review/summary: not outdated but not quite right
review/text: I cannot get these Jocalat bars in my local store and I have ordered them from Amazon several times previously. In my last two orders the product, while not outdated, tasted stale.  It tasted as if the box had not been stored properly and perhaps had been inadvertently frozen.

review/summary: AMAZING!!!
review/text: These uber-healthy bars do the trick whenever I have a chocolate craving. I try my best to eat "whole food" and this becomes difficult when I am craving something sweet. I used to buy "Clif Bar Nectar" bars, which was essentially the same product. However, since those bars are no longer sold I am so happy that I've found these. Also, the savings are amazing...they cost almost $2 at my "Whole Foods" market. The Hazelnut flavor is my favorite so far but these are almost as amazing. If you care about the quality of the food you eat and love sweets buy them, you won't regret it!

review/text: I think no tastes go better together than chocolate and mint. If you agree, you'll love these wonderfully flavorful bars.<br />The fact that two bars have all the protein you need for a meal (and much of the fruit) makes them a treat for air travel, hiking, and other quick meals on the go.<br />They stay fresh and delicious for months without refrigeration.

review/summary: Cherry Pie ok, Choco Cherry not so much.
review/text: I have food allergies, and while I am looking for a Chocolate fix, I think this will take a bit to get used to. The Cherry Pie is quite good, and tastes like the center of a fig newton. The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor. Next time I will try the plain chocolate as I hear they get good reviews.<br />Over all, The Cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10, but the Choco-cherry gets a resounding 2.

review/text: I used to buy these bars regularly at Trader Joe's, but several months ago they stopped selling my favorite flavor, so I've resorted to ordering them online. I don't like to leave home without one in my backpack. Very healthy, raw ingredients, filling, flavorful...I really love this product.

review/summary: Delicious for a snack or treat
review/text: I should start off by saying I was not instantly a convert to Larabars. I tried a few of the flavors in the regular line (Larabars) and did not prefer them over other snack/meal bars. The Jocalat bars, however, changed my mind. I love how they are the perfect balance of fruits, nuts, and cocoa. You can taste all of the flavors and they all work really well together. The chocolate mint is my favorite because the mint has a really clean natural favor and compliments the chocolate well. It easily takes away my cravings for a chocolate bar. I also really enjoy the chocolate orange and chocolate cherry flavors that are in this line. Now if they just come out with a chocolate banana version I will be in heaven.<br /><br />Despite all my raving it's still important to keep in mind that these DO NOT taste like a candy bar or a baked brownie. They definitely have more of a raw taste to them and you can still taste the dates so if you do not like the flavor of dates you may not like these. I also recommend that you try the flavors before committing to a whole case. I've found the Larabar flavors to be hit or miss with my personal tastes. There are some that I love and enthusiastically buy again and others that don't seem worth the calories.<br /><br />Overall these are great and I like them so much better than Larabar flavors and have recommended them to many friends.

review/summary: Satisfying Treat!
review/text: The LaraBar Jocalat is becoming one of my favorite treats.  The rich chocolate flavor and the other nutrient-dense ingredients satisfies the sweet-tooth as well as hunger.  I am a teacher, and I keep these tasty bars in my desk for when I am hungry.  These bars are far healthier than donuts or candy, which are often found in my school office or teacher's lounge.  Furthermore, everyone who I've shared my secret stash with has enjoyed them as much as I do!  One day I took one to the principal, who is a health-conscious individual, and he now loves them, too!  So, this past Christmas I gave him a gift bag filled with LaraBar Jocolat's.  It never hurts to win your boss over!

review/summary: Great & Gluten Free!
review/text: I really like another chocolate flavored bar that's also gluten free, and have been a repeat customer of the other bar.  But I was very surprised at how much more I like the LaraBar Jocalat, Chocolate bar.  These area great!  I rated the other product 5 stars, because I simply couldn't find anything wrong with them and thought they were that good - these are even better.  And they're gluten free!<br /><br />One slight caution: I knew I wouldn't be able to eat a regular meal one day, so I took three of these along and made the mistake of enjoying all three at once in place of the meal.  I hadn't thought about what the "consequences" might be.  Two of these bars at a time are plenty for an active lower digestive system!  If you intend to spend an hour or more in a meeting a few hours after eating three of these, you may find it more than a little uncomfortable.  Have some Imodium handy in that instance.  ;~}<br /><br />GRITS

Overwhelming orange oil/ zest flavor (it tasted just the way the orange essence smells) and zero chocolate flavor. If you haven't had these yet,  buy an individual bar before buying the box. I now have 15.9 of these bars and will *not* eat them.

It was very delicious to me then but six months later I guess my taste buds had changed.  The flavors I do really like are cherry, apple, lemon, and chocolate coconut.

review/summary: If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you
review/text: I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.

It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust.  I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product.  However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us.

I tried this product - the price was a bit lower, but the shipping was MUCH lower.  The dried porcini are as good, if not better than from the expensive place.  They arrived promptly and were packaged well.  I immediately put about a third of them into an airtight glass jar on my counter. Packaged the rest up in a doubled freezer bag and put them in the freezer.  They keep well for over a year.  The pieces are large, sliced well, clean and bright.  The aroma is beautiful.  Tossed some into a pot of braised lamb shanks the day they arrived - fabulous...

review/text: When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled "from Italy". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand.

review/summary: Expensive Mushrooms?  Ehhh....
review/text: I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.<br /><br />I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.<br /><br />In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.

review/summary: Excellent Tasting Sugar Substitute
review/text: This date sugar is very tasty.  I have used it before in making date nut bars, date filled oat meal cookies, bread, and many other recipes as well.  It makes a good tasting alternative to regular or brown sugar in recipes that call for dates, or are date flavored.  Just remember that date sugar is a little sweeter than regular or brown sugar and should be used more sparingly.  Also, date sugar does not melt down and liquify like other sugar either.  When used in recipes it may appear as small brown flakes that give a more concentrated sweetness to cookies, bread, etc.  Date sugar is not cheap, but worth it for the few times you will use it for the special sweetness and flavor it adds. Also, it is near impossible to find in anything but gourmet shops so Amazon is a good bet if you are feeling favorable to it.  The only thing I would suggest is that you either order two or more pouches of this or something else that qualifies you for the free shipping. (If it's still be offered, it was at the time of this writing.) Then it becomes a solid deal and well worth the money.  Recommended...

review/summary: Great For Smoothies!
review/text: I bought this by looking at all the other reviews thinking this stuff will be the equivalent to sugar, but more healthy like Agave Nectar "Not". I made a glass of tea & I tried a tablespoon & I could not tell even that I put it in, then I put in 2nd tablespoon & again nothing, then 3rd & same then fourth & it was the same, the only difference was now my tea was ruined because it was nothing but undissolved date sugar floating in my tea cup & the water was very hot so this stuff should have dissolved, but no not at all. I think this stuff would be good for things like instead of using white powdered sugar, use date sugar because it is not that sweet. It's all good because I also use other healthy sugar alternatives like ( raw organic Agave Nectar, raw organic honey & organic sugar cane sugar. Packaging was not bad, but for the price I did not expect anything special. It is another healthy option, but not for me because I want something that dissolves & something you can actually use in place of sugar & this was not doing it for me. 4 tablespoons & no change just swimming date grounded powder floating in cup. If your a light sugar type person then this may be what your looking for, but if you are a normal sugar type person that likes to actually taste there tea, then this may not be for you.<br /><br />Update July 24,2012:<br />I updated my 2 stars to 4 stars because I found a wonderful use for this date sugar & it is in smoothies it works perfectly & now I am going to purchase more for that reason & I will try to make other things like cookies, brownies & other sweet goodies. Now that I have found a use for it, it works into my healthier diet really well. I think it was because I actually grounded it into what ever I was blending which made the dried date sugar blend very well. Now I am thinking of taking my tea & putting date sugar in & then blending it in my magic bullet or main blender & seeing if that helps with the tea situation & I know that sounds silly & weird, but it worked for the smoothies & it just may work for everything else. Plus there is nothing better to sweeten something like dates or organic natural fruits, rather then using regular sugar. So worth a try in my book & if it does not work I will still continue to use it for other stuff & also use the date sugar for sure for my smoothies & hopefully future other things. Will see!

review/summary: A Better Choice
review/text: I believe Taster's Choice is one of the better off-the-shelf instant coffees. In the past, I tried many but I like the taste of this brand - comparatively speaking. In the stores, this brand often costs more than the others so this price for this quantity is a good deal. I purchased this product for a co-worker who has recently started drinking coffee. After seeing him drinking some really bad tasting and weak brands, I recommended Taster's Choice. He said he didn't know any difference in coffees. But after drinking Taster's Choice, he indeed declared that it was much better than the others. It's favorful and not too strong. Personally, I am a Starbucks, Seattle's Best and a new product line I've discovered, Joe (from Paramount Coffee Co.) coffee drinker. But, in a moment of desperation and lacking any possibility to acquire any of the above listed brands, I'd borrow some of the Taster's Choice I gifted to my co-worker.

It is less salty and has a better soy flavor.  I had three bottles of this in my refridgerator when I moved to Florida.  I gave them all to my daughter, not knowing that I would NOT be able to find it own in Florida anywhere.  I am so happy to see it on Amazon.com and instead of buying an entire case of bottles I was able to buy just one or two bottles at a time.  I am going to be SO HAPPY to have shoyu in my house again.

review/summary: Best GF pasta!
review/text: This is definitely the best GF pasta out there and we've tried them all (rice, corn, corn/rice, quinoa, etc.)  When the Bi Aglut pasta is  done cooking, you don't get a pot of thick, gooey water like with rice pasta.  It cooks up like normal pasta and also, it isn't as sweet as rice pasta. It's even good for leftovers the next day - most rice pasta falls apart into little tiny pieces when you try to reheat it and stir it.<br /><br />My wife and I find the we can get 2 meals out of each 17 oz package of spaghetti.  Most GF pasta comes in smaller packages, cost almost as much and you only get 1 meal.  So, in the long run, the Bi Aglut Pasta is actually less expensive for us.<br /><br />We've also eaten the elbow macaroni, penne and the fusili - all are great. We were able to get it from a local store in upstate NY, but had to move to CT for a new job and nobody carries it locally.  I guess we need to order it off the web now.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />We have tried almost all of the Dreamfields pastas, but have really enjoyed being able to have lasagna again!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Damaged goods
review/text: While I love Dreamfield products, I would STRONGLY SUGGEST not ordering the Lasagna noodles for delivery.  Out of a 12 Box case, every box had at least 40% of the noodles damaged in shipping. When I opened the case, there were busted pieces of noodle that had already come out of the packaging of each individual box.  I only did this because none of my local supermarkets carry the Lasagna noodles. I will not make this mistake again, and I hope you don't either!

review/text: Living a low carb lifestyle is tough for a pasta lover.  However this is wonderful.  Even my husband who is very picky when it comes to low carb substitutes can't tell the difference.  We even break these up and use them in our beef stew (for the larger noodles).  I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the taste of this product!

review/text: I ordered this and it tasted fine, like normal pasta. It did give my family gas, but it did not raise my blood sugar. I ordered 2 boxes to try it and both boxes were shattered. I had 1 unbroken piece in 2 boxes which was disappointing. I paid over $[...] in shipping for 2 boxes and they took over a week to arrive and then came in bits. For that price I expect whole product.If my local grocery carried this, I would buy it regularly, but with the price of the product and the shipping so expensive, I most likely won't order this again.

review/text: My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards. Later that night, neither of us slept well because we were so hungry. I don't know if this is related, but we both had heart palpitations that night.<br /><br />We both woke up feeling starved. I usually don't even feel hungry in the morning! My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us. We're throwing out all the boxes that I bought based on the 5 star ratings here. If you want to try it, start with a single box and see how it makes you feel.

review/summary: fine sugarless gum with a peppermint burst
review/text: Trident White makes a terrific peppermint flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has nothing more than a measly five calories; and there's no fat, no sodium and no sugar. Trident White uses sorbitol and aspartame to sweeten the gum. Moreover, the gum stays fresh until the expiration date stamped on the reverse of the package. Good job!<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of caveats: The gum contains a milk derived ingredient and it contains phenylalanine. If either of these ingredients pose a concern for you please consult your doctor before chewing this gum.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best glutenfree "vermicelli" I've come across yet...
review/text: I confess, I bought the last subscription to this item.  And I sure hope it will be back in stock when my 6 boxes are gone.  It is the only rice spaghetti I've found that is actually "vermicelli" and I love vermicelli, not the fat stuff!  It holds up like real wheat vermicelli, doesn't stick together like corn/quinoa thin linguine, and tastes and feels like THE REAL THING.  Also, you can smell the spinach powder in this product when you open the box.  I cooked it up tonight and my only recommendation is:  Use the longer cooking time and maybe even add a minute.  Be sure to check by trying to cut the pasta before you remove it from the cooking water.  As with most rice pastas, it doesn't plump up as much as wheat pasta.  An 8 oz. box provides enough pasta for only 2 small plates of vermicelli.  But still, it was worth it!

It certainly won't clash with any sauces, but it can add a nice oomph to their flavor.<br />The Amazon price is a great deal too. I hate buying this stuff in stores, my local grocer wants $5 a package for all GF pastas. Yeah right!

review/text: Scharffen Berger Chocolate is one of the best premium chocolate bars out there. When they were based in Berkeley, I had taken a tour of the factory and was able to taste many of their bars. Of all the different Scharffen Berger bars there are, the Sea Salted Almond bar is definitely my favorite. This particular flavor  is so hard to find in stores that I'm excited that Amazon carries this flavor.<br /><br />The Sea Salted Almond bar is labeled as milk chocolate. However, it contains 41% Cocoa which makes it a "darker" chocolate than most milk chocolate bars out there. The higher cocoa content gives the chocolate the quality of a semi-sweet chocolate. Despite the higher cocoa content, the bar still has the smooth mouth feel of milk chocolate. The smooth texture of the chocolate contrasts nicely with the slight saltiness from the sea salt and crunchiness from the tiny almond pieces. This chocolate is everything you expect from a high quality chocolate bar: not too sweet, complex chocolate flavor, and a nice balance of flavor and texture from the added ingredients.

review/text: I believe in full disclosure so I will admit up front that I am a chocoholic. I am partial to milk chocolate such as is contained in these bars. I am not knowingly familiar with sea salted chocolate and I can't say that I can identify sea salt in this product. What I can identify is an excellent flavor. The almonds are chopped into tiny pieces which makes them easy to consume but still distinctive enough to provide the unique almond flavor. The milk chocolate has a superb taste and a perfect level of sweetness. One need not be a connoisseur of chocolate to appreciate the quality of this product.

review/text: I absolutely love these chocolate bars! They come nicely wrapped in thin (3oz) bars you'll have trouble setting down. There are thin grooves in the bar to pattern it and make it easy to break off in triangles, though I prefer cracking the bar before opening it and eating it in tiny pieces.<br /><br />The chocolate is sweet, as milk chocolate should be, but not overly sweet, probably thanks to the salt. The almonds are in tiny fractions, so you can chew the almond crunch or let it melt in your mouth.<br /><br />The package says it's 41% cacao milk chocolate. Ingredients include cocoa butter, nonfat milk, safflower oil, non-gmo soy lecithin, etc. and is gluten-free. One serving (half-bar) is 220 calories and contains 19g of carbs (so I should probably go easy, huh...).<br /><br />I received my package at the end of October and each bar says Best By '07/2012'. Well, let's see if I can make them last that long!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I was surprised by my first taste of this chocolate. I checked the label to make sure that I had not misunderstood, but I'd made no error. It was milk chocolate. I guess I was expecting a high-class Hershey Bar, but that isn't at all what this product is about. The description for this chocolate says that the Scharffen Berger founders, "tested multiple combinations before perfecting a unique blend that highlighted the true flavor of cacao instead of masking it with sugar and other flavors." I think they succeeded.<br /><br />The chocolate is smooth and rich, but not overly sweet. If you have a real "sweet tooth," and like your chocolate with plenty of sugar, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />The almonds are ground up into very small pieces and distributed evenly through the bar. There is just a suggestion of salt, and I think this also counteracts some of the chocolate's sweetness that you might otherwise taste.<br /><br />I am currently dieting by counting calories. As a testimonial, I will tell you that any time I can get to the end of the day with 100 or so calories to spend, it means a bedtime snack of just a little of this delectable treat.

review/text: Salty almond chocolate bars are my very favorite combo, so I was very excited to try this Scharffen Berger bar. My past experience with Scharffen Berger was always excellent, and I expected the same here.<br /><br />While it was a tasty enough bar, it was nothing exceptional or that I'd recommend or buy again.<br /><br />The chocolate was fine, less creamy than I'd expect for milk chocolate, and a bit grainy, but with a full cocoa flavor. The almonds were just shreds and crumbs instead of the nice coarse chunks you typically find in a good salted almond bar.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't be embarrassed to share one, but no raves. It's about at or slightly below the quality of any of the 3oz bars you find at decent grocery stores, certainly not gourmet caliber, and not my first choice by a long stretch for a salty chocolate fix.

review/text: I like Scharffen Berger's darker chocolates, so I thought I would give this milk chocolate with almonds a try.  While I cannot say that I don't like it (hence the four stars), I have to say that I don't think its quality matches the price.  Amazon's recent Lightning Deal price was reasonable (just shy of $3 per bar), but I've had other milk chocolate bars that are far better than these at full price.  If you like milk chocolate better than dark chocolate, however, you might like these very much:  the chocolate is very milky/smooth, not waxy in the least.  And the almond pieces are fairly small and well distributed throughout the chocolate, not just big chunks of almonds surrounded by chocolate like Hershey's.

review/summary: I loved this chocolate.
review/text: This chocolate is quite a treat.  I love milk chocolate, and prefer it over dark er chocolate, but what I really like about this chocolate bar is that it is not too sweet, like some chocolate bars are, for instance, like a Hershey bar.  Not that there isn't a place for that kind of chocolate, but this is for more mature tastes.  The mouth feel is very smooth and creamy, the flavor is rich, and the almonds are chopped, which I really like.  Maybe my palate is not very discerning, but I had a difficult time getting the "salty" flavor, but I might just be missing it.  Overall, this was a very wonderful chocolate bar!  Everyone in my family loved it.  Not your average chocolate bar, and worth the extra cost, a gourmet chocolate.

review/summary: Really good chocolate, almonds and sea salt - Magical!
review/text: These Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate bars with Sea Salted Almonds are excellent. The 4 ounce bars are made with 41% cacao milk chocolate. Sea salt and chocolate is currently a hugely popular flavor mix and that combined with chopped almonds is blissfully delicious. The salt is very subtle here and could stand to be a bit more assertive, but who's complaining. The chocolate is pretty soft with a very smooth mouth-feel. Be careful to keep the bars away from warmth - they soften quite easily. Milk chocolate doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pretty darn spectacular!!!
review/text: Okay folks, this is some great kind of chocolate. The chocolate itself is labeled milk, but at 41% cacao, has a nice dark taste. Add this with the salted almonds and wow, this combo is great!!! Enjoy!
