review/summary: Great quality popcorn
review/text: Tiny But Mighty Popcorn or "TBM" is the best popcorn I have ever had. Being adventurous I've tried all sorts of Popcorn, kettle-corn, cheddar, butter, sugar, even marshmallow popcorn.  So with my "experience" in the popcorn world I can truthfully say I will always come back to TBM Popcorn.  It's the most healthy popcorn out there on the market and it even taste better then every single microwave variety out there.  I have been eating TBM Popcorn for years, recently they have totally redesigned the bag the tiny popcorn comes in.. WOW!!! It looks classy, elegant, sophisticated AND it even gives you guide lines on how to prepare the product to its best results when popping -Not to mention a little history on the ancient heirloom popcorn.. Well done TBM Popcorn Well done! As an avid popcorn lover I cannot wait to see what your next big move is! Keep up the good work Farmer Gene!

review/summary: Love Tiny But Mighty
review/text: I recently moved out west, and was devastated to find Tiny But Mighty unavailable in stores. Three whole days on 'the big stuff' organic yellow popcorn, and my tiny body felt bloated  and backed up, my teeth and head ached from all the hard fluff on the larger corn. Thank goodness 10 pounds of Tiny But Mighty Heirloom Popcorn came in the today. It is my favorite food, perfect for a late night snack without hurting your body.<br /><br /> My posture and attitude are ranked among fantastic, now that I am reunited with this amazing product. Thank you Tiny But Mighty Heirloom Popcorn, I'll never eat big popcorn again!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

review/summary: How to become a Spanish expert chef in 40 minutes
review/text: This Goya product is the best way to cook Paella with seafood and impress everybody. I cook paella every month and this Goya product makes me look like a pro. I have even surpassed my mother's and sister's paella. I am a hit!<br /><br />I add some extra ingredients, like that $3 bag of frozen seafood, one dozen fresh clams, one dozen mussels, and 12 prawns. Besides that I put Oscar Mayer sausages cut in little slices and two chicken breasts cut in thick slices.<br />When the Paella is done, you can feed 6 people and there are leftovers.<br /><br />The secret is in the high quality rice, that does not stick (very important), and, in the can of seafood and squid that comes in the Goya Package. The spices in the rice add enough flavor to make you think you are eating actual saffron (which is ultra expensive).<br /><br />I recommend this product for those of you that miss the Paellas from Valencia and want instant satisfaction. In 40 to 60 minutes, you can have superb paella. I forgot, you need to add sliced roasted bell peppers for presentation.<br /><br />It's the best. It will make you look like a high cuisine chef!

review/summary: Love these honey roasted Virginia peanuts
review/text: If you like peanuts and know how good Virginia peanuts can be, then this review is for you. I've tried several varieties from Feridies, but have been stuck on their Honey Roasted for some time now. Not too sugary, these honey roasted peanuts have just enough of a sugar coat to make them crunchy, and then the honey roasted peanut flavor slowly takes over. Simply one of the best I've tasted. Feridies produces loads of flavors for every palette and every single product is first rate. And buying them on Amazon you get a bit of a discount and free shipping. My last order was just for me, but I could easily give this as a Christmas gift.

review/summary: Great Blend of Medicinal Teas
review/text: I really like this tea.  I've been trying st. johns wort off and on for a while now and found it to help with, in the words of Charlie Sheen, what a "troll" I can be.  Add to that a little anxiety and you can figure out the rest.  Prescribed pharmaceuticals, even at their lower doses always seemed to build up in my system and feel to heavy handed.  This, when regularly consumed, gives me the slight adjustment I need.  This blend has really helped get through a stressful bout of night work.<br /><br />I was curious about the other herbs in the tea, I looked them up and learned quite a bit.  It seems wherever you look in the world there is are plants that serve this purpose.  This tea brings many of them together.

review/summary: Great as an iced tea...
review/text: I have tried three kinds of St. John's Wort tea: Yogi, Traditional Medicines, and this brand.  For hot tea, Traditional Medicines was my favorite, due to its pleasant minty flavor.  Yogi made a nice hot tea, too, with a more cinnamon and licorice flavor to it.  As a hot tea, The Republic of Tea Happy Tea wasn't my favorite.  I guess I'm just not a fan of strong fruit flavors in my hot tea.  However, as an iced tea, I thought it was quite delicious, and I'm incredibly glad I tried it that way.  St John's Wort doesn't have its full effect unless you're having quite a few glasses each day, and when it's hot out or you're very busy, it can be quite a pain to brew a new cup every few hours.  But as an iced tea, I can make a lot at once and store it in a pitcher in the fridge.  On a hot day, the lovely peach flavor is quite refreshing.  Even my boyfriend has started drinking it.  I definitely plan on buying it again, especially with summer approaching.

review/summary: Good Enough For Molly
review/text: Milk Bone dog biscuits are second only to things-she-should-never-eat in Mollie's pantheon of treats.  For some reason we humans can never comprehend, my very  doggy 57 pound, two year old, lab mix, prefers day-old  recently used dog food  as her snack of choice.  Our neighborhood is a cafeteria despite the law.<br /><br /> As soon as she is let off leash in Central Park she makes a beeline for the nearest pile as regular as the clockwork.  "Leave it" screamed in a rising voice only works after her tasting has started.  At home, I have offered her a selection of Zuke's treats, smelly cheese, freeze dried liver, and sometimes, a lick of the knife I just used to spread peanut butter.  If I hold the treat in one hand and a milk bone in the other, most of the time she ignores the treat and gently takes the Milk Bone.  It doesn't matter if I have broken the Milk Bone and the size is small.  She has no discrimination based on size, just smell.<br /><br />In my Upper West Side neighborhood, here in NYC, the sidewalks are crowded with dogs.  Most, like mine, seem to be rescues, but many are show quality, and we owners congregate in the local dog run and talk about, what else, dogs.<br /><br />Tooth cleaning around here with general anesthesia can push four figures and is a popular procedure with dogs that eat home cooked food, "raw diet" diets, gourmet refrigerated pet food etc.  My Molly has been raised on Blue Buffalo dry food in various flavors, and we always have a ten pound box of Milk Bones hands.  When she cleans up her plate, or does a reasonably good job, she is rewarded with a Milk Bone.  They are a wonderful training aid and can be broken in small pieces so you don't overfeed.  The point is that my Molly has shiny white teeth and a sweet breath and has never been fed table scraps or gourmet foods.<br /><br />When using Amazon Prime, the Milk Bone comes in at half the price of buying locally.  Can't beat that.

When we stopped giving it to her, we found her movement inhibited and appearantly more painful. Returning to the senior biscuits returned her to herself. In addition, she loves the taste. We limit her consumption to 3 cookies a day and she is very aware of when they are due. She will stand in the kitchen doorway and point to the cookie jar with a sweeping motion of her snout.<br /><br />It helps the joints of this old retriever and satisfies her tummy's desire for treats.

Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do.  While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple.  I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me.  I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead.

Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and "chewy" nuts ruined it for me.

review/summary: Strange texture and taste
review/text: I bought these several days ago from our local supermarket and was very disappointed.  The nuts were chewy and slightly soft..is this normal and yes they were months from expiration.  Yuck at the softness, however.  Then there was a strange texture of hard, little bumps on this softened nut..another yuck.  The taste of the flavors blended wasn't my thing either..all wrong in my opinion.  I gave it a two because it was edible but will never repurchase.

review/text: I was planning to buy Mr's May's Almonds and Cashews but they were out of stock at amazon so I decided to buy Sahale's Sing Buri and Soledad. Did not like the taste of either of them. Highly Disappointed. Will wait for Mr's May's to be back in stock.

review/text: This snack blend is the best! I tried it on the recommendation of a friend, and have come to love it. It's perfect alone, but I enjoy putting the mix on salads. It definitely spices them up a bit, and the flavor is amazing. I have become a big fan of this product, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks.

review/summary: Indulge Your Tastebuds
review/text: About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale "town mouse" to my regular, boring "country mouse" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.

review/text: I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.<br /><br />Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!<br /><br />Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!<br /><br />Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!<br /><br />Scrumptious!

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving.

review/text: Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy.  I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially  bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12  2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!!

review/text: Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks.

review/text: I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.

review/summary: Great snacks
review/text: I picked up a bag of these on a whim the other day and I was instantly hooked.  I like almonds, but plain almonds do get boring, salted almonds are usually too salty, and honey covered almonds are usually too sweet and too salty.  And it's hard to find almonds that aren't roasted in some kind of cheap oil.<br /><br />Enter these Sahale snacks. A little salt, a little honey, and dry roasted almonds.  Oh and cranberries.  In my bag I didn't get many cranberries, I don't know if that was a fluke but I didn't care because I was mostly after the almonds.  If you are looking for a  big handful of almonds and cranberries this might disappoint.  For me it's been a great snack to keep around the office (it helps me avoid the 3PM coke-and-potato chip craving).<br /><br />The price seems a little high at first, but a single bag last several days, which put's in line with the cost of bag of chips.  Overall a great snack that's actually pretty good for you.

review/summary: Larger sized bags of the Valdosta Blend are available at Costco seasonally
review/text: The ingredient list made for interresting reading. So much so that I almost left my first bag of these treats on the shelf. The kicker for me was that they did not contain any ingredients I am allergic to, so into my basket they went.<br /><br />Once I tried them I became addicted.  These are great right out of the bag.  I also love them in a tossed green salad with crumbled bleu cheese and thinly sliced fresh pears.<br /><br />I checked Costco yesterday for the Valdosta Blend, but they were out.  They are currently offering another Sahale blend with almonds.  I didn't buy it--I'll wait for the Valdosta to come in.  I am not sure if Costco changes the Sahale snack selection seasonally or if they were just out-of-stock.<br /><br />When we were vacationing in Texas, I bought another Sahale blend to sample.  I wish I could remember the name of it. It wasn't as good and I would not go out of my way to buy it again. I will continue to buy the Valdosta Blend regularly though.

review/text: I have been buying these from Costco for years, but was told a few weeks ago that they were gone and not coming back in the foreseeable future.  I hate it when Costco does that!  Thank goodness for Amazon -- at least I can order from them!  I don't think the ones I received are as fresh as the ones I used to get from Costco.  The cranberries are pretty tough to chew.  But they're still a tasty snack and indispensable on a salad of spring greens, blue cheese, apples or grapes, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

I am glad I decided to make the purchase because the combination of cashew, pomegranate and vanilla come together nicely to make a tasty but not cloyingly sweet treat. With the exception of fruit, these nuts satisfy my craving for sugar without making me feel guilty, like a chocolate bar, cookies, or ice cream would.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Cheesy, low-carb goodness
review/text: I love salty snack foods, especially cheesy ones, and one of the things that I miss most on a low-carb regime are Doritos. The Sahale Southwest Cashews have all the spicy-cheesy-salty goodness of a Dorito, but are low carb -- 10g carb per quarter-cup. They're addictive. They're quite expensive (one cup of nuts per package), but if you're not worried about what you're paying for your snack food, these are great.

review/summary: Pretty Tasty, but Not as Good as Valdosta
review/text: The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.<br /><br />I guess, as I've said before in my reviews of Sahale nut snacks, I think every one of them pales in comparison to the perfection of the Valdosta variety. In fact, I'm so crazy about the Sahale Valdosta mix that I posted a Haiku in praise. I know, pathetic. So, take my opinions of the other flavors with a grain of sea salt.

review/summary: The Best of the Sahale Snack Nut Blends
review/text: I really don't know how to describe Sahale's Valdosta Pecans better than L. Thorson did in reviewing the 2 ounce packages (and whre I also quoted him/her): "This is an especially felicitous blend of crunchy pecans and chewy cranberries, spiced up with a little black pepper and orange zest. Good to eat out of hand, and also good to toss into a salad for some extra flavor and texture."<br /><br />After trying this snack I'd purchased away from my usual shpping spots, I couldn't remember the name of it and bought various nut snacks of other brands that I thought may have been the same, but was repeatedly sadly disappointed. Just yesterday I found the real thing again and decided to see if I could get it from Amazon. I was successful at first, but then after receiving them and wanting to get more, found Amazon was out.

The balance of flavors is just right; the combined impression is pretty bold, but no single ingredient is overpowering. It's definitely a salty snack, but the other flavors come through beautifully. Every bite has its own character -- you might get a nice little burst of chili (mild; more pungent than hot) and sweet, chewy pineapple in one bite, and then a cluster of crunchy, tangy cashews and peanuts with a hint of lemongrass in the next. Oh, and be sure to give the bag a good shake before you dig in, to distribute all the good stuff that settles at the bottom.  Enjoy!

review/text: I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work.  After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon.  My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad.  If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.<br /><br />I give these a 4 because sometimes the almonds are a little over roasted for my tastes but all the girls at work seem to like this one the most so they must know something I don't.

These are the Sahale Snacks that sell out first in the store.  Friends likewise agree that these are the best.  For some reason, in my recent shipment, these "Valdosta" pecans and the "Soledad" almonds were as good as the ones from the store, but the "Soccorro" Macadamia / hazelnut and the "Dauphine" Walnut / blueberry snacks were stale-tasting, even rancid, especially the walnuts, this despite being two to five months pre-expiration date.

review/text: Amazing in terms of taste. Don't get these if you want a snack that isn't tempting.<br />By the way, they sell a one serving version of these at Starbucks but it isn't labeled Sahale Snacks (its written in fine print on the back). You get a lot more value buying them through Amazon/Sahale directly.

review/summary: Mostly just really sweet cashews
review/text: The combination sounded wonderful and the picture was enticing but that isn't exactly what I received.  The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)

I bought a bag on a whim one day and went back the next day and bought 6 bags (to stock up). I've found them at Walmart for only 3.88 for a 4.0 oz bag, which is the cheapest price I've found. If you like cashews definitely give these a try!

review/summary: gives me heartburn
review/text: I love nuts and almonds among my favorites. When I saw the description of Sahale almonds I was so excited to try it. All the ingredients looked just delicious so I've got a subscription on it. Unfortunately now, when I got my first batch of them and tried, I have to cancel it. Every time I eat them I have a heartburn. Not sure what exactly causes it because I'm fine with pure almonds, sea salt (at least with the one I have at home), honey, cranberries, no known food allergies. It might be salt/nuts/cranberries combination that causes it, not sure.

review/text: These are perfect - crunchy, only slightly sweet, a bit salty, and with some variation in the mix, but not so much as a trail mix with too much fruit or sugar. These are the same sold at Starbucks, which is where I first found them. YUM!! And made w/ wind power and nutritionally sound (check their website - how they make the products).

So I googled the product and lo and behold! They were on Amazon!<br /><br />I had not had Sahale's product but they were GREAT!  Vanilla-y, sweet, a little fruit-y due to the pomegranate and just a tiny bit of salt adds that that great sweet-salt combination!  I'm anticipating eating these for a long time, they're tasty!

review/text: These little nuts are so delicious, I can't even describe it.  When I think of glazed nuts, I think of overly sweet totally crystallized with sugar.  It almost held be back from buying these, but they are nothing like that. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to sample them before buying, otherwise I never would have.  They are the perfect amount of sweetness with real fruit pieces that taste like fruit and vanilla!  I would highly recommend these to everyone. Very filling too, unlike most snacks.  You only need to eat a few pieces and you don't feel icky after eating them.
