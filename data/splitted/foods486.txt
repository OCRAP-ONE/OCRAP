review/summary: Great for aggressive chewers
review/text: I have a one year old lab/pit bull mix who will chew up a 10" rawhide in a day.  We've purchased two of these 24" rawhide's and they each lasted about a month.

review/summary: Just what I (and my dogs) needed
review/text: My two border collies can eat through 10-inch "rawhide rolls" in one evening (that's one bone per dog). That gets expensive! These 24-inch bones with knotted ends are a better deal. I give one to each of my two dogs and the bones last 3 weeks. I ordered these at the end of September. Noticed the Amazon price went up by $1.72 per bone in October. Not happy with the price jump, but it's still a better deal than the 10-inch bones.

review/summary: Doesn't last very long with a very aggressive chewer
review/text: I bought this 24" rawhide because several reviewers said their dogs worked on it for a very long time.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my 100 lb. Labrodane.  He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour.  While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.

review/summary: Awesome bone!
review/text: Got this for our retriever / doberman mix...she loved it!  At first it was so large that I think she was a bit intimidated by it, but after a few days of coming up with an attack strategy she went right to town.<br /><br />...and finished it in 3 days.<br /><br />Typically a large rawhide lasts about 4-5 hours for her, so it was definitely a value.  Also, it was hilarious to watch her run around the house holding onto it.<br /><br />Bought it for one of our friends pitbulls too, it's a great dog gift!

review/summary: Puppy Loves It But Eats It Too Fast
review/text: My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.

review/text: Kept my 9 month old Golden Retriever intimidated for 3 days trying to figure out how to handle this massive chew.  After one week, he has chewed (maybe) 10% of the rawhide bone.  I've purchased the typical rawhide chews only to see my money devoured in a day. This large, heavy rawhide chew keeps my Golden entertained for hours every day and is still going.  Would highly recommend for your large breed dog who likes to chew, and chew, and chew.

review/text: I ordered these as I have ordered from Amazon 24 inch dog bones. These arrived and appeared to be the same however, definately were not. These came apart in little pieces and broke like potato chips. One of the primary reasons to order these bones is so they dont come apart in little pieces. They were paper thin amd broke apart in to smaller pieces way to easily.. These were definately a cheap poor imitation of the ones I recived before.. I will throw away the remaining 3 to avoid further probelms with my dog chocking on the small pieces..... Stay away from this seller.......

I am very happy with every aspect of the product - the unique flavor, elegant packaging, convenient single-serve stick pouches, and the value for the money. The product packs nicely for camping and backpacking as well. Glad I found this hidden gem!

review/summary: Savory Choice Broth Concentrates the Best!
review/text: Savory Choice Liquid Vegetable Broth Concentrate, 5.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)<br /><br />I bought this concentrate in the vegetable, chicken and turkey flavors because I couldn't find vegetable broth locally and my husband needed it for a brine. He is the cook/chef of the family and was skeptical until he tasted them. They are the richest, most flavorful broths we have ever used; when reconstituted as directed, they keep a full deep color and since they are concentrates, can be diluted as little or as much as needed. The little packages are so convenient as well, taking much less space than the typical cans. We're never going back to the "regular" broths.

review/text: I discovered the Savory Choice vegetable broth a number of years ago at my local Whole Foods store.  I follow a vegan diet, use veggie stock often, make soups frequently, and had tried other veggie broths with no success.  Savory Choice is by far my favorite!  Then, by chance, I discovered the same product at Trader Joe's and I was really happy.  Last year Trader Joe's discontinued this product, and Whole Foods no longer carries it.  On a whim I checked Amazon.  Success!  I recently purchased 16 boxes (4 packets of 4 boxes).  Let butternut squash soup season begin!

review/text: I am a true believer of making your own broth/stock at home. Whenever I cook chicken or beef I always save the broth/stock and freeze it for later use. But when I am out of it I need some trusty brand with no MSG and low sodium. That's my reason to buy the Savory Choice Vegetable, Chicken and Beef broths. These are very convenient since they come in individual packages and the product is in liquid form, just add a cup of water and you have a broth ready to make any sauce you want.

review/text: This vegetable broth is flavorful and so easy to use! I frequently use this instead of chicken broth, as the flavor is superior to many chicken broths and wins over bouillon hands down. I like to take it camping because of the size.  It's also great for those small amounts of broth that doesn't require an entire can--it doesn't take up a lot of cabinet space, either. Use an entire packet with less water for a more condensed broth.

review/text: So as part of a program for weight loss, I have been trying to find foods to satisfy my sweet tooth that actually have nutritional value and are low calorie. I had seen these in stores but 10 dollars a box seemed crazy, so when I saw the price here I finally took the plunge and tried.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever bought food from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier. I worried about getting unfresh food that tasted like a warehouse and I am happy to report these are fresh, crunchy, and delicious!<br /><br />If you have ever gone to a carnival or amusmernt park or state fair and seen the sugar roasted nuts they sell in little paper cones, that is what these are like, but without all the stickyness and weird crunchy glazed sugar parts. They are light, flavorful and fulfilling. I was also babysitting my friends kids who were begging for cookies and candy, and I instead let them share a bag of these and later that night they asked if they could have another instead of ice cream for dessert so I was kinda shocked.

review/summary: Just darn good tea.
review/text: Frontier makes a lovely earl grey.  It's better than 99% of what's out there and if you buy it in the one pound bag it's a heck of a good deal as well.  This has been my everyday tea for more than five years and I still love it.  Sure, the earl grey from Marriage Freres is a tiny bit better (and for $8 an ounce it should be) and makes an lovely Sunday tea, but the Frontier is almost as good, a fifth the price and a whole lot easier to get my hands on now that I no longer live a quick subway ride from Balducci's.

review/text: I received the chestnut flour promptly.  It is of great quality and has been ground perfectly.  I have already made chestnut crepes with Nutella and bananas.  I look forward to purchasing from this supplier again.  P.S. I vacuumed sealed and froze half of my purchase because chestnut flour can spoil over time.

review/summary: Great, Peppery Bloody Mary Mix
review/text: I am usually somewhat reluctant to try new Bloody Mary mixes because I am so frequently disappointed.  Not this time.  Zing Zang is an outstanding Bloody Mary mix and already contains Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce and Tabasco sauce, which for me are two must haves in any Bloody Mary concoction.<br /><br />This mix has a nice tomato base and leans toward a strong peppery flavor, which becomes even stronger if you add in additional Tabasco, which I often do because I like my Bloody Mary's fiery.<br />If you are a Bloody Mary fan, this mix is a real winner.

No other bottled mix is anywhere near it, either.<br /><br />Want to blow your mind?  Add a teaspoon of ground horseradish, a little more fresh ground black pepper, several pickled green beans and pearl onions and rim the glass with lime juice and celery salt.  Feed the celery stalk to your vegetarian friend; garnish with your favorite pickle spear instead.  That's not a drink, its a meal!

review/text: On a recent visit to New Orleans, we took a cruise down the Mississippi on the Steamboat Natchez.  The Blood Mary we each had was amazing, especially compared to the New England variety we were used to drinking.  When we returned home, we e-mailed the Steamboat Company through their website, and they graciously told us what brand of mix they use, and it is Zing Zang.  Now we have a little bit of New Orleans in a bottle.

review/summary: Good mix, but HOLY SODIUM!!
review/text: I love this mix, I'm actually drinking it now as I write this review!  But don't worry, I'm not too drunk yet...  I can still form sentences.<br /><br />I just realized I'm consuming 75% of my DAILY sodium, just on one 10-ounce drink of this stuff!  Wow, I am going to be bloated tomorrow.  How the heck can 1 serving size be only 3 ounces?  Who drinks a 3-ounce bloody mary, or only one?  That is a really unhealthy amount of salt.  So I would add sodium-free tomato juice to this, and not drink it straight with vodka.<br /><br />The mix fairly spicy-- I would consider it medium, so for some this may just burn your mouth, it does mine, but I like it. And could use more of a tomato taste.  Has MSG in it, which isn't a problem for me(activates flavor receptors in the tongue), but can cause headaches in some people.  It also has sodium benzoate, a preservative.  But in moderation, it tastes great.

review/text: My wife and I have shopped around and tried a lot of different Bloody Mary mixes, both local and big name brands.  While the others range from bad to very good, none of them come even close to the taste of Zing Zang in our opinions.  I love it with either Tequila (Bloody Maria) or the traditional Vodka.  I don't know what's in this stuff (and probably don't want to know) but it's delicious.  We normally add Worchestire and/or Tabasco (or Texas Pete sometimes) and occasionaly Old Bay to the other mixes.  We don't add anything to this one, it doesn't really need the extras.

review/text: Look at the label in the picture.  Sorry folks, but 610 mg sodium per 100 g (that's only about 3.5 oz) can't really be "low sodium".  I don't understand Zing Zang's claim especially since Tabasco Tomato Cocktail Bloody Mary Mix, mild  claims 485 mg /100 g and Mr./Mrs. T claim 640 mg / 120 g.  They are all way HIGH in sodium.  American Heart Association recommended sodium intake per day is about 1500 mg - so 2.5 servings of this stuff is it for the day?  I don't think that any of us can really believe that this stuff is "low sodium" as it says in the description of this product.  Amazon should insist that the description be changed.

I have bought and tasted over 25 honey varieties, and like nearly all of them, being indifferent to just a few. This one has a moderately strong flavor, and a stronger aftertaste, neither of which is at all pleasant. If this were the world's only honey flavor, beekeepers would not be able to make a living. It is the only honey variety so far that I've actually disliked. I wish the vendor well--the service was good--but the product is just not palatable.

review/summary: Dassant has great products. This one is so so.
review/text: I look around for bread mixes to use and ran across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL6X4">Dassant Cinnamon Chip Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. I rate that 5 stars! Awesome taste, can't mess it up and almost no extra ingredients. So I figured I would try there other mixes.<br /><br />The American Pie Applesauce isn't my favorite, but it is much better than other brands.<br /><br />This takes eggs and a whole cup of applesauce.<br />The flavor is really good and it is very moist.<br />Easy enough to mix with a spoon.<br /><br />I would easily recommend all of the Dassant mixes over any other I have tried.<br /><br />But the Cinnamon Chip Bread is the best!

review/summary: Tasty and versatile
review/text: I first purchased Dassant bread/cake mixes several years ago.  I just recently tried the American Pie Applesauce Cake Mix.  As with their other mixes, I was very satisfied.  The Dassant mixes are very quick and easy to prepare.  All of the mixes I have tried taste great and everyone seems to love them.  The American Pie Applesauce Cake Mix is also very versatile.  It can be served for breakfast, as a dessert, or as a snack.

review/summary: Excellent- easy and tasty
review/text: I loved this.  I used butter for the oil, and added raisins and walnuts (one handful each- I'm too lazy to measure).  It was fantastic.  I realize it would not be too hard to actually make the whole thing myself- but I'm busy.  I work and I've got kids, so to be able to pull out a mix and have it taste like home- made is great.  I don't even measure the apple sauce.  I just use two of the organic apple sauce cups I send in my kids' lunches.  That's slightly less than one cup, but I don't care- it's easy and the cake comes out perfectly.

review/summary: The Finest, Strongest Aroma, Best flavor, Longest Lasting Bag Chai Tea!
review/text: Just read the title, seriously. I am a tea junkie and love my Chai. After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods. I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas. If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do. For me, one tea bag makes a quart of good tea!

review/summary: A worthy and welcome replacement
review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/summary: This chai tastes very good but should include more black tea leaves.
review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/summary: Stash tea can vary batch to batch
review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it, raising the prices.  You should try it, it's good.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

review/summary: Stash Brand Earl Grey Tea
review/text: To my taste, the Stash brand of Earl Grey Black Tea (in tea bags) is the best I have found. After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!
