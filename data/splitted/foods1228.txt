review/summary: Holey moley, it's hot!
review/text: This frontier ground cayenne is not for the faint of heart. It is 90 000 heat units, where as most grocery store cayennes are somewhere in the 30 000 to 45 000 range. When you get past the heat, this cayenne has a wonderful rich peppery aroma, a vibrant red-orange color and a smooth underlying sweetness. It is an excellent quality cayenne.

review/text: I know this is people food and I'll use some in cooking but I bought this for repelling some insects in my organic garden.  Cayenne works fine for this and I've never seen it at a better price.  I've mixed it with diatomaceous earth and sprinkled it on the soil.  I've also made a pepper tea with a drop of dish soap to help it stick.  Cooled and strained I've used it as a spray.

review/summary: The Best Cayenne I have ever used!
review/text: After thorough research, I decided to purchase this Cayenne and this is the best product I have ever used to aid in losing weight and slimming my tummy after birth. I have used it for about 8 months now and still have it in stock. I have recommended it to a number of friends who were wondering how I keep fit. I don't do extreme extreme workouts and don't like them and so Cayenne has really helped me along with  minimal home workouts.<br /><br />Okay this is my story. I had a baby a few years ago. My initial weight was 149 lbs and by the time I was going into the delivery room, I was 226 lbs. After a couple of weeks after having my son, I was stuck at 203lbs. I decided enough was enough and started digging. I used weight loss pills, etc but nothing really worked out. I came to Amazon and started doing my search, going through reviews and researching the internet about several products offered and finally came across this particular Cayenne and this is the best thing that ever happened to my weight loss journey.<br /><br />I started with a quarter of a teaspoon because it was just too hot and I am now using half in food. I use it on my lunch and dinner (I sprinkle a half teaspoon on every meal after cooking (in my plate after serving)).<br /><br />I also drink it twice a day in the morning and in the evening. I take a cup of cold water, squeeze half a lemon in it, then add a teaspoon of cayenne powder in it, stir it and quickly gulp it down.<br /><br />I also work out for about 30 minutes a day, 3 or 4 times a week doing cardio on my treadmill. I also try to eat healthy as much as I can. Eating foods with high fiber, fruits, vegetables, lean meat, etc.<br /><br />Long story short, I am now weighing 140lbs and have stuck to this routine. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you want to lose some pounds and don't like taking pills, or working out too much.

review/text: I eat cayenne with practically everything so I go through it pretty quickly.  The 2-pack deal is great... one for me and the other one for the squirrels.  Unfortunately, the squirrels are enjoying the spice as much as I am.  It has not deterred them one bit.  They are feasting on the peppered birdseeds and in my flower garden as I type.  I'll continue eating the cayenne, but will need to find something stronger for the unwanted furry visitors.

I'm using Everclear to extract the essential ingredients over a 30 day period then I dilute to 50%.  The effects are supposed to lower blood pressure (hypertension) due to vasicular dilation and increased blood flow.  I'm also taking lecithin (1 TBS/day) in combination as that provides the maximum effect.

review/text: I've tried them all, believe me.  Most are just too gritty. But Kinnikinnick's GF Montana chocolate chip cookies taste good. They have that real brown sugar flavor.  Crisp but not gritty at all.  No weird aftertaste.  These are my #1 top choice to buy when I can find them. I am glad Amazon has decided to carry them.  Wild Oats GF mini-chocolate chip cookies are good too, but not AS good as these.

review/text: I've been eating gluten-free for nearly 3 years and have occasionally missed the little junk food splurge here and there. I saw these cookies on Amazon and decided that, since I've never been disappointed by anything Kinnikinnick put out, I would try them. They are just as wonderful as I hoped they would be. I keep mine in the freezer, as the chocolate chips seem to melt quickly, and just take a few out as I want them.<br /><br />These are truly excellent cookies! I gave the rest of my gluten eating family one cookie each and they could hardly tell the difference between Kinnikinnick and Chips Ahoy.

review/text: The only GF cookies that my son will eat. I tried 'em all: cheap, expensive, ordered on the internet, bought from local specialty stores, bought Pamela's etc, etc. All other gluten free cookies pale in comparison. Most others are actually gross. However, these gems are the kind of cookies that you are sitting in front of the tv in the old recliner and its really hard to stop eating them, just like the old (forbidden) Chips Ahoy. This company has a lifelong customer here. Most all of Kinnikinnick's products are the best gluten free that money can buy. Heck, I can't even make them from scratch that taste this good. Happy healthy eating everybody! :)

If you like gooey or soft chocolate chips cookies those are not for you. But if you like a good crunch you won't be disappointed, they have a great texture and are not gritty like some GF cookies sometimes are.<br />They do not contain soy or dairy which is an added bonus for our family with multiple allergies.<br />My only problem with them is that they're expensive... :-(

review/text: These are very addictive. I can't believe that I can't tell they are wheat-free! They are super delicious and do not taste fake or odd in any way. The chocolate chips are divine. I have eaten entirely too many this week after discovering them because I was waiting for them to have a strange after taste or make my tummy funny, but no, these cookies are just perfect. The calories aren't too bad either. It's something like 36 calories per cookie. This cookie gives much joy because eating gluten free is a bit of a hassle and this makes me feel like I am not missing out on anything! Thank you very much Kinnikinnick!!

review/text: As you can see from the other reviews, these cookies are exceptional. I have Celiac and most GF cookies I have tried simply taste bad, or have no taste at all.  When you cannot eat gluten, most, if not all of your previous "deserts" cannot be eaten. So it was refreshing to find something that replaced all the previous gluten cookies and deserts. I never thought I would crave "sweets" until I could not eat them.....Kinnikinnick's Montana chocolate chip cookies help fill the void.<br /><br />I just ordered some of these from Amazon as my local store has been out for two weeks....got to have that cookie!

I expected these cookies to be more like the gluten-free chocolate chip (or chunk) cookies from Pamela's. Pamela's I would rate with five stars. Overall the Kinnikinnick brand would be fine for kids who want a snack, but gourmet they are not.

With an Amazon subscription I pay $2.74 per box for it.<br /><br />I enjoy that this cereal is all natural with real cinnamon & sugar. So I don't mind paying a little extra for real ingredients. All I eat is this and Special K.

review/summary: When I eat this cereal it feels like there is a party in my tummy.
review/text: This cereal is really good.  I used to really like cinnamon toast crunch, and I still do.  I tried this stuff, and was surprised how good it really was.  When you see a "healthy" version of something in the grocery store it usually doesn't taste near as good, but this is a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Not a whole lot to say really.  It is just good cereal, and if you like cinnamon toast crunch or similar cereal it is definitely worth a try.

review/text: I usually eat special k protein plus, which I love but its nice to have another healthy cereal option-and this is it. I love this cereal,it tastes just like cinnamon toast crunch but this is healthy, whole grain, and not too sweet.it also has fiber and is only 110 cal per serving. I bought two boxes of this cereal from Big Lots for 4 bucks(great deal!) I highly recommend this cereal

review/text: It's almost embarrassing how fast my family went through 4 boxes of this cereal.  Both my husband (48) and my son (7) absolutely loved it!!  They had it for breakfast, snacks, I think my son even crushed it up on ice cream.  We got it on an amazon sale for $8.  I am sooooooo sorry I didn't buy more at the time.  Now the price is around $18.  Unfortunately, although the cereal is delicious, healthy, low sugar, etc., I would never pay more than a couple of dollars per box.  And this is only a 10.3 oz box!!  Waiting for the next sale, but if I see it less expensive elsewhere, I will stock up and recommend you do the same!!

review/text: We are going through so many boxes of this cereal in our house right now, I only wish it came in bigger boxes.<br /><br />My boys love this cereal, I hardly get a look in.  It is deliciously crunchy with lots of real cinnamon taste, and enough sugar without being overloaded.  The best part is it is made with natural ingredients, whole grains, real sugar and no artificial nasties.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: My favorite cold cereal.
review/text: I absolutely love this stuff! I bought it for my boyfriend because he used to like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which I absolutely abhor. However, this stuff takes CTC and kicks it in the gut and sends it to the curb. This cereal tastes like real ingredients--it's sweet (but not too sweet! The calories and sugar content are not too high, although I don't remember the exact numbers), tastes like cinnamon, and that's about it. Not a ton of artificial crap and preservatives. I actually have only eaten it in a bowl with almond milk twice--I usually just eat it out of the box dry. It's like crack! We went through a period were the local supermarket had it on sale for $2 a box, and we ate at least 5 boxes a week for multiple weeks. That's scary! But it was so worth it, and so good. I'm waiting for the supermarket to put it on sale super cheap again. I'm telling you, this is the best cereal made. Period.

review/text: My kids and I love this stuff.  I will say up front- "yes, it has a lot of sugar."  Now that I've said that, let's talk taste.  My kids and I loved Cinnamon toast Crunch- which we cannot eat anymore, because we found out we are allergic to GMO corn.  This stuff doesn't have any of that, so we can eat it, and it's fantastic!  I take it dry, in baggies, for desserts for lunch- and eat it like cookies.  My kids eat it like normal cereal, with milk, and they eat so much of it we are on our second order in a month.  I had been buying it at Whole Foods, but that was a long drive, and it was more expensive.  I love you Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Cereal; no HFCS but still lots of sugar
review/text: We don't normally eat cereal because it is generally junk food. I'm not going to claim this is a healthy cereal--it has a decent amount of sugar in it (8g sugar, 22g carbs for each 1 cup serving)--but it IS organic and as far as junk food goes, this is one of the least junky out there because the ingredients are at least natural and organic, not chemical and artificial.<br /><br />So, on the RARE occasion that I buy cereal for my first grader, this is what I get.<br /><br />I bought it at a salvage grocery for $1/box...very good deal, obviously. But I'd say it is worth the $4+ a box, too. It tastes great and I like knowing that what my son is eating isn't a bouquet of artificial colors and ingredients.

At Target it is $3.50 a box ($14 for 4)...significantly cheaper, even without a coupon.

review/text: I've been trying out teas for the past few months, since I quit coffee. Teavana has my favorites, but it's really pricey, so I thought these might do, so I ordered a couple. The worst part about this one is it's ground up into such a fine powder that it sifts through the metal basket (that I got from Teavana), and the mesh on the basket is extremely fine. There isn't much taste to it, either.  I add Agave Nectar and flax milk, and that's about the only flavor I can taste. Not a repeat purchase, for sure.

review/text: 1883 Routin advertises on their website about using natural ingredients, the label mention artificial flavors along with natural flavors. I wouldn't consider artificial as natural. The flavor is ok when chilled. It is similar to the Dole's pineapple juice in a can/carton. I would not consider the taste as "fresh pineapple" as advertised by their website. It is better than Monin's pineapple syrup.

review/summary: Fruity bold sweet iced tea without the yucky flowery herbal taste
review/text: I have been for years a long-time customer of Twining's blackcurrant tea, but I was very wary of buying Twining's fruit iced tea after having bought boxes of their new blackcurrant tea formula and after having tried other "fruit" teas Twining's, all of which which I rejected in disgust because of their yucky flowery "herbal" tastes like hibiscus, rosehips, etc.  If they were trying to imitate Celestial Seasoning's tea (which I positively hate!!), they were doing a good job.<br /><br />But I was desperate for a good fruity iced tea in this hot weather and didn't want to pay Tazo's premium prices and I found that Twining's iced fruit tea was PURRRFECT!!  It didn't taste too "herbal", it tasted boldly fruity, and it had a sweet taste such that you didn't really need any sugar added.  The only drawback is you need to steep it in the water for a long while to have that bold fruity taste but otherwise, it's just as tasty and more healthy than those artificial over sweetened corn syrup based "iced tea" or other "fruity" drinks at the store.  For a new flavor, try their rooibos tea.  Their rooibos tea is also fantastic as an iced tea as well as being great for your health.

review/text: I was looking for something that I could add to my water at college to make it a bit more interesting than just plain water, and so I wouldn't be drinking so much soda.  This tea is perfect, it has a great flavor, and I like it so much I have even added 2 teabags to a gallon of water (along with a pitcher sized competitor's cold brew tea bag) and made the perfect gallon of tea with just a little bit of berry flavor.  I keep several of the individual sealed packs of teabags in the bottom of a pocket in my backpack, and so far have only gone through 1 of the 6 boxes of tea.  The quantity you get and the price you pay is a great value as well, at about 17 cents a tea bag, it certainly saves money as well.

review/text: I've previously commented on Twinings' other cold brewed teas (green) I dearly love.  In my view, the Mixed Berry flavor is one of the most berry-forward flavors found in a tea. I have purchased teas from all over the globe, enjoying the best of the best the world offers and the convenience of making a travel-cupful or a pitcher (use 3 bags in a large pitcher with lots of ice, fill with water and place in refrigerator for 30 minutes and you've got delicious iced tea - berry iced tea, that is!) is why I keep coming back to this product time and again.  Ordering through Amazon makes it a smart budgetary choice as this can be an expensive tea in the market place. You won't regret the best of convenience and refreshing flavor!

review/summary: Good berry flavor, but weak tea flavor
review/text: I have been drinking a ton of tea lately and have been trying a few different products on Amazon.  I found this Twining's tea to have a very nice berry flavor that doesn't taste artificial at all, but I prefer a stronger tea flavor.  In this cold brew,  the berry def. tastes stronger than the tea.  I feel like flavored iced tea should taste like tea with a flavor, and to me this tastes the opposite.  I am going to experiment with letting it steep longer, and maybe trying a hot brew.  But as is, it's just too weak for my tastes.<br /><br />As I mentioned,  I have been trying different iced teas.  I find China Mist iced teas to be far superior to this,  but shipping is expensive (and you have to order a lot to qualify for free shipping).

review/summary: Nice summer iced tea
review/text: I used to go to a restaurant that served this iced tea when I lived in the Southwest, and could never find it when I moved back North, until I saw it on amazon.com.  It's a great, berry-infused tea, not overwhelmingly so, but just a hint to give it a delightfully different taste, just right for summer (although I'm sure you could drink it any time).  I also like the fact that it is cold-brew - saves some time in the brewing process!

review/text: I have lived in the south most of my life, so iced tea is a very popular drink in my home. I have always been a luzianne drinker, but this has replaced that brand in my pantry. Delicious! Perfect blend of black tea and fruit flavor! So glad amazon is carrying it....it is hard to find in my local grocery store.

review/summary: The Perfect Tea
review/text: Despite the great reviews, I was still skeptical until tasting this cold brew tea for myself.  My husband and I have given up soda and other artificial drinks, but we quickly grew tired of plain tea and I was tired of having to constantly brew a batch the traditional way. I have also gone through almost every brand at the supermarket trying to find the 'perfect tea', to no avail.  This tea is fantastic and will definitely be our number one choice from now on.  One bag per cup gives you a mild flavor, two bags per cup gives you more berry flavor (my preference) without being overpowering, but the best part is that the flavor is never bitter and never artificial tasting no matter how many I use.  This tea is much better tasting than any of the national bottled tea brands.<br /><br />While many other cold brew teas are designed to make 2 quarts or a gallon per batch, with Twinings each tea bag is individually wrapped and designed for an 8 oz. cup, as with hot teas.  This makes it easy to travel with them and also easy to make small batches (I use 6 bags to 4 cups in a small pitcher.)<br /><br />The only minor issue I had at first was sweetening this tea.  While it would be great for those who prefer unsweetened, I do like mine slightly sweet but do not use artificial sweeteners.  Really, no one should use those in a good tea because they can alter the flavor. This is tricky when cold brewing since sugar doesn't dissolve easily, but there is a simple solution. I like to use a small amount of real sugar and dissolve it with a few tablespoons of very hot water, then I add my cold water & brew.  At home I make my own batch of simple syrup (same concept - 1/2c sugar to 1/2c hot water) to have some liquid sweetener on hand.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more Twinings products, I'm very impressed.

review/summary: Very Best Tea EVER I am forever HOOKED !
review/text: After the first glass of this wonderful tea I was hooked, it is mild, with just the right amount of fruit taste that does not overwhelm the tea taste, it is good unsweet or lightly sweetened.  I am normally not one to mess with my ice tea being from the south, I love it just like it is but this is a wonderful and very refreshing change.<br />I found my first box of this tea in a grocery last year, and loved it so I went back to buy more and suddenly it was not in any stores in my area!!  I could not believe it, so I waited thinking they were just temporarily out but it never happened!!  So, I started looking on line to find where I could buy it and had to order from Amazon, it is crazy that the stores do not carry such a great tea, they carry everything else (most of what I do not like).<br />Anyway I am back for another shipment and can't wait, I love it hope that Twinings never stop the production of this one it is a Winner!!!!

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: This is the best pasta I've ever had! My husband is the opposite of me --Doesn't like healthy food and thinks organic foods are a waste. When I bought a big box of these he was kind of upset because he knew I'd try to get him to eat it. The first time I made them I had to cook two separate pots of pasta (healthy one for me and a nasty one for him). After he heard me raving about these for days afterwards he finally agreed to try some --but half and half with his white pasta. I did that for him once, and since I have started giving him just straight good stuff! Now even he thinks this pasta is great!<br /><br />Normal pasta feels like rubber in comparison to this pasta. I love this pasta and will never go back! It not only tastes good and feels good, but is also so much better for you!

Now that I think about it, Basic 4 also used to have dates and those were removed as well. Why after so many years would they do that?
