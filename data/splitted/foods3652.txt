review/summary: Great small "welcome" gift
review/text: We purchased this a couple years ago for a "welcome" gift to our new tenants who are renting a house we own. It's the perfect size - not too large and not too small - with a great price. A little something like this starts off a business relationship on a positive note. We just purchased another one today and with the free Prime shipping we have, will arrive in two days. Great deal! We have not had any issues with the food quality as other reviewers have mentioned.

review/summary: Fun Healthy Bread - Bad Price
review/text: This bread is great for toddlers, my 16 month old loves the fish shape and i love that it doesn't crumble like regular bread.  It also has healthy ingredients and fiber.  The seller's price gouge is ridiculous ($20 for two loaves), but that doesn't effect my review of the actual product.

review/summary: It's Goldfish Magical! Got to read this review!
review/text: As futile as it seemed, having a picky eater (step-grandson), came across this Pepperidge Farms Goldfish Bread; no matter how many times his parents have tried to get him to eat a sandwich, it was futile. Always wanting junk food, but I remembered how he loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> Nutello when I was very ill; thinking it was peanut-butter and chocolate and learned it wasn't and liked it, but only with very salty crackers. One day, at a local grocery store (Now I know they have it here on Amazon, I am going to snatch them) I saw these and snatched it; but never saw them again.<br /><br />My step-grandson's eyeballs nearly fell out the moment he saw these huge Goldfish ...<br /><br />"Grandma, what is that? A big cracker?"<br /><br />"Son, you will see in a little bit. It's for lunch."<br /><br />(pulling out the Nutello)<br /><br />"Grandma, Goldfish don't come in bread, 'cause I not gonna eat i!"<br /><br />"How can you say that before it hasn't even hit the table yet."<br /><br />"'Cause I hate bread!"<br /><br />"Just wait and see..."<br /><br />"Not gonna eat it. Not hungry."<br /><br />Went ahead and made his and my granddaughter's and all he did was watch his half sister giggle<br />with delight, pointing saying "Eye" "Nose" "Mouff" (Mouth) and then "tail" and was swinging it<br />around like a Goldfish swimming while eating and laughing. Step-grandson constantly looks, his<br />is still on the table sitting there; then suddenly my elderly cat is somewhat curious starts to<br />get close and *zoooooooooooom* he was at his place and pushed her away and said "GO AWAY, MY FOOD!"<br /><br />Next thing you knew, he was also eating and laughing, even poking holes to make his eyes bigger; ate<br />the whole danged thing and even he was a mess himself where poor Grandma had 2 grandchildren to wash<br />up and clean and he turns around to ask me if he could have another one?<br /><br />"No you can't have another one, you hate bread, remember."<br /><br />"No Grandma, I don't hate bread."<br /><br />"Yes you do."<br /><br />"I do not! I like Goldfish! Goldfish isn't bread!"<br /><br />"Ok, if it wasn't bread then what was it then?"<br /><br />"Goldfish."<br /><br />:-/<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />While I had Ham, Lettuce (Spring Mix), Cheese and Tomatoes with<br />easy Mayo and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110FILY">Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard, 10-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> with<br />Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard; holding it from the tail end reduced the<br />slippage of the lettuce and tomatoes which is frequent with traditional<br />loaf bread and yet, wasn't a PITA bread but resembled like one in its<br />appearance - after glancing at it; it looked something what I would<br />present for a Woman's Luncheon for a "Fun Twist". Then I thought<br />about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P7T7YY">Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Snack Crackers, Made with Whole Grain,Cheddar, 30-Ounces Carton</a><br />which could be used as salad for a GOLDFISH Luncheon. A Nice table<br />decor would be easy to get a bowl and a live golfish swimming around<br />for an added charm. And even using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SFCB9S">Gamago Cold Fish Ice Cube Tray</a><br />Goldfish Icecubes which are filled with Fruit Punch, like this link:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZRZNMA">Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br />and in glass or Rootbeer mugs (if you have them), add a scoop of<br />vanilla ice cream or two, then add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEHTB4">Shasta Lime Lemon Twist Soda, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PD2BNI">Sprite Lemon-Lime Soda - 32/12oz</a> and toss in the<br />Goldfish Fruit Punch Ice Cubes and pour in a little Fruit Punch<br />and the Goldfish will be the life and talk of the party. You'll<br />know you'll have a "Blast" as they will gobble it all up, hook,<br />line, and sinker ... except for the live goldfish if you elect<br />for a "Door Drawing" then there's something "fishy" going on.<br />You can always tell them to dress up as if they were going to<br />the Caribbean or Hawaii but keep it a secret as what it is all<br />about and just say "There's just something fishy going on..."<br /><br />Just a thought there!<br /><br />Got to love Pepperidge Farms and this would be AWESOME for not just<br />Office Parties to Red Hat Society Parties; it can even be used for<br />Fund Raising events as well ... and why not for gala events as well?<br /><br />What a tremendous and awesome idea this is! I can't wait to place<br />my orders on getting these breads again! Trust me, they are worth<br />every penny you have!

review/summary: My dogs love this food
review/text: I bought some Honest Kitchen Embark for my two miniature poodles and they really love the food. Then I saw an offer for a free sample of Zeal. They also love this food and the ingredients are very good for them. I've started feeding them grain free foods for the past year or so since one of the dogs has bad allergies. But most grain free foods contain white potatoes which are very high carbohydrate. The allergic dog can tend to overweight so I also try to limit her carbohydrate intake. Zeal is one of the lowest carbohydrate foods HK makes. The food is very easy to re-hydrate. Just add equal amounts of food and water, stir, and wait 5-10 minutes. That 5-10 minutes is sheer torture for my dogs as they sit at the base of the cabinet and stare up at their bowls.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: Zeal is perfect for our 14y.o. pup ;) He was diagnosed with kidney disease two Thanksgivings ago, and we needed a grain free alternative to the standard canned kidney diet. (He has been seriously grain intolerant all of his life). We feed him small amounts every 4 -6 hours, and because we re-hydrate the Zeal, we can easily adjust the amount of water he is getting depending on his activities, to be sure he stays well hydrated.<br /><br />It does smell of fish, but he does so well on it that that is a price we will happily pay :) Plus, Honest Kitchen just started packaging the mix in a heavy duty, resealable ziplock bag, YAY! so there is no longer any lingering fish smell in the laundry room!

review/summary: excellent food
review/text: The Honest Kitchens formulas are human grade raw ingredients and offer a variety of grain free formulas that I cannot find elsewhere. I use this as a base for my raw diet which consists of a rotation of chicken, turkey, duck and lamb. I had their nutritional analysis done after almost a year on this plan.  I was refunded the cost of the analysis for both dogs, as their blood work was perfect.  I do rotate between zeal, embark and force. Highly recommend either alone or with raw.

review/summary: Great low-fat, grain-free alternative
review/text: My dog was having terrible issues with reflux.  He was on an antacid, a prescription motility drug as well as Tums but was still having bad bouts of stomach acid gurgling up making him cough.  I did some research and discovered that a low-fat diet works well for dogs with reflux.  I switched to a low-fat, grain-free kibble as well as a home-made combination of turkey and vegetables.  I decided to add in some Honest Kitchen's Zeal for a little more variety and flavor.  My dog loves it, and the Zeal gives him added nutrients and flavor.  As a result of this new diet, my dog is off all medications and is having zero problems with reflux.

review/summary: If your fur-kid has ALLERGIES, or itches and scratches!!!
review/text: What your vet isn't telling you (because veterinarians make SO MUCH MONEY from this issue - is that 10 times out of 10, if your dog is itching, scratching, losing hair, etc - HE OR SHE IS ALLERGIC TO GRAIN!!!  The vets LOVE this condition, and MOST of them will NEVER tell you that it's a GRAIN ALLERGY, because they are guaranteed to make lots of money off of you every month!  They will not tell you what the allergy is - they will just tell you it's allergies - they'll give your fur-kid a shot of steroids - a shot of antibiotic, and send you home with oral (pills) steroids and antibiotics, maybe some cream or an antihistamine - or tell you to give benadryl.  About a week after your meds are finished - the cycle will just begin again, and you will just become part of the vicious cycle for the rest of your fur-kid's life.<br />****LISTEN!!!  I do not work for a dog food company.  I am a doggie sitter and doggie groomer.  I see this almost every single day of my life - and it makes me really ANGRY that because of GREED, so many of our fur-kids are going out of their minds from itching - or go through life drugged, just to calm the itchies.<br />***** PLEASE *****  SWITCH YOUR FUR-KID TO GRAIN FREE FOOD!!!  In 2 WEEKS, you will notice a difference - in only 3-6 months you will notice that your baby's symptoms are COMPLETELY GONE and you won't have a huge vet bill every month!  Their hair will be beautiful again and they'll be so much happier - and so will you AND your wallet!!!<br />I particularly LOVE Honest Kitchen's grain free food, especially this one - my girls are so much healthier and happier now.  Remember too, that you have to remove TREATS with grain from their diet too!  A lot of people forget to do this!  No more Milkbones, pizza crust - and please - make sure the human kids aren't giving Fido any table food!!!<br />*** If you think that the food is expensive - try to remember how much you were paying your vet - and every single time, your fur-kid ended up not being CURED - just reverting back to the same symptoms time after time!

review/text: My goldendoodle is picky, so when he cleans the bowl it means he really likes this. For the past week he has eaten this and licked the bowl clean, which he has never done before. A couple of things I do not like are the smell on the dogs faces after they eat even though I wipe them with a baby wipe, and the increase in poo production!<br />I bought this in hopes of clearing up skin issues on the goldendoodle, so will be patient and say a prayer that it works!

review/text: For years I have watched Kraft's Gourmet Caesar dressing mix packets disappear from grocery stores all up and down the East Coast.  Whatever the reason, Kraft needs to get involved in the distribution chain of this product and fix this problem.  We LOVE this dressing.  Everyone we serve it to at home loves it, and we entertain frequently.  We go through it so fast we don't even refrigerate it so it is easily pourable and ready for use at all times.  In a panic I bought several cases of this stuff the last time we found it online.  Stop this madness, Kraft, somebody in your marketing department is asleep.

review/summary: Wu-Long Tea has really helped my life in a positive way.
review/text: I began drinking Wu-Long Tea about 6 months ago.  I was over weight and had just basically been down on myself because of my image.  This really led to a lot of self esteem issues.  I heard so many great things about how tea could really help me lose weight.  In fact even Dr. Oz talked about it!  I decided to give it a try.  After researching about the differences in green tea vs. oolong tea I decided to go for the oolong tea because it has so many more powerful antioxidants.  These antioxidants are supposed to help boost my metabolism and also help burn extra calories.  Not to mention help with my hair, nails, teeth, and just overall appearance.<br /><br />After getting the first shipment, which came so fast, I opened it immediately to have my first cup.  It tasted amazing and was just what I needed to make a lifestyle change.  The tea did as it promised.  I got an extra kick of energy, it helped with my cravings, and it basically put me in the mood to adjust my lifestyle.  I was not magic, but it really helped me in ways that I needed.  I was able to put a little extra effort into my health each day and with the tea as my partner, I just got healthy again.<br /><br />To this point I have dropped 20 pounds and I am going strong.  I am shooting for a few more pounds off my body, but I won't stop there.  I want to keep going with this, because I just feel great when my girlfriend looks and me and tells me how much better I look.  And really, I feel so much healthier too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Delicious, but not many in the box
review/text: If you've never tried Almond Rocha, you're missing out on one of the joys of life.  Buttercrunch toffee rolled in chocolate and covered in nuts is pure heavenly delight.  All wrapped up in gold wrappers, they look like golden nuggets.  I always appreciate a box of these as a gift.  My only problem with the 4.2 ounce boxes is they only have ten -- yes, ten -- pieces.  That's not very much.  The rest of it is box and plastic, like how they package those school fundraising chocolates.  Either the box should be smaller or the package should be more full.  The way it comes feels deceptive.

review/summary: Excellent quality
review/text: I use lots of bay leaves when cooking and find many brands lack the bright pungency that adds a special touch to a dish.  These have a nice bright green color. They flavor dishes quite nicely.  I was surprised to find that these were as good as those of Spice Islands, which I have tended to prefer over all other brands.

review/summary: Finally -- peace within the pack!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths.  Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game.  Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings.  Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights.  Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need.  Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/text: My dogs loved this treat. They would lick it and lick it. But after a couple of days my Corgi's which are very smart dogs, figured out how to get it out. Even after the treat was gone they would lick the plastic like crazy. There are new everlast locking treats out that are suppose to stop your dog from popping out the treat. I would try the locking system first since the balls are not cheap to replace.

They keep the dogs busy for a long time and they love them.  The only thing I'll say is that if you have more than one dog be sure to have one for each dog otherwise the typical jealousy among dogs occurs.

review/text: Bought for 1 year old Maltese~I like the idea of the treat ball and thought this would be a neat one b/c the treat sticks out of the ball but the dog still has to work to eat the treat. I inserted the treats into the sides of the ball and within half an hour my dog managed to pry the treat out of the ball and then chewed and swallowed the remaining treat. I was afraid she would choke so that was the first and last time she played with this toy.

review/summary: Everlast? I think not!
review/text: I've heard that this type of treat is very good. Dogs seem to like it and it seems to last a long time. Other than it seeming to taste good, it didn't even last 10 minutes! I have a labradane. She loves treats which doesnt help the fact people says it may or may not taste good. Other than that, this product stinks. I bought it a few days ago and it finally arrived today. I put my puppy in her crate and handed her one of these treats to keep her busy while I pack. This treat was GONE in less than 10 minutes. G.O.N.E gone! Now, its not like my puppy is an aggressive chewer, she just has a strong jaw. She's also a puppy, for those people reading this who have ever had a puppy, they are easily distracted by food.<br />I looked up dog treats for aggressive chewers/strong jawed dogs and this was one of the first 5 items that appeared.I read reviews on it and everyone was crazy about how it was soo good. Now to find that I'm not finished packing, I have to go fill up her KONG to keep her from crying as she sees me running in and out of the room. I do not recommend this unless your dog is old or isnt very interested in dog treats/bones and would rather lay next to you...

review/text: These are something my dogs love, and when I first purchased them and the container they are put in, they would last a long time.  I do not know if the holder is weaker or if one of my dogs just has figured out how to remove them now.  One dog still naws slowly on them, but the other dog somehow gets them out and eats them quickly.  I wanted to have something for them to naw at while I was away and keep them busy, but now the one dogs just pops them out and gobbles them up.  Still give them to my dogs as they like them.

review/text: This product used at the right time can keep me sane.  I have a German Shepherd and an Australian Cattle dog that just never want to stop playing...in the house....and they are very loud!  If I want to watch a movie or something like that and I have one of these to put in my everlasting treat ball, I am very happy!  It lasts for a long time for my cattle dog but for the German Shepherd it doesn't last as long.  He can chew up most bones in under 10 minutes and this actually takes him more like 30 minutes to eat the whole thing, both sides and all.  So to me the price is worth it and I think it's a great product, the dogs LOVE it.

review/summary: All around GREAT tasting sauce, not just for stir fry!
review/text: This is THE best Korean teriaki stir fry sauce EVER, I've used it for chicken and beef with a plethora of vegetables. It is GREAT. In a pinch, serve it over some spaghetti noodles or rice with chunked cooked leftover meats and veggies, and you have an "instant better than takeout" meal. I've taken boring chicken breast and have used this as a dip, and have also used it to liven up "boring" meals. It is good with other foods as well, for example it makes a great dipping sauce for won tons as well. Slightly sweet with the teriaki and kind of salty, and LOTs of garlic and whole sesame seeds (even though, I've been using this product for YEARS, I have noticed a decrease in the garlic an sesame seeds.)<br /><br />The ONLY problem is THIS: I get this at a local grocery, and when on sale I get two for 7 dollars. Not on sale they are still under five bucks a bottle!<br />I LOVE LOVE LOVE to shop Amazon, because WHY run out when you can have stuff delivered to you? It is all for convenience. HOWEVER, at $13.92 a pound (or about 10 bucks a bottle on here) I am going to be forced to drive the 4 minutes to my local grocery for this.<br />If I ever move and am forced to purchase online as the only way, I will do it. But for now, I'm making the drive. I can get 2 bottles for less than one on here. Sorry Amazon, it isn't YOU per say, but the seller who is offering this product is price jabbing.<br />Great sauce, but I wouldn't pay over 5 bucks a bottle for it, and certainly will NOT be paying 10 bucks a bottle for it.

It has a good flavor, if you are used to the Goya brand this one is not as red so the color is a little different but it does not affect flavor. Also Badia Sazon is not as fine as Goya so you need to make sure it dissolves. Overall it is a great product. Latin Products shipped product out fast.

review/text: Badia Sazon in the red package has annatto, that yellow spice that makes your Latin rice dishes yellow. The big brands of "sazon" which is basically onion, garlic powders and salt and some other spices all have MSG, which not only is not good for you, it makes that processed food taste that is boring and not all that great. I avoid MSG and I FINALLY found this sazon. I found I only had to use half a packet because it was rather salty and I got good yellow rice, but not so intensely yellow. If that is an issue for you, just add some annatto in addition to this sazon. The taste was excellent, however.<br /><br />Not all Badia's spice powders are MSG-free. There are some in bottles that have MSG, so you have to read the ingredients. But these packets, so useful for quick Latin recipes, are MSG free and very good!

review/summary: All purpose doggy treat!
review/text: My dogs pretty much eat healthy snacks like dried chicken, dehydrated sweet potato sticks, fresh carrot sticks and the like. They turn their noses up at most store brand dog treats and bones, but they love these. One of my dogs has a very sensitive stomach, too, but has never had any issues with these. They're crunchy low-odor treats that make a great little snack. They're too big to use as a treat if you're going to be handing out multiple treats for a training session, though, and attempting to cut them will crack the outer crunchy shell.  In addition to the treats themselves, I love the 40 oz plastic jar. It keeps them fresh and is reusable. I once bought a box of these in the store that some creepy crawlies had gotten into, so I love that the plastic jar keeps the bugs out, too!

review/text: My dog LOVES these treats. She'll do anything for them. I only let her have about 2 a week because they have a high sugar content, and they don't have anything "healthy" ingredients in them. Basically, they're a treat with no nutritional value. That being said, I wouldn't say don't buy them...but definitely use them in moderation. My dogs get healthy treats regularly, and "junk" treats on occasion. These are an affordable "Junk" treat that all of my dogs LOVE!

It says minimum crude fat 7%, but no mention of MAXIMUM CRUDE FAT.  My dog is now fighting for her life after eating these "treats".  Do not feed your dog this junk or you may end up like me.  I would not wish this nightmare on anyone!!!  I just now started paying attention to the fat content and how to read this stuff.  I am devastated.  This stuff doesn't have to be made in China to make your dog very ill or kill her.  I have learned my lesson.  Please, only feed you dog low fat foods...........

review/text: The package seal did not appear completely tight, but I thought it not a problem since the top was closed tightly. The treats seemed a bit softer than before and coloration was different. After a couple of treats making my dogs sick, I returned this to Amazon. I've used these for years with my dogs and never had a problem before. Now, I'm really suspicious of anyone's using this product for their dogs.

review/text: For all the hype that pitbulls get, you'd think they could eat license plates, dead trees and babies and not flinch.<br />The fact is that the dogs aren't nearly as tough as the media would mislead you to believe. And the reality is, most have extremely sensitive stomachs.<br />I know what you're thinking... "awwweee... poor pit bulls!" and that's my sentiment too!<br /><br />Especially when you live on the 16th floor and need to go up and down and up and down the elevator when they get the runs.<br />Not fun.<br /><br />These treats are perfect for training dogs, for small doges, for big dogs and for dogs who have sensitive stomachs. Like pit bulls.<br /><br />:)

review/summary: Milk-Bone Dog Treats - Digest of Poultry By Products?
review/text: WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch.  So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases.  Whay are they eatting...?  I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />"In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening."<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.
