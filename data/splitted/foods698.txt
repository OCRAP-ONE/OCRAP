review/summary: Great quality cacao
review/text: I was hesitant on buying this organic cacao because of the 0 reviews but after seeing the nice packaging photo and visiting the company's website and finding out more info on the product I decided to purchase it. Initially I bought this organic cacao to prepare a facial mask from an online beauty recipe I found along with some other natural ingredients but was so impressed by the packaging (I'm a graphic designer hehe) and the little history on the back that I thought I'd give it a taste. It's definitely very rich tasting and very high quality. I'm not a cocoa drinking type person so I sprinkle a teaspoon of it to either my coffee or chai tea and I can immediately taste the richness of it.

review/text: I've tried a lot of coconut oils and this is the best I've ever had! Why? It tastes amazing, for some reason it has a lighter taste, and it's cold pressed and extra virgin. I cook with it, eat it straight out of the jar, put it on my lips and face, and make yummy desserts with it. AND it's healthy!!!

review/summary: Excellent Cereal Bar
review/text: This is a great cereal bar, and I'm suprised that it's not widely sold at grocery stores. I think it tastes far better than the Lucky Charms treats and much better than the Cinnamon Toast Crunch bars that are sold both which I think taste good as well. The Golden Grahams Treats though have a very distinct flavor, and the marshmallows and chocolate chips throughout it make it one of the richest tasting cereal bars I've ever had, and as a result does satisfy your hunger. I highly recommend this product to anyone that likes Golden Grahams, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Tea for every mood
review/text: I have an office in an extremely remote and often frigid location and sometimes have co-workers visiting.  I try to make the workspace welcoming and hospitable.  I set out a box of other assorted teas and a box of this Numi assortment and visitors ALWAYS go straight for the Numi.  This also serves me well because I can pick out a tea to suit my mood, whatever the occasion.  All of the teas have great, deep flavor.

review/summary: Decent selection but....
review/text: I got the assorted box after I fell into Numi's fabulous tea and wanted to sample the others. However, I noticed that the assortment of teas actually do not enhance each others flavor but rather take away from it. What I mean, is that with so many flavors crammed into one box (18 to be exact) is a collusion of scents and flavors that may or may not be conducive to the palate. I found even the teas I was familiar with tasted rather stale, lacking its vigor. Case and point: rooibos. Case and point: jasmine green tea.<br /><br />On the upside, I did discover that the toasted rice and chocolate pu-erh were rather great surprises.<br /><br />My advice to Numi is to break it up like Celestial Seasonings does: group 3 or 4 each of conducive flavors into a 4 flavor variety box as to not lose its aroma/taste that will offer enough variety and give each box a theme, like Energize, Soothe, Revive, etc. Allow people to choose the sampler they want.<br /><br />In the end: Numi makes wonderful, out-of-this-world, amazing tea. But this assortment did not do the brand-name justice. :( Sorry!!!

review/summary: A nice variety and pretty good quality, but I didn't like many of them.
review/text: I love Numi's organic loose leaf jasmine green tea and drink it every day, so I figured I'd try this sampler to see if there were any other Numi teas that appealed to me.<br /><br />Honestly, I was disappointed.  Out of 18 different teas, the only one besides my favorite jasmine green that really appealed to me was the breakfast blend.  Maybe it was the fact that they were bags instead of loose tea, I don't know.  I just didn't like the flavors that much.<br /><br />However, the quality of the tea was decent for bagged tea.  It didn't seem like it had been sitting forever and getting stale.  Especially the floral teas, like the rose infused white tea, tasted fresh and the floral scent was vivid, but not overpowering.<br /><br />Also, it's a mix of herbal (no caffeine) and black/green/white (with caffeine) teas, if that's important to you.

review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: I really liked this collection which I purchased it the first time about two years ago.  Given that I am already familiar with these teas, I made this purchase because the product description included two teas that I had not tried.  I thought this was a new collection with a combination of new and old products.  Turns out that it was the same 'old' collection and despite what was in the product description, this collection did not include the two teas that I had not tried.  I thought it may have been a shipping problem because the two teas are also listed amongst the ingredients on the box.  Sale or no sale, I am making my tea purchases in a store so that I will know what is in the box.

review/summary: Excellent strong tea!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, cheap teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, this is what I imagine Homer's nectar of the gods to be like. It's like Zeus brews me a cup, hands it over and says "here, drink this".<br /><br />So far I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. A 10/10.

review/summary: The perfect cup of tea
review/text: When  I could no longer drink coffee  ( I loved it but it stopped loving me at age 50, making my nerves too jangly and insomniac for comfort) my favorite advisor about coffee and tea suggested I try Taylor of Harrogate"s Kwazulu Tea from South Africa.  Enough caffeine to keep a busy evening nurse clear and running at San Francisco General Hospital, but no frazzled nerves, and deep sleep like a baby restorative rest once off duty.  i love the clean, slightly bitter taste it gives to my palate; other black teas taste insipid by comparison.  If you like English or Irish Breakfast Teas, you'll find Kwazulu Tea a magnificent improvement and frankly, never want to settle for anything less.  It's sometimes a little difficult to find, but like the search for the Holy Grail, worth the pursuit.  Shop around on the internet for the best price since there can be overpricing.<br />A sante, as Julia Child always signed off.

review/summary: Major problem: new stuff is not what I loved, should be 2 stars
review/text: This is a strong but not bitter tea, as others have mentioned. The thing that really distinguishes it is a rich tone like fresh-cut cherry wood in the middle of the flavor.  Keeps very well, smooth on the throat.  I can put a gram in a full cup, let settle,  and have a tasty dilute lunch tea that's more woody, or 3 grams per in a pot for something really rich, with sugar.  Takes less than other teas.  I've been raiding an office-mate's box, so the 6-pack of boxes will let me replenish that store and load up my own tins.<br /><br />9/24/2009 update:  An office mate had this and I loved it.  I ordered this 6 x 4.4 oz.  set, and at first taste, it was very different.  A lot more bitter, much less fresh woody flavor, more like a Ceylon.  I was surprised and disappointed.  The office mate noticed too.  She says it isn't even close. We made some, compared again.  The bits and the tea color look similar, but the flavor is way off, with a flat bitter note instead of the wood note.  Not sure what to do with this.  Many people like this, but it isn't the Taylor's/Kwazulu charm I got to like before.  Maybe I can add some wood chips from a wild fruit branch...I dunno.  Woe.<br /><br />The editing will NOT let me alter the rating stars.  I would give it: 2 stars now.  This is not what I was raving about before.

review/text: This is an excellent black tea. My preference in black teas runs toward those that are smooth and not at all bitter. This means I often end up with  somewhat blander brews with little to distinguish them. This Ntingwe Kwazulu is a great exception to that experience. It's quite brisk, has robust flavor and yet is very smooth with no bitterness. My only complaint is the powder residue in the bottom of the cup, but it's well worth it. Now my favorite black tea!

review/summary: This tea made me feel like a Zulu Warrior!!!
review/text: Drank this tea almost exclusively for about two years.  It brews up with a full body and thick liquor and an equally robust albeit smooth flavor.  This tea has a look peculiar to itself in that the leaves appear almost ball-like.  I don't know if this is the type of tea bush used in this variety or if it is a characteristic of the picking and curing process.<br />Anyway, I ceased drinking this tea about three years ago when the formula appears to have been changed with a consequent flavor change.  The tea now has a strong, and to me, unpleasant aftertaste that puts me in mind of something chemical.  Anyway, I don't like it and ceased buying this blend.  Before then, however, its robustness made me feel exactly how a Zulu Warrior must have felt as he went off to battle.<br />I believe that a reviewer below states he began drinking this as the next best thing to coffee and I wholeheartedly agree.  I too kicked around for a tea that came close to the strength of coffee before settling on this one.  Highly recommended to those who have to wean themselves off Java.<br />If you are looking for flavor, the loose leaf tea with I find the one with the most refined and complex flavor that is both robust and inexpensive is Ahmad Tea's English Breakfast tea.  I see it sold only in bags here on Amazon but it is definitely a superior everyday drinker.

At first, Ewee (he looks like an Ewok) lost a considerable amount of weight on this food, so I had to increase his portions to compensate.  Other than that I think it's a great, healthy product!

It smells exactly like cup-o-soup or ramen and if you read the ingredients that is about what it is. I recommend that if you want to try it, DON'T start with the beef. Our dog is NOT a fan.

It is exactly the same for this product.<br /><br />However, my dogs MUCH prefer the beef flavor to the turkey. We try to switch between the two to give variety, but they eat the beef immediately and are much more excited when they are on the beef bag. The beef also looks different and has more distinguishable vegetables. However, as puppies we fed them vegetables as snack and they really like them, whereas my sister's dogs do not.<br /><br />My dogs love this dog food and I love how healthy and shiny it makes them and their coats. We will continue to purchase and love the convenience of Amazon.

review/summary: our dog won't eat this!  loves the turkey Sojos...
review/text: perhaps it's not fair to give this Sojos Beef only a three stars as the ingredients appear just as wonderful as the Sojos Turkey.  our 8-month old Golden Retriever loved the first bag of Sojos Turkey we tried. we decided to give her variety and introduced the Sojos Beef and it has been a no-go. she normally will eat most anything and has not been picky at all. with the Sojos Beef, she will not finish her meals. she will pick through the bowl and leave food bits on the floor.<br /><br />on a human level, the Sojos Beef does not smell as yummy as the Turkey. it also appears to be more vegetal.  our pup will normally eat vegetables that appear as treats ... carrots and broccoli, etc ... but is simply not thrilled with this Sojos Beef in any way.<br /><br />I've quickly just ordered two bags of Sojos Turkey from Amazon. in the meantime, I will be augmenting what is supposed to be a complete meal with things I know our pup will eat. last night she got minced turkey and cheese in with her Sojos Beef and she mostly finished her dinner. today's breakfast was just the Sojos and there is quite a bit left. this is a dog who has cleaned her bowl in the past.<br /><br />some guessing on my part...<br /><br />there is less beef in the Beef Complete. the flavor is not as full as in the Turkey Complete.<br /><br />our dog gets human beef from the table on a regular rotation and freeze-dried beef doesn't compare.  the turkey survives the<br />freeze-drying better.<br /><br />lastly, our pup is neither too fat nor too thin. her looks are stunning. her coat is like silk.  she is healthy in every way.  she will try most anything that may be edible. I am really surprised this Sojos Beef has flopped for us.

review/summary: Really yummy, but high in sugar.
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for something I can use as a quick breakfast or a relatively healthy dessert, so when I saw these on the shelf I figured that I had to give it a whirl.<br /><br />The good about this product is that it is only 160 calories, is pretty filling, has 40% of your daily vitamin C, & is awesome when heated. I decided to try mine heated as was recommended & I found that it didn't burn or taste funny, which is a huge bonus.<br /><br />The bad is that this isn't nearly as easy to open as the manufacturers would have you believe. The plastic wrap covering the apple portion didn't peel off cleanly & I ended up getting apple goop all over me. The other bad is that this has about as much sugar in it as a 3 Musketeers bar. I'll probably end up buying this again, but only sporadically as a treat. That's just a little too much sugar for my current diet.<br /><br />This does make for a filling meal, but if you're watching your sugar, looking for something to put in a bagged lunch, or wanting something a little more diet-friendly, I'd avoid this.

review/summary: Dole Fruit Crisp - Tasty, but could be tastier.
review/text: Dole Fruit Crisp, Apple Cinnamon sure sounds and looks appealing.  I love apple crisp, so figured this would be a good way to have a quick serving now and then.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Convenient packaging.  Easily fits into bags for overnight trips.  Is nice to have if you're staying at a hotel/motel which doesn't provide a real breakfast.  Is good for at home when you don't have a lot of time.<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- 40% DV vitamin C<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Packaging may be convenient, but produces a lot of waste.  NOT environmentally friendly.<br />- Plastic cover top which seals the apple portion doesn't pull off with as much ease as it seems it would.  Go slowly and carefully or you'll have a sticky apple mess all over the place.<br />- Can be heated to make it even tastier, but I don't like to microwave in plastic.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I was surprised at how little of an apple flavor there was.  I mostly just tasted a sugary sweetness that was a little too much.  There was a hint of cinnamon.  The crunchy oat topping was very tasty, though.  The whole oats made me feel more like I was eating something healthy.  The brown sugar in the topping made it even better.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />For 160 calories and 20g of sugar, this isn't a snack I eat daily.  It's also pricey, and for how much it costs, I wish it had a better apple flavor.  Maybe if they backed down the sugar, those apples would have a fighting chance!  I do still recommend this for an occasional convenience factor.

review/text: This is absolutely awesome! OK, so it may have sugar, but with oatmeal and apples, you still can't go wrong. The flavor is oh, so fine. One caution: it's a little wait for it to cool down enough to eat, so please be careful. And one problem: the price is simply outrageous. It's awesome, but too doggone pricey. Bought mine at Sam's Club at an excellent price only to never see it on the shelves again which is downright sad. All the same, try it and enjoy!

review/summary: One of the best vanillas you will taste and at a great price
review/text: I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)

review/summary: Dirty Chips Are Great
review/text: Though I like all things potato, for the most part I enjoy potato chips sparingly because of their calories and fat content. In this case, however, I made an exception, intrigued by the "Dirty" name on the bag and the low price in the local warehouse store. A third reason I avoid potato chips is a lack of will power on my part, and I soon found out that controlling one's eating with an open bag of these chips nearby requires a will of steel. Mine is a will of mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Dirty chips are a taste bonanza and a sensory delight. They are thick and crispy with an intense flavor one can't get enough of. If you think about it, salt and pepper complement potatoes perfectly, even in chip form. Want a different potato chip experience, try these tasty tater treats.

review/summary: Not bad, would eat again
review/text: For fun, I went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about 2 dozen different protein/nutritio bars. My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon. It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.<br /><br />Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible. There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.<br /><br />NuGo Dark Chocolate Chocolate chip was pretty good.  Good chocolate flavor, texture crispy, not pasty.  190 calories seems high, but you do get 10g of protein with it.  I wouldn't call it delish, but how many protein/nutrition bars are really all that good? I prefer the Luna bars by far, but that's just me.<br /><br />I would not wretch to eat these, but I wouldn't be running out to buy a case of them either.  If I was hungry and there were no healthier options available, I would eat it, probably with a glass of milk, and it would tide me over until dinner.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: It tastes better than a balance bar, and its vegan.  It tastes more like normal chocolate than dark chocolate, I think.  It has enough sugar to almost put it in the candy bar category, but the protein is high enough to make it not too bad for you.  It works in a pinch when I need a small energy boost and cant eat a meal or healthy snack.<br /><br />If they could put some vegan sources of the common difficult vegan vitamins (B12, D, Iron, Zinc and Calcium) in this, I would consider it as a daily snack.  Until then, I consider it a nice indulgence.

review/text: I had the pleasure of sampling this product earlier this week, and I have to say, of all the [anything other than pure chocolate] bars I've tried, this one had by far the best-tasting chocolate.<br /><br />Not a hint of the fake-chocolate taste that's so prevalent in other bars!  In fact, these nugo dark bars are so downright delicious that I'd likely pick them over most any packaged dessert choice.<br /><br />And indeed, these fall squarely into the dessert category, not health-food category.  In fact the only thing costing this a star is my wish that they had a bit less sugar and a bit more fiber (10g of protein is reasonable, IMHO, for a bar this size and of this deliciousness).

review/summary: Chili = spicy, not Mexican style. Spice up your ramen!
review/text: Yes, it's packaged ramen, not a health food. However, for those who want a fast and inexpensive snack or meal, Maruchan ramen is a classic.  This Chili flavor can be hard to come by in some markets; I haven't found a reliable source locally for the past year or so.<br /><br />Some may mistakenly think that "chili" means Mexican-style, like the dish with tomatoes, beans, and beef. Here, "chili" means chili pepper, as in spicy broth. Don't pay extra for those bowl noodles with the additional spicy seasoning packet. Maruchan chili-flavored ramen gives you the same flavor and heat for less money and less wasteful packaging.<br /><br />This Chili flavor makes a great, spicy ramen with flavor and a little kick. You can enjoy it as a simple ramen soup or add meat and vegetables for a more nutritious and tasty meal. Give it a try!

review/summary: Spicy Chili Pepper flavor is really good, but there's lots of salt.
review/text: Grocery stores are usually around 20 cents per package; however, the selection is less than stellar for Nissin and Maruchan. Amazon's price is sometimes a little higher, but considering there's a better selection of Maruchan than I can find elsewhere, it is definitely well worth it. I can't even find the Maruchan Chili [Pepper] in grocery stores (though I can sometimes find the Nissin of the chili pepper flavor in stores). I got these Chili Pepper noodles on Amazon for around 25 cents each.<br /><br />The Maruchan chili is a bit more spicy and tastes different than the Nissin chili noodles. I'd say I like both equally well. No matter which flavor, they're a bit too salty. I sometimes will use one seasoning packet with one noodle package, because it tastes so good, but once in awhile I'll use half of the seasoning packet for one noodle package. I usually eat two noodle packages, so I just put in one seasoning packet. I put in about half of the suggested water in the frying pan to cook the noodles and all the water simmers away with no water leftover. I add the seasoning packet at the very end of cooking, so the flavor of the seasoning is still prominent, even with half the suggested seasoning.<br /><br />I like the noodles in various ways. I sometimes will add one or two eggs while cooking the noodles. Other times, I'll mix in a half cup of mixed frozen vegetables while it cooks.

The seasoning package seems to be bigger than in the regular chicken ones and unless you want your mouth to be on fire, you can easily use only about half of the packet and it still tastes great but not overwhelming.

It has good robust flavor that lingers after your done eating.<br /><br />I wish they would put this seasoning in a bottle so I could sprinkle it on everything I eat.

review/summary: Not awful, not great.
review/text: I'm assuming that most people reading this review have had Maruchan brand ramen noodes before so I don't feel the need to go into much general detail. I don't eat instant noodles too often (trying to go healthier!) but I was curious about these so I grabbed a couple packs.<br /><br />I'm a fan of chili peppers in curries and was curious how this was going to work out. Overall, it was underwhelming. The noodles are the same as always but the powder was kind of weird- after cooking I left the room to go do something and when I came back it had separated.  I didn't prepare it as per package instructions (I made it in the microwave instead with less water and didn't get it to full boiling, though I still added the powder after cooking) but it still seemed weird to me.<br /><br />As far as flavor, it was a kind of bland blanket spicy taste with a hint of chili powder. The spiciness is pretty strong (which I like) but I wanted more personality to it.<br /><br />I need to look at these at the grocery store and see if the salt content is a little lower than other flavors. It tasted like it might have been, and I'd be happy to trade lower sodium for a little less flavor.<br /><br />Overall, I'd prefer pork or creamy chicken flavor. But it's not nasty and it's definitely not as horrible as that time I tried cheese flavored cup ramen.

review/summary: Gourmet pasta
review/text: This is the same pasta which sells for considerably more at Whole Foods, Smiths and some Albertson's. This tastes like the pasta you would be served in an upscale Italian restaurant. Since it is made from spinach (but sure doesn't test like an spinach I've had)it is very healthy and simple to make. Add your favorite sauce, or some fresh tomatoes, and a glass of wine and you will be sitting down to a very nice meal with a minimum of effort. For a change try adding some chicken, soy , meatballs or fresh vegetables.

review/text: Here in SW Florida, I find it difficult to locate spinach pastas.  I've now ordered this pasta at least several times and I'm always more than satisfied...with the quality, the taste, the cost.  What I especially like is the cooking time.  This pasta seems to be ready for serving in about two-thirds the time other pasta takes.  Ordering in quantities of six allows me to also share a bag or two or three with friends.

review/text: The pasta is fine, tastes very good and the package is plenty for 5-6 people.  The problems I have are A) one of the bags arrived with a tear and some of the pasta was spilled inside the box and B) package says cooks in 3 minutes but that is NOT true. It takes about 10 minutes unless you like your pasta REALLY firm. The quick cooking was a major part of the reason I made this purchase so that, combined with the torn bag are the reasons I won't purchase again.

review/summary: Warning: L&A Pineapple Coconut Juice-Not Kosher or Pure as Advertised: May Cause Severe Gastrointestinal Cramps and Constipation
review/text: I did not purchase this juice here at Amazon.Com as it is 51.00 and Walmart had the identical product for 15.00. (NOTE:) Right after I wrote this review I contacted Walmart with my review- they chose not to print any part of my review;however, Walmart did change their price to 50.00 the following day.<br /><br />Continuing with product review: Please read for your own health:<br /><br />The juice tastes good (does not taste natural) and is thicker than normal for Pineapple and Coconut juice. Now, as any juice drinker will tell you both pineapple and coconut juice have a very thin water-like consistency. So what gives this all "natural and pure juice" its thick creamy texture, and for you who care about sugar-why does this juice have an unusually sweet taste? And those who only eat Kosher: Please read on for warnings and your health:<br /><br />L & A Pineapple Coconut Juice claims to be KOSHER. It also claims the product is PURE 100% JUICE. This is stamped on the front of the glass bottle right beside the word "Natural."<br /><br />After my son drank it for two days -one bottle of 32 ozs he developed severe stomach cramps. He was doubled over in pain. Upon examining him I found him to have a large lower colon fecal blockage. After treating and removal of the blockage his tummy pain is gone. (Please pay attention to ingredients below)<br /><br />Upon reading the bottle more carefully I found in small white letters.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: FILTERED WATER, PINEAPPLE JUICE CONCENTRATE, COCONUT JUICE, ACACIA GUM, XANTHAN GUM AND CITRIC ACID. (I ask you- Is this "PURE 100% KOSHER JUICE"?<br /><br />Acacia Gum and Xanthan Gum ( broken down into sugar-bacteria is then added to create a thickening and sweetening agent) These ingredients are used in food to sweeten and thicken. These two ingredients are also prescribed medically for patients with gastrointesional illnesses. Their purpose in the gastro gut is to cause a stool to form bulk, as in the case of a patient with very loose bowels. What if your bowels are normal? Do you want your bowels to form such bulk that you have a bowel blockage or severe constipation? If you research you will find both ingredients can have excruiating side effects for some patients and consumers- to include bowel blockage and or severe constipation.<br /><br />A.

review/summary: the best pickle relish no longer on the market
review/text: If you love sweet relish with some heat (not mustard relish), then this is the relish to relish.  But I guess it was not a good seller for Heinz, because my local grocery store tells me that it is no longer available from their supplier.  Luckily I bought a case from Amazon about six months ago.  I took a bottle to a local sporting event for their concession stand and it was an instant hit, both on burgers and hot dogs.  It has just enough cayenne pepper to make you appreciate the heat, but it is nowhere near overpowering or even painful.  This was a very nicely executed condiment from a great condiment maker.  I hope they bring it back (I only have ten bottles left...that might last me four months).

review/text: I don't use any other sweet pickle relish since trying this.  I store it upside down in the fridge so it's always ready to go.  I mainly use it in egg salad and tuna salad.  It adds a zip but it's really not too hot.  Maybe I don't use enough of it to get a bite from it.  Good on any sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, thousand island dressing, and my favorites - tuna and egg salads.<br /><br />This isn't sold in stores around here and I've never found it in stores - I saw it on Amazon and took a chance and so glad I did.  It's  a mainstay for us.  Please keep carrying this, Amazon.  It's a nice, sweet pickle relish...good flavor, colors are bright, not a lot of liquid, squeezes out of the over-sized top easily...just a slight hotness to it.  I really don't understand why this isn't on grocery shelves.

review/summary: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED !!!
review/text: You might as well save your money on this product. I had been looking forward to receiving this so much, but wound up so disappointed. First of all, the product looks nothing like the picture shown on the packaging. It is not a croissant as we know it; it looks more like an ordinary roll and VERY small at that! What made it worse, is that as I was eating it, I kept wondering WHERE the creamy custard filling was. It wasn't until I reached almost the end, that I got it! Yes, the filling is delicious, but if they put in more than HALF a tsp. of it, I'd be surprised.<br />Another point to consider...why do they charge over $8.00 to ship this product, when it's as light as a feather? Please consider the product itself only costs $4.49!!!! I've never written a review before, but am feeling so outraged by this, that I felt I had to warn others.

review/text: How stupid can we be, buying water, when it come free right out of your tap. That is, until you research the origin of Fluoride and realize, what on earth is it doing in our drinking water.  Until you research what it means to try and shift your body into a more stabalized alkalized state, until you research what all this nonesense concerning alkalinity and acidity and what it means to us. This water is 9.5 alkalized and that's pretty awsome, it's also revearsed osmosis which is the only way to remove fluoride and it is infused with "proper" electrolytes that we desperately need.  Water is supposed to be 7.0 completley neutral, and it's generally understood that below 7.0 resides acidity.  I used to drink Smart Water, which is also reverse osmosis, but upon research I found that the Smart water was a staggering 4.5, NOT EVEN NEUTRAL.  Obviously they did something wrong, so when you consider buying water, please do some research so you will never think that your getting ripped off buying something that you think you can get for free!

It's bit pricey, and apparently according to my friend Eukanuba should be boycotted because they do experiment on animals (I don't know if its true or not), but this seem to make her the happiest. Also, for some odd reason, my cats (they're very finicky when it comes to food) starts to eat my dogs food for some reason. The cats eat the The Blue Buffalo Co. BLUE Wilderness, but most of the time they're at the dogs bowl, eating this stuff, so go figure.<br /><br />Thought I'd share, since I've never seen this with my dog and cats. Weird thing is that Dog use to steal Nutro cat food from the cats, but wouldn't touch the Blue Buffalo stuff.<br /><br />p.s. my dog looks like the Border Collie on this bag.

review/summary: The Gold Standard for Pumpkin Pie - Double Size Container
review/text: This is what to use if you want to make the most consistent, most delicious pumpkin pie! Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin in the can. Libby's also makes a Pumpkin Pie Filling in a can, but stay away from it, the results will not be as good.<br /><br />Usually, supermarkets stock Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin in the smaller 15 oz can. This extra-large (double sized) 29 oz can is often difficult to find....even during Thanksgiving and Christmas season.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9" pies (2 cup volume). If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical. I made three pies for Thanksgiving, so I bought one 29 oz and one 15 oz cans.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives. The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipes over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful traditional pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I also add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate almost custard-like texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't over-bake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />For comparison, this 29 oz.can would normally go for about three ninety nine in your average supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipes and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!

review/summary: This pumpkin has other wonderful uses besides pies...
review/text: There are tons of great pumpkin pie recipes that work wonderfully with this product.  But my favorite way to use this one is in a smoothie...it's incredible!!  There are so many ways to make it: I've used plain yogurt, cinnamon, nutmeg, almond milk, sometimes ginger, crushed ice and even a banana.  Any way you make it, it will be a delicious pumpkin smoothie/shake. You can even add a little vanilla protein powder.  I LOVE this product!!

review/summary: Low-quality High-Price
review/text: The price of this product was outlandish. One half of the cans arrived with major dents, even though the package appeared to be in perfect condition. However the shipment arrived quickly. The contents of the one can we have used (the one most seriously dented) were fine.

review/text: No complaints about the case of pumpkin.  My family enjoys pumpkin pie all year round and this saves carrying them home every other week or so.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: To be honest, I didn't think mixed greens in a can would taste this good! Used it for a recipe that called for frozen spinach and tasted even better with the spices and seasonings. Highly recommend for a recipe and on its own as a side dish, too!

review/summary: bitter, chemical taste
review/text: Just bought a 12 pack of this and Orange Crush; the Orange Crush is good, not as good as I remembered but drinkable.  The Sunkist has a strange bitter taste to it---makes me feel like I gulped a chemical experiment not a refreshing beverage.  It's not as bad as the generic Big K, which is quite awful, but I don't think I can finish the rest.

review/summary: Sunkist review
review/text: This soda rocks. A welcome change from Pepsi colas and Coke Colas of the world. It taste sweet and great. They got the orange color right on the nose. Don't drink too much of this stuff or it will turn your lips and your teeth orange. Overall a great change from Pepsi and Coke Cola with a great taste. I give this soda a 10 out of 10.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor & easiest curry ever!
review/text: LOVE the S & B Curry pastes. The Hot is the best flavor of all, but they are all good. This is the easiest way to make a really good curry at home. Little fuss and little mess and this stuff served with lamb, potatoes, carrots over rice the next day is even better!

review/summary: Forget your hamburger helper!
review/text: I've been using these "mixes" for several years and they are so great. Couldn't be an easier meal to prepare. Nice with added veggies-- green or red peppers, carrots, onions, a little potato-  but not necessary to make a very tasty and unique meal.<br />I used to put raisins and slivered almonds on top as a garnish but lately have just been throwing some raisins in to the mix while cooking and it's great that way. My brother adds some pineapple chunks when he makes it. I've given up finding these locally so I have my California people send me some -- but I think Amazon is cheaper.

review/summary: Awesome Curry For Anything
review/text: This is an awesome curry paste to use with coconut milk. For what ever reason the combination of the two work reaaly well. I have used this paste with chicken, shrimp and minced lamb and each time it has worked out really well. I also simmer coconut milk with this paste and the protein and the two work very well together.

review/summary: Best curry  Amazon is slow 16 days from order to reception
review/text: I love this curry but all the stores around here in Beaumont have stopped selling it.  Only place I could find was here on amazon.  But turns out amazon free shipping is not a good deal.  They wait one week before they ship.  One of amazon partners on here jvc or something like that you can order this for $29 bucks and pay $6 dollars for shipping  and get it shipped out right away with out having to wait and get it for a total $1 cheaper than from amazon.<br /><br />I'm still waiting on my shipment.  But I love curry alot so I guess it's worth the hassle.  But next time I'm ordering on jvc  instead of Amazon.  !

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I ordered the hot mix by mistake because I didn't read carefully enough. It didn't matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot, which I hate.  Super easy and quick to make and very tasty.  Highly recommended.
