I am impressed with these decorations. They seem high priced, but go buy them at a store or speciality place. I am very happy and they traveled a long way to get to me. The colors are vibrant and I can't wait to put these on my sheet cakes!

review/text: I ordered two boxes of the Hershery bars for a party I was having. It was three weeks before the party and I was going to be out of town for one of the weeks. Apparently there was a heat wave happening so I was sure they were going to be melted when they arrived.  I received an email from the company advising that they held my shipment due to the heatwave.  As soon as the weather was acceptable they sent them out.  I received everthing on time and in perfect condition.  I am very satisfied.

They should be shipped with some type of signage indicating the fragility of the contents. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to send them back  and had to use them. I was content with the pricing but unsatisfied with the candy bars themselves. I don't think I'll be using this vendor again.

The gift did not call for almonds and was ruined. Absolute waste of 36 bars of chocolate. I would be less offended if this was the first time I heard of this problem. After reading other reviews, I see this is a recurring problem. Sending me almonds was relative to a slap in the face, just as this was to the other purchaser. Do not order this chocolate. The warehouse staff working for this seller clearly does not care what you want.

review/summary: How long do I cook it?
review/text: I tried the smoker bag twice. Since my bbq is very hot (3 burners at 30,000 btu each) I need to cook at a very low heat setting. I've tried ribs and steak. The ribs were perfect and smoked nicely. The steaks were overcooked as I had the heat on medium low (should have been low). I had four steaks each about a pound. If you follow the directions I estimated it should smoke for about an hour or so. Boy were they overcooked. Since the directions also say not to open the bag it's hard to know how much time. If you have a very hot bbq, as I do, you may try cooking half the time, say 30 minutes. One thing for sure, the bag really works. I've never had a real smoker type bbq but the bags do a great job. ps, don't try your kitchen oven as the bags really give off alot of smoke and would smell up the house if you don't have a high output exhaust system. Experiment on your timing. Good Luck

They taste like I have smoked them all day and the meat is so tender that it falls off the bones.  I have used them for 3 years now and wouldn't cook ribs without them.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 6:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>The soda is clear, with gentle carbonation. It has a faint citrus scent, with mellow lemon undertones. The drink itself is very cool and refreshing, and reminds me of the clear rock candy that is sold in most candy stores. It's flavor can be likened to a very softened down version of a Sprite or a Mountain Dew in terms of flavor, carbonation, acidity, and sweetness. Overall, this is a fun drink to try, at least for the experience of opening up the bottle.

review/text: I figured you could rip off the typical Anime freak/nerd/whatever but this is just dumb. These sodas cost a buck in Japan. ONE BUCK. And you'll selling it for FOUR!? This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it! Cute little 6.6 fl oz to boost (or you can buy the larger ones for like three bucks) and the marble is a cool effect, just a little confusing on how to open the bottle at first, especially if you're craving soda. This stuff is worth buying.........but not here. This is a total rip-off. Unless you're adamant about Amazong and willing to stay at home and pay for shipping and handling, and the greedy price for cheap soda, have at it. It's your money. Your call. I'm not the government telling you how you should spend your money. ........I just highly recommend you go somewhere else for your Ramune. Like Japan. Or a Japanese store. Not here.

We'd always tried to buy good olive oil, and seldom buy the same oil twice, but we'd never had anything like it.  Didn't know olive oil could taste this good.  It's hard to find anywhere anymore without paying outrageous shipping costs, so this is an excellent opportunity on Amazon.

review/summary: Too many oranges!
review/text: I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a "candy dish" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.

review/summary: "Often imitated, never duplicated"
review/text: .<br />General Mills bought the Gardetto's Snack Mixes some years ago, but I think the chief reason this version has lasted so well is that the company hasn't messed with it.  This original recipe equals "bold" or "spicy" from other food companies.  The formula is blessedly simple:  mostly little toasted rye rounds with a really nice hard snap to them, pretzels, and short breadsticks.  Plus an inimitable taste and aroma that is Gardetto's own.  (Is it Worchestershire sauce?  Seasoned salt? Opinions vary.)  Gardetto's still has the taste of the tavern in it, as though each batch were made in the back of the bar.  And I mean that as high compliment.<br /><br />I'm lucky living in the Upper Midwest where Gardetto's is easily found at the supermarket.  If you don't have that resource, or if you just want a lot of excellent snack mix, I urge you to take a chance on Gardetto's -- the "adult" alternative. It goes great with beer, even better with spicy Bloody Marys!<br />.

review/summary: Sour milk?
review/text: The milk discs taste like sour milk to me.  It wasn't a bad batch, I tried several (latte and cappuchino).  I don't see how people can't taste this, but some people seem to love them so I guess it's not everyone.  The option to use milk discs for cappuchinos is the only reason I opted for the Tassimo machine over a Keurig.  Thankfully mine was recalled and the store let me swap for a Keurig.  I get the benefit of using bagged coffee in the reusable K-cup.  I'll add my own milk/creamer.  When I want a true cappuchino I'll venture to Starbucks.

I checked out other places since most of the other reviews says it's too expensive...but I think there was probably a price change recently. I couldn't find a better deal. Plus it qualifies for free shipping!<br /><br />Since I absolutely love cappuccinos, I get these with the Gevalia Espresso T-discs and save a ton (no more Starbucks!). And it's delicious!!! Definitely gonna keep buying this.<br /><br />You can also combine it with regular coffee T-discs instead of Espresso, and it's still yummy.<br /><br />I'm feeling brave; so now I'm gonna try the Latte creamers!

I use it in a professional kitchen to make foamy hot sauces that keep for several minutes (time enough for a plate to be delivered to a table and be eaten).  It is expensive, but a little goes a long long way.

review/summary: They didn't taste that great...
review/text: The price was excellent & I heard many good things about the Kind bars... but the mango macadamia bar didn't taste all that great. I would be willing to try other flavors, but I would not buy this flavor again.

review/summary: Good, but strong toasted coconut flavor
review/text: This are very good. I was a little surprised by how strong the toasted coconut flavor was since it isn't included in the "flavor" of the bar. I would buy them again. My wife wouldn't eat them though because of the coconut.

review/summary: Super healthy and not sugary sweet
review/text: I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.

review/text: I sampled these bars at a bike event and I was hooked.  I ordered them on-line because I wanted too many to eat and the individual cost is significantly higher.  They are absolutely delicious if you like nuts and fruit and are gluten free.  YUM

review/summary: the best kind bar of all
review/text: Chocolate cherry kind bars are yummy, and one of the lower calorie kind bars. I order by subscribe and save and I had to increase the frequency.  A real treat - love em!<br />Reviews are misleading.  I can tell that a lot of the reviews are for other flavors of kind bars, not cherry chocolate.  No one would say they are peanutty!  They are chocolaty and chewy and cherry-ie and delightful.

review/summary: Fresh Nutty & Fruity On the Go Snack
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes.

review/summary: must have one everyday
review/text: I love the cranberry bar. It has the right about of crunch and sweetness. I eat them midday and it keeps me full until dinner. Some people were complaining that the nuts in the bars were a bit stale. I didn't run across that problem, but they were sticky (just pop them in the fridge and they should be fine). You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it.

review/text: I really like the flavor of these so I think I am a bit biased in favor of them.  They are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i then that's about right to cover the cost. At least this sight offers a great discount. This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body.

review/text: I come from a high-fructose soaked nutrigrain bar eating family, but these are MUCH BETTER. The texture took a little getting used to but now I couldn't go back to the old stuff if I wanted. Not to mention far superior nutritional value, and ingredients you can see.<br /><br />If you're tired of mashed up and molded who knows what kind of bars, these are definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Should be called "Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts"
review/text: While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say "Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.

review/summary: Kind Bars
review/text: Kind bars are awesome.  I'm a hiker, figure skater and I also travel quite a bit with my job.  I prefer KIND bars for hiking because they are GOOD.  So often hiking food in general is loaded with salt just to give it taste and then it's still not very good.  I actually crave Kind bars.  They are good energy for skating and excellent to throw in before a meeting or take on the airplane in case I'm delayed.  Just good stuff and gluten free.
