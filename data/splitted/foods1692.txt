review/summary: Better than whole grain for bread maker
review/text: The whole grain spelt is so much heavier - it creates a much denser/smaller load - this light unbleached flour makes a far suppeior loaf of bread.

review/summary: Better than wheat flour for everything!
review/text: Our family switched from wheat flour to spelt hoping to improve our nutrition and avoid the sensitivities that we knew was caused by wheat. It is wonderful for baking, from cookies to bread. It is more tender than whole wheat flour and produces a very fine bread.

review/summary: A lovely flour
review/text: Spelt flour is one of my favorites to make bread with, but it does require a lighter touch than wheat bread if you are using a yeast recipe, too much kneading causes denser loaves.<br />Not safe for people who need a gluten free bread.<br />The flavor is faintly nutty and my favorite way to make bread with it is to mix finely chopped nuts and honey in the dough, it's one of my family's favorite recipes. I bake bread by hand using yeast not sourdough starters so I have no idea how it works with sourdough starters or with bread machines.

review/summary: Pleasing product
review/text: It's difficult to find Bob's Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area, so I have this product auto-shipped to my home, and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes.  Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat, although it doesn't work for anyone with celiac-sprue disease. Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain, the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all-purpose white wheat flour, but we haven't found the differences to be objectionable. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good alternative to wheat flour.

review/text: So far, I've only used this in banana bread. And I cut it with some regular flour in probably a 70% spelt to 30% flour ratio. My next batch I will use all spelt to see what happens. My boyfriend and I call the spelty banana bread "Run-der Bread" because when we eat it before going on a run, we have a lot of energy.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Light Spelt FLour A Must Have
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Light  Spelt flour is much better than the regular spelt. It has a milder flavor and lighter color. My husband is highly allergic to numerous foods. Spelt is one of the few grains that he can eat. I use it in all my baking, for waffels, pancakes and as a thickner in gravy and sauces. Regular recipe ingredients need to be adjusted which I have done by trial and error. It usually takes a little less spelt or more liquids. I have not tried using spelt with yeast as my husband is allergic to yeast and sugar. I have been told it doesn't have enough gluten for the yeast. Try it-you might like it.

review/summary: makes a great hearty loaf of bread!
review/text: I bought this to try as a replacement for a combination of whole wheat flour and multi-grain hot cereal in my bread recipe to make hearty multi-grain loaves of bread. This works great! It's easier and cheaper and all organic (instead of just the flour like before). My recipe is 6 cups of this flour, 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp instant yeast (bread machine yeast), 2 Tablespoons sugar, 2 Tablespoons olive oil and water to the right consistency (between 2 and 3 cups). Mix. Form ball and place in large oiled bowl. Let rise. Fold a few times and form two loaves, let rise again and bake at 375 F for 45 min. It's delicious!

review/text: Just finished my first 25 lb bag, and we're officially fans.  This flour has so much flavor and the bit of crunch is a perfect balance.  It does make a hearty loaf of bread and is amazing toasted with a bit of butter.  We use this in our bread maker using a standard wheat bread recipe, in place of the wheat flour.  We make about a single loaf per week, and this bag has lasted us months.  Looking forward to trying some other blends from Great River, and at this size, it's an amazing value.

review/summary: Wonderful taste & quality
review/text: Like the other reviewers we love the taste of this flour baked into bread. I had been trying (unsuccessfully) to convince family members to eat more whole wheat bread. I was trying new whole wheat recipes and perfecting the recipe and this flour just took the flavor over the top. So now I substitute half the whole wheat flour called for in my bread recipe with this Seven Grain flour. This Seven Grain flour provides a nutty flavor and a nice crunch to the bread which is lacking in whole wheat recipes.<br /><br />Originally I tried the Seven Grain bread recipe off the Great River site but was unsuccessful. Congrats to the reviewers who did find success. My bread loaf came out dense and suitable only for use as a hockey puck or doorstop. So while this is quality flour I do recommend that you continue to add vital wheat gluten to get a good rise on your loaf. I didn't my first attempt and that's probably why I was unsuccessful. Below is my family's favorite recipe-<br /><br />1 cup lukewarm milk<br />1/4 cup orange juice (you won't taste the OJ but it removes the bitterness of whole wheat flour)<br />1/4 cup vegetable oil (I use olive oil)<br />1/4 cup honey, molasses, or maple syrup (my family prefers honey)<br />1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br />1 1/2 cup Great River Seven Grain flour<br />1/2 cup bread flour<br />2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast<br />1 1/4 teaspoons salt<br />1 T Honeyville vital wheat gluten<br /><br />Throw ingredients into a bread machine in the correct order dictated by your manufacturer. I have a Zo bread machine so all liquids go in first on the bottom. Then add the flours and top with the instant yeast making sure no liquids touch the yeast. Set the bread machine on dough and allow it to do the work. When the machine is done (after the first rise) I divide the dough in half and place into two lightly greased glass medium 8x4 loaf pans and cover with a towel for the second rise. When doubled in size bake in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. Enjoy the flavor of this wonderful flour.

review/text: This makes fantastic hearty bread, I just made my first loaf in my bread machine.  I used the recipe that came with the flour and am looking forward to trying others.  I agree that it has the perfect mix of crunch and flavor.  I have used it for pancakes and they were awesome.  With pizza crust I found that the flour competed with the flavor of my usual sauce and I could hardly taste the sauce.  The next time I added a lot more spices to the sauce and it was absolutely delicious (another alternative is to add some regular whole wheat or all purpose).  This is one more step in the right direction for me eating healthier!  I was reluctant to purchase such a big bag of flour, but I am glad I listened to the reviewers on this one.

review/text: My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones.

review/summary: A must have for the diaper bag!
review/text: My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.

review/summary: My baby loves it!
review/text: This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it. If you have problem with this blend being to runny I solved it by using Boon spoon or Plum organics boon spoons for pouches which made it breeze to feed the baby.<br />My son loves all the other flavors he tried as well ( pear; pear & peas & broccoli; apples & cherry; banana & blueberries & beats ), he did not like sweet potato & apricot flavor, it was too tart and sour for him, but I contacted Happy Baby customer service and the next batch should have more sweet potato to help with the sour taste, but if you can buy just one pack and try it you might have a baby that likes it either way.<br />Most of all I love the packaging, it is perfect since we travel a lot and it is so much lighter then glass jars and easier to pack as well.

review/summary: Too sour for my baby
review/text: We tried this flavor when my son was almost 6 months and he wouldn't eat it. It is too sour even for me. I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well.

review/text: This is another one of my daughter's favorite snacks.  She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it!  She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering.  I like fresh mango, but for some reason the smell of mango baby food is just awful to me!  Other than that, a good product that I'll be ordering again.

review/text: I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.  She did try it, but gave it back to me after one bite.  Later, I tried to feed it to my baby with her oatmeal, and she didn't like it either!  I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor.

review/text: I originally bought this after my toddler had tried some squeeze pack apple sauce and enjoyed the novelty of it.  She likes applesauce anyway, but I thought I might be able to get her to eat some veggies if I could find them in a squeeze pouch too.  This fruit and veggie mix is perfect -- she gets some green veggies, but it really does taste just like pears!  I've tried several flavors, and this is her favorite by far.  My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too.

review/text: My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online. He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!

review/text: I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!

review/summary: Tasty & Nutritious in one easy to administer pouch!
review/text: My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

review/text: I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pouches Not Recyclable
review/text: This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase "BPA free", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, "lower carbon footprint than glass jars". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first.

review/text: I really dislike that Companies are combing Fruit & Vegetables. No wonder kids are not liking Vegetables. I would like to purchase pre-packaged Baby Food, but after Stage 1 all I can seem to find are products with Vegetables and Fruit mixed so the food tastes sweet. I guess I have to stick with making my own baby food. Oh and the packaging is so convenient that you can even forego the Spoon and Dish, what does this teach your Children!

review/summary: Very sour :(
review/text: My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says "don't like it!" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!

review/summary: Very Messy
review/text: I was hopefully that since this was a mixed food combo it would be thicker in consistency - WRONG! It was like straight water. It made such a messy. I used it with my 6 month old who has recently started solids, but this was a disaster. He did seem to like the flavor, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I am going to keep it so that when he older I can mix it with some oatmeal for breakfast.

review/summary: Dominant Beet Flavor
review/text: I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.

review/text: My youngest loves this flavor straight out of the pounch and my older kids enjoy it without even knowing.<br /><br />My youngest often takes this in her lunchbox to preschool to enjoy during the day since she can recap it as many times as she would like.<br /><br />For my older kids, this is my favorite product to hide in all of their "treats"!  The apple & cherry flavoring is delicious in smooties, brownies, cupcakes and makes everything healthier.

review/text: The price from 911drugstore is crazy!  If you buy the spinach, mango and pear one, which amazon itself sells, it is half the price (see link) of 911drugstore and about twice what you'd pay retail.  Don't buy from this company. They are price gouging.<br /><br />That said, all of this band of baby food that I've tried are great.  I don't even use a spoon, my son likes to just suck it right out of the tube and has been since he was 7months old.

review/summary: My son's favorite food!
review/text: Our son is 6 months old. This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars.

review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/summary: Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!
review/text: We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that "baby food" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.

review/summary: Too sour, 16 months old doesn't like it at all. A waste of my money!!!
review/text: My boy is not a picky eater. He likes these pouched food except this flavor: it is too sour, even I have a problem with it! He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!

A previous reviewer indicated the puree is a bit thin for a spoon and I agree with that. However, it doesn't bother me because if your diaper bag space is at a premium, like mine, you can forget the spoon and just sip from the pouch. My 7 month old has no problem doing this.

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere.

review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.
