review/summary: Just the kick I need in the morning!
review/text: I love the spiced chai so I decided to try the green tea chai.  I love the balance of green tea and chai flavor.  It is a delicious way to start my morning.  Unfortunately the tea doesn't ship to all 50 states so I shipped to a visiting relative to try it.  Hopefully they will visit again soon.

review/summary: Not 99% caffeine free
review/text: I love Big Train Chai and want to decrease the caffeine in my life.  I ordered this in confidence that it was mostly caffeine free.  Well it states on the package that it contains 87 mgs of caffeine per serving!  Ugh!  Maybe I will try the decaf version.

review/summary: yum
review/text: I'm a coffee person by nature, but since my mom came back from a trip to India with a taste for chai, I got hooked. I bought this to get free shipping on something else, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. I have to admit that in recent months I've become a fan of flavored creamers and stuff, so the fact that there's non-dairy creamer in this doesn't bother me, but it might bother a purist.All in all, if you just have it as a treat, the 140 calories per serving won't be a problem.

review/summary: 3 jars spreadable fruit-Sarabeth
review/text: Nice package. We found them more sweet than expected. Each jar contains lots of pieces of fruits, no doubt, plus sugar and lemon juice. The Mixed Berry:1 tbsp (20 mg)  40 calories. The Strawberry Peach: 1 Tbsp (20 mg) 30 calories. The Apricot combination was the only one with a color preservative in the ingredients, as a warning for people with allergy issues. Great for bakery or to mix with plain yogurt.

review/summary: Her favorite treat!
review/text: I have a lab that absolutely loves these.  I buy the 6-pack of small dog peanut butter since they're small enough to fit in a Kong and fill it up.  She loves them so much in fact that she'll bring the Kong over to me, drop it and stare at me until I pick it up and say the catch phrase; "Want me to fill it?".  Once I say that, she bolts to the kitchen where I keep them and paces or sits in place until she gets it.  It's almost impossible to find a good grain-free peanut butter treat and these do have barley flour as the main ingredient, which isn't bad by any stretch, but they are meant as treats and not as a primary food source, so I don't want to get too crazy about her carbohydrate intake.  A dogs digestive tract processes fats and proteins first and since carbs are generally non-essential in the process and either get converted to glucose for energy or become part of the waste, they're not really needed that much.  Plus, the tumeric and rosemary seem to make her farts much more bearable.  :)

review/text: I'm a bonafide halvah-lover, ... so I haven't met a halvah yet that I didn't appreciate to some degree.  The pros and cons (in my opinion) of this Koska brand "Tahin Helvasi", (as the product is labeled, and which translates in english as "Tahini Halvah")...<br />Pros; Good price compared to other brands, (about eight bucks a pound when I ordered a two-pack, with free shipping via Amazon).  Decent flavor, especially with the pistachios mixed in. It's also packed well in two resealable plastic rectangular containers.<br />Cons; A slightly unusual texture, with a lighter and more crumbly texture than most halvahs I've tried.  I think this may be a result of the "emulsifier" listed in the ingredients. The only other "con" is that it's not made with real vanilla.  Overall, I still like it and would recommend you give it a try.<br />Here are the listed ingredients; "Sesame paste (57%), sugar, Pistachios (8%), Emulsifier (E471), Saponaria root extract, Acidity regulator (E330), Nature-identical vanillin aroma."

review/summary: Cats love Purina Naturals and it is GREAT for sensitive tummies!
review/text: Cats really love this food and I recommend it to anyone I know with a cat who throws up a lot. Many times they will stop throwing up altogether after being put on this food. It is great for sensitive tummies. I like the fact that this comes in multiple smaller pouches so that it stays extra fresh and is easier to handle. I have back and joint problems and I just can't handle large bags of food so I am willing to pay extra for the convenience. Plus, I like knowing my kitties have fresh food. My cat is allergic to many of the ingredients in the "super premium" and holistic food brands and none of my cats will eat any of the dark colored cat foods like those anyway. I knew from the color of this food that it would be a hit with them. I realize this has corn in it but I do not see any difference in that and the more expensive brands that use potatoes, blueberries, tomatoes, cranberries, etc. Cats aren't meant to eat that either. Anyway, I have been very happy with this food and so have my cats. And my vet says it is perfectly fine to feed to them so we are all happy!

review/summary: My Canine Urban Princess Loves It
review/text: I started buying Avoderm for a cat with a skin problem. She kept licking the fur off her tummy. Nothing worked - even those high-powered pricey foods from the vet.<br /><br />Then we discovered Avoderm and now it's my primary food of choice for all three of my companion animals. My dog (the CanineUrbanPrincess) had minor skin issues when I adopted her. She kept scratching. After I switched her food to Avoderm (mixed with some California Natural), she seemed better. Her coat is shiny.<br /><br />Best of all, Gracie is a dog who eats everything in sight. "Garbage gastritis" is no joke to us. Avoderm (at least the chicken version) goes easy on her tummy.

review/summary: great for allergies!
review/text: I am using this for my labrador mix that is extremely allergic to all kinds of foods and it works great on him!!! I got him as a puppy and he would have huge stomach upsets, diarrhea, vomitting, pretty much everything!! I didn't know what to do with him and I thought he was not going to make it.. However, this seems to be the only food that works for him now. I looked for a good holistic food that I could afford and also easily available so that I can run out to buy it when it's out. This is found in petsmart so it's pretty easy to find this food and it works really great for dogs that can not consume corn meal. Also, I have found that his coat is extremely shiny now! I get compliments on it all the time and everyone is always asking me what I feed him :) For the price, I think that this food is pretty awesome and I probably won't be looking for a new food anytime soon. I'm still looking for a cheap holistic food that does not contain any grains, but I think that will be next to impossible.. :(

review/text: Admittedly I ordered these based on price comparision to other Chocolate Almonds offered on Amazon.  So I should not be too surpised that "you get what you pay for"  I thought these chocolate covered almonds were not tasty whatsoever.  There was an after taste that really made me dislike these.  I took the remaining 5 cans to work and let my co-workers dig in.  No complaints whatsoever.  So maybe I am just that picky, or they were really hungry.

review/summary: I love this cinnamon tea (NO SPICE, WITH A HINT OF APPLE)
review/text: This is my favorite tea flavor, it's herbal/no caffeine, and sweetens nicely; and best of all, it gives me the cinammon flavor that I just love (NO SPICE)...I hate that almost every other cinammon tea adds that clove spice, yuck!  But this is free of that.  Sometimes, I add a tea bag to my plain oatmeal or cream of wheat as it's cooking for that extra flavor of yum.  It also gives me a way to add cinammon to my diet--good for diabetes--without having to deal with the dry kind that just sits on top of drinks or food. I even keep it at my desk, drop a bag into my tap water, add sweetner, and after a few minutes, I'm good to go and stay hydrated without having to worry about boiling any water.

review/summary: Great taste unlike any other cereal!
review/text: I've seen Peace cereals at the store for some time, but was hesitant to buy it because it was expensive (~$4.50). I finally tried it, and it was a great choice! A great taste unlike any other organic cereal I've tried - unique with the cardamom and other spices. It has a nice bite to it, a nice spice about it, and the mango flavor is good too. I'm not as fond of corn flakes as I am of wheat flakes, but these corn flakes are crisp and crunchy. I really like the oat clusters. I also tried the Raspberry Ginger Peace cereal and it was just as good and unique.<br /><br />Only two downsides (which is why I rate this a 4) -<br />1. not many servings - it says 7 servings, but I usually just get 4 (and I measure)<br />2. high sodium for cereal - why does cereal need that much sodium? Most of the cereals I buy have no sodium.<br />3. Ok so there is a 3rd reason - the price.

review/text: As a Binghamton Native, I was able to enjoy the wonderful variations of spiedies for a good portion of my life.<br /><br />However now that I am nearly a 1000 miles removed from my home town, when the spiedie craving hits, I have only a few options.<br /><br />I've tried my hand at homemade versions, with reasonable amounts of success, but it just wasn't the same, couldn't satiate the craving.<br /><br />Now that I can order direct, I don't have to bug relatives to buy/package/send some to me.<br /><br />I keep a healthy supply on hand all year long, and usually more than I can handle during the nice long grilling months.<br /><br />I have served different type of spiedies to all my close friends, quickly making myself the default go-to guy when it comes to grill parties. Even more deviously I have converted many unaware locals to try the food simple from the smell from heating up my leftovers at work.<br /><br />So try it! Cube up some chicken breast(or rather any meat you like), throw it in a ziplock bag with the marinade, let it sit for 24 hours, throw them onto some skewers and grill them. Then grab toss a few onto some bread (I prefer regular old Italian bread), and enjoy. Also, I prefer a light coating of miracle whip on my bread for nice extra kick.

review/text: I grew up in Norwich, NY eating chicken spiedies every year at the New York State Fair. In my high school years I discovered a mom and pop take-out restaurant in Endicott that sold both the grilled skewers of marinated chicken and tubs of ready to grill raw meat. Rapture! Later the sauce showed up in local grocery stores. Now that I have left central NY, I am thrilled to be able to buy this from Amazon.<br /> Unfamiliar to most, this sauce is vinegar and oil based and the bottle is about half full of herbs, garlic and other seasonings. It is not tomato or sugar-based so that it won't flare up or burn. You can throw this stuff on any almost any meat(I prefer chicken), let it marinate for a few hours then grill it up! Easy.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Lupo's is the best spiedie marinade I've had. I wasn't even introduced to spiedies until a couple of years ago, so maybe that's not saying much. My fiance and his family are from upstate NY, though, and raved about them, always saying that Lupo's was the best. We can't buy it in NC (though other brands are available - but not the same!), so I ordered a couple of bottles of marinade and I had my first spiedie experience. Now we regularly order Lupo's marinade from Amazon. We've tried the brands we can buy locally and they just aren't as good as the original!

review/text: Lupo's, the Cortese Restaurant, and the people.<br /><br />These guys are 100% correct, for making Spiedies, this Lupo's Marinade is #1!<br /><br />The other thing I remember about Lupo's, there was always a crowd, and it didnt<br />take long for this country boy to get addicted to chicken and pork Spiedies.<br /><br />I've tried to duplicate this stuff... gave up. I tried using the State Fair<br />marinade its a reasonable substitute, but this sauce from Lupo's is just magic.<br />Does for a Spiedie what Chiavetta's does for grilled chicken and pork. Awesome!

I happen to have had a partial bottle of Tropicana and I couldn't tell the difference between the two. The only one difference I can find is the Florida natural growers orange juice cost more than Tropicana does. That's my fault not the sellers for not dividing 12-46 ounce bottles into the total selling price-almost 4 bucks a bottle

I cannot find these bones in Pet stores, the only other place that I was able to find them was in our local grocery store, but they were pretty expensive. Both of my dogs teeth have been very healthy since using these bones. I would highly recommend them!

review/summary: Not a real Cream Cracker!
review/text: I have eaten cream crackers for 20 years in Mexico and Brazil. Since coming to the US I have been forced to eat these horrible little dry crackers they sell here.  So when I saw these "Cream Crackers" on Amazon, I was overjoyed.  To my utter disappointment these crackers are not anything like the cream crackers I have eaten in central and south america.  These crackers are extremely dry and bland.  They taste like you took an unsalted three day old dry biscuit and compressed it into a cracker.  There not light and flaky like the cream crackers I have eaten for 20 years.  What a disappointment!  I also tried the Jacob's brand and they are just as bad.  Both are made in the UK, so that might explain it.  You will find Mexican food restaurants and Brazilian food restaurants, because they know what taste good. But you will never find a England food restaurant. Maybe it is because they don't know how to cook.  They certainly do not know how to make a cream cracker!

I like that there are six small pouches rather than one big one, so that I know the tea won't go stale before I can use it all.<br /><br />The leaves are definitely the highly prized top buds, and is "single-source" as the package info states (not blended with cheaper teas from other countries). You cannot over-brew this tea. It doesn't become bitter or acidic if you accidentally leave it brewing too long.<br /><br />So far, I've only had it hot but can tell it will also make a great iced tea.

By purchasing their products, you will not only be indulging in the ultimate tea-drinker's experience, you'll also be helping a multitude of award-winning non-profit programmes instituted by Dilmah's enlightened management. There should be more products like this. Do yourself a favour and buy some today.

review/text: First off, the tea i received was also very fine cut tea, of average quality. In my opinion the red canned Dilmah Supreme is better than this.<br /><br />I might be able to explain why there are different opinions regarding this product. I have bought dilmah tea for many years at a local Mediterranean store. about three years ago they sold the identical green box with the same fine cut leaves in a vacuum packed bag. then the product changed to a better quality course leaf tea, but the box was nearly identical except for a cellophane pane to show the tea leaves and cellophane bag. then dilmah seemed to stop distributing their Ceylon tea, and only marketed their flavor teas of all things. so i turned to amazon for tea.<br /><br />so its possible they are distributing both forms at different times, since it seems they are a bit schizophrenic about their marketing.<br /><br />for the record i bought mine in Dec 2009.

review/summary: Dilmah's Excellent Tea
review/text: I first tasted Dilmah 5 years ago at a luxury hotel in Singapore.<br />The bouquet, taste and after-taste of the tea were superb.<br />I was reminded of the Darjeeling tea I had tasted at the London home of an Indian diplomat over 30 years ago.<br />Of course the two are quite different teas, but their subtlety is rarely found in mass-market products.<br /><br />Dilmah tea is not a "bold" tea - so don't expect a PG Tips kick or the almost as robust Typhoo taste (both teas top their class).<br />In fact, I prefer my morning Dilmah brew with only about half a teaspoon of leaves steeped for 6 to 8 minutes in freshly boiled filtered water. It brings out the deeper flavors of the leaves. (P.S. - preheat the cup)<br />Later in the day, a full teaspoon brewed for a shorter time hits the spot.<br />I am enjoying this worldly indulgence while it still pleases, for my meditations keep taking me to a place where desire is absent and the Silence of being reigns.

I am so pissed that I have bought 6 packs of this and it costs 3 times as much as the regular Red Label tea, which tastes much better.  I won't buy it again, at least from this seller.

review/summary: average quality CTC tea
review/text: I had great expectations when buying this tea. I have never tried loose leaf Dilmah tea before but I remember very well that wonderful distinctive taste of paper-bag packed Dilmah tea I enjoyed somewhere in the mid 1990th.  First disappointment, it is not loose leaf tea at all. It is minced leaf tea, not loose leaf tea. I guess they sell as "loose leaf" the same stuff they pack into paper bags. May be it is more convenient and more profitable for the company but I would not be surprised if somebody sue Dilmah (or Amazon? or "middle-man" unitybrandsgroup.com?) for the false advertising since there is no any single mention in the web-site or  on the package that this is CTC tea, and not loose leaf as boldly stated everywhere. Secondly, regarding the taste, there is no resemblance with that exceptional "mid 1990th" Dilmah. Now, I would say this is rather average quality CTC tea, sorry if I am saying something unpleasant.  The way I make it is traditional, one tea-spoon of tea per approx. 250 ml of boiling water in ceramic  teapot, and sit for 3-5 min.

review/text: Occasionally I have a more refined tea for an afternoon treat, however, for my everyday tea this beats anything, in flavor and price,that I can find in the USA. This was my everyday tea in Australia where there is an abundance of teas to select from. Put yourself on the list to have it auto delivered you will never want to run out of this tea...of course you need to be a tea drinker.

review/summary: My favorite new House Tea
review/text: Because you need something for everyday use.  This may not be the most awesome tea in the world - I noticed some of the reviewed were confused by the rave reviews.  What's great about this tea is that it is nostalgic, tastes like the tea we all remember from the 70's before Lipton took over the market share.  Also this tea is consistently good.<br /><br />The leaves are small. If you steep it too long it can get a bitter taste. Combat that by drinking it with milk and raw sugar as we did in Sri Lanka in the 1970's.<br /><br />For the price, this is a much better tea than anything I've found in my local supermarket.

review/text: Having failed to find a new source for my favorite Ceylon tea, Bogawantalawa Golden Valley, since moving to another state, I tried this Dilmah product, since I find their teabags very acceptable.<br /><br />It certainly wasn't dust, as one reviewer found, but the same cut as most other Ceylon and Indian teas I've bought over the years, readily dealt with by my (English) tea-strainers.<br /><br />This brews to a very good cuppa, fragrant, gentle on the palate, and sustains its flavor down to the bottom of the pot. Just a little bit short of top rating.

review/summary: a real tea deal
review/text: I used to buy Ceylon labeled tea exported from middle eastern countries <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZMY">Ahmad 500g Loose Ceylon Tea, 1.23-Ounce Packet (Pack of 4)</a> for around $12 per kilo, only to later learn about high mountain genuine (lion&sword seal) Ceylon from Sri Lanka.  Being able to buy the real thing on Amazon for $20 per kilo was an amazing find for me, as I brew a Gallon per day using a drip style coffee maker.  Only 1g per cup is needed here, not the typical 2g per cup you may need with cheaper loosely packed leafy Ceylons, so each box can yeild over a hundred 8oz cups of tea - as no leaf rinsing is needed.<br />This is NOT some low quality crushed leaf dust, just a fine packed leaf that requires a paper filter to brew to yield a crystal clear amber tea - don't use a hole steeper - only a fine screen will do.  This is an affordable leaf type especially for ice tea lovers.  This malty neutral pH tea, combines well with fruit, spices, citrus, and even milk.<br />UPDATE:  I'm just about to reorder and wanted to share that drip method ice tea *makers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDZWSG">Mr. Coffee TM3-2W 3-Quart Iced Tea Maker</a> like me - can save even more money by using only 1/2g per cup - and you will still get a dark amber full flavor tea.  So for every gallon (16 cups) I brew, I use just 8g of this tea leaf, with 16x yellow 1g Splenda packets, and get perfect lightly sweet sugar free tea every time!  That gets my cost per large 8oz cup of fresh brewed no preservative iced tea down under 10ï¿½.  Flavor with a tablespoon of cranberry or grapefruit juice for an extra kick.  This tea the best balance of quality and afford ability.  I have tried other Dilmah teas including; Ran Watte, Uda Watte, Supreme, Earl Grey, and these little blue boxes are the only ones worth reordering.

review/summary: Is this the same tea as others reviewed?
review/text: I have to wonder what the other reviewers are talking about. The tea I received was packaged as described but consisted of tea dustings -- the dust left over after everything else is gone. I use FINE mesh teaballs and this tea dust just goes right through. The bottom of the cup is covered with it and you get to drink the dust as well.<br /><br />Even then, it is possible to get a decent tea from dustings (from The Book of Tea) but not with this stuff. It makes a weak, thin tea, no mater how long you steep it.<br /><br />There was not a single tea leaf in the first package I opened and spread out to look at after I got over the shock of having a bag of dust, just a couple small pieces and a lot of dustings.<br /><br />Hence, I really wonder about the other reviews, meaning what I got is NOT what they got, but it is what Amazon shipped to me. This stuff is junk.<br /><br />By the way, I have 12 different loose teas in the house at any time, with Keemun generally my favorite and Kenilworth my favorite Ceylon. There are other single source teas from Sri Lanka and there are other pure Ceylon teas. Tea of Life is one such. I've bought a lot of loose tea from tea shops and Amazon but never got anything this bad before. I threw it out.

review/summary: Kome-Pletely Miss Leading REVIEWS
review/text: Im with the one reviewer who opened the pkg and said WHAT LEAF ? first off, this is a CTC ( cut tear curl) method ....like lipton uses, theres NO LEAF left in this, its all very small 1/8 in peices. With that said, there is a difference between bad tea and delicate tea. This tea has flavor, but its delicate,<br />and certainly wont brew any dark colored cupa tea, NO WAY JOSE ! can it be considered a good morning wake up tea? only by those that have NEVER had a strong cup of tea...caffeine content is weak, but it does works well as a good cheep base for afternoon tea when mixed with flavored green ( citrus, berry etc )Caffine cravers wont get any more kick from this than a green tea, and it wont satisfy anyone looking for a " robust, strong, flavorful, malty, aromatic, etc " like all the other reviewers have listed....only thing i can say is either they got another tea than i did, OR they are just plain NUTZ, and/or work for DILMAH

review/summary: good product, good seller
review/text: After trying the manufacturer's Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products. I really enjoy macadamia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try. This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />The macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container. There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices. When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture. This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer. I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product. There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is "made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's."  As a side note, if you are allergic to cashews, I have not found one of Artisana's butters to be absent of cashews.<br /><br />Artisana products are delicious and simple in their composition.  Since purchasing the macadamia nut butter, I have sampled the pecan, cashew and walnut butters.  With the exception of the cashew butter, I would buy them all again. For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets. They are tasty, natural and unique.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.<br /><br />A note on another place to buy this product, iherb.com.  I turn to iherb.com with frequency to purchase Artisana products.  Sometimes Amazon has the best price and sometimes iherb.com has the best price.  iherb.com has free shipping over a certain threshold and offers thousands upon thousands of natural and organic food products. If interested in trying iherb, you can use my code LEK375 for a five or ten dollar discount depending on order size.<br /><br />Also, Artisana's nut butters are typically offered in 8 oz and 16 oz containers and price is usually about 8 to 11 dollars a jar with the 8 dollars typical of an 8 oz jar and 11 dollars typical of a 16 oz jar.  If you are seeing sellers charging more than this (16 dollars for one 8 oz jar is price gouging), keep looking.

There is a somewhat pungent quality to the mustard that while it smells somewhat unpleasant when you first open it, it cooks extremely well. The taste is something you can't replace.

This may be "organic" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.

review/summary: does not look anything like its picture. not spicy at all.
review/text: i ordered this product along with a pound of chipotle peppers.<br />they arrived soon enough, well packed, in unmarked bags.<br />i had to guess which was which.<br /><br />the aji amarillos that i know are bright yellow or orange<br />and very hot and spicy, with a fruity, fragrant flavor.<br />these arrived dark brown and dusty looking.<br />they are not at all spicy<br />but they do have a nice bitterish flavor.<br />they are closer to paprika than hot peppers.<br />you will like them if you don't need the heat.<br /><br />i roasted about a quarter pound in the oven<br />and powdered them in my coffee grinder.<br />i've been sprinkling it over my rice, pasta, salad and vegetable dishes.<br />i'm  enjoying what i have<br />but i will not order it again.<br /><br />peace to everybody.

review/text: I bought two types of peppers from your store and when they arrived there were not labeled. How do I know which pepper is in each bag?

review/summary: Great chiles, great value
review/text: I've had mixed reactions to some of the Angelina's Gourmet products I've purchased.  However, these dried chiles are superb.  They came unlabelled in a sealed thick  clear plastic bag.  They were fresh and pliable and perfectly dried with an outstanding flavor.  I'll definitely be buying more of Angelina's dried chiles.  With this quality and very low price, it easily gets my 5 star rating.
