review/summary: Very nice rich roast
review/text: This came to me at a very attractive price. Quite bold almost as full bodied as a French Roast. I like Cameron's Gold Cup Blend more than I like their Intense French Roast.  This coffee can hold it own against several much more expensive S******k's blends. Especially nice if grinding is done right before brewing. I'll be ordering this again.

review/text: I purchased the coffee to compare with the organic coffee beans I have been enjoying for at least 6 years because Gold Cup was less expensive and the rave reviews.  I did not expect the rich flavor--wow.  I am sold. I signed up for the automatic shipments.  My only problem is I can't figure out how to change my shipping date since I will run out of beans before the date originally chosen! A telephone call to Amazon should fix that.<br />Judy

review/summary: Good coffee, great price.
review/text: I bought this coffee to try, strictly based on price per pound.  Was sick of paying $8 for not even a pound at the store.  For years I bought 8 OClock brand because it was the cheapest per pound on the shelf & I do like it, but then it started going up in price so I thought if I'm paying almost what the "gourmet" coffees cost, why not try some of them? And so began a quest to find gourmet flavor at middle class working stiff prices! So I searched good old Amazon (they NEVER let me down).  Found this brand in Gold Cup, Woods & Water & Kona. With "subscribe & save", it worked out to around $8 a pound, so I subscribed to each flavor & so far so good!  Haven't tried the Kona yet, but I really like the other 2.  I like my coffee on the weaker side, so I set my Capresso to grind for 8 cups but I add 10 cups' worth of water & it comes out like I like it.  So in addition to saving money per pound, I'm using less because it's a stronger brew than 8 OClock...double bonus!<br />I like the subscribe & save, too, because you save a couple of bucks plus you don't have to remember to order AND you get free shipping even if your order is under $25...how can you not love that!<br />Cheers! I raise my Gold Cup to you on this fine New England morn. :-)

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Olio Santo Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a highly rated California olive oil.  I love it on salads and use it for pizza--as an ingredient in the crust and as the "sauce" (add minced garlic to a couple of tablespoons of Olio Santo, let sit for an hour or two, and brush over the crust before adding other toppings).  Also great with pasta in place of a marinara or other sauce.  It is a flavorful olive oil, so you might want to choose a less-flavorful oil for sauteeing when using another main sauce.  Great for dipping or any time you want great olive oil flavor!  Stonehouse makes a standard EVOO that is also very good, but Olio Santo is their star.  Makes a great gift when paired with Stonehouse Balsamic Vinegar or White Balsamic Vinegar.

review/summary: Delicious... one of our new staples!
review/text: I purchased these mushrooms for the first time recently and they have quickly become one of our home cooking staples. The mushrooms are easily and quickly re-hydrated and have a rich, earthy flavor. We love them!<br /><br />The instructions say that water, stock, milk or wine can be used to reconstitute the dried mushrooms - we've just used water so far and the resulting liquid (after the mushrooms are re-hydrated) is very flavorful, as well. We use that in our cooking too, as they suggest... more robust mushroom goodness.<br /><br />Tip: the instructions say to simmer the mushrooms in 1 cup of liquid for 20 minutes to rehydrate. This works fine, but doesn't result in much liquid. I use 1 1/2 to 2 cups of water to rehydrate them so I have more delicious mushroom broth to work with. The extra liquid doesn't seems to take away from the mushroom flavor at all.

review/summary: Not my Passion...
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5Q76">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Tea, Hand-Picked Tropical Passion, 20-Count Tins (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />Ahhhhh, the aroma of the tea in the tin is so very pleasing - strong and fruity - it truly does take you to a tropical paradise. I just knew that I was going to love this Passion tea. Maybe more than I love the Tazo Passion - but alas, No. I loved the Tazo Passion from first taste - fruity, just enough sweetness - the perfect warmth and flavor for my mid-day drink at work and on weekends at home to relax. Just a Tazo loose-leaf tea bag and hot water - no sugar needed, good to the last warm sip. I even always keep my tea bag in the cup and never get a bitter taste; just more good fruitiness. Can't do that with the Coffee Bean Passion. I knew about the possible bitter taste from reading the instructions on the can, so I was prepared to make the adjustment. I steeped the first cup for a short time, savored the aroma before my first sip, but all I got was bitterness. It left a bad taste in my mouth - maybe I steeped it too long. It was a few days before I attempted this Passion again. When I did I decided to time the steep - just 3 minutes and immediately remove the tea bag. It appeared strong, smelled great, but still the bitter taste. So I decided to get comfy and drink it anyway - maybe the taste will grow on me. No. I added some lemon and a touch of sugar to make it tolerable for my taste buds. Tolerable, but not my passion. I didn't pay much attention to the ingredients list before ordering: black tea, malva flower, marigold flower, natural and artificial flavorings - its a black tea blend - not an herbal infusion tea. Makes a big difference. I so wanted to like it, but for my taste and preferences - this tea has nothing on Tazo. I guess I was expecting something different. Its probably the black tea that my taste buds disapprove, as well as the artificial flavorings, I suspect. I have 3 tins of it and I'm probably going to drink it because I hate to waste food - but I do not look forward to it. May be good as an iced tea, with sugar and lemon. Or maybe one of my friends will like it - if so, I will gift the remaining tins with love. Sorry to disappoint - just not for me.

review/summary: Yummiest European chocolate bar
review/text: Wispa is hands down my favorite chocolate bar. It is light and airy, made of quality milk chocolate; a simple yet yummy and satisfying chocolate bar. Unfortunately, just recently, Hershey signed an exclusive distribution contract with Cadbury, and chose not to allow exportation of many of the awesome European chocolate products to American retailers anymore. For shame on Hershey! And those of us who do not like wax in our chocolate, have to pay premium prices to get the good stuff. Definitely thankful for the smaller resellers out there on Amazon. I did a lot of researching; pricing out who had the best deal for Wispa bars. Note: never pay more than $1.99/bar (that includes shipping) but hopefully you can find it as cheap as $1.20 (depending how many you are willing to buy to get the deal). I purchased 12 bars for $1.50/each plus $3.15 shipping which came out to $1.20 a bar! The shipper included an ice pack to make sure the chocolate didn't melt or bloom. I am definitely planning on buying more from them when we eat up what we got.

The box seems about the same size as always, but the tiny little downsized cakes just shake around in it. I hope the stock holders are happy this year, because this is the last box I will ever buy. Even at two boxes for the price of one, these pint-sized cakes are no bargain. If they down-size them again, shoppers will have to buy two boxes to put together one little cake. The cakes are delicious, but barely big enough to taste anymore. There are still some generic companies out there making full-sized cakes, and, in light of this ridiculous miniaturizing, I would wholeheartedly recommend them over Hostess.

review/summary: Buddy Dog Biscuits
review/text: Our newest rescue dog, Harry, a 2 year old lab mix, has had a hard life before his new life with us. Limping, we discovered that he had been previously hit by a vehicle requiring more surgery to live pain free. Life in a shelter made him fearful of eating without worrying about other animals (even our gentle cats) stealing food from him. Most treats he was given were just dropped from his mouth. Since he was so underweight, I searched for healthy treats that he would actually eat. He loves Buddy Biscuits and has even learned to give his paw to get them! I am happy I have found a healthy treat to feed our Harry, and our 9 year old border collie mix who has never turned down any treat. But also, I am happy to support a company that makes all natural dog treats.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: Buddy got hooked on these Buddy biscuits when his "aunt" gave them to him for Christmas.  We have been unable to find this flavor in our area, so we were thrilled to get them through Amazon.  The only thing we didn't like is that they were priced in such a way that we were JUST short of getting free shipping, which would have been a great help.  The product is awesome, and absolutely Buddy's favorite treat.

review/summary: A Great First Time Green Tea
review/text: I bought this at Costco, as I had just recently heard about the benefits of green tea. I let it sit in a corner for a long time, but then, with it being the only drink I had on hand for an all-nighter cleaning my house for a visit from the in-laws the next day, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've never been a tea drinker (even ice tea), but I have to say that this stuff was excellent. It struck me as tasting a lot like ice tea but without that certain something that always kept me from being a big fan of it. I don't know where this stuff stands compared to other brands of green tea, but at very least, it's a good stepping stone for those of us whose favorite drink had previously been a soft drink of some sort.

review/text: Got this at Costco three months ago because it was cheaper than Lipton and we go through green tea. It tastes too much like mineral water with a slight tea flavor. And it has a bad after taste. We have been drinking it off and on since we bought it and are still not half way through the package of 35. Not recommended.

Dates of candy are also wildly varied - bubble tape to Charleston chews to things we couldn't even identify.  Still glad I bought it - made for a good time, though don't expect the ultimate in qualty; some of it is 30 years old after all.

review/text: My cat is a very picky eater, and I went through so many different brands and flavors, and this turned out to be her favorite.  Every cat has their own preferences, so best bet is to sample a few before buying a bulk pack like this.  Tried Natural Balance based on a recommendation for a healthier food with natural ingredients, not packed with fillers and byproducts.

review/summary: Major Disappointment
review/text: I've been a "connoisseur" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.<br /><br />The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture.  It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.<br /><br />The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.<br /><br />On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.<br /><br />I would not order these again.

The chocolate is dark chocolate, not milk chocolate, and it does appear to have a higher cocoa butter content to make it more firm on the moist apricot, but I would not describe it as "waxy".<br />I highly recommend these as an occasional indulgence.

review/text: Although these chocolates can be listed as "low carb", they do contain some sugar. I try to avoid all sugar so if I had known that, I probably wouldn't have ordered them.

They aren't too sweet or bitter. Very creamy. I wouldn't hesitate to get these again for either my self or as a gift.

review/summary: Bzzzzz...
review/text: I bought this tea because when summer rolls around, I am a little puddle of miserable. Seriously, my allergies attack with everything they've got and there are days where I simply cannot go outside. Last summer, I discovered green tea seemed to help with some of the symptoms, as did local honey. So when I spotted Bee Pollen Matcha, I had to try it, if only to keep on hand for when I make smoothies all summer. Mmmm smoothies. A little frozen fruit, a splash of tea, and I am in heaven. This is why I bought a blender!<br /><br />This is most likely a case of mind over matter, but the first few sips of this tasted like honey to me. I don't know if it actually does, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but it tastes a touch like honey. Kind of like how Honeybee from DavidsTea tastes like...well, how you imagine a bee would taste. All bzzzz and the like. But it is sweet enough and flavorful enough that while I was drinking it at work, I kept reaching for it. I tend to place my travel mug on the corner of the desk and forget it's there until I lose my voice.<br /><br />This matcha is also a good addition to my smoothies, since it provides calcium and protein. As someone on a dairy-free diet, the ability to get calcium in my tea is very important to me. A friend of mine says that "drinking tea for the health benefits is like having sex for the exercise," but after a summer of allergies made manageable by local honey and green tea, I'm a believer. Do I think tea is going to magically make me skinner? No. Damn it. But I do firmly believe that teas like this matcha can help with things like allergies and vitamin deficiencies. If nothing else, this tea keeps me away from carbonated drinks like Coke and Dr. Pepper....mmm, Dr. Pepper. It also helps me cut back on sugary fruit juices and heart attack causing energy drinks. Matcha is all I need to get that rush to help me make it through my day. And this particular matcha is a tasty, tasty option. I love it! A sweet green tea that makes you feel like you're drinking something that will give you superpowers? That also helps you get your vitamins and bounce around your office like you just had a large can of Red Bull? Sign me up!

review/summary: great price for a quality treat
review/text: I ordered 2 bags, since the price was really good (8 bucks per bag).  This treat is made by a high quality dog food manufacturer, so I know my dogs are getting something healthy.  One bag had expired recently, and another bag was expiring soon (maybe that's why the price was so good).  But that didn't bother me.  This isn't yogurt or milk.  It was in sealed bag, and it look fine.  Some of it had turned to powder (probably from being jostled around during shipping, but that's no different than a bag of potato chips).<br /><br />The pieces are shaped differently; they are small enough to feed to my dogs whole.  If I try to break them apart, some splinter into small pieces, but others break easily (some shapes break cleaner than others).<br /><br />Both of my Chihuahuas love these treats.  The treats have a little fish odor to them, but not bad.  When I run out, and if the price is still right, I would buy these treats again (because they are a healthy, quality treat).

They also crumble very easily, and can be used because of that for training.  By the way, the full line of Evo dog food itself is just as good!

review/text: I love these. Lately I have been trying different types of spicy peanuts (Da Bomb, Dave's Burning) and these are just as good as the rest. Not as hot as Da Bomb, and not as peanut buttery like Dave's(least heat of the three). I will definitely be getting more...mainly because the other two aren't on amazons Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />I love the Habanero! (also try 100% Pain Garlic hot sauce---delicious)

review/summary: Not for wimps
review/text: These peanuts are pretty good, they have plenty of heat so if you are a chili head you'll like them. They are flavored with dehydrated habaneros so you obviously aren't going to get the same flavor you would from a salsa or other dish that uses fresh peppers, but the flavor is there, not just heat.<br /><br />If these are too hot for you, you can tone them down by adding a small hand full of them to a can of honey roast peanuts. The heat goes well with the sweet, my GF can tolerate them mixed like this.<br /><br />As a side bonus, when you finish the nuts, there will be a good amount of powdered death left in the bottom of the can. That stuff is awesome mixed with salt and used on french fries and popcorn. I'm sure there are other uses, but those are the only 2 I've tried so far.

review/summary: Excellent for my senior cats!
review/text: I can't guarantee for everyone, but this food really works for my tough to feed seniors. As cats age their renal systems begin to gradually fail. My experience with cats in various stages of renal failure is to feed them whatever is palatable enough to keep their weight up. Not give weird diets that restrict protein. The "renal" diets that many large companies have been trying to push totally ignore the fact that a cat in any stage of renal failure will fail faster if losing weight due to unpalatable "renal" or low protein foods. Our renal tests here confirm that they are very early stage after 3 years of solely worrying about weight loss. My 3 cats are all 18 and one of the three had improved numbers for her last BUN last month and the other 2 low 40s with no crystals. We still experience chronic UTIs with one, but that's always been an issue for her, her weight is incredible and she bounces back immediately from them.<br /><br />As for the smell of poo that some people complain about in these high quality foods, really! If you don't like smelly poo, DO NOT have cats.

review/summary: Good tasting butter cream frosting
review/text: You have to add an entire stick of melted butter and some milk to this frosting mix, so it's a butter cream frosting.  There's no shortage of fat in it either, thanks to the butter.<br /><br />The frosting hardens when cooled, and it's not very fluffy, so so expect any big swirls on the top of your cake.  Otherwise, the frosting tastes good and serves its purpose.<br /><br />I won't buy it again though because it's too expensive.  You'd might as well make frosting from scratch.

This one is so delicious EVERYONE at the parties who've had it, love it. Even people who are used to the regular off the shelf kind. It doesn't get very fluffy, as another reviewer said, but it will harden in the fridge. The taste is well worth the lack of "height" on your cakes/cupcakes/cookies.

review/summary: Love Lil' Shuga!
review/text: I love this product! I've tried so many different sweetners and they all tasted awful, or left some after taste in my mouth after eating. Lil Shuga tastes great! I use it for everything, hot or cold beverages, coffee, tea, milk, you name it, I've used it and the taste is so smooth and yet so sweet you need to use very little to make anything taste great. It is definitiely worth the price since you can use it for so many things and lasts so long! I've tried baking with it and substituting sugar for Lil Shuga has cut down my calorie intake a great deal, without giving up on the great sweet taste. I am extremely pleased with this product and definitely recommend it!!

review/text: These dried mangos are wonderful.  I use them as a natural way to get something in my tummy at the start of my day. They are so much more tasty than the kind available in local groceries, and they're more moist, too.  Watching TV in the evening, my 8-year-old and I WILL tease and bargain and jostle for the very last of the bag if it's even mildly close to empty (actually I'm thrilled that she loves them, too.)!  She'll even choose these over some sugary, empty-calorie dessert. To make a sweet deal even better, these scrumptious morsels get to me in 2 days flat, which is quicker than I can get my spouse to remember to pick up a package of those sold locally!  These are seeeeeeriously good!

review/summary: Long Lasting Fruit
review/text: Dried fruits can be traced back to 4000 years BC in Mesopotamia. The dehyrated fruits maintain their nutrition and have the bonus feature of longevity. Fresh fruit in our house only stays fresh a few days before overripening. This bag of dried apricots with the easy seal top can sit on a shelf for weeks maintaining freshness, taste, and nutrition. I noticed that the source of the dried apricots in this product is Turkey.<br /><br />I enjoy the taste and texture of these dried apricots and don't find them overly dry. Quality of each piece is consistent, though occasionally one comes across a piece that might be a little drier than the others.  Apricots are a soure of antioxidants, potassium, and fiber. I just noticed that the bag suggests refrigerating after opening for best quality; guess I'd better start doing that now.

review/summary: Great for salads, tasty and wonderful to cook with
review/text: In the last year we've been adapting to eating Gluten Free.  Receiving a Celiac diagnosis in the family caused us to eat lots of salads as we worked out our other options.  One of the things we missed was croutons.  We tried several kinds and didn't like them much.  Once we discovered these we have been incredibly happy with them.  We'll grill chicken and have a tasty grilled Chicken Salad with these croutons and some Walden Farms dressing and it's a very satisfying meal.<br /><br />These croutons taste great, are crunchy and flavorful, and best of all they freeze well.  We buy several bags and keep them on hand, defrosting them as we go through them.  Biting into them, they have a firm texture but not soft or mushy.  At the same time they are not too hard, really just about right.<br /><br />One added bonus is that we save the crumbs at the bottom of the bag and use them when we want to cook recipes that need bread crumbs.  Chicken Parmesan and so forth.  These really work well to give us a Gluten Free option when we want that crispy breaded flavor.  We have found really great tasty items by sampling the New Grains line of products.  It's helped us deal with the difficult challenges that come along with the necessity of eating Gluten Free.<br /><br />5 stars, we love these and tend to eat them pretty quickly

review/summary: Don't loose your Gripz!
review/text: I love these little handy Gripz snack packs.  The Keebler Variety Box comes with three types:  Cheez It's, Nacho Cheese & Chips Deluxe.  Each pouch contains mini versions of your favorite snacks and I do mean mini.  Each pouch contains easily 5-6 large handfuls of snack.  Or if you are like me, 10-12 small handfuls of snack.  These are great for portion control - keeps you from eating a whole box of the scale versions. You can spread them out and make them last. They are handy for those on the go or for ones lunch.  I grab one when I head out for the day.  They are perfect for car trips b/c of the size.  Imagine a bag of sunflower seeds - these are a little shorter but about the same width.  This makes them easy to hold onto while snacking.  The cheez-it's look like super tiny oyster crackers.  They are not triangular like their larger predecessor. Oddly enough - the Nacho Cheez is in the shape of a Cheez It and has a spicy nacho cheese it flavor.  My favorite out of the three is the Chips Deluxe.  Those lil cookie bites are freakin awesome.  Imagine the size of a chocholate chip.  That's about how big each mini cookie is and they taste just like the scale version.  If you purchase these in a grocery chain like Kroger, you'll expect to pay about $6.50 a box.  Amazon has a pretty good price on these - especially if you opt in to the subscribe and save program.  At that price with the free shipping alone, it's worth it.  Whether you are a busy mom looking for easy lunch solutions for your kids.  A hungry dad who likes to snack between meals.  A road traveler who is looking for something handy to snack and drive with at the same time.  Or a Granny looking to satisfy a sweet tooth, I recommend giving these a try.  I think you just might like them. Whatever you do, don't lose your GRIPZ!

review/summary: Great Size for Toddlers
review/text: I personally don't care for cheese crackers, but my daughter loves them.  At 16 months, she's getting better with gold fish, but doesn't always chew them well.  I love the size of these, as I don't have to worry how well she's chewed them, and like another reviewer mentioned, a box of just the cheez-it are expensive at the store.  I thought this was a great price (on sale and save more with subscribe and save) and liked the variety (I don't know that I'll feed my daughter too many of the chocolate chip, but she loves the grahm craker ones also).  They are also pretty low in sugar (and she only a partial package as a treat at the end of dinner).
