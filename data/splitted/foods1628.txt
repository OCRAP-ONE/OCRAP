review/text: I ordered the flowers for my friend's 60th birthday in Albuquerque. She was thrilled and couldn't believe how fresh the flowers were and what a bright happy bouuqet it was. She sent photos to me 5 days after she received them and the flowers looked great to me. I will use this service again.

review/summary: A beautiful bouquet at a real savings
review/text: I accidentally sent this bouquet to myself instead of to my mother in law due to hasty pointing and clicking. However, I can now comment first hand on the quality of the product. The delivery was quick, the packaging superb, the quality of the flowers outstanding.  The bouquet that arrived at my house looked just like the picture - colorful and the same flower selection including Gerbera daisies, with their stems sheathed in plastic to keep them upright. I kept the bouquet on my table for 10 days before it showed any signs of withering. I highly recommend this item for anyone wishing to send an affordable fresh flower bouquet.

review/text: I sent these to my mom for MDay and visited her 3 days later.  I saw for myself the flowers she received and they were just OK, the kind you buy at your local grocery store.  The price is reasonable from this seller so I guess you get what you pay for.  I would use them again for your everyday "thinking of you" flowers but NOT for special occasions.

review/text: I'm not given to adjectival extravagances but simply must go there with regard to these flowers, the seller's packaging and the speed of delivery.<br /><br />I ordered the flowers for my girlfriend on the night of 10/10 and the flowers got there today, 10/12. Wow, utterly amazing! The packaging, my girlfriend said, was extremely good: very heavy duty box, flowers well protected, and there was an icepack in the box to help keep flowers cool and fresh. Then we come to the flowers themselves. All I can say is that my girlfriend gushed; said that the color combinations were beautiful, the flowers were in perfect shape without a hint of wilting, browning, or trauma of any kind. She absolutely loved them.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these flowers, this seller, enough. I'm exceedingly impressed and WILL buy from them again!!!

review/text: I ordered these on 2/14 in the afternoon.  They were delivered 2/15 before noon.  I almost fell out of my chair!  My mother called and said that they were extra-nice blooms and that they looked like a premium bouquet, not something standard that you'd get from a carryout florist or anything, but extra nice and almost exotically big blossoms.  I've never heard her rave about flowers so much and I've sent her flowers on lots of occasions.  I'm doing this one again.  Beats spending $75 or more on something she is not as happy about.

The colors are so pretty and bright.  A couple came with little mesh pouches on them.  Once you take them off, they open up really big.  They are beautiful.  I got them on Tuesday and they look as nice today as they did then."  She wrote this on Friday.  I definitely will buy these again.

review/summary: Pretty good flowers though not quite up to florist quality boquet
review/text: The rub of course is for a comparably sized florist boquet you will spend close to $100 delivered.<br /> This company will have the flowers delivered for $35. So thats why I gave them 5*'s, the price. No the flowers arent hand delivered in a pretty vase, they come in a box and the person has to arrange them.<br /> But the flowers I gave were very fresh, the packaging was excellent and came with a cold pack to keep the flowers fresh.<br /> I have ordered with ProFlowers before and this company here on Amazon is 10x better. The ProFlowers werent sent next day for the base shipping fee, these flowers were. The box didnt include a cold pack to keep the flowers fresh, these did. The ProFlowers only lasted a few days, these flowers have lasted a week and still look good.<br /> Also these flowers were more abundant and had a lower price than ProFlower flowers.<br /> So this company is the new winner of this market. And this particular boquet was very nice to boot.

review/summary: The BEST sesame snack I have ever had!
review/text: Hands-down, the absolute best, sesame snack I have ever had...<br />Being a physician, I hate having too many carbs & fats, and so avoid MOST candy/snack items...<br />These packs are excellent: each pack has 4 thin sesame wafers; so you can easily control your portion size (I use a ziplock bag to save the rest, for eating the next day...). Very crisp, fresh taste, NOT super-sweet. It is more sesame, less sugar...<br />I tried the sezme sesame snack (a different brand sold by amazon also): the sezme ones are MORE sugary (more caramel); these sesa-kiss ones are MUCH better...<br />Hope this helps...

review/text: I have this item on "subscribe and save" since it is so good.  Tastes better than the sesame honey bars you can get in most natural food stores (the ones which come packaged in the plastic containers).  Just sweet enough, but not so sweet you feel like you have to brush your teeth after you eat them, like with candy bars.  Also, I like how they are individually packaged so they are easy to carry around and I don't have to worry about them getting stale.  Have them set up for delivery every three months, but they are now my snack of choice, so will probably be changing that to more frequent deliveries.

The only drawback that I had was having to eat this with braces on. I lost a bracket just by biting this. I had to be careful the next few bites. Overall, a great healthy snack.

review/text: I discovered this snack during a morning "coffee" run and enjoyed the taste but not the cost for an individual packet which is three thin layers of product.<br />I decided to try obtaining it on my own and was successful.<br /><br />You have to be lover of sesame seeds to enjoy this treat and the small amount of honey makes it particularly tasty. My only problem was that some of the were stuck together and if you have ever tried to pry dried honey wafers apart you know its almost impossible.  All and all, I am pleased with the taste, but also find that there were too many in the box (48 three layer packets) and my yen for the sesame sweet waned largely due to its availability.

review/summary: Freshly roasted, it is  wonderful coffee
review/text: I received a shipment from Peet's Coffee that included Cafe Domingo.  If you buy the coffee directly from Peet's they roast it just before they send it to you, and the roasting date is shown right on the bag.  Today is August 9th and the coffee I received today was roasted yesterday on the 8th.  Pretty darned fresh!!!  I made a pot of this coffee with a french press and it is ....wonderful.  This is a medium roast coffee, so if you are a dark roast fan, it may not be for you.  For people who enjoy a medium roast that has a nutty/toffee taste to it, you will probably like this coffee.<br /><br />I buy all kinds of stuff from Amazon, and in this case- if you want to experience this coffee at it's best, right after it has been roasted- you might consider going directly to the Peet's website and ordering it there.  If you join their coffee club, Peetnik's, you get discounts.<br /><br />While I am writing about Peet's, I will also mention that I really like their reasonably priced cafe style mugs.  A cup of Cafe Domingo in one of their mugs is a good start to the day. (And no, I do not work for Peet's, or in the food industry at all.  I just love their coffee!)

Now it is the Carroll Shelby Chili Kit.<br /><br />The hot version is not hot, just tasty. I use cubed beef chuck roast and ground beef. I also used just diced tomato and no tomato sauce.<br /><br />The gravey that comes from Shelby's spices would make shoe leather taste delicious. Add a little more water if you like a more liquid gravey, I do. Also, you probably don't need the masa included for thickening.<br /><br />Outstanding.

review/text: This is the 2nd bag of these candies I've ordered through amazon and they are still great. I remember enjoying original Peanut Chews from way back when I was a little nipper and I had really missed them. Now someone else is making them from the original recipe and packaging and they bring back a lot of good memories. This order was from a different amazon supplier but they came quickly and were well packaged, and they even cost less this time. Very pleased with deal.

review/summary: Great for quick, easy flavor bump
review/text: Tomato powder is fresh smelling and rich. I'm on a lower sodium diet so I add this to veggie chiles, couscous, risottos or soups made with low sodium bullion to bump up the flavor. Very convenient and available to use in smaller quantities than opening a can of tomato paste and having to figure out a use for the rest of the can before it spoils. Packaged in a tall, clear plastic spice bottle with screw top. Quick shipping from this seller as well.

review/summary: Try it in pizza cheese puck!
review/text: I originally bought tomato powder to use in making a low-carb pizza alternative.  I use fresh mozzarella (the moist kind), ground pizza spice (Kroger store brand), and onion and garlic powder.  Since the fresh mozz makes it too moist to begin with, using tomato paste just made it soggier.  Using powdered tomato is just the thing.  Assemble the ingredients in a pyrex dish and microwave it lightly covered till light brown, about 4-5 minutes; allow to cool for a few minutes and cut it into wedges.  All the pizza flavor with very few of the carbs.  That's why I got the tomato powder originally, but now I use it in salad dressings, tomato sauces (it makes them exTREEMEly tomato-y), and in cheese sauces over steamed broccoli, which it makes a little more like a rarebit.  By the bye, I don't know exactly how many carbs it has, but I stay in ketosis while eating it frequently, so I'm satisfied.  The only problem with it is I'm going through it so fast that I'll be out soon!  [Note: this review actually by Cindy's husband Jamie]

review/summary: Replicates that "just bathed" feel to your pet's fur.
review/text: My two little monsters are big shedders. Coupled with an unusually dry winter, the shedding was not only exacerbated, but my cats had also developed dry skin and dandruff. One of them, who liked to sit butt-first in front of the fireplace, ended up losing a few patches of fur on her back legs. I purchased a Vornado warm-air humidifier to combat the dry air (especially by the fireplace), which did seem to help somewhat, but as my little ones are both free to go outside during the daylight hours and I have no control over outside humidity, they were still being exposed to very dry air.<br /><br />I had previously tried using another skin and coat product for my cats (Tomlyn's Omega Power), but they had absolutely hated it, and refused to eat the food I mixed it with. Naturally, it was a huge surprise when I mixed the Shed-X into their wet food and they didn't seem to mind at all! It has the consistency of cooking oil (as opposed to Tomlyn's thick jelly) so evenly mixing it in with their food is very easy.<br /><br />It's now been three weeks since I first began using the product and the difference is amazing! I brushed them both and neither of them had much loose fur to lose - definitely not a typical occurrence for them! When they sit on our laps (or sleep in our clean laundry!) almost no fur is left behind on our clothes. The dandruff is gone, and their coats are so thick and soft - it literally feels like we just gave them a bath! My little girl still sports those patches on her legs, but her skin no longer feels papery and dry and she no longer over-bathes herself!<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who owns a cat!

review/text: This is the type of thing you don't want anyone to know about so you can hoard it all to yourself. But I must be charitable and let you in on a good thing. It has a very strong raspberry flavor which means you don't have to load up your toast or muffin. A little bit goes a long way. The label says 70% fruit and I believe it. Even with that it is noticeably sweet with a high sweetness sugar added. This goes good with chocolate as well. I put a little teaspoon full on a scoop of vanilla ice cream followed by fudge sauce. Great treat! You will not be disappointed if you give this as a gift, because it will be memorable for the lucky recipient. Only downside is the cost, but this is truly a unique product. Your taste buds will thank you.

review/text: I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product. So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!! This oil has a BITTER finish. Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable! Has the production changed? Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation? First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself.

review/summary: Pepperoni heaven
review/text: I just got my order today which consisted of two nice sticks. Not too thin, not too thick. Delivery was amazing. It came on the second estimated delivery date and the order was at a good price for what I got. The two sticks were well packaged and even included a scrumptious looking catalog.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to find stick pepperoni in the stores like I used to so to finally find someone who sells them in sticks, I was in heaven. This pepperoni was fantastic for several reasons. The sticks I used to buy in the stores which were greasy, as soon as you open these sticks they were were nice and dry. The outer covering, was welded onto the sticks unlike those long ago store bought sticks where you'd have to peel away the outer covering which came off looking like paper. I didn't have to peel these. These sticks were easy to cut, or as I like to do, just tear off a chunk. The best thing about these sticks whether you eat a small or large portion, it goes down easy and I didn't get any painful indigestion, or stomach pain. Looking at the ingredients on the package they're  the same as those sticks I can no longer find at the market, but in in much smaller quantities so there was just enough to flavor, but not enough overpower to the point of indigestion. With these, you're actually eating meat, not tasting  outer covering and they're filling. I'll really savor the second stick. The next time I have a craving for pepperoni in a stick, these are going to be what I choose as they put me in pepperoni heaven.

review/summary: Dark Snickers rules supreme!
review/text: Snickers candy bars are a hit for many reasons: thick, chewy texture; good chocolate presence; the multiplicity of flavors from caramel, nougat, peanuts, and - of course - chocolate.  But the Dark chocolate version is EVEN BETTER!  The more mature, serene, deeper flavor of the less-sweet dark chocolate perfectly complements the sweet fillings, providing a very satisfying mouth feel and long-lasting flavor.  While kids may not go for it, this surely is an adult candy bar that satisfies.  Unfortunately it is not readily available at most grocery stores and supermarkets, and when available, only individually at some drug and candy stores.  I sincerely hope Mars won't cease production and continue to make dark chocolate versions of their candy line available.

review/summary: Wrong bag pictured
review/text: Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula. Woops! So I went and bought the 15lb bag of Chicken and Rice and mix the Beef and Fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system.<br /><br />I can say that after we started feeding this to my pup, she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before. Also, Roshan's right about the fish breath! Ick.<br /><br />Overall, my dog has no issues with this formula, it's just stinky so I'll stick to Chicken and Rice after this bag is done.

review/summary: Best dog food.
review/text: Other than a few table scraps, Canidae is the only brand (dry and wet) we feed to our blk lab.  She's done excellent on it and has a very healthy and shinny coat.  People routinely comment how nice her coat looks, most even ask what we feed.  I sent a bag to my brother and he too noticed his dog's coat was healthier looking after a week or two.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Top dog food
review/text: We have tried other natural dog foods, but they all had grain fillers in them and while our dog liked some of them she never reacted the way she does with this natural no grain dog food.  She can hardly wait at feeding time and she gobbles it down and licks the bowl clean.  She seems to be more energetic since eating Canidae no grain.  I doubt that we will ever change.

review/text: I have a 4 year old mastiff who, despite his tough appearance, has a bit of a delicate belly :) He has been eating this since he was a puppy after a bad experience with a nasty corn-based product.

review/text: The adoption worker at our local humane society recommended this product because it is grain free and high in meat content.  Our dog loves this food.  We have a relatively small dog who is still in his puppy stage, and the kibbles are the right size.  It is a bit pricier than the supermarket brands of dog foods, but we think our dog's health is worth the extra minor investment.

review/summary: My girl oves this food!
review/text: I am surprised at  a lot of the negative comments on Canidae. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin.  I tired 4 other brands of food: Innova, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Evo....all of which she scratches and bites herself constant.  With Canidae, she has a beautiful shinny coat, doesn't itch and she loves it!  It's amazing the difference.  Her stools sometimes are loose, but nothing to complain about or worry.  I'm not putting down those other foods, I'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her!  I've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat.  Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her.  We use the Chicken version on her.  If you on dog food analysis, you will notice it has a 5 star rating.  Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae!!

review/summary: don't buy this stuff
review/text: I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.

review/summary: Was great, but formula changed!
review/text: My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!

review/summary: After feeding for 5 years, we're done
review/text: We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.

review/summary: Another bad reaction. Why risk it?
review/text: We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?

review/text: We bought a small bag of Canidae to give it a try, as we are always trying new foods for our 3 dogs.  I normally serve 2 kinds of food for dinner and whenever we put Canidae in the dish, the dogs would always eat the other food first.  I'm glad I only bought a small bag.  For the price, the food should be more appealing.  But our dogs just didn't like it and we were glad when it was all gone.  I will never buy again!

review/text: I have a rescued greyhound and he was doing great on Canidae until we got our last order just last month.  Now he's a mess digestively.  I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed.  Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing.

review/text: Switched to Canidae from ScienceDiet after reading about dog foods on the internet.  I haven't noticed any major differences in the dogs habits or frequencies, other than her eating habits.  Before, she acted very finicky and sometimes would take all day to finish one bowl of food.  Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like.

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.  Very impressed overall.....

review/summary: Beware the new formula!!!!
review/text: I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.

review/summary: New formula nothing like old!
review/text: We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.

review/summary: Corn isn't dog food.
review/text: Canidae has been excellent for my dogs. My Siberian can be picky at times but they all seem to like Canidae. The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say "Made in America" but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children, much less their pets. A premium food, sans fillers and trash, really is no more expensive since you feed less of it. Your dog will be healthier. Call this company and other companies and ask about their ingredients. Science diet and Purina will, for good reason, be way more evasive than Canidae.

review/text: Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs.  I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.  There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food.  Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).  There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list.  Do your homework before buying this dog food.  Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding.

review/summary: Terrible and Dangerous to Feed
review/text: I fed Canidae ALS (old formula) for 7+ years and my dogs thrived.  Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS - BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.<br />----<br />It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.<br /><br />I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members.

review/summary: Packaging was already open!!!
review/text: When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it "Canidae" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip

review/summary: Great for Diarrhea and Making Your Dog Sick
review/text: I've been feeding this to my dog for months and I have just realized his stool has been pretty runny the whole time, today he had diarrhea again, probably the second or third time during that period.  I came online to see if others have been having the same problem as me, and sure enough the answer is yes.  I'm done with this dog food, I'd suggest you do the same, it's just not right.

review/summary: OUR DOG BECAME VIOLENTLY ILL...NOT THE 1st...
review/text: We switched or dog to the canned All Ages food. She has had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days. She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog - 19 years old.<br /><br />Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.<br /><br />We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her.

review/summary: CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi
review/text: I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound.  I did alot of research and read alot of labels.  I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!  It's also an excellent value - Try Canidae, you'll see!

review/summary: WARNING!  They've changed the formula!
review/text: I've been a happy Canidae customer for over a year, recommending the product to everyone.  However, they have recently changed the formula and my dog has been violently ill.  I've talked to most of the suppliers of Canidae in the Chicago area, and they are receiving countless complaints about very sick dogs since the new formula was introduced.<br />I'm taking my dog off of this food immediately.  He's been sensitive to different foods in the past, but never as violently as this.<br />It's disturbing that they would make this switch without notification.  At least I finally know what's wrong with my dog, and that it's been happening to countless others.  Beware.

review/summary: Another satisfied pet owner
review/text: We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams.  Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.  I settled on Canidae for the same reason as the other reviewers; top notch ingredients at a reasonable price.<br /><br />She loves it.  I alternate dry with dry/wet every other day.  And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots.  Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.<br /><br />And the added benefits are about the poop; less poop to pick up, poop is solid, not runny, and like the other reviewer said, the poop is way less smelly.

review/summary: Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle
review/text: **Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says "Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like "Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a "raw food is the only way to go" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.

review/summary: WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.
review/text: My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.

review/summary: Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers
review/text: My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.

review/summary: Very good ingredient list with extras.
review/text: I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.
