review/summary: No Grass for My Cats
review/text: I normally grab this item at the local pet store and my cats (and carpets) absolutely love it.<br /><br />A couple months ago, I purchased a couple boxces from Amazon to fill out a shopping cart. Bad move. Not only did neither box grow a single blade of grass, but one of them spoiled and smelled horrible for a day or so.<br /><br />Amazon's excellent customer service jumped in and sent two more boxes last week for no charge. When I saw the dates on the box were different, I was relieved and expected to have grass growing any day. I was wrong. Something is not right with Amazon's supply. Not a single blade of grass from four boxes now.<br /><br />Spend the extra couple of bucks and pick this stuff up locally. You cats (and dogs) will thank you.

review/text: If you follow the instructions, you'll have a box filled with lush, green, grass in about a week. The stuff the seeds are in is very light and blows out easily so be careful when you add water. For some odd reason, my cats loved this grass at first but they soon lost interest. They seem to much prefer outside grass. No clue why but it is what it is. In terms of working as intended, this is a good product. I don't think I can fault them because my cats ignored the grass - maybe my cats are just more used to yard grass?

review/summary: Better than I thought
review/text: I was skeptical about growing cat grasses, but I've had this for 6 weeks now, and I moisten it every 2 days or so and it's producing more and more grass.  Both cats love having it.  I can see it going for another month at least, new sprouts are coming from the bottom, and those seem to be choice to the cats.  They just munch a bit here and there.  Finally after 2 years of them eating my houseplants, the plants are finally safe and left alone.

review/summary: What is wrong with this product
review/text: I have used this product for years and have been generally satisfied with it. However, out of the last five containers I have purchased only one has produced grass as expected.It was from Pet Smart dated 2009. They were purchased from Pet Smart(2), Pet Supermarket (2) and Amazon (1). Only one from Pet Smart was usable last year and the other four were purchased after that container, the last from Amazon. All except the (2) from Pet Smart were dated 5/2011.<br />I recently sent a letter to Gimborn detailing my experience, with pictures of the failed containers. They contacted my by phone and said their customer service rep is on vacation and will contact me upon her return. Hopefully she can offer an explanation as to why all of a sudden their product is failing and offer me a replacement that works.

review/summary: used to be better
review/text: We used to buy this brand all the time. Our kitties loved it. I'm not sure if the company changed the formula or product or what, because the last few boxes were clearly not the same. At first growth was sparse, one box I exchanged at the store after noticing weevils in it, and the last two boxes, we grew only mold instead of grass. The first I was willing to chalk it off to a bad batch, but after the last box, that's too many times I've been burned and wasted money on this brand. No more. We are trying other sources of grass. So far, our kitties seem to like those just as much.

review/text: After reading the review here, I wonder why so many people have had trouble in using this product. I have been using this product for several years for my cats, and I only have had one or two defectives that the grass did not grow. Maybe because of the climate? It germinates just in 2-3 days and keeps almost 2 weeks here in California.<br />I usually purchase them from Petguys.com, because this item is the most lowly priced there, and it is still cheaper than the retail store even including the shipment if you buy more than 4.<br />Because the item was out of stock at Petguys.com, I wondered if I could buy it at Amazon, and I was shocked to see the price. The price is almost double!

review/summary: Fungus
review/text: Although the product grew very quickly (within one week) and our cats absolutely loved the product, we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth. I'm assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth. We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn't eat themselves silly, so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time. Regardless, I would never purchase this product again because I don't want to risk my cats getting sick from it. We are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we're trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants.

review/summary: Weak Flavor. High Sodium. Low Quality.
review/text: Fortunately, I've never been gluten sensitive, at least as far as I know, but I've got a couple friends that are on gluten-free diets. This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I've bought this product many times in the supermarket. The Amazon price is much better than what I have ever paid for the same item. It's nice to have on the shelf because my family will always eat tortellini. The fresh tortellini that you buy in the refrigerator case has a different, fresher, taste; however, this is still delicious and great to have on hand. All you need to do is boil it, toss it in some butter, maybe add a little bit of tomato sauce (not much) and some grated cheese (not much). With a salad, that's a good, satisfying dinner!

review/summary: fabulous dinner in minutes from the pantry!
review/text: These tortellini (and also the spinach and ricotta version) are truly wonderful.  We tried them on a special promotion from Sam's Club, and I'm thrilled to hear that they'll soon be available directly from Amazon with free shipping for Prime members.  When we're exhausted and hungry on the way home from work, we don't head for a restaurant at the last minute or give in to the lure of take-out, because we can have these ready in moments after we get home.  With tomato sauce (we love the Barilla tomato and basil, which is good heated up right out of the jar, and can also be enhanced with our own lightly sauteed onions, celery, minced garlic and mushrooms -- yummm!), or just with butter and parmesan, these and a steamed fresh vegetable or a crisp salad (or even a high-quality frozen or canned vegetable, in a pinch) make an entire meal without having to succumb to restaurant prices.  If we're feeling ambitious enough, we have time to saute the onions, celery, minced garlic and mushrooms for the customized sauce while cooking the pasta.  I have liked DaVinci tortellini in the past, but these are even better!  They have a fresher and richer taste, and the nutrition seems comparable.  Unless we're ravenous, we even have a little left over from the two of us to warm up for breakfast the next morning (and they do warm up beautifully, if stored in the fridge BEFORE you put any sauce on them and then just microwaved with a tiny bit of butter -- add parmesan once they're hot).  Try 'em -- I think you'll love 'em as much as we do!<br /><br />UPDATE 6/11/11:  Will be available in 2 days -- YEAH!!<br /><br />Just wanted to add:  these tortellini pretty much double in size when cooked, unlike the fresh ones in the deli.  So it's a much more generous package than it looks.  :)

Since I did a search for "sugar free cookies," I wasn't careful enough with what came up under the search results and hit order when these popped up.  Unfortunately, they are *not* sugar-free cookies, but turn out to be really wonderful gluten-free cookies in a variety pack.  We re-gifted to a friend who can't eat gluten, and she can't say enough good about all the varieties.  I highly recommend them for people with gluten or nut allergies.  But Amazon, seriously:  improve your search terms!  (And note to self: actually read the bags in the picture before buying!)

review/text: These are good cookies, but I'd hesitate to buy them if you don't like fava flour. It is a taste I don't like and kind of ruins the flavor. 4 cookies per snack bag with 3 cookies being a "serving". they do come in a nice looking box which more than one person admired!

review/summary: They taste okay
review/text: The cookies were okay. I enjoyed the chocolate cookies the most. The others were okay and tasted very similar. There was barely any cinnamon flavor in the cinnamon thins. The oatmeal flavor was very weak too. The oatmeal, cinnamon and sugar cookies tasted like sugar cookies. The cookies are very sweet and high in sugar. The texture is good and crispy. If you are into really sweet snacks, these cookies would be great but I expected more flavor. Prepare to drink a big glass of water after eating a pack ^_^.

review/summary: VERY surprised at how good these are!
review/text: I rarely write reviews, but I thought that this product deserved to have it's own!  I have seen these at Starbucks for 2.50 a package, but I wasn't going to pay that for 4 cookies.  But I will pay just a little over 10$ for 16 packages using subscribe & save with a code from Amazon.<br /><br />These arrived super fast, as always, and I broke into the sugar cookies first.  They are perfect - light and airy and the perfect sugar cookie taste.  I haven't tried the rest, but I am sure that it is all the same base with different add ins.  My favorite GF cookie by far, outside of the homemade ones at the bakery.  Perfect size for lunch or a snack....and the cookies are small and portioned controlled.

review/summary: Vegan Cookies!
review/text: Okay, I got the variety pack because I wanted to try out all the different flavors and I'm glad I did. Personally I love the chocolate chip cookies, they are super and the cinnamon ones are really good too. The oatmeal cookies taste a bit like cake batter to me and the sugar ones just weren't for me. This is not something I would keep on hand to snack on but it is a fun treat. The cookies are small like famous amos size and they are also hard cookies - so if you only like soft bake these won't be for you. A lot of gluten free products have a funky after taste and I only really tasted that in the sugar and oatmeal flavors.

They are a lovely, crispy texture, and high-quality ingredients. My favorite are the chocolate chip, but all of them are outstanding. FYI they do contain a small amount of soy, for those of you with food allergies. I can't recommend these highly enough!! ... go ahead, treat yourself. :)

review/text: I really like these cookies for three reasons:  My mom has a specific medical condition that severely limits the types of snacks she can have, but she is allowed to have these cookies; I'm vegan and so are the cookies; and they're crunchy (not soft-baked... yuk!).  And I love all the flavors.  The only reason I gave a "4" rating rather than "5" is because there are FOUR cookies in each bag, but the "serving size" calorie breakdown is based on THREE cookies... not cool.

review/text: I've got to warn you of something important.  These cookies are ADDICTIVE!!!<br /><br />I put them on a 2 monthly subscription plan and in the very first month, I've ordered 2 extra shipments.  I wish I could tell you it's because we have a large family, but I can't.  It's just little old me, and I am plowing my way through these incredibly delicious cookies like I'm getting paid to do so.<br /><br />Forget the gluten-free part.  These cookies are fantastic by anyone's standards; I am guilty of consuming 2 bags of these yummy-to-your-tummy cookies a day.  They are super good, not a gluten-free compromise, and an avid fan like me will not doubt find regular cookies no longer up to snuff.<br /><br />Heed my warning, but buy them anyway if you are gluten sensitive.  They are not a compromise from my way of thinking but remarkably good cookies.

They're not an exact replacement for other commercially available cookies. That being said, they are still very tasty! My three-year-old devours them, and will request them for dessert all the time. We send them to day care to use as a replacement snack when other kids send in birthday cupcakes, and he doesn't feel like he's missing out. Total win!

review/text: I bought these cookies because not only are they gluten free, they're also peanut free (all major allergens to be exact). They are the best GF and PF cookie I have tried to date.<br /><br />The "Every crispy, crunchy Lucy's cookie is baked without wheat, gluten, milk, eggs, peanuts or tree nuts. But you'd never know it." statement is spot on. While the texture and taste aren't exactly like grandma's gooey chocolate chip cookies, you'd never tell they were "missing something".<br /><br />The variety pack is nice so you can change up flavors, though the flavors aren't very variant of each other.

review/summary: Delicious, but a little soupy
review/text: PROS: This dish is delicious. The flavor is not at all hot-spicy, but there is plenty of body to it. The cheese is firm.  It was really easy to prepare, too. I just tossed the bag into a pot of boiling water for 4 minutes, as recommended by the preparation instructions.<br /><br />CONS: The texture is lacking. It's almost as if the spinach was pureed; this makes it a little too soup-like. Also, the sodium content seems a little too high. The nutrition info on the package says there is 800 mg/serving (33% daily value) and about 2.5 servings/package; so if you eat this all at once like me, you'll be ingesting about 2000mg of sodium (about 82.5% of the daily value).<br /><br />But for the texture, I would be happy to find this on my plate in a restaurant.

If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. This one's consistency is like baby food.  I ofter buy similar products, including a hearty Palak Paneer from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better in flavor and cost far less.

review/summary: Not so pleasant
review/text: We love curry and Indian food, Moroccon food, all types of dishes from different cultures and anything from anywhere that goes on rice. I've bought many dishes from Kitchens of India but this one just fell flat.  My first and last impression was "slimy".  I cooked it in the microwave and the boil water method and both were inedible to me and every one of my family.  It's like a pureed slime with only about 3 chunks of cheese and a few small tidbits more.  Not a pleasant taste or texture, little food value, way too high in salt..makes this something I'll never purchase again.  I will continue with Kitchens of India, however, as they do have some tasty dishes.

review/text: When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. The great thing about Indian food is that they are mostly sauce (or "gravy" as they say), so I will cook up some meat or steam up some veggies and add one of these packets to make a fabulous meal. Their really aren't much in the way of veggies in these packets, but that is typical in Indian food, no matter where it comes from. American's tend to use gravy or sauce as the secondary component while Indian's use it as the primary component and sop it up with lots of bread or rice. By steaming or sauteing some additional vittles, you can really stretch one of these packets.

review/summary: not very yummy
review/text: I normally love this dish. It's one of my faves at the local Indian restaurant I frequent. But this version of it, perhaps because of what's required to market something in a foil bag and ship it all over thither and yon, isn't very good.<br /><br />It's thin, for one thing, and my first packet of it contained a whopping three chunks of cheese. Say what?! I love the cheese! Where's the cheese?! Added to the cheese shortage is the fact that the dish is a wee bit salty, and you've got a palak paneer that doesn't really light my fire. IF I combine it with a biryani from the same company, it's tolerable, but I normally like this dish with nothing more than a couple of slices of naan. Ah, well, live and learn.

review/summary: Okay but not great
review/text: Palak paneer is my favorite Indian food and I have tried the shelf stable versions from Trader Joe's, Haldiram, Tasty Bite and now Kitchens of India. I find the Kitchens of India version to be my 2nd favorite next to Haldiram. It's not too spicy like TJ's, and it is pretty well-seasoned (arguably a little too salty). My only complaint is that the paneer is not as good as Haldiram's version. Haldiram's cheese is "squeaky" and firmer to the bite, so it feels more fresh and homeamde. I bought this when it was on sale though for 50% off so it's a great value. I also bought the variety pack and I like to heat up two packages and eat with a little plain yogurt and rice. Perfect for a weeknight dinner and lunch for the next day.<br /><br />Update 1-27-10<br />I'm now down to my last box of this product and I have to say that I'm not going to be ordering it again. It really is way too salty for my taste and I can't get over the poor consistency of the paneer.

You might even find a few drops on yourself.<br /><br />The positive side is that means you have so much less oil to add to calories ingested. I add one or two teaspoonfuls of soy protein powder to blunt the spiciness and add protein to the calories to grams of protein of this product.<br /><br />Also good on Amazon kasha, rice, pasta, etc.

I generally don't like eating soup and this seems a bit "soupy" because the spinach is pureed so much; however, the taste makes up for that complaint.<br /><br />When the only food around town is unhealthy fast food, Kitchens of India's products are a wonderful and healthy alternative to have stored away at the office.  The problem is, they don't stay stored too long because they taste too good!

review/summary: Not as good as other Kitchens of India products
review/text: Amazon has made a great service introduce me to Kitchens of India products. These spicy Indian meals makes lunches during work a very simple endeavor. However, after trying several varieties I did not find the spinach dish as good as the other ones.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It still tastes Ok, and it's still easy to prepare/serve. However the general green soupy substance is not as delicious as other offerings. Additionally the semi-solid floating parts - which are supposed to be cheese, but I think they're tofu - do not add an interesting flavor to the mix.<br /><br />If this was the only Kitchens of India product, or I liked spinach soup more (I do like spinach, but not in this style), I'd recommend it. Currently I'd recommend a more regular dish, or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GQ6OEM">variety mix</a> to find your own taste.

review/summary: Sodium Overload - inedible for me
review/text: I'm not someone who is particularly sensitive to salt - I don't have high blood pressure or anything like that.  However, with 800 mg of sodium (33% of your recommended daily value) - in only 1/2 cup of this - I was a little concerned.  But, the reviews for this product are pretty much good - across the board.  So - I TRIED to like it - I really did - and the smell was incredible - I do agree that it's not got the most appealing visual effect, but I don't really care about that.  My first bite was just some of the spinach puree - and I thought "Wow, that's good - a bit salty, but good" - then, I had a second bite with some of the cheese, and the salt level in it hit me.  I tried one more bite after that, but that was it for me.<br /><br />I'm hoping I just received a bad batch - I most likely will try one of the other packages, but I'll prepare it with something else (maybe chick peas? Lentils? Potatoes?) to tame it.  As is, I can't eat it at all.

It is a little soupy, but I think the description says its made with pureed spinach so being soupy is expected. It would be very good with rice. The paneer wasn't the best, but was enjoyable.<br /><br />All in all if you keep in mind what you are buying, I think you'll be satisfied with this product. The worst thing health-wise is the sodium content, it has 33% of your daily value.

Sort of.<br />This is one of my favorite Indian foods and I have enjoyed it in India and at my favorite Indian restaurant here in the states and I even make it at home sometimes. I am an accomplished amateur chef.<br /><br />This product is very easy to heat and to pour over rice,it only takes minutes and the left overs store well in the fridge and do get better with age. ( Don't we all )<br /><br />Palak Paneer  Pronounced  ( Paneeer ) the latter refers to Paneer cheese which is not in this product. They use cottage cheese instead. But that's ok, it works. Many people don't like and most likely cant find Paneer cheese in the store any way.<br /><br />For some one who is just getting their feet wet with Indian food they will like this dish and if you are a professional Indian food eater this stuff is good in a pinch,<br /><br />If you want to improve it  and make it more authentic add some chick peas and potatoes and a little dry curry powder.<br /><br />I would recommend that people try this.<br /><br />Dean

Some may find this a little spicy (a bit of chili), but my tongue enjoys this level of spice. (I lived in India for two years, and by Indian standards, there is little "hot" in this dish.)<br /><br />The only negative I have with this dish is that the inside pouch is not microwavable. But It is easily emptied over a bowl of dish to enjoy in just  a couple of minutes from the microwave.<br /><br />This is something I will keep on my shelf for a quick, protein-rich, vegetarian lunch.

review/text: I've tried various different palak paneer...frozen, boxed, freshly made. Obviously, the best will be freshly made, but I have to give kudos to Taste of India for producing such a nice product. In all of the other packaged paneers, my biggest problem was the cheese. It would almost always be rubbery or chewy...in one frozen product, it actually would squeak as I ate it. However, ToI had soft and moist little cubes. I'd use my naan to smash it a bit against my bowl and grab just enough to soften the bite.<br /><br />The consistency was good. Seasoning was good. Taste was very good. I honestly don't think they could create a better pre-packaged version. Not going to a win against homemade batch, but if you're like me and stuck miles away from an Indian restaurant, it's a nice indulgence now and then.

It feels like everything has been overcooked. The base is very thin and soupy, and the paneer is very soft, like tofu, not firm and slightly chewy. The flavor was okay, and just a little too spicy. I did find it quite salty though. I'm not sure I'd order this again. Probably not. I really like the Pav Baji from Kitchens of India.
