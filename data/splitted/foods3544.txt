review/text: Yes, stone me now. I've removed a star, and not due to the quality of the product.<br />But, this is a packaged deal, and as you can't get one without the other, there you have it.<br />The dogs loved the bones, and it does take them a few minutes to get through them, which is the point.<br />Good ingredients, and no staining.<br />However, why these come packaged in such a heavy box, wasting recourses, is beyond me.<br />The bag they are in is sturdy, air tight, and could easily be sold on it's own.<br />There are over treats, CheckUp, that arrive this way, so clearly it can be done.<br /><br />Unlike the makers of Greenies who never bothered to respond to the same question about packaging, the kind folks are Nylabone did.<br /><br />Until these is lest waste in the way these are packaged, I'm gonna have to pass of purchasing more.

review/text: This is my first attempt at using dried mushrooms.  The flavor was good and texture firm but I still had a few pieces of grit after rinsing them.  Perhaps I did not rinse properly.  I was trying to be delicate thinking they would break apart.  You get quite a bit considering they plump up a lot after being rehydrated.  I only used 1/4 of the package so will let you know how the next batch turns out.

review/summary: Used to be super smokey, now more salty than smokey
review/text: I've been getting these for years, but the last few bags since December 2011 and especially the most recent bag in March 2012 since being fulfilled by Amazon have been getting less smokey and more salty. This month's bag was barely smokey at all and super salty. I have no idea why.<br /><br />These used to be shipped direct from Choo Choo R Snacks, and always got delivered in 3 days, and they also included a free sample of another beef snack product. Now that they are being shipped by Amazon, they cost more, took 13 days to receive instead of 3, and no more free sample of another snack!<br /><br />Update! Wow, the same day that I wrote the review above I got a call from an owner of Choo Choo R Snacks, they are sending me some more directly, and their product consistency is very important to them. I haven't been blown away by awesome customer service like this in a very long time! My hopes are up, and I look forward to enjoying the excellent deep smokey flavor again!

review/text: I have having this in my cart for a while since my friend wanted to try it for s long time, but was trying to justify if it was worth its weight in taste. I finally bought it and spilt it equally between ourselves. It was lean and smokey, but it was indeed salty. I liked it enough to want to eat at least 2-3 sticks in one sitting, but the salt content did not allow me to. It is still good and no oily after taste in your mouth like Slim Jim, but I don't think I could buy another set if it would be too salty.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, but a bit too smokey for me
review/text: Overall the flavor of these is excellent.  They are actually a bit denser and dryer then expected, but not enough so to make them less enjoyable for me.<br /><br />But, I can't quite give them five stars.  The first bite, I very much enjoyed both the saltiness and smokiness of the beef stick.  But by the time I finished, the smoke flavor and saltiness had became slightly overpowering.  I may cut them into half sticks to be honest, a half a stick as a snack is about right given the smoke flavor and saltiness for me.<br /><br />Having said that, if you like a STRONG natural smoke flavor and/or like things very salty, then consider this a five star review.  As much as I did enjoy this sausage in small doses, I'd rate their jerky products a bit higher, most or all I've tried I've rated five stars.  Still, if you do like a very strong smokey flavor, again this is the product for you.<br /><br />As an aside, this company has always given me free samples of various flavors of their country cut jerky line, and this time also a free sample of a new flavor, "maple-peppered".  The maple-pepper flavor was excellent, the mix of the two worked well.  I'd probably rate the new flavor 5 stars, and next time I order from them I'll see if they have the new flavor ready to order.  Customer service has always been excellent as well.  This is a wonderful company to order from, and even the product I liked the least I rated four stars.  The ones I liked the most, five stars easily.

review/text: This package of beef sticks didn't exactly meet my expectations.  Two things immediately came to mind when eating: 1. the beef sticks are as hard as rocks!  The sticks are so hard to bite into and then chew, my jaw ends up getting sore after only one piece; definitely not good.  2.  Way too salty!  The flavor of the beef is masked by an undeniable taste of too much salt.<br /><br />I think I only eat 1-2 pieces a week, simply when I need a quick protein source; I wouldn't recommend these to people, especially if they are looking to a tasty and fun to eat snack.

review/text: Buffalo Bill rides again.  These "Extra Smokeys" have very strong smoked flavor, which I have been looking (or drooling) for quite a few years.  By far the best smoked meat snack available in the USA that I know of.  Overall flavor is excellent, though somewhat on the "extra peppery" side.  And a little pricey at $1 each.  And don't even think of doing this at home if you wear dentures--these sticks are quite tough.<br />I will order more within the month, excellent service form Choo Choo R Snacks, and they even give you a bonus beef jerky sample to try.<br />"Extra Smokeys" really smoke!

review/summary: These little things are great
review/text: I love beef jerky. It is one of my favorite snacks and these are awesome. They have a unique taste unlike anything else on the market.  Calling them "extra smokey" is not a joke. You can smell the smoke in the bag, and on the meat. After the first bite I thought, "wow never had anything like that before" then I though "I want more."<br />These are pretty tough, but I like tougher jerky. The soft stuff is not for me at all.  These are salty, but traditional type dried meat is supposed to be and they say this is an "old world" recipe. Like another reviewer stated, I was well taken care of by Choo Choo R snacks when a problem came up that was not of their control. Customer service is great. I have tried a few products in the Buffalo Bills line, and this to me is by far the best. I have had nothing like this before, and I like-em.

(Extra Smokeys, Hot short shots, and Red Hot pickled sausage)<br /><br />Out of those 3, the Hot short shots are the best.<br /><br />update:<br />The extra smokeys are still a bit salty to me, but the flavor does grow on you after a while.<br />If I cut all the sticks in half, and eat just half a stick at a time, that makes it much more palatable than trying to eat a whole stick at once.<br /><br />I might buy another bag eventually.

review/summary: Intense Flavor To The Max
review/text: After my first order of Extra Smokeys was lost in the mail by the post office, one of the owners, Paul, really took care of me and sent another package right away plus an extra $20 worth of free extra samples for my trouble.  As for the product, I think it is really a flavor explosion.  The smokey smell is obvious when you get too close to the bag, and the flavor is very powerful.  There is just enough spice in there too but not too much.  They are a little chewy, but that just makes you take smaller bites, which both lets you savor the flavor and makes each stick last longer.  They are also very convenient to just grab one from the bag and eat it on the run or in the car.  No mess and no wrappers left behind.  Oh and after 28 days passed, the original missing package finally arrived, so now I have a new bag to start on!  YES! Thanks Paul and Choo Choo R Snacks.  This is some SERIOUS BEEF JERKY.

Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm� pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm� are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next.

review/summary: Excellent choice
review/text: By dogs, Gus (Glen Imaal Terrier Mix) and Tootsie (tiny teacup Poodle) both loved the food.  I will have to feed it to them for a few more months to see if it REALLY changes their energy level, etc.  I have noticed their bowel movements are smaller, which I understand is a good sign for dog food that is full of nutrients and not fillers.  Anyway, I loved it and am getting more.

review/summary: Chihuahaua does very well on this food
review/text: My chihuahua puppy did so well on this food, but then I could not find it anymore. I tried a new food, but she had diarrhea and bloody mucous. Finally I put her on the Avoderm Small Breed Adult food as the formulation is a lot like the small breed puppy version, except with a little less protein. My puppy is 8 months old now so I figured it was okay. Now she is thriving again -- nicely formed stool, very silky coat that is luxurious to touch, and lots and lots of cheerful energy. I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it. How much can a 3 pound dog eat, anyway.

review/summary: My Cavalier Loves This Stuff!
review/text: My small Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (81/2 months old & only 8 lbs.) loves this food!  Anything else, she turns her nose up at (she's picky, too!).  But she gobbles this up like crazy.  Its a great formula and the avocado meal and oil in it has given her a most beautiful and soft, silky coat (the grandkids say she feels like a bunny!).  She also has a bit of a sensitive stomach and vomits whenever she has any food with beef in it, or rawhides, bully sticks, etc.  With this formula, no disgestive problems at all.  My only complaint is that Avoderm only makes it in a 3.5 lb bag instead of larger, more economical sizes.  I've sent them an e-mail to ask about manufacturing larger bags.  Otherwise, this has been really great for my "baby".

review/summary: The only thing my picky dogs will eat!
review/text: I have had a really difficult time getting my dogs to eat dog food:  one had to be on a special homemade diet for 6 months, after which no kibble would make the grade.  Fortunately, this one worked, although I do take extra measures for my incredibly picky dogs, including crushing it, adding warm water, heating it in the microwave, and mixing it with ground beef.  Avoderm is a healthy food that I trust, and the other reviewer with concerns about avocados need not worry:  it's the stems and leaves of the avocado that are a problem for dogs, not the meat of the fruit itself.  I will keep buying as long as they make it.

review/summary: FINALLY, ANOTHER OPTION FOR SMALL OLDER DOGS WITH TEETH PROBLEMS
review/text: I have have 10 toy poodles and all are over 8 years old and have lost some teeth.  I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all. I am so happy I discovered this food!  P.S.  It's a very healthy food for them too.  As long as the price is reasonable, like now, 15.00 for 7 lbs, and can be bought with Prime 2 day shipping free, I will continue to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/21/12 - Oh rats!  I went to re-order and price went up to 16.98 plus 5.73 for shipping.  Disappointed, but found another seller who offers prime shipping on this item, thank goodness. Regular USPS does not deliver directly to our house, in the mountains, and we have to go pick it up.  I am not always able to do that due to health restraints, so Prime shipping is very important to us as it offers UPS delivery to our door. This seller always did an amazing job getting our order to us quickly with the prime shipping and I was very happy with them. I regret having to change, but is necessary.

They've made me smile for 43 years so I'm glad someone agrees with me!  I buy these things all the time, have been doing so for years, and they're still awesome.  I think Hershey's outdid themselves on this invention - many have tried to copy, all have failed. There's just nothing like a Reese's peanut butter cup, egg, Christmas tree, you name it.  Savor the moment and by golly, will they EVER make these things life-size?!!!  One of the best things about them is if you're starving, since they do have peanut butter in them, they do help get you to your next meal. Great, great product, been loving them for years, now I even buy the peanut butter (it's WAY better than Jif!)!  Highly recommend!

review/text: this was my first venture into the bonsai world.  i saw a similar tree at a family member's house.  i wasn't so sure about ordering on line, but it turned out to be a great surprise.  the tree was beautiful ( a bit smaller that i imagined, but that is fine).  it has been thriving on my window sill for almost 2 months.  the instructions in the package were easy to follow. (i also did a bit of research on the type of tree i ordered-- the brush cherry).  my only suggestions is that it should have been sent with a humidity tray.  (or that option to buy one at the time of purchase should have been offered.)  when i realized i really needed one and called for the company, they were very friendly, but did not have a tray that would fit the pot they sent the tree in.  i rummaged around my house and found something that works, but would much rather have had a matching tray.  if you order a tree (which as i said is beautiful and came wonderfully packaged and in great shape) i would make sure you state you want a matching tray.

review/summary: Really bad!
review/text: I was making peppermint bark for the holidays and I ran out of the white chocolate melts I had been using. I'd already made one tray using another brand of white chocolate, but I still needed to make another tray so I ran to the store and all they had in stock were these Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. I figured for the price they'd be alright to use, and it is Ghirardelli, they talk themselves up a lot and sell themselves as a fine chocolatier so I figured these would be at least decent.<br /><br />I was so so wrong.<br /><br />These were disgusting, first of all. They have a very plain, flat taste. Also, there's a gross after taste that accompanies these. Compared to the other white chocolate I was using, these may as well be classified as inedible. Regardless, I went ahead and attempted to use them. They melt terribly. Actually, they don't melt at all! They became a big, nasty dry mess of powdery white chocolate imitation. No, my chocolate didn't seize, these really are just that bad.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting these to be great, but I was expecting they would be at least usable. They were not. After trying and failing to use one bag, I have decided I'm just going to use the one tray of peppermint bark I already have made and just make some cookies or something instead. These were a massive disappointment.

They can't actually be called chocolate since there is no cocoa butter or powder in them but they taste amazing and melt well in the microwave. Just don't microwave them too long, watch carefully. I used these baking chips this holiday season and was pleased with the results. I melted some of the chips and spread them on top of a vanilla cheesecake. Everyone loved it. I've also used these chips in cookies with macadamia nuts. Here are the real ingredients as listed on the package (the ingredients on this website page are not correct at the time I posted this review): sugar, palm kernel oil, whole milk powder, nonfat dry milk, palm oil, soy lecithin and vanilla. To be honest this tastes better than any white chocolate I've ever bought. Eating the chips straight out of the bag with some pecans is very tempting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I bake a lot and started using the Ghirardelli Classic White Baking Chips to make my white chocolate & macadamia nut cookies (which are amazing, if I do say so myself) and was really happy with the results.  I had tried other brands previously but had a recipe that said to use a quality brand of white chocolate so I started using the Ghirardelli chips and never looked back.  Unfortunately, they have gotten so expensive on Amazon (about $7.00 a bag!) so now I have been buying them wherever I find them usually at a supermarket (at about $3.50 a bag) and I get them at a much better price.  I don't know why Amazon seems to be raising the prices on quite a few of the products that I really love, but I just buy them elsewhere.

review/summary: A Traditional European Treat
review/text: I used to purchase this all the time during the holidays in specialty shops at the malls and other places. This is not your typical fruitcake that everyone hates. This is a delightfully rich German holiday dessert that everyone will truly enjoy. The marzipan is what makes this so unique and delicious.

review/text: My German inlaws give us stollen every year to enjoy on Christmas Eve.  This year they sent us this brand. Sugar coating for some reason tasted like flour and didn't even have a hint of sweetness. I had to thow it out.  The second loaf wasn't as bad, but sugar coating still did not seem right.  It had sweetness, but didn't melt in your mouth right. Still tasted like it was mostly flour.  Maybe they got sugar and flour mixed up. Inside was good: moist with plenty of marzipan filling.

review/summary: Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder
review/text: I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

review/summary: great alternative to bottled green tea
review/text: The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

review/summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea
review/text: I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.

review/summary: Very Reasonably Priced and Delicious
review/text: If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for "White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream," "Green Tea Papaya Nectar" and "Green Tea Sugar Cookies." You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.

review/summary: No Flavor - Not Authentic
review/text: I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!

I also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants, saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories. Although the Stash rep tells me there is a "negligible" amount of caffeine, the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout. Since I love mint, I think I've found the perfect product.

review/text: This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: "Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties." Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.

review/summary: Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again
review/text: I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

review/summary: Trying this product for the first time
review/text: I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.

review/text: This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea "add to bottled water" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this "top shelf" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!

review/summary: Not for Me
review/text: I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.

review/summary: ice tea
review/text: THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies

review/summary: Great tasting and easy to use
review/text: This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea, and the instant convenience.<br /><br />I give it five stars

review/summary: Perfect summer tea
review/text: this is the best iced green tea I've ever had; the hint of blueberry is just perfect.  I add a bit of Stevia for a little more sweetness.  It would be an insult to call this "instant tea," but I carry a packet in my purse because it's better than any prepared tea I could buy when eating out.  Stash tea is always good, but this is extraordinary.

review/summary: Just had a glass today
review/text: When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said "natural", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong "mint" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)

review/summary: Doesn't have taste...
review/text: I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good.<br />This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water.<br />Well, I used just a cup and it didn't work out for me.<br />I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little.<br />I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve<br />that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup<br />of green tea--, or I am missing something here.<br />I do not recommend this tea.

review/summary: Of al the Stash iced teas this is the best, and it is still not all that good
review/text: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable. And only than were these passable...<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

review/text: This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.

review/summary: Makes great drinks but you have to use a lot!
review/text: This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.

review/summary: Not bad.  A bit light.
review/text: I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.

review/text: I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form.

review/text: I finally finished my box of the Blueberry Green Tea Powder and wanted to try something new!  So glad I tried this flavor as it is now my favorite!  Just add it to a cold bottle of water, drink it as is, or add a few drops of Stevia or Agave and you are good to go.  Very refreshing!!  Will be packing this on my trip to Mexico!

review/summary: quality lightly sweetened green tea powder
review/text: lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.

review/summary: not too sweet, not too strong, just right
review/text: As a long time tea drinker, was happy to come across this iced tea mix.  It serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing.  I find this iced tea very refreshing.  I really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content.  The plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry.  The blueberry is good too; it's unsweetened, so I add half a packet of Truvia.

review/summary: Great pick me up on the go - hot or cold!
review/text: I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants.
