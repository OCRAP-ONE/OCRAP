review/summary: A Taste of New Orleans every morning!
review/text: My first experience with Coffee and Chicory was when my sister-in-law who lives in NO sent me a Kringle cake from a local bakery. They would include a small packet of their brand. I looked forward to that Kringle cake every Christmas just for the coffee. On a recent visit to NO, I found the Cafe deMonde brand at a local grocery store and loved it! I checked to see if Amazon carried it and found it in both can and pack. Have purchased both and love them equally, but found the Pack of 4, 13 oz bags to be the best deal without compromising on the taste.

review/summary: Nothing like the "real" CDM
review/text: I'm originally from New Orleans, where just about everyone drinks coffee with chicory, and I've been drinking CDM coffee pretty much all my life.  I like CDM coffee so much that for years I've had it shipped up to New England by the case from various suppliers in Louisiana.  Then I saw this listing on Amazon, and the price looked really great compared to what I've paid in the past.  So I ordered it without paying much attention to the "AD" in the title - which it turns out stands for "Automatic Drip" - which it turns out is vastly different from the "Regular Grind" that I've been drinking for years.<br /><br />This CDM-AD might as well be Maxwell House (no offense intended to the gazillions of people who probably think Maxwell House is good coffee), and it doesn't begin to match the deep, rich taste of the CDM-RG coffee that I'm used to.  I don't know where the CDM-AD went wrong - maybe it's a different type of coffee, maybe it's got a lot less chicory in it, maybe grinding coffee specifically for Mister Coffee somehow makes it taste like warmed up dishwater.  Who knows.  All I do know is that, after making just two pots from a 4-bag shipment, I can't drink another single cup of the stuff.<br /><br />I've got no one but myself to blame for not shipping this pathetic excuse for CDM coffee back to Amazon before the 30-day return period expired, but at least I've cancelled the automatic subscription.  I'll take the remaining 3+ bags to the office, where people mostly don't seem to care what they drink as "coffee" as long as it's got caffeine in it.  And I guess I'll go back to ordering "real" CDM-RG from someplace in Louisiana like before.<br /><br />All in all, this was a huge, HUGE disappointment.

review/summary: Great product, great price
review/text: I have to admit, I'm a hopeless CDM addict and have been for about 35 yrs. When I lived in CA, I'd take an extra suitcase when I went home at Christmas to load up with CDM. When I moved to SA, I drove back for Christmas and loaded the back end of my vehicle. Since Katrina, "home" isn't there anymore. I can buy it at the local grocery store, but only in cans and it's ridiculously priced. I ordered from several different online stores for about 6 yrs, including Amazon, but it was all cans and/or more than I wanted to pay. I have been a subscriber since Amazon started carrying the vacuum packs. Besides being great tasting coffee, it's the only one that doesn't upset my stomach, and I can drink it at midnight and go right to sleep. (only did that once but I was long overdue for my caffeine fix and didn't care if it kept me awake, but it didn't) It IS an acquired taste, however, a lot of it just a matter of figuring out how to brew and "season" it. I never used milk or cream in my coffee until I started drinking CDM in 1977 and I make it like the standard cafe au lait! Yum. Nothing compares. It takes far less CDM to make a great pot of coffee than it does the other coffee and chicory products, and I've tried all of the major brands sold in New Orleans, even the more expensive ones. Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, CDM is THE best and Amazon's price is the best, particularly with subscription.

review/summary: Disappointing bitter flavor
review/text: I love coffee with chicory and have tried most available blends. The price of CDM coffee and chicory blend in a four-pack with Amazon's Subscribe and Save plan was very attractive and the reason I decided to give it a try. However, as I learned to my regret, it's a bad idea to economize on an untried coffee brand.<br /><br />The taste of CDM coffee is not only disappointing, it's unpleasant. Instead of the robust flavor I associate with other coffee and chicory blends, the word that describes it best is "bitter." I now have four bags of a coffee blend I dislike too much to drink. Since coffee and chicory is an acquired taste, and I don't know anyone else who drinks it, I doubt I can even give the stuff away! But I can't bring myself to drink the four bags I bought, so, instead of saving money, I wasted it. I've learned my lesson about trying to economize by buying an untried brand of coffee and chicory:  Don't!<br /><br />In addition to the unacceptable flavor, I was surprised that the plastic pack containing four bags of CDM coffee had three of the vacuum-sealed bags and one of the loose bags. This did nothing to instill confidence in the brand before I even opened one of the bags and brewed a pot of the coffee.<br /><br />I would not recommend this brand of coffee and chicory to anyone who normally drinks a C&C blend and is discriminating about coffee flavor. If you don't care what your coffee tastes like...the bitter taste that characterizes CDM C&C may not matter to you.

review/summary: Medicine time made so easy!
review/text: My cat was recently diagnosed an epileptic, and will be on phenobarbital pills for probably the rest of her life. My cat loves to eat, especially table food, so I thought getting her to take her meds would be easy, crush the pill up, mix it in milk or sour cream or any of her favorite foods, and viola! But I quickly found out it was not so easy! I would be up at 6am chasing her around the house trying to get her to eat it, or force-feeding it to her, which me and the cat both hate to do! I discovered these pill pockets while doing research online and decided to order it. Let me tell you, medicine time is a piece of cake now! I dont even have to crush the pill up. You just stick the pill in the predesigned pocket, pinch the top together and my cat eagerly chomps it down! She loves both the chicken and salmon flavor, medicine time takes less than a minute to accomplish, and both me and the cat are happy! She has been enjoying these "treats" for a few weeks now, twice she ended up biting into the pill, yet the flavor of the treat was so appealing to her that she didn't pay any attention to the pill and kept chomping it down! We love these things, they really were the answer to our prayers, especially for my boyfriend who had been responsible for medicine time in the evenings while I am at work. My cat has always been more hesitant to take her meds when he is giving them to her, but since trying these pill pockets it has been absolutely no problem. We are all very thrilled with this product--mom, dad, and kitty!

review/summary: Red sea salt
review/text: Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.  Ordered it and Himalayan sea salt from Fairies Finest.  I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.

Jitterbeans say what they are, caffeine and chocolate.<br />I started doing triathlons last year and when I get up at 4:30 in the morning to drive to a race I know that 1 cup of coffee isn't going to get me where I need to be by 7:30 when it starts.  Now I could drink 3 cups of coffee, but then I'd be looking for a restroom 1/2 way through the bike event.<br />So on the way to the race I chew a few jitterbeans for the extra get up and go.....and the fact that chocolate doesn't taste too bad :-)  !

review/summary: Simple Feline Diabetes Test
review/text: This is a terriffic way to confirm a tentative diagnosis of diabetes in a cat without the trauma of taking your cat to the vet or trying to hold a strip to them while urinating.  You sprinkle some sugar-detecting "confetti" in the litter box and check it each day for color change.  In our Simba, we confirmed high blood sugar and immediately took her off her existing kibble diet (kibbles are generally high in carbohydrates as well as grain products such as flour and gluten that cats and dogs can't metabolize).  She now eats only high-protein grain-free canned food and is symptom free. I highly recommend this product. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VJ55U">Purina "Glucotest" Feline Urinary Glucose Detection System (one test packet)</a>

review/summary: Great way to monitor kitty's glucose
review/text: Our cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He hates going to the vet, and from what I have read glucose readings spike when the cat is under stress, so we wanted to be able to test at home. Our cat is already unhappy with insulin shots, so we did not want to have to poke him and draw blood to test his insulin.<br /><br />We just received the Glucotest pack and I have to say this is the easiest way to monitor glucose. I know it's working, because my cat without diabetes uses the box and the test strips do not register a high glucose level. A couple of things are a pain, but that is not the fault of the product.<br /><br />1) You have to watch them and monitor when they go in and out of the box, especially with two cats. We have two boxes, but since we can't gaurantee that the cat always goes to the same box we have to be diligent so that we don't see the non-diabetic cat's sample and assume it is our diabetic cat's.<br /><br />2) We use scoopable litter, so we have to dig around in the clump (I use a nail file & tweezers....eek) to pull out the test strip. It's worth it to help my kitty, but certainly kind of yucky.<br /><br />Otherwise, so far so good. The first time we used this we realized that our kitty's blood sugar was still very high, which surprised us since we had been upping his insulin based on his water intake & other behavioral factors (at the advice of our vet). Now we will be able to gather better info and pass that on to our vet, and adjust his meds acordingly.

review/summary: Purina Glucotest is a godsend!
review/text: I could not believe my prayers were answered when I discovered this product!  My cat was suffering from transient diabetes (caused by steroids).  He was heading for remission as the glucose levels began to drop but as the levels dropped, we had to keep adjusting his insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. I had been monitoring his urine glucose using Keto-Diastix for humans. This involved following him around until he was ready to urinate and then holding the stick in the stream to get a reading. (My cat and I have a very trusting relationship.)<br /><br />We had a holiday trip planned and I was a basket case worrying about how my pet sitter was going to find the time and patience to accomplish this during her busy holiday schedule. My Vet (the guy with the wings) mentioned he had heard of something that you sprinkle in the litter box and it gives you a reading.  He wasn't sure about it and had never seen the product.  An online search brought it up immediately in Amazon and I promptly purchased a package.  Sure enough, this package contained little pieces of confetti which you sprinkle into the litter box.  It lasts for five days and the color of the confetti tells you the level of glucose in the urine.  Genious!!!  We went on our vacation without fear, the sitter monitored the litter and all went splendidly!  By the time we got home, our kitty had gone completely into remission and was feeling fine.  The litter was clear and we were all very happy.<br />This product is a godsend for anyone who can't be there 24/7 to monitor their cat and can't do blood tests.  Let's hear it for Vets with wings, Purina and Amazon!

review/summary: the good, the bad
review/text: we order this for our diabetic cat. she has done well for three years with insulin shots twice a day. But we wanted to save the trip to the vets for bloodwork updates and insulin adjustments. We thought we would stress her out less and save a few dollars. Looking at paperwork that came with package we decided to call company and get a report of what is in the little pieces of paper that you place in the litter box. They sent out the requested paperwork. Upon reading it we decided it may not be worth the risk to the cat...if the cat while cleaning herself injected the tiny papers that have chemicals on it. Our vets is close to our house and we will have your monitored that way. On the other hand, we think it's a great product IF you can monitor your cat when it exits the cat box and make sure there are no test papers on it's fur, that may work. When we used the test we did not get a color change, not sure if the cat was in normal range or the test was flawed. We'd have to use a few times to really know for sure.

review/summary: Saved my kitten from more blood tests
review/text: You need to use a whole packet of the Glucotest at a time, and check the litter 2-3 times per day to assure accuracy.  Outside factors may have caused a faulty result from an earlier blood test for our kitten, but the test confetti did NOT turn colors.  We are comfortable that our kitten is diabetes free, without subjecting him to more blood tests.  Works great!

review/summary: saved my cat and me
review/text: The glucotest really works. I wanted an alternative to sticking my diabetic cat's ears to test his glucose levels. He was getting inconsistent readings at the vet because he was too stressed out there. (I took him off all grain, fed him canned meat catfood, then switched to the raw (frozen) meat diet). To successfully use the  purina glucotest confetti, make sure you mix it thoroughly into your cat's litter so it is all submerged. Any pieces floating on top I found did not give an accurate reading.The pieces that were submerged showed consistent readings and were verified by a recent blood test done at the vets when he was calm and not stressed. I checked the pieces by scooping up the clump of pee from litterbox and placing it on a piece of newspaper. That gave me room to pick out submerged confetti pieces with a pair of tweezers. That sounds wierd, but I am so pleased to be able to help my cat get healthy. He is stable now and getting better.

review/summary: Reliable & easy to use
review/text: My cat turned diabetic in March after being put on steroids for a lung infection.  I have been using this Glucotest product from Purina in her kitty litter to monitor the amount of sugar in her urine since that time.  The squares started out in the very darkest brown category (high sugar output).  After months of monitoring her urine with these squares every time she went, and keeping her vet informed and adjusting the amount of insulin she gets in the a.m. and p.m., it is exciting to see the squares are not changing color anymore and she is going into remission!  So, I want to encourage buyers to use this product in conjunction with your vet's professional orders for your cat.  I bought this on Amazon, which was a lot cheaper than at the vet's office. It was shipped very quickly and I received it in just two days!  Thanks Purina for a valuable product!

It's a<br />good product to determine the level of<br />glucose in your cat, and the higher the<br />level, the more you will need to visit your<br />Vet to check for glucose levels and possibly<br />to begin insulin injections.

review/summary: Wasn't quite what I expected, but still delicious
review/text: I tried a cinnamon hazel nut coffee from a different vendor recently.  While I didn't like the bitterness of the hazelnut, I did absolutely love what the cinnamon did to the flavor of the coffee.  I was so anxiously awaiting this version to compare, as I have found Donut Shop Classics to be some of the best pods I have tried.<br /><br />There really wasn't that much cinnamon flavor in this cup of coffee.  However, there was almost a buttery aftertaste that just felt like the after effects of a bite of coffee cake in the morning.

review/summary: Great Taco Seasoning in Bulk!
review/text: I love this taco seasoning!<br /><br />Growing up, my mom always bought taco seasoning in this bulk container because we had taco's so frequently.<br /><br />I didn't realize why she used the bulk container for seasoning until I had to start buying my own groceries - and I realized that taco seasoning was over a dollar a package!<br /><br />I like this container because you can customize how much seasoning and spice to add to the taco meat.  I also cook my taco meat with onion and I drain the fat before adding spices.  I add enough water to cover the meat before adding spices so the meat is all equally flavored.  I just cook on medium head until the water evaporates.<br /><br />Very yummy flavoring - I recommend to everyone!!

review/summary: Good price, Flavor not exactly right
review/text: It is approximately 8 cups of seasoning.  With 1/4 cup recommended per 1 lb meat, that's about 16 meals.  In my grocery store, taco seasoning pouches would have to be .25 each to beat this.  The best price I've seen in years is .33 and that's due to grocery wars going on in my town right now.  The flavor is nice, but something about it doesn't match other taco seasoning pouches.  I feel like I need to add a little something each time.  It is strong so I may be able to get by with 3 Tbsp instead of a full 1/4 cup and that would make it an even better deal.

Really delicious chips and each bag is 1 ounce which is a very good size!  I think I'm addicted.  Try them at your own risk.

review/summary: It's cheap, and it's bad for your cat.
review/text: I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes. Many cat owners use Meow Mix without experiencing some of these problems--but very few will use it without noticing *any* of them.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the "baseline," and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable).  Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.

review/summary: Made cats sick, destroyed beige carpet
review/text: Have 4 cats and gradually worked in this cat food over the course of a month.  Result was 2 cats apparently have an iron constitution.<br /><br />One cat puked every other day although he continued eating the food so he did like it.  Discovered that the reason I couldnt get it out of the beige rug is because they add RED DYE!  That must be to impress the consumer, doubt cats care about the color of the food.<br /><br />My other cat got very sick.  Was puking alot, stopped eating, went to the vet and they kept him overnight.  His Xrays showed "something" in his stomach which they could not tell was an object or serious gas.  Ended up being gas. Put him on Prescription Diet ID (VERY pricey).  He's back to normal but it took almost 2 weeks (and $500 later).  He's worth it though.  I wont even put this crap out for the feral cats that come up at night to eat.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Wrong Food in Can, and they won't man up about it.
review/text: I've bought Petguard for my cat for a good while. She needed a specific protein diet and this was the only thing we could find on the shelves locally. The food in the cans were always dry and old looking but she ate it and that is what counted.  One of my last purchases of a case of this online, I opened a can and it was different. Instead of the gray-pink food, it was dark and smelled like fish but it had the rice particles in it.  I thought maybe they changed their formula and like the law gives them.. 6 months to make changes to the label... eventually they would reveal the new formula for venison and rice.  I used a dozen cans of this dark fishy smell *venison and rice* and then ordered another case.  I opened up a can of the new case and it was back to the gray-pink food!  The dates for this new case showed it was manufactured after the dark fishy smell venison and rice.  That made me question what on earth my cat has been eating!  I've tried to contact Petguard sooo many times and I get no replies.  I will be recording opening a can of the *who knows what* venison and rice and putting it on youtube. Maybe then Petguard will see they made a big mistake and depending on allergies... the potential of killing pets with whatever they put in the venison and rice cans.<br /><br />My review is 2 star for the old gray-pink crumbly food, a 1 star for the unknown stuff.  I'd give a negative 5 star (if it was possible) to the foreign matter in this case of venison and rice cans.  And I'd give a negative 10 star for the company for making itself so difficult to get a hold of (they took off their facebook page... why???  And they haven't responded on twitter for a year and a half. And they do not respond to either email addresses they have on their current website.)<br /><br />I do not recommend Petguard, the food nor the company.
