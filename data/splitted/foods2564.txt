review/summary: Pure Joy in a Box
review/text: Words cannot express the immense pleasure I felt upon receiving these treats. Could it be? My favorite childhood cereal at long last discovered on Amazon! I have already had two orders of the four pack sent to me, and will no doubt be ordering more. I will savor every delicious bite until they are no longer available or expire. My hope is that the good people of Kelloggs continue to stock this item, even if only available for online purchase.

review/summary: Arrived when I had no milk!
review/text: I had been looking around in stores for years and could never come across a box of these.<br />I missed them so much, so I decided I'd search online a little.<br />Found them on Amazon, and I knew I had to order for the price.<br />They arrived packaged nicely in one box without any annoying Styrofoam or bubble-wrap in the mix.<br />I opened a box, and the cereal looked just a amazing as it did in my childhood.<br />All of the cereal is fresh; arrived on March 2nd, 2012, and expires December 2012!<br />The only downside is that I had no milk when it arrived, so it caused me a great deal of frustration that which I took out on my dog and wife.<br />Never again will I forget to buy milk!

I've gone to Shopt Rite, Acme, Super Fresh, Pathmark, you name it and NO ONE but NO ONE even knows what I'm talking about. So each year I purchase a 1/2 dozen or so to make it through the rasberry, blueberry season. Thank You Amazon and all who carries it for us to purchase...You're the best!

review/summary: Nostalgia tastes delicious!!
review/text: I debated about buying this for months, but I'm so glad I did! All four boxes will not expire for over six months, and they'll be eaten well before then.  It worked out to be $9.00+ per box including shipping, but value is what you're willing to pay for something. Since it's just as I remember, I couldn't be happier!  Some other reviews said this cereal was discontinued, but that is not true.  Kellogg's website has it listed and you can put in your zip code to find it locally.  Unfortunately there aren't any nearby me, so thank you, Amazon!!

review/text: I think I got overly excited when I saw that I could buy this on Amazon.  Memories of how great this cereal was came back to me when I saw this for sale: how I would eat the big chunks as a snack first, then the smaller pieces with cereal.  I immediately ordered it.  This definitely didn't let me down, it was just as I remembered.  The taste of rice krispies was excellent, yet it has a good texture for cereal. I feel a bit younger eating this cereal.

review/summary: Ah the nostalgia...
review/text: The reason why alot of people can't find this stuff in stores, is because it's "technically" out of circulation. Stores no longer carry it. Thus, here on Amazon is the only place you're going to find it. A bit pricey, but def. worth the nostalgia value! Especially for the taste. It's good stuff, just as you'll remember it from your childhood back in the 90's.<br /><br />I'm currently purchasing this for my girlfriend for the upcoming V-day. She used to love this stuff, and will more than likely be pleased to see there are still ways to obtain it. =]<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering up an out of circulation cereal product from my childhood! I just might be back to buy MYSELF some of this stuff!<br /><br />[Now if only Amazon sold "Squeez-It." My nostalgia would be complete.]

review/summary: better than rice krispies but with one fatal flaw
review/text: so many crumbs! out of the four boxes I got, all of them had about 20% of the box that had turned into RICE KRISPIE POWDER. I don't think it's a shipping problem because I have ordered cereal from amazon before and never had this problem. I think it's the design of this cereal that makes it crumble easily. if you like eating mush you might enjoy eating this.

review/summary: Love this cereal, but $31 (plus $15 s&h)?!?
review/text: I remember this cereal from when I was a kid, but I couldn't seem to find it anywhere. So I signed up to be notified when it became available from Amazon, lo and behold less than a week later I got an email telling me that it had become available. I was very pleased, until I saw the price tag. When a box of cereal costs over $46 (including s&h) it becomes less a novelty from your childhood and more a luxury item. I'm in college right now, I have just enough money for only a few luxury items; $45 is not a luxury I can afford. Five stars for the cereal, but I hope no one is foolish enough to buy it at this price.

Highly recommend this cereal for those just looking the recapture feelings of their childhood, or just to simply have a cereal that is superior to most of those out there these days.

This cereal puts almost every cereal (aside from the Blueberry muffin top cereal of course) to shame! If you have not had this you are missing out! It's sweet but not too sweet, and even gives the milk a marshmallowy taste.The 3 pack sure did not last long, as my girlfriend had never had it after the first bite she was hooked too!

Amazon ships the cereal quickly and the cereal is always fresh and months away from the expiration date.<br />While I love this cereal the recent decision to reduce the number of boxes to 3 without adjusting the price appropriately does not differentiate this package from buying boxes in the local grocery. I wish Amazon would reconsider selling this as a pack of 4.

review/text: So I was pleased to see that the cereal arrived before it's intended ship date, however when I poured my first bowl this morning and went for my first bite, I was pretty upset. I let it soak in the milk for a few minutes and then went to grab a big clump for my first bite, when I went to bite into it, it was rock-solid. I mean a hammer couldn't break through this stuff. It turns out all the clumps are the exact same way, and that's my favorite part of the cereal. So I'm still eating it and just not eating the clumps because it still tastes good, I was just ultimately let down by this.

review/text: Very happy to see they still do make this. When I saw it, I wanted some. When I saw the "Subscribe And Save" price, I ordered. Not as sugary as you might think, contains less sugar (and more vitamins) per serving than some "health conscious" cereals.

review/summary: Glad to have my TREATS again...
review/text: I have fond memories of Rice Krispies Treats cereal from my younger days and was glad to see it available on Amazon (since I haven't seen it in stores around me for years). It doesn't seem that they've changed much with it, because the taste is just what I recall (basically tastes like Rice Krispies treats without that marshmallow chewiness). It's definitely sweet cereal, but not overpoweringly so, and is perfect for breakfast or snacking (especially the big chunks). I was a little worried that the expiration date would be close, but I've got more than a few months to go, so that's good. If you're a fan of the cereal already, or Rice Krispies treats in general, you should pick this up. It's hard to find anywhere else and Amazon's price just about makes it a no-brainer.

review/summary: A great and hard to find cereal
review/text: "Rice Krispies Treat" Cereal is impossible to find nowadays.  I have looked at nearly 10 different locations for this product, only to be disappointed.  Needless to say, I was very excited that I found this cereal online at Amazon, and at such a great price.<br /><br />The Rice Krispies Treat Cereal is basically a sweeter version of the "Rice Krispies" Cereal.  The rice pieces are however more clumped together like "Rice Krispies Treats" bars would be.  This version does have more sugar than "Rice Krispies Cereal", but actually is less in calories (go figure.)  When I had this cereal as a kid, the cereal was more clumped together, but now the clumps are far fewer and smaller.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as it is easier to eat.<br /><br />Anyways, I rate this cereal very highly for kids especially.  You will find that it still have a lot of vitamins in it.  Being 23 years old, I still cannot get enough of this tasty cereal.

review/text: Most sugary kids' cereal tastes simply awful and chemical. But this one tastes so good! It's actually a bit sweeter than the RIce Krispie bars you would make for yourself, but it's a good kind of sweetness. The cereal comes in various-sized chunks but are uniform enough to eat. I don't eat this often, but I must admit, this is one of my all-time favorite cereals. It is freaking DELICIOUS.

review/text: This is a very hard to find cereal in stores, but yet you can get it from Amazon. At a little over $2 a box if you select subscribe and save, its a great deal. The cereal arrived in good condition and was fresh, it expires in Oct 2011 and I bought it in Jan 2011. But with the way this stuff tastes, it will be gone long before then. It tastes just like rice krispie treats, although its not as sticky as homemade ones.

review/text: WhenI first heard that I could buy this cereal online I was a little wary. I wasn't sure if I could trust that the cereal would be fresh or expired. I have been looking for this cereal for a long time because the stores in my area stopped selling it years ago due to the high sugar content. When I saw that I could get 4 boxes for 12 bucks, I had to order them. The shipment was received 2 days after, so I would say it was delivered quickly. I'd recommend this seller to everyone who loves this cereal.. Enjoy!

Woohoo!<br /><br />Definitely a recommended buy for the cereal lovers out there!

It's definitely one of my favorite cereals, I'm sad they don't produce it anymore.<br />I'm still not sure how this company has some of this cereal still since they've stopped making it...just overstock from when they did make it I guess?<br />Either way, mine was great and I'm already out and it was really tasty.

review/text: I got this on Amazon because I loved it when it first came out and they don't sell it much anymore at least not in the Northeast USA.  This comes in a 4-pack and if you remember the size of the cereal it isn't as big as lucky charms and those boxes, it's slimmer.  Still not a bad deal for the price because the cereal is awesome.  Kinda gets old after the 3rd box, but still a great cereal.  Expires at the end of 2010 which is good because other reviewers said their's came stale.  They should send you boxes with at least a year or close to it left on them.  Great cereal though.

But I had to try it out for myself, this was my last chance to eat this cereal. Im eating a bowl of this cereal from heaven right now and I couldn't be happier. It tastes exactly like I remember and they don't expire until jan.2010!! They'll be gone long before then, but thanks to amazon I can have them whenever I want!

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

Just warm it with milk and it's great. Or you can refrigerate the chai mix and add cold milk for iced chai.<br /><br />This is also a great drink for those cold winter evenings when you need something warm, but don't particularly want a caffeinated beverage that will wake you up.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2011

When they do respond they try telling me that the $52 price is for the 6 pack and not the 12 pack and the 12 pack is $102, I might as well go to Starbucks everyday at that price (I NEVER go to Starbucks fyi). the tea arrives in a flimsy cardboard case with the receipt of sale taped up on the box making it impossible to read once opened unlike ordering directly from Oregon Chai's website that packs everything in biodegradable peanuts (iirc they are made from cardboard as well) keeping everything safe, neat and organized.

review/summary: Awful; terrible; wretched
review/text: So, I ordered a box with 12 bags of sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are healthy; they're rich in that "good" fat that lowers your cholesterol; and I think they're also rather tasty.  This final adjective, however, doesn't describe Sunridge Farms' Organic Sunflower Seeds.  I opened the first bag.  Took a couple of bites and then spit them out.  I tried a second bag.  Same reaction.  I wondered whether or not there was something wrong with my own taste, so I offered them to someone whose sense of taste I respect.  She had the same reaction I had.  In short, these sunflower seeds are inedible.  It's like chewing on rancid, tasteless cardboard.  I threw out the entire shipment.  There are far better options available.

review/text: I wanted organic raw sunflower seeds to use in making homemade granola. These were perfect - a nice crisp, tasty, nut-like addition that really complement the other flavors. You can also toast these in the oven or stovetop for a crunchy healthy snack. I originally thought a pack of 12 would last me a long long time, but after snacking on these and seeing how delicious they are, I'm pretty sure I'll go through the 12 packs much more quickly than I thought!

review/summary: allergens not listed correctly on amazon
review/text: I think the allergy statement on this page is REALLY MISLEADING.  It only warns about peanuts and tree nuts, when actually the package also mentions a number of other allergens that these sunflower seeds were exposed to.  If there was no allergen statement, I would have contacted the manufacturer to find out the allergen statement for this product.  But because there is allergen info in the description on Amazon, I assumed that it was the complete list, so I went ahead and ordered these, only to find out that actually these "may contain" wheat and other allergens.  My family is very allergic to wheat.  So now we've got a ton of useless sunflower seeds.  I think the description of this product should contain either a current allergen listing, or no allergen listing, but not an incomplete one -- that's misleading.

review/summary: Very bland
review/text: These might mean well, but I found the seeds to be very bland.  NO SALT is added, which I did not realize when I bought them:( Also, you should note that they need to be refrigerated once opened. Not very convenient when taking them on trips or to the beach.  These may be good on salads , but otherwise, I found them to be less than desirable. I guess a real health food nut would like these.  I try to eat organic, all natural foods as much as I can. But, I can find much better tasting stuff than these seeds. On a positive note, sunflower seeds are among the healthiest foods you can eat.  VERY good for you. I ended up giving almost all of this shipment to the food for the poor.

review/text: Now I won't eat any other kind. Black rice is a natural anti inflammatory which is very evident to me since I have multiple food allergies and intolerances. I handle black rice better than any other grain. Lotus foods black rice is of very good quality.

review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

review/summary: Cherry Syrup
review/text: I purchased not only the cherry syrup from "Back to Basics" but 3 others syrups along with the "Slushie" machine before two of my grandsons had their tonsils removed.  They loved the cherry syrup the most, it had alot of flavor and it was the one flavor they asked for the repeatedly after they had their surgeries.  Most children do not want "all the ice cream you can eat" that the doctors tell them they can have post-op. Children and adults alike must drink to prevent dehydration after a tonsilectomy.  This syrup and the slushie machine was a wonderful way of getting my grandchildren to drink something cold to soothe their throats, but also something sweet so they felt they were getting some kind of a treat after going through the surgery.

review/summary: yummy
review/text: We enjoy this syrup, but there is still room for improvement. Obviously, it is sugary, which is not good for health concious folks. I imagine that the sugar free kind probably is not as tasty, but we might give it a try this summer. I will let you know if I do! The other downside is that you need to use a fairly large amount each time; otherwise, as the ice melts, your slushy or snow cone becomes watered down. You can easily go through this small bottle after just 6 uses. That being said, I'd rather hit the Dairy Queen drive-thru and let them do the work for me. It really does not cost much more to do so (about $1.69 for one arctic rush where I live), and it saves time and effort. If you are determined to do it yourself, though, this is quite delicious!

review/summary: Nasty Chemical Extract
review/text: I ordered this product to make white, strawberry-flavored icing for some cupcakes for a wedding. since it was so expensive, i did not test it to make sure it actually tasted like strawberry before baking day. My Mistake! It smelled like bad bubblegum and tasted like Windex or something - just a terrible, chemical taste. i made the icing, then tasted it and thought "what was on my finger!? nail polish remover or something?" well I hadn't done my nails, it was the icing! i could not serve that. I had to start over and use vanilla at the last minute. Thankfully the bride was very understanding. I DO NOT recommend this product. (Also, when I contacted the seller to try to send it back, they would never reply. Obviously they don't stand behind what they sell. Money Wasted.)

review/text: When I think of Lindt chocolate, I think of silky-smooth richness. No matter how true the chili-chocolate combination is to chocolate's New World origins, it doesn't quite match my impression of Lindt's reserved elegance.<br /><br />Well, I'm wrong a lot. Lindt pulls it off beautifully. The chocolate flavor is all you might hope for, but with a high, thin note of tingle in the aftertaste. It hints at chili's fire, but only just warms the mouth. Delightful!<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/text: I had been buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27JIW">Silver Springs Mustard, Jalapeno, 9.5-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 9)</a>, but Amazon stopped carrying it. This mustard tastes almost identical to the Silver Springs and, because of the larger bottle, it is easier to squeeze more of the mustard out. Like another reviewer, Amazon sent me only one bottle instead of the case of 6, but when I notified them of the problem they shipped me a case overnight. This mustard is so good that I need to find things to put it on... a nice hot pretzel would be perfect.
