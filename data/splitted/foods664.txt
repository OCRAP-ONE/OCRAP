review/text: I ordered these for my son (age 11). He doesn't like them at all. I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust.

review/text: These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...

review/text: Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire.

review/text: Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade.

review/summary: Prefer the rice Earth's Best over this one
review/text: We've used this cereal many times for our twins and have had no problems. It's a great brand.  Earth's Best rice cereal is made from whole brown rice whereas this one lists organic whole oat flour as the first ingredient.  Flour compared to whole grain, for the same price.  That first ingredient is a qualitative difference, whole rice versus oat flour, is the reason we go for the rice one when we can.<br /><br />I have to load up at the store when they have Earth's Best rice cereal. They always have this one, the Whole Grain Oatmeal Cereal though. This one is never sold out.<br /><br />Both of the two above-mentioned cereals work perfectly in formula, mixing right in as you'd want. Our babies are growing and they liked these cereals the moment they were introduced. Of course, one has to test a food out on one's baby(s). You never know if for some reason your baby will have a negative reaction. But we've had a very positive experience with Earth's Best. We also subscribe through Amazon to several Earth's Best baby food jars.

review/summary: Not bad for diet, if you like the regular Moxie
review/text: I was thrilled when they developed Diet Moxie as I usually drink diet soda. This is faithful to the recipe of the regular Moxie, without sacrificing too much of what makes Moxie Moxie. For a very limited product (only really available in scattered locales in New England), I was frankly surprised that they would produce a diet edition, but am very happy that they have. I understand all the reservations the full-octane drinkers have about diet drinks, but if you love Moxie as I do, your avenue is not cut off for enjoying the flavour of it if you need a diet variety.

review/summary: Diet Moxie has moxie
review/text: I was very pleased to discover a few years ago that HometownFavorites continues to sell Moxie, which according to Wikipedia has "a unique flavor that is not as sweet as that of most modern soft drinks and that is described by some as bitter".  Most sodas are too yucky sweet for my taste, but Moxie has a zingy flavor that I really like.<br /><br />Even so, I don't drink any non-diet soda (non-nutritional junk, imho), so I'm glad that a diet version is available.  I've bought it both directly from HometownFavorites and via Amazon.<br /><br />Some of its appeal to me is undoubtedly nostalgia for a regional brand from New England, where I grew up. (I don't recall actually drinking the stuff as a kid.  It was out of fashion by that time, and like most kids, I probably wouldn't have liked the slightly bitter taste.)  If you're looking for a soda for grownups, you might like Moxie.

review/summary: Great sauce, but VERY spicy
review/text: I originally purchased from my local Wegmans supermarket in mid-March 2011, but they no longer carry it.  My brother and I found this to be a delicious sauce, though much spicier than other Kung Pao sauces we were used to.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and will be ordering from Amazon as it is actually less expensive than ordering from Starport directly.<br /><br />The "heat level" is probably closer to or slightly more than the "heat" of a product like Gold's Szechuan Duck Sauce, which is usually easier to find in the Philadelphia area.<br /><br />One other note:  this has the unusual name of "GENERAL Kung Pao Sauce", which I had never seen associated with "Kung Pao" before.  I only every saw "General" with "Tso", as in "General Tso's Sauce".  And, as I inquired about availability from other local retailers, they invariably thought I meant "General Tso". Surprisingly, Starport did not provide an image; I copied this from their website in case you want to share with friends or show to a local retailer ~ hope Starport doesn't mind...).

I wanted to find out what was in the sauce in the hopes of making it at home.  When I inquired of the person behind the counter he showed me a large bottle of the General Kung Pao sauce.  I ordered several bottles from Amazon.com and found it just as delicious as the offering at Bristol Farms.  You need do little more than cut up your favorite vegetables (and meat, if so inclined), place some oil in a wok, and pour in this pre-made sauce.  I usually make my stir fry sauces from scratch.  When time is short I now reach for the General Kung Pao sauce.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Foie Gras
review/text: As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras  mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras.  It is not as good as the product we purchased in Paris and brought back with us in January, but it was all I could find that was affordable.  Store in Refrigerator and note the long shelf life. Very tasty.

review/summary: Who eats Fois Gras?
review/text: So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods?  What gives?  Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is?  And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line.  So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal).  People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding.

review/summary: Diabeti Sweet IS the answer for baking for your Diabetic!
review/text: My husband has been a Diabetic for years........and until Diabeti Sweet came out.......it was a real problem to try and bake any items for him, that would taste, bake and LOOK like the item was supposed to.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet looks like real sugar....feels light real sugar....and weighs like real sugar....thus when you make a cake, or cookies or any other item......it comes out looking just like the original recipe made with real sugar.  When you use "those other" sugar substitutes, they don't have any weight, as a result, your cake is flat both is looks and taste....your cookies never set up, because there is no volume to them.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet IS the best thing since sliced pickles!

review/summary: Not as healthy as I would have liked
review/text: I bought this during the lightning deals specials and thought it would make a nice snack tray for everyone to pick at instead of eating junk. I was rather disappointed when I read the ingredients and found that the fruit not only has fake color (I'm allergic to Red 40) but is also injected with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Why do manufacturers constantly seem to seek out new ways to ruin something that should be good? Overall, the pineapples (and cherries, according to my kids) are too sweet and taste a little wrong, but I'm pretty happy with the figs and apricots.

review/summary: Fruit basket not exactly as pictured or described and not so great
review/text: While this fruit basket looks nice enough, it is not exactly as it is described here.<br /><br />According to my inventory and the actual product label, the basket contains:<br /><br />dates, apricots (preserved with sulphur dioxide), prunes (preserved with potassium sorbate), pineapple (processed with cane sugar and citric acid, preserved with sulphur dioxide), coconut date roll (dates, almonds and coconut), cherries (processed with corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, water citric acid, natural and artificial flavor, preserved with potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and sulphur dioxide, artificial color - FD&C red no. 40).<br /><br />The basket does not contain:<br /><br />Apples, Figs, Pears or Peaches<br /><br /> - All of which are listed as included in the Amazon product description.<br /><br />Also the Amazon description says "Made of assorted dried fruit from the fertile California Valley" and "This generous, large basket provides two pounds, 12 ounces of sweet, healthy, and delicious dried fruit from the fertile California Valley," but according to the actual product label, the product contains fruit from The Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and the USA (in that order).  I wouldn't have even purchased it if I knew that.  At least China isn't listed.<br /><br />Additionally, some of the fruit just isn't that great.  For instance, some of the dried apricots were moist and some of them were tough and dry - some of the dates were moist but some were bone dry.  The cherries are basically maraschino cherries without the jar - IMO, they don't really belong in there.  The prunes were all pretty good and the dried pineapple was okay.  The coconut covered dates were also good, but there are only six of those.<br /><br />Also, it's not really "healthy" to consume all of those preservatives (that aren't mentioned in the description) such as sulphur dioxide, potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate.  I'm not even going to get into the problems with those colored fructose soaked cherry hulls.<br /><br />If you spent $40 on assorted dried fruits and made up your own baskets, you could probably make four of five baskets of fruit of better quality than this.  It's not that this basket is bad, but it just wasn't worth $40.  I's say $15, tops.<br /><br />Please see my photos of the actual item and the label to see for yourself.

review/summary: My family loves Ahmad Strawberry Iced Tea
review/text: Here in North Texas we drink iced tea almost every day throughout the year.  I first tried Ahmad Strawberry Tea when it was enclosed with a tea set I purchased for our daughter.  My whole family loved it.  The mango and peach/passion fruit teas are also good, but strawberry ranks as our favorite flavor.  After our local market stopped carrying the Ahmad line, we have been half-heartedly trying other fruit teas, but they don't compare; many of them seem more like Kool-aid with a slight tea flavor.  I look forward to trying other flavors that we weren't able to find in our area.

review/summary: Best Taste & Best Value By Far
review/text: This product is by far the best brand flavored tea I have ever tasted.  I find that other brand flavored teas have such a wonderful aroma, however, the tea tends to be bitter--tasting nothing like the intended fruited flavor.  The Ahmad strawberry tea has a rich and smooth strawberry flavor, no matter how long I allow the tea bags to steep.  My family loves it as iced tea--as do I. We enjoy it so much, I make full, three-quart pitchers at a time and its always gone by the end of the day.  This year, I have already purchased four large boxes--20ct/6 bx--120 tea bags per box and now am purchasing the last of the 10 ct/12 bx box. I've gotten some great deals on here (as low as $.12 cent/tea bag)--on the internet, this tea runs $.18-.20/tea bag which adds up when you are buying 120-240 ct boxes.

review/summary: Um, acquired taste for others...
review/text: I happen to love acai and blueberries. So I was happy with this juice. Heck I'd even use it as a mixer. My family, not so much. One of them referred to it as my "Enya Juice." Clearly I was being made fun of for being "earthy" and perhaps tree hugging. I let this one go. I settled for fresh oj not made from concentrate. Everyone is happy and I still get to be secretly earthy... And make good screwdrivers.

review/summary: Best bags for iced tea, excellent deal
review/text: First, Luzianne makes the best classic brewed iced tea, hands down.  The family sized bags make 1 quart per bag, 48 quarts per box, 12 gallons of iced tea x 6 boxes @ $4.72 a box, thats 72 gallons of iced tea, certainly enough for the summer season and then some, plus free shipping if you play your cards right and order something else; you just can't beat that.  You can't get Luzianne cheaper anywhere else.<br /><br />So stop buying the instant iced tea mix crap, get some of these bags and brew your own.

review/summary: Best Tea On The Market.
review/text: Just had this tea with dinner, iced.  This tea beats Lipton hands down.  I would wager that in a blind test taste anyday.  In my opinion these tea bags when steeped, make a bolder tasting tea.<br /><br />It has a great dark color, and when made as iced tea, tastes great and is refreshing.  One 48 ct package seems to last my household forever.<br /><br />Great way to add even more flaver:  After you are done brewing a batch of tea, add fresh mint trimmings to the mixture, let it sit for a while.  Adds a great mint flaver to an already great tasting tea.  We do this in the summer time on a weekly basis.<br /><br />This deal that Amazon is offering is actually a GREAT offer and I may have take advantage of this soon.<br /><br />If you are a die hard Lipton drinker, I beseach you to try this just once, I believe you will find it better in quality than what you have been drinking.<br /><br />Remember tea is relatively healthly, drinking this instead of Coke is always a good substitution.  After all Coke-Cola will rust a nail to nothing if you leave it submerged, what's drinking it doing to your body?<br /><br />Hope this helps, and have a good day.

review/summary: THE One and Only Iced Tea
review/text: There is no other suitable alternative. If your are making Southern Sweet Tea, the options are use Luzianne or don't bother. I'm not really sure what to say other than that. The discrepancy in quality between Luzianne and its next closest competitor is huge. It is such a big difference that Luzianne is worth ordering if it is not available in your area.<br />THE Southern Sweet Tea recipe is:<br />- 1 part boiling water<br />- 3 parts hot water(not boiling)<br />- 1 family-size Luzianne tea bag per cup of boiling water (use more bags for more flavor)<br />- 0.25-0.75 part granulated sugar (depending on taste)<br /><br />1) Pour boiling water over tea bags (DO NOT AGITATE, JUST POUR)<br />2) Let steep for 5 minutes without agitation (don't stir, don't squeeze, don't do anything!)<br />3) Remove tea bags quickly without squeezing or draining and discard<br />4) Pour steeped tea into hot water<br />5) Mix in sugar and stir until dissolved<br />6) Serve over ice

review/summary: My Favorite Black Tea for Sweet Iced Tea
review/text: I'm from the south and Cold Sweet Iced Tea is like water. I'm very picky about it and it has to be freshly brewed and sweet'n to perfection while it's still warm. I do use a tea maker to brew it nearly daily.  I like to add a little Mint as well (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E67210">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Mint Magic, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>). Not to strong either.<br /><br />Obviously being so picky I've tried many different kinds of black teas and this is just my favorite. 2 Family bags to a gallon, one Mint tea bag and little over a cup of sugar pure cane.  Some people like it like liquid candy and others I know like it just barely sweet. I'm in the middle. I want to be able to taste the tea herb flavor but for it not to be bitter.<br /><br />Hope this helps. I highly recommend it ;)

Nice color too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys their ice tea.

review/text: We were a little hesitant going with this brand, but it is fantastic.  The bags are large so you only need to use four of them in a tea maker.  We also make two batches of tea with the same 4 bags and do not notice a difference in taste or potency.  We got this tea about a month ago and are still on the first of the six boxes we received.  I have us set up on the automatic shipment every six months and I think that will plenty of time in between.

review/summary: Best Tea Blend Ever!
review/text: You can't get better tea than Luzianne.  Tetley, Lipton, Rose Red, etc. don't even compare.  I love the delicious Orange Pekoe/Black Tea blend because it is the perfect combination of fruity and roast flavor.  My family has been buying Luzianne for years.  I just bought a 48 pack of family size tea bags at Walmart tonight and I love how large they are.  I've been drinking almost nothing but tea and water for about a week now because I am trying to wean myself of soda.  It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!<br /><br />Just a helpful tip:<br /><br />I have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.  Let it steep for the full 5 minutes.

review/summary: Great for Summer Iced Tea Lovers!
review/text: I am new to brewing iced tea at home, and I must say, Luzianne tea is fantastic for this very purpose.  The flavor profile is not too robust, but not weak.  It's a perfect balance of black tea that will leave you wanting more!  I use subscribe and save and take advantage of the great price.<br /><br />Some people use home brewers, but they take all the fun out of tea making.  I've adopted the below strategy for the perfect cup of iced tea.<br /><br />Place six cups of tap water in a pot.  Pour 2/3 cup of sugar into the pot, and then bring this simple syrup to a rolling boil, with an occasional stir.  When you reach the rolling boil, steep three of the family sized teabags for about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.  Allow the bags to sit in the pot for 5-10 minutes.  Use a wooden spoon to squeeze any remaining tea out of the bags, and discard.  Allow your tea concentrate to cool to room temperature.  Pour six cups of fresh water into an empty gallon jug (preferably glass, but BPA free plastic works as well).  Then, pour your tea concentrate into the same jug.  You now have delicious iced tea - refrigerate, and serve with ice and a wedge of lemon!  Variations: 1 cup of sugar for southern sweet, 1/4 cup of sugar for sunkissed sweet, or no sugar at all if you like unsweetened tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: UNPARALLELED HOT SAUCE!!!!!!!!
review/text: This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Lime Notes: Zingy with a fresh lime (not that awful concentrated flavor)... It goes perfectly on salad when mixed with some olive oil and chicken with a mexican twist or as a marinade for pork (that's the ways I've tried and loved it).
