review/summary: Good taste, but difficult to get out of package
review/text: I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/text: Tasted these bars in a health food store and grabbed several flavors ot Kind bars to try.  The chocolate cherry cashew ones are like crack -- totally addicting!  Amazing blend of tastes makes me feel like I'm sneaking a candy bar instead of a healthy, wholesome friut and nut bar.  These are soft and chewy with with wonderful nuts throughout.  Major indulgence and healthy snack in one.  FAB product!

review/text: The dark chocolate cherry cashew kind plus bar combines everything I enjoy. The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the cashews add the right amount of crunch.

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: Helped my geriatric cat
review/text: This food was well worth the price!  I will not buy cat food from the stores again!  I bought Cowboy Cookout for my 17-year-old kitty who has been going downhill for a while now.  Her blood tests came back normal, but she's been having a lot of gastrointestinal issues on top of feline dementia.  In the last two weeks since starting her on it, she's stopped throwing up almost completely (which she had been doing on a daily basis), and doesn't have as many tummy problems in general.  She is more alert, more aware, and much more like herself. Who knew that food could make such a dramatic difference?  I highly recommend Merrick's Cowboy Cookout!

review/text: This has a lovely nutty taste that is addictive. Very fresh tasting. My only issue is that the kernels do not pop entirely, so even though it does not have the flaky hull what I am left with is about 1/3+ of the popcorn that are 50% popped and 50% hard dense yellow kernel. This is not nice to chew either. Normally the partially popped ones are the best flavor but these are chewy and so dense they don't budge, wind up in the trash.<br />Still looking for my popcorn.

review/summary: Ti Kwan Yin Flowery, 1st Grade Loose Leaf Oolong Tea ...... No Flowers Here
review/text: I was introduced to the "Iron Goddess" in a friends Chinese restaurant.  The Tie Guan Yin I was introduced to (which was her personal stock) had a light or subtle floral fragrance.  My friend is from Fuzhou, PRC and her family works in the tea industry there.  The tea she gave me to drink was lighter or milder on the polyphenols, with a bold fruity flavor or quality and a sweet lingering finish with an orchid like aroma. This product is not at all that smooth and no floral aroma or sweet taste or finish.  The polyphenol  taste is noticeable when compared to the type she had.  I will not fault the service of the company but sample before you buy.

review/summary: nice and hardly weak
review/text: On my third bag of this coffee something happened.  It wasn't the same.  It has a skunky taste -- really atrocious. I am done with this one and Copper Moon coffee<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />The charge of this being weak is laughable.  It is a sturdy roast.  It is missing the harshness of poor beans.  This is an excellent coffee without acidity.  It has a nice caramel note.<br /><br />I'm grinding it with a Braun burr mill and brewing in a Cuisinart automatic machine.  The Cuisinart is one of the few that provided proper temperature. It could be slightly faster but it is still faster than most and that avoids the bitter aftertaste of cheaper/slower pots.  Cuisinart isn't the perfect brewer but it is close.

review/text: We're a bit picky about our coffee. We don't like over-roasted, burnt-tasting or weak coffee beans. Copper Moon has, IMHO, perfected the roasting process. While this may be a Sumatra "blend," the end result is delicious, Rich, dark, creamy, not bitter, and has no over-bearing acidity. We use it in our Senseo machine, and it produces a light and fluffy crema. Hey, Amazon! Please don't raise the price or discontinue selling this coffee. I have no interest in switching to a Keurig maker and the quality of the "senseo" pods  has hit an all-time low.

review/text: As someone who is happily addicted to Dr Pepper, I felt it my duty to try it in its purest form--Dr Pepper made with Imperial Cane Sugar.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at my first gulp.<br /><br />It certainly tastes like Dr Pepper, but I couldn't notice any huge improvement in the taste or difference in viscosity (you may laugh at my use of this word, but Dr Pepper is the oil that my body runs on).<br /><br />Could it be that this "Imperial Cane Sugar" thing is just a cheap marketing trick?<br /><br />Actually, it's not.<br /><br />If you do try Dr Pepper with Imperial Cane Sugar MAKE SURE you contrast it (right then and there) with a can of Regular Dr Pepper.<br /><br />THEN, you will taste the difference.<br /><br />The Imperial Dr Pepper has more flavor and kick. It tastes more "real". Immediately chasing it with a sip of regular Dr Pepper, you notice how "thin" and "watered down" it tastes in comparison.<br /><br />So with two cans of Dr Pepper side-by-side--one Imperial and one Regular--the obvious palate-pleaser is the Imperial. However, Regular is the obvious logical choice once you factor in the price differential and the fact that Imperial Dr Pepper is not commonly found in stores.<br /><br />But in the end, it doesn't really matter whether you choose Imperial or Regular Dr Pepper--either way you are drinking the Nectar of the Gods.

Next time I'll use spinach or kale, instead. I used mild Italian chicken sausage from the butcher case but next time I'll try the spicier turkey Italian bulk sausage made in another store. (You'll want to remove the casings from the sausage.) Try the other varieties. Many of the soups can be cooked in a Slow Cooker (crock pot) all day long. This sausage and lentil soup cooks in such a short time, it's not worth it. All of the Frontier Soups have little to no salt and they're terrific.

review/text: This is indeed "dark" chocolate and not "bittersweet" as the label on the Toblerone package indicates; so it is rather sweet, but unlike USA produced products still tastes like that apparently elusive substance known as chocolate. The honey almond nougat is unfortunately mostly lost amidst the chocolateness, but it gives the bar a nice crunch when it is hastily chewed, or a slight stickiness when the bar is slowly savored. In short you can make a meal out of--a portion--of this bar. It's not some vile brown sugary confection, nor is it a gourmet experience; it's simply a satisfyingly rich chocolate bar.

review/text: If you know a dark chocolate lover or if you are one yourself, Toblerone deserves a chance. I found a bar of this Dark Chocolate w/ almond Toblerone in Atlanta once, but haven't been able to find it locally (I live in Louisiana.) The item was shipped quickly and I used the majority of the bars for stocking stuffers. Exceptional taste and quality.

review/text: A co-worker bought me one of these from Marshall's and I absolutely loved it.  I'm an on-line shopper and was thrilled to find a 12 pack of these for such a reasonable price.  I thought Ghiradelli's Dark Chocolate was the best until I tried this.  It does have nuts in it but that doesn't bother me.  Actually adds to the flavor of the chocolate in my opinion.  This is so far the best dark chocolate I have had.

review/summary: Overpowering
review/text: The reason why I love Toblerones is the honey toffee chips. Unfortunately, the dark chocolate overpowers the honey flavor. The chocolate in itself is not bad. It's probably about in the middle in terms of quality. It's not particularly smooth, but it's better than Hersheys by a longshot. Just try to avoid chewing this treat up so you can still enjoy the honey toffee and almond flavor at the end.

review/text: I wouldn't say this rates anywhere near "best dark chocolate", but I grew up on the original Toblerone and have always enjoyed it.  I'm a dark chocolate nut now and I rarely eat white or milk chocolate, so I had to try the dark chocolate version and I really prefer it to the other two types.  The honey/almond nougat is what makes it good though, not specifically the dark chocolate.

review/summary: Does not look appetizing, but tastes great.
review/text: The rock candy did not come in nice long pretty strands as shown in the picture. It's more like candy on bits and pieces of string. It's in a bag, and then shipped in a box with no padding at all. By the time it got to me it looked like it had been beaten up pretty badly. There were many pieces still in tact, but it resembled dirty rainbow colored rock salt. Too expensive for what I got, in my opinion.<br /><br />I ordered 2 packages of this candy to take to a 4th of July party. The package arrived too late, despite my 2-day shipping. It wouldn't have mattered if it got to me on time, however, because I would have been embarrassed to give this to the hosts of the party for the guests.<br /><br />It did taste great so it did not go to waste, thus the 3 stars rather than 1.

Mix crust, mix filling (which is good chocolate pudding) and mix topping. No bake and very easy. Three hours in the fridge and you have this perfect billion calorie creation. My husband and I could not decide which layer (crust, pudding or topping) we liked best. All were wonderful.<br /><br />For a special occasion, a fresh custard pie you make yourself.<br /><br />Surprisingly easy and tastes quite good.

IF you buy them from some place that sells them at the right price.<br /><br />So, they are a 5-star treat - dogs LOVE them - but make sure you don't overspend because you don't have to.

review/summary: Glad to find it!
review/text: I am glad to have found the Hazelnut Butter from Dundee Orchards.  I have a chocolate protein shake almost every day and add nut butter for protein and to be more filling.  I use hazelnut butter because both of my kids are allergic to peanuts -- and I love hazelnuts.  I used to be able to find it in specialty grocery stores.  Now I can only find it online.  It is getting harder and harder to find as many manufactures are adding chocolate.  This hazelnut butter is great.  Of course, because it is natural (and has no trans fats) you have to stir it.  Set the jar upside down overnight and then turn it right side up and open it.  Most of the oil will have sunk to the bottom.  Go ahead and stir it until creamy one time and put it in the refrigerator.  You won't have to stir it again.

review/summary: Another Good Choice in Organic Cookies
review/text: After my positive experience with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUT89A">Health Valley Cookie Cremes, Double Chocolate</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2S">Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O's, 16-Ounce Packages</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2I">Newman's Own Organics Alphabet Cookies, Cinnamon, 10-Ounce Bags</a>, I thought I would give Country Choice a go.  So far, I'm "4-for-4" in ordering good organic cookies.  I took a chance and bought them without trying them first.  I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon is a good tasting cookie that have all the benefits of sweetness we would expect from cookies, but lacking the artificial ingredients consistent with cookies commonly on the market.  The cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, but the taste is quite strong and the cookies are sweet, a surprise from my initial introduction to organic cookies that had the flavor and consistency of the cardboard box they were stored in.<br /><br />There are some points the consumer needs to know; they may be minuses for some, but they're certainly pluses for me:<br /><br />1) The cookies are VERY sweet; I had to have a glass of milk with them.  While I adore sweet cookies, it may turn some people off.  Be mindful of that.<br /><br />2) The taste of ginger is overwhelmed by the strongest taste of lemon in cookies I've ever had.  To me this would be a significant minus, except that I absolutely love the lemony taste in cookies.  The aroma is heavenly, but the taste is so powerful it seems almost artificial.  Oddly, I can taste a hint of ginger when they're dunked in milk (any explanation from food chemists/scientists out there?).  Again I love that taste, but others may not.  If you want the gingery taste, you would have to be an expert food taster to find it here (in my opinion).<br /><br />3) While these cookies are made with organic and natural ingredients (no hydrogenated oils or trans fats), they're still cookies: they are loaded with sugar, sodium and carbs.  Two cookies pack a whopping 130 calories; 50 calories from fat.  Remember, organic does not always mean healthy.  And because these cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, and very tasty, it is very easy to overeat them.<br /><br />4) These cookies (barely) pass my all-important "dunkability" test, where they adequately absorb milk to compliment the flavor of the cookies (Oreo's, despite their artificial ingredients, is still king in the dunkability of cookies, in my honest opinion).  They taste delicious when dunked, but these cookies begin to fall apart quickly, so holding them under milk for a length of time could be problematic.<br /><br />Given the minuses I've indicated, you wonder: why do I give it four stars.  Simple: I love them.  Taste, like beauty, is in the eye (or palate) of the beholder.  And I can't get enough of them.  While my opinion is unquestionably biased, I try to give as much unbiased information on the product as I can.  Use it to make your decision.<br /><br />As with all Amazon grocery products, I recommend going to a supermarket or specialty store (Whole Foods, for example), buy a single pack and sample the cookies before you buy the entire case.  I took a gamble and bought the case untested; it's a gamble that has paid dividends for me.

review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Vanilla creme filling between two vanilla wafers. The vanilla wafers are very light and crispy which goes well with the smooth vanilla creme. Vanilla bliss. More crumbly than the chocolate wafers. Kosher D from processing on shared equipment. 65 kcal per cookie. I put 2-4 cookies in zipper snack bags to make convenient portions.

They may be more expensive than Oreos but it is well worth it. Highly recommended.

review/text: Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon cookies are the tastiest sandwich cookies on the market.  They have a tangy, fresh flavor that tickles the tongue and sets them apart from other, more mundane cookies.  I only wish that they were more widely available locally.  My whole family goes through six packages in about a week.  If you want to stock your larder with an adventurous snack, you can't miss with these delicious sandwich cookies.

review/summary: Super great - way better than Oreos
review/text: These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion.  They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days.  They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all!  The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor.  The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness.  I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed.  The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!
