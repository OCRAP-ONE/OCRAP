review/summary: Tasty Veggie Snack - Love them!
review/text: If you are looking for a healthy alternative to typical crunchy, salty snacks, these are a must try. My daughter loves them, my boys not so much. I LOVE them, but tend to lean towards healthier tasting foods. These are very airy and crunchy. They would be an easy snack for a toddler.  If you are watching your weight or "dieting", these do contain fat so you have to watch total consumption. Overall, one of my absolute favorite snacks!

review/summary: Different kind of snack
review/text: My two youngest daughters love these snack crisps, my oldest daughter can't stand them. I'm in between...they're ok, and they do add some variety to a gluten-free diet. The texture is similar to snacks made with corn, but the green pea flavor definately comes through in this. I do with they used a little less oil. Other than that, it's a pretty good snack.

review/summary: Great Product, great service
review/text: We were familiar with the Snapea Crisps from a local retailer and were happy to find the product on Amazon.  We selected the automatic reorder service which gives free shipping and a discount on the product.  The Snapea Crisps have come twice so far and were fresh on both occasions and at a lower cost than the local supplier.  The automatic reorder feature is great.  I receive an email a few days before the shipment detailing the order information and the total cost.  This gives me plenty of time to decline the order if I so chose.  The email includes handy links to cancel the shipment or to edit the auto-order options.  I couldn't be more pleased with the product or the process.  I would recommend to others.

review/text: These things are addicting. I love the taste and crunch. I eat mine with humas. Although they may have about the same calories/fat as potato chips I rationalize that they do at least have some protein and are therefore maybe a little bit more healthy.

They're tasty but not something I can eat an entire bag of.  I think that's a good thing though as it helps me keep my portion size down. :)

review/summary: They're Tasty!
review/text: I try to generally follow a low-carb lifestyle and eat as much whole food as I can but every so often I crave something that just seems bad for you. I could easily grab a small bag of chips at the neighborhood bodega but there is a store only two miles away that sells these tasty treats which satisfy my cravings without leaving me feeling like I've totally blown my diet. At 12 net grams of carbohydrates per serving (and there are 3+ servings in the bag) they're certainly not low-carb, but they also don't have a lot of the additives or MSG that many chips have. Honestly, I would have given them 5 stars had they not used GMO corn oil because I really like them.

review/summary: Shouldn't be a veggie substitute
review/text: I have two kids, a 3 year old and a 5 year old. My 3 yr old was crazy about them (she loves veggies and she loves chips so it was the perfect combination for her. She excitedly called them "green frenchfries!"). My 5 yr old hates peas and disliked the pungent whiff you get when you first open the bag. She was not crazy about the color. It took her a couple of tries before they grew on her (seeing her sister devour them encouraged her to give them another chance).<br /><br />These are a bit oily even though they are baked. They have a great crunch and are not too salty (but we love salt!) I think they look cool and taste good. They can be addicting! I like dippingthem in hummus.<br /><br />I don't think they are a healthy substitute for vegeatables (fat content) but a good way to introduce veggies into a veggie-hater's diet. They are in our snack cabinet and make a nice addition to a lunchbox every now and then but I don't offer them everyday.

Then, lo and behold, there they were at the grocery store! I picked up 1 bag to try...and now it's over, I'm completely hooked. These things really are that delicious. Since they seemed to be a one-time thing at my local grocery, I'm now ordering them from Amazon. They're a great replacement for chips anytime you're craving something salty.

review/text: Crispy, salty, tasty -- and healthy. For me, a bag holds two servings. But if I occasionally pig out and eat the whole bag, no harm done. Snapea Crisps have fewer calories and less sodium than potato chips.  They are baked but contain some corn oil so they feel slightly greasy like potato chips. I much prefer the Original flavor to Ceasar (which tastes a bit tangy).

review/summary: My kids love these!
review/text: My kids love Snapeas.  I personally do not care for the caesar flavor, but stick to the original.  They have a somewhat peanuty flavor, but with a cornpuff texture.  A much healthier snack than most kids processed snacks out therre, so we bring them along when we go on outings or roadtrips.  I do wish the bag had a resealing zipper to it, though... the material of the bag does not like to stay closed when folded down!

Maybe they aren't as healthy as a dish of fresh organic vegetables, but I can get a picky, severely allergic little boy to eat them.

In fact I seek these out at the grocery, and love that they are baked, have natural ingredients and score on the calcium content too!  Glad to see I can order them by the case at Amazon.  The danger is that once you start a bag, it calls to you until all the crunchy crisps have disappeared.

review/text: I love Snapea Crisps.  The Caesar more than the original, although they are both really yummy.  My children and I eat them instead of cheeto's.  They have that sort of consistency, crunchy and salty, but disolvable enough for my infant son.  They do have fat in them, and the aforementioned salt, but they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so I feel they are a justifiable snack, as long as they are in place of, rather than in addition to, other salty snacks like chips and french fries.

review/summary: An insanely delectable little snack!
review/text: First things first. Snapea Crisps do have 8 grams of fat (and 150 calories) per serving, with a serving size being one oz., which is approx. 22 of the cute little life-sized pea pod thingies. The good news is that they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so you can hold you chin up while scarfing down the bag, which has been the compulsion of everyone I've known who's tried them. Kids love the taste, too! These also make great finger food snacks for toddlers, as the little pod thingies are finely textured. My only complaint is that I have to share them with every one else in the house. At this price, tho, you can afford to buy a case and hoard a few bags for yourself.

review/text: I'm excited to find these for sale on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price!  I just tried them for the first time a few days ago, and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them.  Everyone I've given them to has liked them, even those who are not normally healthy eaters.  These crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks (like cheetos), but with a different light flavor.  The calorie content is similar to other chip-type snacks (150 per serving), but these have the nutrition benefits of peas--protein (5g per serving), calcium (6% DV per serving), and iron (4% DV per serving).  I haven't tried the Ceasar flavor yet, but intend to do so in the near future. :)

review/text: You know, they used to say that smoking was good for the lungs.  Now, we're told that a greasy little snack in a bag is "healthy."  But, while this isn't an apple or a cup of yogurt, Snapeas are a far cry from bright orange Doritas or Ding Dongs.  They are baked (not fried), and perhaps there is merit to the pea foundation, as opposed to the potato or corn chip format.  They are major addictive - full of unique flavor, a pleasantly crisp but foamy (as in styrofoamy) texture, a dash of saltiness, and just enough oilyness to satisfy.  Try these and then spread the word.

My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them.

The next one is like hmm. ok, let me taste one more to make sure my findings are correct.. everyone in my family likes these. All agree, don't judge by the first nibble :) half a bag is 130 or so calories. Me and my friend ate a bag together while we were playing video games and pretty fast xp so try em!! I recommend. oh PS.. I got the original flavor. In case you were wondering.

review/summary: Tasty, but oily.
review/text: To be fair, these Snapea Crisps taste great.  The Ceasar have even more flavor, but contain dairy, which we avoid.  The kids love these in the car and they can be quite addictive.  Unfortunately, they are quite oily and can become very messy when eaten with the hands.  From the packaging it may appear that these are actual baked peas in the pod.  They are actually pea flour shaped into pods. If you don't mind the oiliness (comparable to kettle chip oiliness) give 'em a try!

review/text: These crisps are very good, I had never had them before but bought the 12 pack looking to try a new healthy snack.  The only problem was the expiration date on the 12 packs is 7/10/10.  Considering they arrived on 6/29/10, that doesn't leave much time to consume them at their best and I wonder if a younger product would taste better/be more fresh.

review/summary: Tastes really  good
review/text: I got these because I was intrigued by the idea of snapped pea crisps.  They were much better than I expected.  I found that I had to eat the whole bag although one-serving is supposed to be about 3 OZ.  There was no good way to close the bag after opening unless you put it into a large zipper food storage bag.  I did like eating them, but they might get to be too much if I eat them everyday.  They were crispy upon opening and looked like they could easily go stale if left open for long.  My DH thought they tasted like french fries.  I thought they definitely had a "green" type taste although it wasn't overpowering.  I will buy again...but it will be a while since I plan to "pace" myself with these rather than get tired of them.  They do have corn oil and salt added as well as other preservatives of some kind.<br /><br />Also these have the same type of crunch that Baked Cheetos have.  They aren't really greasy, but there is a powder residue that is left on the fingers.

review/summary: Green, different, and completely yummy
review/text: If you judge this snack by the packaging, you might never try them. Baked pea pods don't exactly sound like the most appetizing (or satisfying) snack, but these guys really deliver.  As one of the other reviewers said, they are crunchy and light, with a texture similar to Cheetos, possibly a little more dense.  They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas, only light and airy.  While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable, they're a good alternative if you don't want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks.  These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable.  I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast.  Both flavors are delicious, though I prefer the original.<br /><br />Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them, you might try Wild Oats, Trader Joes or Whole Foods, if any of those are nearby.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I, too, thought these would be dried snap peas.  Boy, was I wrong.  The picture on the front of the bag is VERY misleading...when you actually get a look at the product inside the bag, there are no visible "pods" on the snapea crisps.  The crisps are actually more like sad, green Cheetos.  At this point, I'd rather eat some Cheetos...at least they have some flavor.  These snapea crisps (original flavor) are on the bland side...even after adding salt to them, they still weren't very flavorful. They also left my hands greasy.  I thought I might be able to keep a bag of these in my desk at work to eat as a healthy snack, but I have reconsidered.  The crisps don't seem like much of a health food at all.  If I want to eat something with 6g of fat per serving, I'd rather go with chips and salsa or a handful of pretzels.

None of my friends like them either so I guess I'll just throw them out.

review/text: Bought these after reading the reviews.  They are tasty (a little strange at first but they really grow on you).  One nice thing is that for me, I can eat them as a chip alternative but I don't eat too many.  About 10-15 crisps and I'm done.  I have also used them in salads.<br /><br />I bought a case here and I don't think I'll do that again.  I've seen them at my grocery store and I'll buy a bag now and then.  For now I have a big box full in the closet.  I think it will take a while to get through them.

review/summary: Good but not as good as the original
review/text: I first tasted the original Snappea Crisps, and absolutely loved them, so when I had the chance to try the Caesar flavor I jumped at it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed at the taste. Not that it is bad, not at all, but I had very high expectations. These are very crunchy, with a slightly sweet flavor (which is one of the reasons I didn't care for it as much). They are baked, rather than fried, so the fat content is not as high as most crunchy snacks. Try them, you may like them better than I did.

review/text: The crips are just that, pea shaped crispy snacks. They are good but, don't taste like peas or pea pods and they are loaded with fat. My guests liked them; I put them out instead of potato chips and they are a nice alternative. Like I said, pretty good but, I was a little disappointed in the calorie count and the flavor; not quite as healthy as they were touted to be.

This item was in the produce section of Walmart and since I love sugar snap peas....well you get the drift. Let me tell you that these are not baked sugar snap peas! They are greasy cheeto-like green things. The put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned. These crisps should be in the potato chip aisle along with all the other greasy fattening chips, and not with the produce to make the consumer think she's getting a nutritious baked snack.

review/text: Let's get this out of the way first: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH GMO CORN OIL! Several un-informed reviewers on here feel it is their duty to bad mouth this ingredient and thus the overall product.  GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism.  In other words, food that has had its DNA altered.  The reasons for such alterations are for better, disease and insect resistant crops.  Wow, really a BAD thing huh?  After over 15 years of GMO products being in wide use, the statistics show that not only are these products NOT bad for you, in many instances they are BETTER for you! But some people cannot wrap their head around the fact that humanity has improved upon nature.<br /><br />Now about these pea snacks.  Awesome!  Tastier and much better for you than a tube of Pringles.

review/summary: AAAAAAAaaaaccccKKKKK!!! PRICE WENT UP OVER 50%!!! When can we subscribe for this great healthy snack?
review/text: A half-pack of this (if I can stop at a half-pack) usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes. Other reviewers have described it most adequately, with nearly all finding it quite enjoyable, perhaps not TOTALLY virtuous, but much healthier than most snack foods. This is the best price I could find for it, at this writing a dime per pack cheaper [[AS OF JUNE 6 50% MORE!]] than at W**-M***. Amazon does not yet offer it by subscription, which would bring further price improvement and freedom from having to place repeat orders.<br /><br />UPDATE: THE PRICE WENT UP BY OVER 50%!!! These were $1.50/bag at a "national discount chain," so I can no longer recommend buying them from Amazon.  The store had them in stock when I checked, but another store wanted $2.50 per bag.  If Calbee drives the price up so horribly everywhere, I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.<br /><br />Oh, Amazon, why do you keep doing this to us?  This isn't the first time that your price for a beloved item rose by some huge amount.<br /><br />Ya know what?  We can buy a bag of frozen microwave-steamable sugar snap pea pods or edamame (soy beans, either shelled or in pods) and be eating them five minutes after the urge packs us.  The bags costs less, contain more pods, and contain no fats or seasonings, so we can control the amount and type of added sinfulness.

review/text: To each his/her own.  I was suckered into buying a case on a Friday sale.  I'm now still trying to give them away a package at a time.  (You want one???)  They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean.  I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).  Like I said--to each his/her own.  I personally hate them.
