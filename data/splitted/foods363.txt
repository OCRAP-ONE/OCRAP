review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: We have two collies, one 11 year old and one 3 1/2 years.  We have to watch what we feed our senior, because he has a sensitive digestive system.  We also have to watch the 3 1/2 year old because she has pancreatitis and a low fat food is good for her so that she keeps an even weight.  We tried many different dog foods including premium holistic foods and prescription foods.  We have used the Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight food for about 2 months.  So far, both of them seem to be doing well.  They like it well enough that we use the dry kibbles for their treats.  I will update the review in another few months.

review/summary: My dogs love it :)
review/text: One of my little dogs was starting to get bad breath.  After about one month on Wellness, the bad breath is gone!  I guess the previous diet I had them on had a lot of non-digestible ingredients.  Whatever the reason, I'm happy :)

review/summary: Awesom Price, Awesome Project!
review/text: So glad I could find this on Amazon. Saved more than $10.00 off of regular retail price at all of my local pet stores. My dog has been sick, in part due to regular name-brand dry foods. Too many additives and by-products hidden behind a "healthy" label. Wellness allows me to feed my dog food that will not make her sick. I can pronounce the ingredients and she loves the Healthy Weight Recipe, despite it being a "diet" formula. As a dog living with colitis, limiting fat and increasing fiber intake is vital to her IT health. This food makes it easy and she still regards it as a treat six months after starting to eat it in her bowl. She is a finicky eater, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on various "diet" foods from the vet and pet boutiques. This was the first formula she liked right out of the bag. What a relief! Five star product!

review/summary: Excellent food with an easy-to-read nutrition label
review/text: Our 7�-year-old and 2-year-old dogs have been on Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight Recipe Dog Food for almost 3 weeks at the time of this review. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the bag for the first time -- I was not greeted by that all-too-familiar and cringe-worthy dry food smell that you get from other brands. The kibbles are little triangles and pale yellow in color. I love that the 26-lb bag is also resealable.<br /><br />Because this food was designed to fill doggy bellies the right way, I learned quickly that I didn't need to adhere to typical portion sizes for our dogs. The 7�-year-old is a 92-lb Rott/Shep. Given her size, the recommendation is 4 cups a day. This serving size is not needed in our case with this food. She eats 2� cups at dinnertime and is very happy. She doesn't poke around the food bag or tip her bowl over as a request for more. Our 2-year-old is a 40-lb Chow mix that is as skinny as her breed comes. She eats 1� cups (sometimes less) and walks away when she's done, occasionally leaving a few kibbles for her sister to finish up.<br /><br />Both dogs have also not skipped any meals the way they used to when they were on a different brand of food. They now eat every evening without fail, and I've not had to throw out uneaten kibbles. I also recently noticed that their breaths actually smell cleaner.<br /><br />Thank you, Wellness, for making excellent products for our furry kids!

review/text: My dog had gotten Pancreatitis (no reason why) but had already been eating the regular whitefish Wellness bag so we switched to this low-fat blend b/c Pancreatitis can be caused by too much fat in a dogs diet (make sure you look at the fat content in any brand you buy) and it's working out great!  It's a great blend and brand for the price!

review/summary: Truely healthy dog food
review/text: If you have never investigated what is in your dogs food, and you think it is all about the same...READ THIS !<br />All dry dog food is NOT good for your loved pet, and it is NOT the same.  MANY major brands of dog food, including most that are sold at local grocery stores are not good for your pet.  Yes...they will survive on them...and yes...they might like the taste, but investigate !  Useless calories, fillers of cereal husks, and other trash are typical ingredients....and....the PRIMARY incredients.  Wellness...and some other brands....all of which will cost you more than the cheap brands, are made with chicken, lamb, or other animal products as their MAIN incredient, which will be the FIRST one listed on the label, by law.  With added antioxidents, vitamins, and joint compounds, these premium foods will extend the life of your pet.  Feeding them the cheap food is like feed your child McDolnald's bugers 3 times a day, with all the desserts they can eat.  They will live, but you are killing them slowly.  Our dig loves her Wellness food, and I feel better knowing I am doing the best I can for her.  Does you dog deserve any less?

review/summary: Sadie Loves It
review/text: We started Sadie on Wellness White Fish and Sweet Potato formula, which she loved.  But it gave her gas and she had 'fish breath' after she ate.  So we switched to the Healthy Weight formula and she transitioned very well.  And it cured the gas and breath problems too.  Although she is at a good weight, we will continue with this formula because she really likes it and since I use individual kibble as a treat for good behavior, I don't worry that she is getting over fed.  I would highly recommend this formula, regardless of whether your dog has a weight problem or not.

review/text: Pugs are NOT finicky eaters - still mine gobbles this up and loves it as much as any food I've tried on him. He weighed 18 lbs. when I first started him on this and reminded me of a fat little sausage. He has almost finished one 26 lb. bag and has lost 3 lbs. and is holding at a steady 15 lbs. now. I feed him 1/4 c. in the morning and 1/3 c. in the evening. And....2 - 3 times a week I give him a "treat". The food does what is supposed to. Vet says he couldn't be healthier!

review/summary: Perfect for both overweight and healthy weight dogs
review/text: Our puggle's weight had ballooned to almost 40 pounds--at least 10 pounds too heavy--and we weren't willing to feed her a low-quality food full of by-products and weird stuff after making the switch to holistic foods a few years ago. Just three months after starting on Wellness Healthy Weight, she has shed several pounds and is well on her way to being at her ideal weight again. Our other, healthy-weight dog has also been eating this food without any noticeable weight gain or loss and without having any food allergy flare-ups. The best part is that both dogs love the food, and they are both picky, picky eaters. If you're looking for a high-quality, no-filler holistic food to help your lazy, treat-filled pooch lose some of those extra pounds, give this one a try.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: I was feeding my dog the Complete Wellness but decided that she needed to watch her weight so I started feeding her this weight one. She started vomiting daily. I figured it  was probably the food since it started happening right around the time we got her on the new one. I took her to the vet just in case and the vet agreed that I should stop feeding her this food and put her on a bland diet for 5 days. Once she stopped eating this food, she was fine. I'm going to be switching her to a new brand because I'm hearing some sketchy things about Wellness.

review/text: I recently ran low on Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Less Active Canine Formula Dry Dog Food and it was unavailable with Prime shipping at the time, so I ordered this brand.  I've been mixing the two together to increase my dog's acceptance, but she now has not eaten for three days straight.  I suppose that is an alternate strategy for weight reduction, but neither of us is happy, and the food was really expensive.  My dog does not recommend this dog food. She preferred the Organix.

review/summary: good candy but box not worth the money
review/text: The box is 24 pack of tiny boxes. There is 24 little boxes and the little boxes are 24 grams each. The box you get at Walgreen or Walmart is 142 grams and costs a dollar. If you pay $13.33 for this product like we did than the cost of these Boston bake beans is 43grams/dollar. Walgreens is 142g/dollar. So the only reason to spend this much is if you can't get them at a store near you or you really want the mini boxes.<br /><br />P.S. I love the candy, I just don't think it was worth the cost.

review/text: The noodles were better than I thought instant rice noodles would be. That said, that was the only positive I can think of. Rice noodles being as bland as they are, I expected a much more flavorful soup. What little flavor I could make out in the soup wasn't good, and didn't fit the description. (If "Chinese Onion Flavor" means something significantly different than "onion flavor," ignore me.) I would not have connected this to onions unless I had read it on the package. I'm not sure how to describe the little taste that's in it. It tastes bad.

review/summary: Not Exactly what I Expected
review/text: First off, my true gut feeling on the rating is a three.  I am giving it a four because the I think the company is really good, the product was shipped fast and was packed really well.  I am not super happy with the Trident Maple Forest but I am not totally disappointed either.  I really didn't know what to expect since this item had not been reviewed before, I couldn't find too many photos, and I have never ordered anything that is alive on the internet.<br /><br />My main disappointment is probably due to my own ignorance with bonsais.  I have had a few various bonsais before and have sadly killed them all.  I had seen the Trident Forest in a brochure before and really wanted it awhile ago.  The idea of a "mini forest" sounded really neat.  I also love maple trees so it really seemed perfect.  When I received my bonsai today I was a little disappointed when I saw the trees.  Basically they look like someone cut tree limbs off a maple tree and put them into a pot.  Now, that may be how bonsai trees are made and I just don't know.  I thought that maybe these were mini trees that were grown from a seed and pruned and trained to be small.  But, as I said, I don't know much about bonsais.  I am also disappointed in that I read when making a forest one should really try not to put the trees in any order or try to make them symmetrical.  My forest is almost arranged in a perfect oval shape.  Also, the largest "tree" is very loose and feels like it may pop out of the soil any moment.  So, some of my trees look like a stick off a tree with maybe 10 small leaves on them and the top of the "tree" pruned diagonally.<br /><br />Now, am I planning on returning the product?  No, probably not unless it starts looking sick in the next two weeks or one of the trees falls out of the pot.  I think it is a cute bonsai and am hoping I can take really good care of it and get it to grow some more leaves and fill out.  To be honest, if I had seen this in a store for 100 dollars I would not have ever considered buying it.<br /><br />So I am giving it a four because it was shipped fast and packed really well.  It only lost about 10 leaves which I think is pretty good.  Some of the leaves are wilted but I am assuming it is because of them being in the dark box for a few days.  I also don't want to rate the tree too low because I really didn't know what to expect so I want to be fair to the product and company.  I also love the leaves that is does have.<br /><br />I took photos of it packed, me unpacking it, and the tree by itself.  I am hoping to post these photos on amazon.  I hope this helps you decide if you want one.  Like I said, it is small and cute but definitely not like the photo posted on amazon.  It is not thick with leaves or stems but this may be due to the season.  Oh, and my tallest tree is 13 inches from the soil to the top of the stick.

review/summary: Not too crazy about these sticks.
review/text: This product shipped quickly which was the highlight of this experience.<br /><br />When I opened the shipping box, I found a zip lock plastic bag with all of the sticks contained loosely within. There was no labeling at all on the bag or in the box. If you are like me you like to know the product information especially country of origin, preparation method, and manufacturer.  The HPD information states that these sticks come from free-roaming bulls, but, who knows what I received. The smell of the product is sickly sweet and fairly pungent.<br /><br />What was most disappointing though was the size of the sticks. An average size is about 1/2 inch in parameter. Many are around 1/4 inch.  Only a few are close to 1 inch.<br /><br />My cocker spaniel plowed through one of these sticks in about five minutes.  Hardly the distraction that I intended.<br /><br />Typically I purchase Cadet 12" bully sticks, cutting them down to 4 inch sticks.  Cadet sticks are wide, have very little smell and contain product information. My dog takes about 30 minutes with these. Going forward I will order the Cadets.

review/summary: Currently best value for bully sticks on amazon
review/text: These bully sticks are currently the best value for 6" bully sticks on Amazon.  Amazon used to carry a similar bulk package that qualified for Amazon prime, but it no longer offers that - so factoring shipping costs, this set is the best value left.<br /><br />The sticks are decently thick - some pieces are lower quality than others (smellier, pink tinge, etc.) but overall the quality of the product is on par with what you might find at a PetSmart at a fraction of the cost.  They're bundled neatly in 10 packs with rubber bands, and shipped in a perfectly sized box which required no wasted space or filler (something I appreciate that the seller does.)

I searched high and low for something like this and now my local Fred Meyers stopped carrying them so I had to go online. They are crunchy with a good oatmeal peanut butter taste - salty and sweet but not too sweet. Alot like Nature Valley peanut butter granola bars sans rice. Great for breakfast or to bring along on a hike. Yum!  If anyone knows of any other good rice free granola bars, let me know...  Thanks!

review/text: I start my day with one of these and a handful of almonds every workday.  I can't imagine a better way to get started.  I have food sensitivities and most granola bars can be problematic.  These bars never trigger a sensitivity.  Also, I do not get a low sugar bounceback an hour later like some of the lighter, more sugary granola bars.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, no other granola bars I have tried over the past 5 years can compare.  One thing of note is that I have noticed differences in batches where some seem better (peanut butter in greater quantity and 'wetter' vs a dry batch).  Both taste great, but the wet batches are finger lickin' good.

review/summary: Tough, gummy and where's the pleasant Aroma?
review/text: First time using Great Western brand.  I usually use Gold Medal but decided to save a few bucks.  Yuck.  Big mistake.  The aroma and flavor were sub-par.  While the customers still liked it ok, I found it almost unpleasant with chemical overtones rather than the soft rich vanilla I expected.  And the texture was tough and gummy and it soaked up the humidity like a sponge.  I had to keep clearing the buildup on the inside of the bowl and the cleanup afterwards was like getting melted gummy bears off.  I've never had this much of a problem with Gold Medal or even plain white sugar even on the muggiest days and today was a pleasant summer day with modest humidity.<br /><br />Bottom line, cannot recommend and will never use again.  Trying to decide if I pour out the remainder or not.  Don't like serving customers something I wouldn't touch.

review/summary: How about this idea?
review/text: How about this idea? Even though we buy the non-hydrogenated "natural" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non-hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!

review/summary: Yay! I &lt;3 Peanut Butter, and now I can actually have it!
review/text: So... my preferred breakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.<br />No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully, that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week-- and I still get to have my preferred breakfast.<br />The taste? Not going to lie- it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it.

It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency.

review/text: I purchased this item mostly out of curiosity.  I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or bread.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...

review/text: Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!

review/summary: Good peanut butter taste
review/text: This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of "gluey" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes.

review/summary: Love PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter
review/text: I got PB2 powdered peanut butter for mixing in with my morning shakes. I absolutely love it! It tastes great and mixes in great with no clumps. I love 2 T for 45 calories as opposed to 200 in regular peanut butter. It says you can mix with water to make a solid peanut butter, but I haven't tried that yet. I've already bought my second order which included the chocolate PB2 and love that just as much! For more on my thoughts on PB2, visit: [...]

review/text: I am a peanut butter lover, but not a fan of the high calories and fat. As an extreme health junkie, I understand the notion behind moderation, but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this, I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)<br /><br />About 2 months ago, PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility. I will be using this product for the rest of my life, as long as its still in production!

review/summary: I really wanted to love this product...
review/text: I was so hopeful that _finally_ a lower fat, great tasting peanut butter was available. But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried.

review/summary: Powdered peanut butter??  YES!!
review/text: Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your<br />fat intake, this is the PB to eat.<br /><br />I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good<br />as this one!  YUM!  Now, I wonder if the same company might want to make this in almond or cashew<br />versions?!  *HINT TO THE COMPANY*

Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.

review/text: I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.

Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast

review/text: I was a little hesitant to try this...how could it possibly hope to imitate REAL peanut butter with any success? But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more. So yes, this stuff is very expensive and you don't get very much.

This stuff tastes really close, and you can adjust the amount of water to create the consistency you like.  My only problem is the cost. This jar doesn't make an equivalent jar full of the final product.  To demonstrate, this jar makes enough for about 4 or 5 peanut butter sandwiches.  Again, I am a peanut butter lover, and this tastes great.  My only problem is the cost.  P.S. I've lost 130 pounds over the last 18 months, so to me the cost is worth it.

review/text: I read the reviews before trying PB2 peanut butter powder and even with all of the good feedback, I was skeptical. As it turns out, it's surprising and delicious. Getting another jar today. I prepared it exactly as instructed on the jar (2 TBS PB2 powder + 1 TBS water) and it was amazing - more like natural PB without all of the oil and less sweetness than store brands. They add just the right amount of sugar to this product. The total ingredients are peanuts, salt and sugar. 45 cals for 2 TBS. Also, I tried this in Greek yogurt (1 TBS to one container of yogurt) and it was really good and peanuty! You have to try it to believe it. I'm going to try the chocolate version next. I'd like to make a sesame noodle with this and maybe mini donuts or smoothies. I plan to experiment. A LOT.<br /><br />I'll be buying a few for stocking stuffers, too. Great product!

review/text: My daughter loves this peanut butter.  It is low in fat and although it isn't exactly like peanut butter it is a great substitute.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: This product is awesome! I decided to buy from Amazon instead of the manufacturer because I wanted to try one jar before buying 4. It is a really good PB Substitute. It doesn't have the exact same texture as peanut butter, but it is almost like a whipped peanut butter. It is delicious!

review/summary: Great alternative to peanut butter!
review/text: I made peanut "butter" out of this flour and it was surprisingly good!  You need to put salt and/or sweetner on it, but that is to one's taste.  Personally, I like it just plain.  You can't beat the lower calories, lower fat, and price.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I was sceptical of this product when I received it but was sold once I gave it a try.  A little bit of water and you have peanut butter that your diet will like!  It is great in protein shakes, baked items, or just to eat by the spoonful (reconstituted of course).  I have been reccommending it to everyone!

review/text: I like to make a smoothie of this, a cup of cold brewed coffee, protein powder, a spoonful of Nesquik and lots of ice.  A banana too, if I'm feeling adventurous!

review/summary: No more feeling guilty
review/text: I am on Weight Watchers and I love peanut butter.  Now, I can have more of it without feeling guilty because there is virtually no fat in this product.  Tastes better than the regular stuff too.  Amazing!
