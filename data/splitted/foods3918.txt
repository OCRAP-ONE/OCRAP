review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This product is a great one for someone obsessed with sweets, their weight, AND their health!<br /><br />These lollipops are ridiculously delicious, not too high in calories (23 calories, and they last for around 20 minutes) and organic.<br /><br />This is such a great value. I tried some YummyEarth products, then went for sugar-free hard candies from Crystal Light, and found myself back at YummyEarth for more. Whatever, whatever. This is a good product. Buy it.

review/summary: Instantly addicted
review/text: I am not someone who enjoys hard candies -- in general, they have sweetness with very little flavor -- but these amazing lollipops were instantly addicting.  Each flavor has the taste of tart, delicious fruit.<br /><br />At just about 23 calories per lollipop, they make a satisfying treat when I'm counting calories.  The natural dyes -- from beet and carrot -- don't leave my mouth and lips stained in bizarre fluorescent colors.<br /><br />There's nothing I don't love about my new favorite candy!

review/summary: Great way to satisfy your sweet tooth!
review/text: I love these lollipops! I'm not wild about watermelon or apple, but the others are great. This is the first time I ordered the 30-ounce container and overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase (value for money spent). YummyEarth claims there is an "almost even assortment of flavors" but I did not find this to be true. Since I don't like the watermelon and apple, I pulled those out of the container and put them in another container - there seem to be more of these flavors than the others, but to be honest, I did not actually count them. I'm judging by my eye. :)<br /><br />Still, I'm happy with the purchase. My guests love these lollipops and they're a great snack when you're watching a suspenseful film - the licking gets more intense. lol

review/text: I wanted a small pop.  You know, just a little bit of sweet in those minutes when a little pop will do you?  These are perfect.  They're sweet, organic, made with real sugar instead of artifical sweeteners, and just the perfect amount of sweet for that sweet moment.  And I really loved the mixed variety.  I can have a little surprise to go with my little sweet, too.

review/summary: Tastes like they took a piece of fruit and stuck a stick in it!
review/text: I've been looking for something I could snack on other than sugar free hard candy since most of the time I end up chewing them and not savoring them. I figured with a lollipop I would go through less candy and thus less calories that way. These are delicious, they don't taste artificial, they taste like they've come right off the tree, or from the ground, or whatever the case may be. Tastes like they took a strawberry or a pomegranate or a cherry and put a stick in it! Fabulous! I am wondering if they would be able to come out with a sugar free version of their lollipops that would taste just as great. If they can make organic taste this great, I'm sure they could do it!

review/text: WOW, I am still sucking my tongue trying to get every drop of candy! This stuff is AMAZING. First off, Amazon delivered it very promptly. I took all the suckers out and there was an EQUAL amount of ALL flavors, averaging about 16-19 per flavor.I am gearing up to start the Feingold Diet with my son, to manage his ADHD, and I can already tell these are gonna be a HUGE hit in my house. These lil babies pack a BIG punch in terms of flavor. I thought they would disappear as soon as I put them in my mouth but they last a good while. Psst...Don't tell my son that a serving size is 3. LOL.

review/text: These taste delicious!  I bought them for a party at my daugther's school.  I wanted something a little healthier than the normal dummy pop.  No artificial colors.  Not a huge amount of sugar.  These hit the mark and as a bonus are so good I had some too.  The nutrional info they show in the description is for a serving size. That's about 3 pops.  One is really enough of a serving IMO. So looking at the numbers on the box, its like 25 calories a piece with 5 grams of sugar (in the form ofevaporated cane juice). Not bad!

review/summary: Flavors are more grown up friendly
review/text: These were purchased for our 2.5 year old peanut/tree nut allergic daughter.  I enjoyed the mix of flavors.  Unfortunately, my wife and daughters did not.  Almost a year later and the big bucket is still about half full.<br /><br />We got a good value (number of pops per dollar, compared to other allergy friendly candy), but the flavors were a bit too varied to be be popular with our kids or their friends.  They routinely picked the dum-dums over these.  Granted, you would not expect an organic/natural candy to be as sweet as something artificial.  But, if the kids wont eat them then the healthy aspect does no good.<br /><br />I would reccommend these to adults or older kids.

review/summary: Better than the restaurant miso soup
review/text: Delicious -- to me anyway. I do add about 1/2 teaspoon of Kikkoman Ponzu soy sauce because I like a little bit more salty taste. This miso has a depth of flavor that others don't have (to my taste anyway). I like it better than ANY restaurant miso soup that I've had.  I notice that the flavor improves if I let it sit in my cup for a couple of minutes before eating.  I did not like the version of this soup that includes the seaweed because it is simply too fishy tasting (again, in my opinion). Minor problem:  There are 4 envelopes in the box. Each envelope will make 2  8 oz. servings. The problem is that it is difficult to exactly split the quantity in the envelope into two equal portions. My solution is to lay the envelope on the counter, flatten it, find the middle of the product packed portion, fold the envelope on that line and then cut the envelop in half with scissors. This works OK but I'd prefer that the envelopes were half size.

review/summary: Product change
review/text: I also have been a fan of Cafe Francais since it came on the market. I so look forward to my coffee each morning. No more!!! The shipment I received last week came in a tin with a new look. My first thought was to check the ingredients against my old tin. Well guess what-----they changed a perfect formula. It has more sugar, less fat, more sodium, and a whole lot less coffee. It tastes more like creamer with very little coffee flavor. I sent an e-mail to General Foods International Coffees and am waiting for a reply. In the mean time I will not order it anymore unless they change the formula again. I am soooooo disappointed that General Foods would mess with perfection but not surprised. As I told General Foods in my e-mail, the Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans would be amused that they are passing off this new formula as Cafe Francais.

review/text: This product used to be a five-star for me. I was thrilled to find that I could order it through Amazon in quantity, at a great price. This most recent shipment was my third - and I noticed that the can was different. But nothing on the can indicated that the product had changed, so I thought it was only a cosmetic makeover. WRONG.<br /><br />Many people have noted in their reviews that they like this product because it is not as sweet as the other flavored coffees; well, now it is, AND there's less coffee flavor.<br /><br />I looked up the company's website and e-mailed customer support. They confirmed that they have "reformulated" Cafe Francais, and said would take my comments into consideration. I urge everyone who is unhappy with the "reformulation" to go to [...] and ask General Foods to PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS. If enough people complain, they WILL listen!<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm scouring all my local grocery stores for the "old" cans of coffee...

Next test was the taste test.  It was very good, just like I remember it, not too sweet with a bit of a bite.  I was very glad because I wondered what I was going to do with 6 cans of coffee that tasted bad!  I am happy to know that I can get it here now because I cannot find it in any of our grocery stores and it is my favorite. It is especially good in winter on a cold snowy day...............and right now with 100 degree temps a snowy day sounds pretty good!

I may try it once more next year to see if they really do return to the old formula.  I received a letter sometime in March from the company telling me it was likely a storage/temperature problem that caused the flavor change. Right!  I checked other tins with 3 different expiration dates including very late this fall and there was no difference and the old flavor was not there. Would love to find a similar coffee flavor but not with Kraft.

review/text: This has been my favorite International Coffee beverage since General Foods introduced it. I use to purchase a pack of 6 cans every other month through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" until I was notified that it would no longer be available. It is available on Amazon through other sources, but not at a reasonable price. Kraft has changed the branding and packaging of Caf&eacute; Francais numerous times over the past 3 years. And I noticed prior to writing this review that they have changed both branding and packaging again. That creates a lot of confusion for consumers of the product. I love the taste of this product but because of all the recent changes, I give it only 3 stars.

review/text: General Foods International Cafe Francais Coffee Drink Mix was nearly a decade long favorite. Consuming nearly two 8 oz tins a week at a price ranging from $2.99 to $4.50, depending on the store and sales. Then over this winter 2010/2011, this flavor disappeared from the shelves of food and department stores. It wasn't like it wasn't popular, since I was always finding this one flavor to be sorely lacking on the stocked shelves.<br />I was most pleased to find it on amazon (i forgot who the original seller was - but it was a awesome deal to me) subsequent purchases however have been sorely over priced...price average near $7.00 a tin ... and for what I began to challenge, and found that the formula was greatly changed to something more akin to sugared milk.<br />Truelly disappointed in General Foods International...the end of a great comfort food, for me.

The problem with this flavor is it taste a lot like a latte instead of a mocha. Even though the product claims to have sugar in it, there is nothing sweet about this. I would consider this more of an instant coffee than a flavor enhancer.

review/summary: I think it's great
review/text: I read some reviews about this product being discontinued and how the company who makes it changed the recipe formula. I'm not sure what's going on with all that stuff but all I know is I ordered it and I really liked it. It's sweet but not too sweet. It's very smooth and flavorful. It's like drinking a lighter version of cappuccino. It's very easy to make as well.

review/summary: I was surprised
review/text: I consume coffee everyday. Never less than 3 times a week from starbucks on my way. Sometimes I try to make my own mixed style at home but need to that to be simple, and this saves me money a lot instead of everyday coffee to go.<br />I was afraid when I saw some other low rate reviews, but since the price was low to earth, I dicided to take a chance.<br />I got mine today and tried. It tastes not bad. Slightly sweet, if u like sweet, this is not a good choice.<br />I was surprised. And I'm gonna share tins with my friends.<br /><br />Maybe they changed the recipe again back from the one some others reviewd as "all sugar""too sweet""taste artificial"...I guess they changed and wanted to open the market of this item. However, it is creamy as some of those described. But considering this price with the quality, I decide to leave a five star review.

review/text: Cafe Francais has been my favorite for many years.  I was disappointed when the local market stopped carrying it (for what reason?) I looked on the internet to see if I could order it, and sure enough, there it was.  The International Coffee distributors should not remove things from local markets.  I have tried the other flavors, but prefer this over the other ones.

review/text: I started drinking Cafe Francais after my son was born. I would get him up and feed him his bottle and sit and sip this coffee every morning cradling him in my lap. This was before Starbucks or Coffee Bean was even heard of and it was like drinking a creamy latte. My son is now 24 years old and I am still drinking this coffee every morning. I look forward to having a cup when I wake up. My husband thinks it is cute but I do know that I am addicted to that first cup!<br />I buy it on Amazon because it is cost effective and so much easier to find.<br />Thanks General Foods!

I have been a fan of this and only this flavor of GF coffee for over 20 years, but no more.  I will no longer be buying it.  It tastes cheaper, sweeter, and less like coffee--more like the other flavors they make, which I thought were gross.

review/summary: Delicious coffee - tastes like a latte
review/text: General Foods International Coffee sells a large variety of these flavored coffees.  I have tried many of them and Cafe Francais is my favorite.  My husband drinks nothing but the Cafe Francais instant coffee so I usually buy 10 cans at a time.  The grocery stores charge around $5.00 per can for these flavored coffees.  If you do the math, you will see that Amazon's offering of 6 cans is a very good deal. Plus, the convenience of getting the coffee delivered to your door is even better.  Many times, I've looked in stores for this coffee and found the shelf empty.  Considering my husband drinks this coffee every day, I have to make sure I can keep several cans on hand.  Looks like I won't have to keep going to the grocery store to look for this coffee because I can just order it from Amazon.com.

review/summary: The classic is still the best
review/text: For as long as I can remember, General Foods has offered Cafe Francais as part of its International coffee line.  This was the first coffee of the line I tried as a teenager.  I am proud to say it's still the best of the line.  While some prefer the cinnamon of Cafe Vienna, the classic taste of Cafe Francais endures. Smooth and mellow, it is pure enjoyment, the perfect cup of coffee to ease into the day with, the perfect indulgence when you want to relax. While I can continue my morning rush drinking suisse mocha, the taste of cafe francais takes the new york minute down several notches and makes me relax.  it is so smooth and mellow that I think only of how wonderful it tastes.  If I have to pick just ONE flavor of all the many wonderful and indulgent flavors from their line to drink on any given morning, then it just has to be cafe francais.  hands down it's my favorite.<br /><br />Amazon sells Cafe Francais in packs of six cans, which will last a single individual about 2-6 months, depending on if that person is switching off with any other kinds of coffee, like I do.  As I do normally, I prefer to make cafe francais with heated milk instead of water, for a much richer taste (milk is just also more nutritious than water).  I think it tastes better in milk.<br /><br />Cafe francais is the perfect travel coffee for the airport.  Why pay $4-6 for a cup of coffee at the airport?  Bring a can of cafe francais, some creamer (if you like), and sugar and something to stir with.  Past security, go to a vendor and ask for a cup of hot water.  They will give that to you either for free or minimal cost.  I've done this before, telling them I was willing to pay for the cup and was given the water free of charge.  Walk out of sight of where you are given the water, make your coffee.  It's a way to save a lot of money at the airport.

review/summary: Turkish Delights
review/text: We purchased Hazer Baber Turkish Delight with Pistachio on our Mediterranean cruise this July and liked it so much we looked for it at Amazon.  We found the exact picture of the box and ordered some more.  What we received was a different version of the candy and while delicious, it was not as good as that which we ordered.  It had less pistachio content in the candy.  I contacted the vender and was impressed by their quick response and follow up to my questioning of the product.  They learned that their supplier had changed the product slightly.  To the vender's credit they immediately changed the image on their web site to the correct one and also offered us a full refund.  Thought they went the extra mile to satisfy the customer.  I would still rate the product we received with five stars.  It was fresh and tasted great; just not quite as good as that we first had in July.

review/summary: Floral tasting matcha
review/text: This matcha smells very floral.  I am crazy for honey so I could not resist ordering this wonderful matcha.<br />My first impression of this matcha... I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I was hit with a strong floral scent.  I do love floral teas, but this was not what I was expecting.  I find it very hard to detect any honey scent.  Now I was worried, the floral smell did not meet my expectations.  I'll admit, it was almost a chemical smell.<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I'm officially a matcha pro now.  I could not get a good froth going no matter how fast I whisked my chasen.  No worries though, froth doesn't make the match in my opinion.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with about 3/4 perfect teaspoon of matcha. I was scared of the floral so held back on adding a full teaspoon until I could see if I could drink it.  Once that was properly mixed I added a bit of sugar (sorry, can't do without a touch of it) and 7 oz of water.  As with the Jasmine Matcha the matcha itself is light and vegetal.  Actually, it's probably even less vegetal than most.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water stayed the same, in your face chemical floral smelling.  The flavor is nice and smooth!  This matcha is very hard to describe for me.  I still do not really get honey flavor but a floral flavor.  If you took the chemical edge off this I think it would be better.  The quality of the matcha is very good.  This is definitely one you need to try for yourself.<br />I'd love for the honey to come through more so I think I'll try it in a latte and add honey to the top.  I don't want to add honey while hot and gum up my chasen.  This could very well be good iced too!<br />To try Hawaiian Honey Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Not bad at all
review/text: I have to say, I didn't have high hopes for this product, especially when I tasted the batter, but decided to toss them in the oven anyway.  I was surprised when the house filled with the smell of baking muffins and even more surprised when I tasted one hot from the oven.  It was really pretty good.  I made these using the vegan prep to replace a school snack (cupcakes) for my son, who is allergic to wheat, eggs, dairy, and a host of other things.  They do not have the grainy or dense texture I have come to expect from gluten-free mixes.  The chocolate flavor is light and a little different from the rich-gooey stuff we've gotten used to.  They actually remind me of unfrosted cupcakes made from a basic mix.  I'm also thrilled that they are pretty low in sugar (8g if you only make 10 muffins, but mix easily makes 12) and low in fat (I added only 1 Tablespoon coconut oil to the entire mix).  Mix was super simple to prepare- add oil and water and mix on high for 4 minutes.  I'm glad we have a whole case.  These will come in handy as we have to take replacements to birthday parties, etc.

review/summary: Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.
review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.

review/summary: PUCKER UP
review/text: I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.

review/text: I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.

review/summary: Salty and vinegary!!!
review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/summary: Good chips, more cheese
review/text: They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.

review/text: These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving.

review/summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!

review/summary: Box-o-Chips
review/text: These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected.
