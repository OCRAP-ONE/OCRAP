review/summary: The perfect spice
review/text: I'm crazy about this spice! I only recently bought a bottle just because I liked the way it looked mostly... and now I'm totally addicted. It is the perfect amount of heat. I'm almost out of it and can't remember the store that I bought it at. So glad that Amazon carries it. I sprinkle it on everything including spinach salads, deviled eggs,  corn on he cob and mangos. Even good on watermelon.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

review/summary: Never Anything But Excellence
review/text: Excellence is what we've come to expect every time we open a bag of a Bob's Red Mill product, and their Soy Flour is no exception.  Soft as cornstarch, it adds just the right amount of low-gluten volume to allow for more successful results when working with vegetarian/vegan alternatives or ultra-soft muffin or pastry doughs.  I've been an avid home baker for over 25 years, and for as long as I've been able to get them, Bob's Red Mill flours and grains have been regular stock in my pantry.  Buon Apetito!

review/text: Bob's Red Mill is always of the highest quality and i always choose their brand over any other.  That being said I must emphatically say that Soy Flour is pretty darn nasty tasting.  I suggest that if you are going to use it, blend it in with other flours (if you can).  you can probably get used to the taste, but kinda leaves an aftertaste that is unpleasant to me at least. good luck!

I too appreciate that it has no MSG and it has no artificial ingredients! Thanks for keeping it real Konriko:)

review/text: I usually order the Organic Nature Select Applesauce from Gerber, however I thought that this is the same product, only DHA enhanced.  The DHA is derived from Tuna Oil which is not so bad, however it also contains Gelatin, derived from pork, not vegetables!.  The product ingredients above does not state that, and is very misleading.  I didn't notice this until my 3 year old ate 3 containers of it!

review/summary: Good product, best price...
review/text: We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an "organic pear-only" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is "cooked" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!

review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/text: When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has "organic" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product "does not have harmful levels of mercury."  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish.

I assumed it with just be veinier. It was veinier but also lacked that great earthy duck taste that you get with grade A and with the canned product. I felt like i was eating chicken liver or something. It wasnt worth the price. I suggest you continue to splurge on grade A. But if you are making a pate' then grade B might suffice- hope this helps

review/summary: Great dog food!!!
review/text: Evanger's Super Premium Pheasant and Brown Rice is a wonderful food for dogs.  I own a Shiba Inu who is very picky about the food we feed her.  It was a challenge finding the right combination of food that would not make her sick or have an upset stomach.  I put this food in front of her and now she paws at the pantry requesting more.  For all dog owners who own a dog who is particular about their food this may be the answer.  I try not to feed my dog table scraps and instead invest in a good dog food with the right nutrients.  My girl is currently eating the Evanger's brand mixed with Stella and Chewey's raw patties.  She absolutely loves the combination!

review/summary: Gave me my life back
review/text: We adopted a standard poodle about a year and a half ago.  She had a hard time just surviving until we discovered she couldn't eat chicken or beef without getting sick.  It's very hard to find a commercial dog food that doesn't have one of those as a major ingredient.  Even many of the lamb and rice formulas have chicken in some form as a major ingredient.  I was making her food fresh twice a week, approximately a three hour process each time.  We had to hand feed it to her most of the time.  Then one day she decided she was done with the food she'd been eating for months.  I had some sample packets of Evanger's Pheasant and Brown Rice.  She ate it!  And she has continued to eat it, a big step for her.  Finally, a quality food, commercially prepared, that she can eat without getting sick and will eat all by herself.  And it's wonderful to have it available on Amazon.  Life's gotten so much easier.

They were both a little on the light side.  Recently I switched to Evangers Pheasant Brown Rice dry dog food.  THey both gobbled it up. I was mixinbg it with their old food and they picked out the Evangers and only ate it.  Their stomachs were fine right away with no problems making the change in diet.  THey both now feel like they should.  THe gained a little weight and look wonderful. I am also giving them a little of the canned Duck that they make as a treet in the food.  THey love it all.

review/text: First of all, I usually don't write reviews but I've always been a fan of spicy food and of course pepper jellys. I purchased the Stonewall Hot Pepper Jelly recently and was impressed.  I use it with butter on crumpets and muffins and often a small bit on a Ritz cracker and brie cheese.  That's good!  The flavor is sweeter than others I've tried but the spicy pepper flavor still jumps out and enhances the sugar on my tongue.  We'll serve it at our Superbowl party by warming slightly and pouring over a wedge of Brie placed on a wedge shaped triangular plate with crackers or those mini toasts.

review/text: While the product itself is a great tasting gluten free food. Amazon did not securely ship these fragile crackers. The package comes in a case of 12. When the box arrived to my home, ten of the trays where completely crushed into tiny cracker fragments. Amazon did not make the effort to enclose the crackers in a safe shipping box. And when I looked into returning the crackers, the website informed me that this was a non-returnable product. After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up. I ended up using the crackers as cracker crumbles in soups and such - This was not my initial intent. Based on this one bad experience, I will never order another food item through Amazon again.

review/summary: GREAT crackers!!!!!!
review/text: Hey couch potatoes and lovers of pure food!  These are dynamite crackers!  Get 'em!  They are made with rice flour, so all of you who need to avoid gluten can enjoy them.  They are unique and delicious.  Gormet and organic.  And the case price is perfect.  The only problem is that they do arrived a bit broken up.  :-(  It seemed that about 1/3 of the crackers were not in whole pieces.  We could live with this, especially for the price, but some folks might find that offensive.  However, we LOVE these crackers and will order them again.  They are not available in our local stores, so ordering them from amazon.com is the way to go for us.

review/summary: LOVE KENYA AA K-CUPS!  ONE OF THE BEST!
review/text: Excellent, simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised.  I consider it to be a medium roast/breakfast blend kind of coffee.  If you are into heavy, dark roasts like French, Italian, or Sumatran, then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste.  However, I love it.  Unfortunately, the one-star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee.

review/text: I bought these expecting a replacement for my beloved but discontinued Van Houtte Kenya Kilimandjaro K-Cups. Those were dark, robust, and fruity with plenty of flavor to stand up to cream.<br /><br />Well, these are not close at all. At best, it is a medium roast and cream just dilutes the flavor. Maybe OK if you drink your coffee black, but not all Kenyan coffees are the same. If it didn't say "Extra Bold," I would not have guessed this was an Extra Bold K-Cup; the flavor just isn't there.

review/text: I just finished eating my first batch of this great popcorn made in my presto air popper. The trick to getting it to pop properly with minimal un-popped kernels is to tilt the air popper back at an angle while waiting for the first dozen or so to pop. After the chamber starts filling with popped corn, set the popper upright and you are good to go! Hope this helps. Really great popcorn too by the way.

review/text: In this package you get three varieties of popcorn, all of which are different, light, fluffy, and fun to eat. Two are of the hulless variety (very tasty and won't stick in between your teeth as much), and the purple kind has a thick kernel and a uniquely nutty taste. All of these stand up to any kind of butter, salt, or seasonings that you might throw their way, and I highly recommend this as a starter package for yourself or a nice gift for one of your corn-poppin' friends.

review/summary: Popcorn SHOULD be fun
review/text: When I came across this Amish Country Popcorn I thought, well why not have some fun and diversity for a change. Ol' Orville looks like a fun-loving guy, so he would agree I'm sure. Heck, he is probably living in Malibu, floating in his horizon pool with his companion Bonita...<br /><br />Started out with the smallest variety, the Ladyfinger. Tiny yellow kernels pop into tiny tender popcorns. Hardly a hull, nothing sticks in your teeth. Harder to eat because of the small size. Cute and delicious. Little kids would like this, cooked just for them.<br /><br />Next was the Baby White. These barely yellow kernels are sort of medium size and like the Ladyfinger variety have little in the way of hulls and are very tender. A quality choice and easier to eat because it pops up larger. Probably more like popcorn from the old days.<br /><br />Lastly, the Purple. Most seem to like this the best. Full size and easy to eat. Again, not too much in the way of hulls. The kernels are purple and they pop to white with purple flecks. Attractive and full size, easy to eat. Nice sort of nutty taste, although popcorn is pretty mild stuff no matter what brand you get.<br /><br />I used a Whirly Pop, a device I recommend. Coat the bottom with olive oil, almost cover the bottom with seeds, turn the heat up to around medium (not too low) and slowly turn the crank. Stop when the popping stops, as it does pretty abruptly, and pour it into a bowl. I season with sea salt and ground pepper. For the butter part, I mix about a small spoonfull of real butter with a slug or three of olive oil, heated together in the micro. Definite butter flavor without all the fat. Not a bad compromise at all.<br /><br />All varieties popped almost completely, not many duds.<br /><br />This makes a great breakfast, takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />This popcorn is advertised as from Amish country and presumably is more a traditional style of corn, maybe a heritage variety, not a genetically modified product like Orville's. This is a controversial subject, important to many people and this product is an alternative to "Corporate Popcorn" for them.

I found the Amish country popcorn somewhat as advertised.  The purple were tasty with larger kernels.  However, the smaller kernels did poorly in air popper.  Kernels kept flying out because of being so much smaller and lighter weight.  Did like the taste and give an A+ for less hulls.

review/summary: Good Popcorn even in a hot air popper
review/text: Please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt (and maybe a little butter).<br /><br />My pack came today.  The directions said that a serving was 3 tablespoons, so I took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my (very old) hot air popper and turned it on.  It popped fine with only a few un-popped kernels  and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small -- perhaps 1/3 of the number that I get with "regular" popcorn.  The popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped, but the that's to be expected since they are about 1/2 the size when it starts out.  The flavor of all three varieties is good and I could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste.  I could not distinguish between the three varieties visually (but I didn't do a careful inspection, I just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as I was putting it in my mouth.  I used about half a tablespoon of melted (real) butter and a decent size pinch of salt.  I thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable, perhaps not as much as I usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than I usually eat in terms of number of kernels.  I'll try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review.<br /><br />In summary, it's a touch pricy for popcorn, but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store  popcorn and I'd buy it again (especially with free (Prime) shipping).

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I am disappointed in this product. For reasons unknown to me, it doesn't pop well at all in my electric air popper.<br />I've never had a problem with other brands. Perhaps it has to do with the small size of the kernels. But rather than pop, they pretty much just fly around the kitchen...unpopped!!

review/text: This popcorn pops up in very small kernals.  However, the flavor is very good and much better than the "store" bought popcorn.  The small baby white is my favorite.  The purple is the most bland.  Overall though, worth buying if you like good popcorn.

review/summary: Tried the all & here's my advice
review/text: I got the combo starter pack. Flavor is good with all of the varieties, but they have their pros and cons. Baby White are very tiny and a bit hard to eat with fingers, so I ended up using a big spoon to eat (also too many unpopped kernels).  Gourmet red IS less hulls, but a bit larger than Baby White, but still too small for my tastes, but it DOES have great flavor. Gourmet White medium is an excellent choice, pops well, crunchy, flavorful, easy to pick up. My Favorite is Purple Popcorn with good sized kernels, nutty flavor almost, tender, perfection and looks good in the bowl (not that it matters).  All of their popcorn is grown so much better than conventional popcorn - no doubt due to their old-fashioned ways of farming.... thank you Amish Community for being this way. No more Jolly Time or Orville's for me.  My only negative review is that glass corn popper device they sell, does not work well in microwaves... too many un-popped kernels and if you put too much it'll burn real easy and ya end up with a very stinky microwave and kitchen UGH!  IF they know how to make it work, give very detailed instructions or discontinue.

However, don't be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face! Does NOT feel good. Popcorn has a great, distinct flavor and I think we will be returning for more.

review/summary: Dangerously addictive
review/text: If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/summary: Wonderful Plain Poppadoms
review/text: These are the best brand of poppadoms, and I have tried many. I am in a rural area and recently unable to find them in the local stores. I even watched a video on how to make poppadoms. Living in Florida, I knew the sun-dried aspect was obtainable. But as it is winter, I decided to wait until summer before attempting this.<br />Not wanting to wait until summer to have poppadoms with curry, I went back to searching online. As they are called many things by many different people, I now search for poppadom (yes, many different spellings), udad, papad. I was really happy to find these on Amazon.<br />These are fresh and "bendy", unlike the more famous brands which are truly brittle and dried out. I can almost see these by Lijjat being sun dried a few weeks before I use them. After cooking, they are larger, lighter and more crisp than the usual poppadoms, and taste wonderful.<br />I may never try to make my own, as these are probably much better than I could ever make.

review/summary: Look for the specific brand.
review/text: Lijjat Papad is the only brand I trust to consistently perform well for me. I tend to roast mine over an open flame (god bless gas stoves!), but my sister-in-law likes to do hers in the microwave. It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly.

review/summary: You have to do it right!
review/text: This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.  I make 5L at a time, one of each flavor and it is always a hit.

review/summary: not a good value at 9.95, but passable for half price
review/text: I was dissapointed with this product's retail price.  While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor).

review/summary: Pretty good for stevia
review/text: For someone who is trying to slowly switch over from regular diet sodas/drinks to all natural diet substitutes, I have tried a variety of stevia flavored drinks (aka stevia sweetened sodas and teas). This my first time trying a powdered drink. And it's better than what I expected. I was bit wary after reading some of the reviews. You can add just a little bit and it's enough to sweeten my tea or just water. I am not a fan of drinking water (except fiji or while working out) and this can easily quench my thirst when I add the right amount. If I add too much its a mix between bitter and sweet and it's not that good. It's something I add for flavour and a great alternative for a healthy diet nut who likes tasty drinks. I would like to try the orange so I can add it to tea and make it DIY iced orange tea.
