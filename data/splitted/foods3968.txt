review/summary: A truely pleasurable flavored coffee.
review/text: I make coffee for myself and my significant other nearly every weekday morning using a Krups grinder and a Bodum press.<br /><br />Normally we buy coffee in small quantities from bulk bins at the local Safeway, Whole Foods, and Sunflower Market (the later of which roasts their own) and the only other time I've tried whole bags like this was from Starbucks which was a truly unpleasant experience to have to use up.<br /><br />But this coffee is delightful!  It's well packed with a dehumidification button so it was very fresh.  Standard dark bag with closure otherwise so you can keep it that way for a while.  It's some of the oiliest beans I've seen (which means very rich/strong coffee if you use the same amount).  It grinds well (although does tend to "powder" more, creating more sediment that slips through the metal filter on the Bodum).<br /><br />Not very bitter at all and you can definitely taste the caramel and chocolate, especially if you slurp it.  Gives it a great natural sweetness (which yeah, I do supplement with Stevia) even though it is a stronger coffee.  Seems to be medium acid, medium roast.  The smell is not as chocolaty as some of the grocery store chocolate varieties, but it's still pleasant and the taste is superior to the grocery store in my mind, even if the chocolate/caramel are supporting players to the coffee flavor (as they should be) instead of trying to overwhelm it like, say, the chocolate macadamia variety sold by Safeway.<br /><br />Great smell, pleasant to drink, good after taste and hits the tongue well.  No real complaints, save that 2 lbs will take me several months to use.  I'd definitely be tempted to order from this company again and it'd be nice to try more of their flavors.  Love the freshness and oiliness of the beans.  Great job!

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I have had many different kinds of coffee. I have also become excited about many different coffees I have purchased because they smelled like they would taste like chocolate, caramel, vanilla, etc. They NEVER have! So, when we found this at our local Big Lots (I know! Score!) I wasn't expecting much. Oh my gosh! I was pleasantly surprised! BEST TASTING coffee, period! It actually tasted like chocolate and caramel and my house smelled AMAZING for hours after I brewed just one cup! Excited to see that Amazon carries it and that almost all the reviewers think it is as great as I think it is. I will be purchasing this through Amazon now, as I don't think I will find it elsewhere in our small town.

review/text: I usually don't like caramel candy as it is too sweet, but I was pursuaded to try this flavor - and love it!  The flavors of caramel and brownies are beautifully blended with the coffee flavor and not a bit too sweet.  I have recently ordered more of this flavor and will continue to do so.  Cameron's Coffees are very smooth and creamy.

review/summary: Has Me Brewing an Extra Pot!
review/text: I don't add anything except a small amount of half & half to my coffee, so I expect most of the taste to come from the bean and it's flavorings.<br /><br />This coffee is excellent, it has enough chocolate and sweetness to sooth without becoming overwhelming or sugary.<br /><br />I'm normally an AM coffee drinker, but I now often make a 4-cup pot of this instead of a soft drink in the afternoon.<br /><br />The price is amazing. If you don't go through it very fast, freezing it does NOT hurt. There are anecdotal claims that it does, but they come from the same people that say you have to use your coffee up within several days after the beans have been roasted!  Blind taste tests indicate freezing in a sealed bag doesn't damage whole beans, but make sure you've let it thaw in its sealed container so it doesn't absorb unwanted flavors from the air.<br /><br />I use three or four different beans as the mood strikes me. So, I put half a pound of this at a time in an old small coffee can and keep the rest frozen, sealed well-enough in it's original package.

review/summary: Very good coffee (whole bean)
review/text: I think the best part of having this coffee may be grinding it up!  It smells so good.  The taste is very pleasant and doesn't give me heartburn (as some other coffees do).  The chocolate taste is not overwhelming, and according to the company's website (which I checked before buying it) they do not add any sugars to the coffee.  I find myself adding less sweetener to this coffee because I like the chocolate taste.  I can imagine (although I have not yet tried it) that this might also be good in a few baking recipes that call for coffee.  I will be a repeat purchaser of this coffee, which I have not yet found in any store.

The chocolate and caramel combo is perfect for that first cup in the morning, an afternoom pick me up, or an after dinner treat.

review/summary: Add sweetness to your boring coffee ...
review/text: My background in coffee has range ... I can drink the strongest Starbucks coffee or the weaker store bought varieties ... but one thing is for sure, I like my coffee.<br /><br />When I ordered this coffee, I gathered from the current reviews that it was going to be very flavorful and aromatic. This was indeed the case ... it smells and tastes like its namesake. But as with most flavored coffees, it may bore you after awhile (especially since you get a huge amount ... 32 ounces!).<br /><br />I've found that mixing three parts of your more straightforward coffee with one part Cameron's Chocolate Caramel Brownie coffee adds a hint of that amazing flavor without overwhelming your taste buds. Try your own mixture to find that perfect match!

review/summary: Bitter Coffee
review/text: I usually find flavored coffees to have a bitter aftertaste that reminds me of pecan or walnut skins. If you don't have a similar opinion of flavored coffees in general than I doubt this particular one will bother you either. I make coffee in a ratio of 1: 5, chocolate flavored to regular( 8 O'clock 100% Columbian) so it's not like this bitterness is the result of an entire pot of flavored coffee. Chocolate caramel flavor should be smooth and full. When I opened the coffee the beans had a distinctly greasy look and feel. I bought this because of a 'Quick Picks' offer. I have been ordering Coffee Master's Dark Chocolate Decadence via Subscribe and Save and will return to this. I do not find this to be bitter. [...]<br />Update: The bitterness and greasiness must have been the result of some volatile oil. After the container was open for a while both dissipated.

review/summary: Exquisite.
review/text: In 1989, during my first trip to China, I was sightseeing on Lamma Island, near Hong Kong.  I spent the entire day there and was rather amazed to not see another Westerner.  It was October and the weather was excellent.<br /><br />Browsing the local markets I spotted tins of tea in one small shop.  I was relatively young at the time--only 39--and being rather uncultured I did not know anything about tea.  Purely guessing I selected two tins each of Lichee Black and Jasmine to take back home with me.<br /><br />When I returned home I put the tins in the cabinet and subsequently forgot them.  Years passed and the tins were packed away during various job-related relocations.  My wife then developed a love for fine tea and was therefor given my tins.<br /><br />One afternoon soon after she asked me about the origin of the tins.  I had to think for a while to remember when/where I had originally purchased it.  Much to my surprise, I realized those tins were now 20 years old.  Curious as to their condition I opened one of the tins of Lichee Black.  The aroma was very clean and inviting.  I therefore made myself a cup.  The flavor of that cup of 20 year-old Lichee Black tea was the finest, most genteel I had ever had.<br /><br />In the subsequent 2-3 years, we've grown to appreciate many varieties of tea.  I continue to hoard my half-pound tin of Lichee Black tea and even after repeatedly opening the canister, the tea continues to stay fresh and aromatic, and incredibly smooth.<br /><br />Having just returned this week from my 5th trip to China (Shanghai and Nanchang, this time) I went to good old Amazon to see if my Lichee Black is still commercially available.  I am amazed and very pleased to see that it is.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this variety of tea, whether you are a connoisseur or a novice.

review/text: I have been drinking this brand of lichee tea for over 30 years, whenever I could find it (thank goodness for the internet). The quality has never faltered. As other reviewers say, the lichee in the tea is not overpowering--more of a delicate roselike aroma than a fruity taste. The tea itself is not too tannic, and it re-heats well.

review/text: Couple of years ago a friend of mine gave me some lichee tea that he brought from China. That tea tasted absolutely wonderful, so when I ran out of it I decided to get it from Amazon. Unfortunately I couldn't find the exact same tea, but I figured that lichee tea from china shouldn't be that different from one another, so I ordered Golden Sail brand Lichee Black Tea. Well... what can I say? the difference is huge. This tea is by no means the real thing. It is a decent black tea and I'll drink it, but it's more on the bland side, it has nothing of the wonderful aroma and sweetness of the lichee tea that I had before.

review/text: My daughter and I visited a Japanese tea house and they served lychee iced tea which neither of us had had before. We loved it. (At first it seemed strange--it IS unusual--but it grew on us very quickly.) If you're into trying novel teas, try this!<br /><br />I decided we needed to have some of our own and bought this brand. At first, upon opening, I thought wow, it's really heavily perfumed, and thought maybe we wouldn't like it, but it brews a perfect pot of subtly sweet/flowery tea (I don't use a lot of the leaves and I brew for three minutes, served with milk). Haven't made it iced, yet, but I will.<br /><br />I like that they double seal the container. While everybody else is cutting costs and packaging as cheaply as possible, this is a very nice bonus and will keep the tea flavorful for a long time, I think.<br /><br />I use this for our "special" tea, don't drink it every day, because I don't want to become so used to it that it becomes ordinary.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tea!

The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.<br /><br />But, I also realize that not everyone will agree.  What i like, you may not and vice verse.<br /><br />My recommendation... buy 1 bag (it's now sold in local stores where i live) and if you like it, then come back to Amazon for more as the prices here are often the best, unless the company is running a special.

This coffee is very smooth and I didn't really need much cream which is a good sign. I like a medium to dark blends so this one falls a little more on the lighter side but wasn't weak.

review/summary: Real Nice Brew, But Be Careful.
review/text: This is a real nice beer. Excuse me, Ale. And what an ale it is! Real rich, hoppy flavor and full bodied. Nice aroma. Don't confuse this with the pale imitations that are sold on most supermarket shelves. Sierra Nevada Topedo Extra IPA is bold! Just look at the alcohol content. It's 7.2 % and that's really up there. Please be careful about drinking this stuff and driving. When you say "But Ocifer, I've only had two Sierra Nevada Topedos." you may be legally drunk. Torpedoed, so to speak. But sitting at home with the TV on, it's a real nice brew!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: great place to buy hard to find oatmeal
review/text: My daughters ages 6 and 8 love this oatmeal. It starts as little eggs and then when the hot water hits them the egg coating starts to melt and inside is a gummy sort of dinosaur. This oatmeal for some reason is hard to find in the stores so when I found it on amazon I was super excited. However, like a previous reviewer said, when we recieved the shipment, some of the boxes were open and some of the boxes had beeen taped shut with clear tape. I will still keep my suscription but amazon please look into this issue.

review/summary: Cool Dino Eggs!
review/text: I have a 22-month old son who loves everything dinosaur.  Including this cereal.  The dino eggs are actually pretty cool... they're basically little pellets of sugar that dissolve when you stir in the hot water.  The outer sugar shell dissolves and what is left behind are these little colorful dino shapes.  There are probably about a dozen or so green, red and orange "friends" in each packet.<br /><br />Be aware, though, that you are paying a premium for these little dino eggs.  Each of these boxes only contains 8 packets as opposed to regular Quaker oatmeal that comes 10 packets to a box.

review/summary: The very best!
review/text: Let me start the review by saying that I have not purchased this from Amazon, so I don't know of any packaging issues that may happen.  However, my review is of the oatmeal itself, not of the seller.<br />I grew up eating this oatmeal, and it is the absolute best.  It's hard to decide whether to leave the dinosaurs in their eggs or take them out of the oatmeal beforehand; I usually take the eggs out, make the oatmeal, and eat the eggs separately (This may not be the best idea, because the sugary "egg" around the dinosaur is a large part of what sweetens the oatmeal).  The oatmeal itself is delicious, and tastes very authentic.  The dinosaur eggs were a great incentive when I was younger to eat a healthy breakfast, and they make the entire meal exceptionally better.  Perhaps it's because I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to the dinosaur egg oatmeal, but I absolutely adore these and will buy them as long as I can!

Good size portion and keeps me going until lunchtime. Love it!<br /><br />The dinosaurs are only an added benefit, as far as I'm concerned...!

review/summary: Great price but what is with the open boxes. A bit bland.
review/text: I got this 4 pack for $8.10 after a coupon code and I have to say, it's a bit bland, although the dino eggs are kinda cool. Two of the boxes were opening and the other two are part of the pack at the botton side that I didn't open yet but I have no idea why all the boxes are prematurely opening. Something is causing the individual boxes to be open prematurely. Were the bulk packs dropped at some point bursting the seals? There is very little sealing the boxes closed. Just two glue points on either end.<br /><br />My order was bought on the 13th of February and the "Best if used before date" is Jun 14 2012. Just called theQuaker and the rep said these have a shelf life of about 18 months and approximated these were just two months old, so good job Amazon. Quaker rep was kind and sent out some coupons and suggested that the boxes should be sealed and under no condition be opened and to make a report with Amazon. Only two of the boxes holding the 8 envelopes were opened. The other two boxes remained closed, no spillage of the actual oatmeal occurred.

review/summary: Marzipan made with corn syrup isn't up to snuff
review/text: I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the old addage is true:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, has a low almond content, and is flavored with a hint of citrus that masks any almond flavor whatsoever.  I may as well have been eating lemon-scented glue sticks.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety.  Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.  They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.<br /><br />I will never buy cheap marzipan again, and I have thrown out the bulk marzipan that I purchased from this company.

Yeah, that's a LOT of marzipan.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, it is DELICIOUS! We opened the box up right away and dove right in. The candy was finely ground, without a grainy texture we've found in some other candy.  It was nicely sweet and intensely almond flavored.  Even my picky two-year-old tried a piece and asked for a second.<br /><br />To prolong our enjoyment of the candy, we froze two of the trays and are quickly working our way through the third.

review/text: I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough.

review/text: I don't consider myself a food snob by any means, but this isn't the best.<br /><br />The good stuff is a pure almond-sugar paste. This has a slight almond-lemony flavor that's loaded with corn syrup, definitely isn't the real deal. I would imagine if you grew up with this, you may have a nostalgic connection to it; you may like it if you like very sugary-tasting sweets.<br /><br />Personally I'll keep looking. I thought when I found it at T.J. Maxx it was a good deal but it was disappointing. Also, the fruits look dimensional through the box lid, but really they're cut in half. I'd love to be able to find someplace in the U.S. that offers the real fruit-shaped marzipan instead of these expensive substitutes. Bummer.

review/summary: Nice and smooth no bitter taste!
review/text: I've tried about 30 varieties and this is one of my everyday cups. This actually tastes like Folgers which I also like but this is cheaper. I think in fact they make this? I use the 10oz setting on my Keurig and this is just right for me. For those who like a strong cup then they might want the smaller setting. I have had a few guests ask me what kind of coffee this was as they really liked it. Must be a low acid blend as it never upsets my stomach even after 5 cups. Very smooth taste. I'm not a coffee connoisseur but after tasting so many different K-cups I can tell you this one is one of the best.

review/summary: Great Coffee at Ripoff Price
review/text: This is great coffee.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I seem to love a light roast that feels "thick", and doesn't have a bitter aftertaste.  Millstone is the best I have found.  It's smooth and doesn't feel watery.  What I don't understand is how it can sell for over a dollar a cup.  That's twice the price at a local store, and there are so many kcups at this price on this site.  Are there that many fools and lazy folks out there to keep this ripoff going?  Local stores sell for 55 cents a cup before tax and coupons.  Maybe this fits people in remote locations, but it sure is expensive.  They must make more off you folks than if they sold more cups at a lower price.

review/text: Don't buy Millstone in the K-cups! We've used Millstone coffee beans for years. In my opinion, it's the best you can buy. I thought the Millstone K-cups for my Keurig would be just as good. They aren't. Maybe the coffee that I got was old - it tastes old - but whatever happened between Millstone and my coffee maker ruined the coffee. I bought two boxes of this at a "special price" and am stuck with it since you can't return food products to Amazon. This is the worst cup of coffee I've ever had from a Keurig. It doesn't even smell good. Stick with Tully's or Green Mountain.

review/summary: Medium-Light Roast Coffee. Decent Blend. Very, Very Slight Hint of Bitter.
review/text: This Millstone Breakfast Blend falls into the medium-light roast category; however, I wouldn't go larger than a 10oz cup for this categorization.  The blend is what I'd consider a typical Breakfast Blend - good as a compliment to your meal.  The taste isn't bad, but it also doesn't have an outstanding flavor.  It doesn't have a bad flavor either, although there are slight hints of bitterness (not a gut tearing bitter, just a whisper of bitter, which a splash of cream/milk would override).<br /><br />For a medium coffee, I'd rank <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZB2">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> slightly higher on the preference grid.  However, given coffee prices and Amazon specials, if price were an issue, I'd be happy with any of these three choices.

review/text: I just bought six dozen Millstone Breakfast Blend Light Roast K Cups and am having a problem. Water does not come out of the cups I have tried. The machine works fine with other cups however with the new cups out of the batch I just bought water does not come out of them.  Best if used by Feb 11, 2013  2138725  PL054  14:48  is on the back of the box.  Since AMAZON will not accept food products for refund or replacement.  I guess I am out $43.92 with no recourse.<br /><br />UPDATE I contacted Keurig, they sent me credit for the defective K cups.  It seems Keurig buys coffee from coffee companies and they put it into K cups. Any problem with getting the coffee out of the K cups is Keurigs job to solve.

review/text: My kids and I LOVE this drink!  It is relatively healthy and my 11 yr. old chooses it over a soft drink, which I think is great!  Will say this though - VERY disappointed with the shipping! I ordered 3 cases that came in 2 separate boxes. Opened the smaller box first and didn't open the 2nd one until today.  A bottle in each of the 2 cases had somehow leaked.  One bottle was completely empty in the first case, the other was about 1/3 empty (but won't use it because of this!).  Was a big mess too!  Needs to be packaged better - no packing peanuts or bubble wrap, just the 2 cases stacked on top of each other!!  Wish there was a way to let them know too!  Anyway, love the product, just hope it arrives better next shipment!

I rarely drink anything else and my husband laughs about this - what would I do if I had no black rasberry ICE in the house?  The answer to that question is that I'm never without it!  I'm not fond of the other flavors and recommend that you try the black rasberry first and if you like it (and I bet you will) stick with this flavor.

review/summary: Delicious Fruit-flavored Drink.
review/text: Not too long ago I discovered the "Sparkling Ice" Lemon-Lime drink and enjoyed it very much. Next, I tried the Black Raspberry flavor. I like it even better. Mmmm, good. It's ever-so-slightly carbonated with a nice fresh flavor. Goes down easily. One surprise is that it somewhat sweet. Sweet. Hmmmm. I looked over the ingredients at the suggestion of a reader and there's no sugar but it evidently has an artificial sweeteners in sucralose, perhaps it's also getting it's sweetness from the blackberry juice concentrate. Which brings up an interesting point . The drink is called black raspberry, but raspberry is not listed in the ingredients. Blackberry is listed. No matter, really, the main thing is that it's a quite good fruit-flavored drink essentially free of calories and  I enjoy the very low sweetness.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Then one day my mad-scientist mate poured leftovers from three different flavors together, and the tartness of the Pink Grapefruit and Orange Mango offset the (for me) slightly cloying taste of the Raspberry.  I'd still rank it, along with my preferred flavors, much higher than any other soda, diet or otherwise, out there.
