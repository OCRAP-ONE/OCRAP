review/summary: Healthy and Simple
review/text: I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long.

review/summary: Pricey but the dogs love it
review/text: My two dogs love Wellness brand dog food.  It's expensive but I just feel I'm doing the right thing for them with food I think is probably good really meaty food. They have begin to turn away from Newmans and I sure don't trust Alpo since the Chinese dogfood scare, but the various Wellness products are the best I can do for my little (and quite big) best friends.

review/text: It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.

She has never failed to clean her bowl when it contains the lamb.  Her digestive system seems to handle it quite well for canned food.  My only complaint is the cost, but she is worth it.

review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

review/summary: Cold-free for over 2 years!
review/text: My son first bought me a bottle of Goji Juice 2-1/2 years ago for my birthday; the intent was to try to diminish my arthritis pain in my two thumbs. I started drinking about 3 ounces each morning, hoping to notice some reduction of discomfort; unfortunately, that never came. However, I've been cold-free and virtually sick-free ever since. At times, when I've been directly exposed to people coughing, sneezing, and suffering from various ailments, I have experienced the initial signs of a cold, but that's as far as it progresses. Within a day, my health is restored and I'm feeling strong once again.<br />I highly recommend Goji - all it takes is a few sips in the morning to stay healthy and feel great.

review/text: This is a very good fish fry and makes your fish very flavorful and crispy, but putting it on is a bit more delicate than with other brands. This tends to clump up a bit if too moist at all and won't deviate over your seafood. You may end up with a little more breading on parts of your fish, which is totally ok unless you're a perfectionist :)

review/text: One of the best diet variants out there.  (Other types I find quite good; Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Mountain Dew.)<br />No aftertaste, subtle to the point of very easily ignored "fake" flavor.  Does tend toward a really heavy carbonation; you may like it, but I find it kind of irritating to my sinuses, so I tend to pour it over ice and let it sit a bit.  Not as obvious of a spice note as the leaded variety, but it still has the bite you expect from Barq's.

review/summary: Good Tasting Jerky - Recommended
review/text: The Buffalo Bills "Honey Pepper Beef Jerky" is a very tender and good tasting snack. The honey flavor is not overpowering and the pepper adds a nice "bite".<br /><br />My only issue is that it does contain MSG (which I didn't notice until ater I ate it), so be advised if that is an issue for you.<br /><br />A very good tasing, high quality jerky! Recommended.

review/text: Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago.  The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming. I generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product.  I would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others.

review/summary: The best online
review/text: I recently found myself on a jerky hunt.  After visting Texas and finding out that real jerky is nothing like a Slim Jim I have been looking to find anything with serious pepper and heat.  This is the best I could find.  The only reason this is not five stars is because there is better jerky, just not packaged as far as I have found.<br /><br />The pices are meaty and firm.  They could use more pepper but there is enough to give you a nice little burn that builds while you eat and for a little while after.  The 8oz packages are far more than you will find in most stores but if you find this is what you like, you will still go through it in a week pretty easily so you might as well buy two.

review/summary: Hands down, the best jerky I've EVER eaten!
review/text: While I discovered this product through Amazon, I purchased it through their website so that I'd be sure to receive a free sample (also saved 1 penny!). Sorry Amazon, I still love you! Amazon is a better deal if only ordering one or two of their products.<br /><br />This jerky FAR exceeded my expectations.  It's not too peppery nor is it too sweet.  They balanced the flavors PERFECTLY!  The flavors don't taste artificial as can be the case with some products.  There's a subtle sweet honey flavor in the background, with a stronger peppery taste in the foreground.  Just DELICIOUS!<br /><br />The beef itself is not too moist, nor too tough when chewing.  The consistency is perfect.  It even looks appetizing, the pieces not being thick and clunky, nor too thin.  They really nailed this product.<br /><br />I purchased this to eat when I'm working late and need a quick snack.  Considering the price, I'd planned to save it for when I really needed it.  It's already gone, including the other flavors I ordered.  It's THAT good!<br /><br />BUY SOME!

review/text: I got this and the western cut sweet n' spicy. I liked this more. The country cut is thicker pieces and overall just better; seems more homemade. I love the combination of the pepper and the honey. You wouldn't know it was honey; it just adds a little sweetness. I wouldn't have liked a strong honey flavor anyway. It also has a smell that I really like. You have to try it. If you have to pick one kind of Buffalo Bills, try this one first.

review/text: This jerky is just great.  It was expensive, but at the same time the consistency and softness of the jerky was absolutely great, and the taste was very good for packaged beef jerky.  I would definitely recommend this, however I wish they were less expensive... I might not be buying this regularly just because of the price, since it's pretty much double of what I paid for Wild Ride jerky, which definitely isn't as good, but is more economical for me as a poor college student.

review/text: The actual meat was fine.  The problem with this product is the quantity and strength of the pepper.  It burns your mouth there is so much of it.  I had to use a knife to scrape the pepper off of the surface before I could stand to eat it.  Also very salty.  If you love pepper or can't taste pepper, then this might be for you.

review/summary: Move over, jams and jellies!
review/text: This is absolutely delicious! It makes jams and jellies look bad! Unlike jelly, this is a thick paste with a rich mouthfeel. What does it taste like? Apparently, quince is a pome fruit related to apples and pears, but it's hard to say exactly what it tastes like. It's different from any fruit I've ever tasted, and I can't really tell you that it tastes much like apple or pear. It has a flavor of its own. Try it!<br /><br />It's amazing on whole wheat toast, crackers, and pita chips, either alone or with a bit of Earth Balance buttery spread. I made a Bakewell Tart with a quince paste filling which was even tastier than any jam-filled tart I've ever made. If only this became more popular so grocery stores would carry it!<br /><br />Ingredients: Quince paste, sugar and lemon.

Based on their shape, size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky, they can choke your dog.  DON'T BUY THESE. PERIOD.

review/text: We made this seasoning purchase based upon the item as-pictured. Unfortunately, the received seasoning is quite different from what was pictured. To explain further, Lawry's made a significant change in their taco seasoning, not for the better, a number of months ago. When they did so, they also changed the packaging of the product. We based our purchase upon the pictured seasoning, the "old" and tasty seasoning, yet what we received was the "new" and not-so-tasty seasoning, which can be purchased at any grocery store. Not worth sending back, but if what you're looking for is the good stuff, avoid this one. I finally think I'm going to try my hand at making my own taco seasoning.

review/summary: Delicious Taco Seasoning, no MSG
review/text: This is the classic Lawry's taco seasoning. I'm probably biased because I grew up eating this stuff every week, but it really tastes far better than the rest of the seasoning mixes out there. I suspect that it's the unique set of ingredients you find on the label like milk (solids) and cocoa powder (hint of mole flavor?) give Lawry's a depth of flavor that others lack. AND no sign of MSG, "autolyzed yeast extract", etc. on the label either! Good on beef or, my personal favorite, ground chicken breast (most other seasonings seem to fall flat when combined with ground chicken breast.)

review/summary: Old, Outdated Dog Treats...Made my dogs puke!
review/text: Prior to this purchase, I had been a staunch supporter of Dog Nips brand (previously "Free Range" brand) chicken wrapped apple treats.  And, perhaps it's just this particular merchant that sold me old, outdated dog treats.?  But in any case, they made both my dog & my parent's dog puke.<br /><br />Only after both dogs became sick did I closely inspect the bags for an expiration date.  The only thing I could find was an imprint on the front that said "LOT # 20110305."  I took this as an expiration date of March 5, 2011.  I just recently bought the treats (in October 2011,) so they were very outdated!  When I received them, the chicken had indeed appeared somewhat darker in color than other bags I've bought in the past, but I didn't think a whole lot of it.  After the dogs became sick, however, I felt I had to discontinue feeding them to our dogs.  3 BAGS & APPROXIMATELY $50 DOWN THE DRAIN!<br /><br />I was very unhappy with the purchase, and I wouldn't recommend ever buying doog food or treats online because of this experience!

review/text: I tried this product once. My dogs loved them. Just found out they are made in China, where everything is inferior. They are also made dirt cheap. But the price of 3 bags pushing $50 is what put me over the top. One of my dogs is Newfie, so 3 bags is a snack. I don't like this buying from China and being charged a quality 'Made In America' price. It's a dog treat for pete's sake. I guess my babies will have to do w/o this poor quality high priced item.

review/summary: Great for allergy dog....stuff them in a Kong!
review/text: The best part about these is they can be literally jammed into the Large size Kong stuffable dog toys and my aggressive chewer Dobermans will enjoy chewing them to get the treats out for quite a while because its such a tight fit!<br />Another up side is they are allergen-free for my Doberman who's allergic to rice, corn, peas, carrots, and the list goes on and on.<br />The dogs love them, too!<br />The down side of these treats is that they're made in China.<br />My local specialty pet food store used to carry them a little bit cheaper, but now that they don't anymore I'll buy them here!

review/summary: Tasty Treats - Questionable source
review/text: Treats smell so good I would like to eat them myself. They are manufactured in China and they look shiny on the outside and I am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this. I have concerns because of China's reputation, plus they eat dogs in China,so how concerned could they be with making a clean expensive dog treat for rich Americans!

review/summary: Very poor quality, made in China
review/text: I'd seen some reviews saying the treats were old but I'd had good luck -- that ran out with this last shipment.  They were obviously old, meat darkened and extremely hard, and my dog became sick.  I can't seem to find these treats any longer that aren't either made in China or of inconsistent quality or both.  My dog will have to adjust to not getting her favorite treat -- I feel they're getting too risky.

review/summary: My fussy Poodle loves these treats!!
review/text: My little poodle is soooooooo pickey...she never eats treats.<br />I purchased these hoping she'd eat it. I bought.........<br />14oz Free Range Apple Chicken Breast Wraps, also banana wrap & liver wrap.<br />She LOVES all 3 of them...WOW what a surprise. The treats are not hard so it's easy for the princess to chew. lol  I give it to her whole...normally anything I give her has to be cut up in tiny pieces.<br /><br />Okay, now here is my big concern. I just realized they are "Made In China".<br />I don't like this. With all the tainted products out there, the majority come from China. Take a LQQK at FDA recalls...veterinary. I am not saying that this product is bad, it may not be & than it may be bad for dogs.<br />I have to research it further, as we all should do before letting our pets eat treats & food.  I hope this is okay for my dog since it is the only treat that she'll eat.

review/text: Pometta's Marinara.  Wife used this over meat balls and on pasta, never had a better sauce.  Finally someone has come up with a gluten free and organic pasta sauce that can't be beat.  Great consistency and not pasty like the national brands in the grocery store.  Also, tried roasted garlic and would give that 5 star too.  Better than any restaurant.

review/summary: Great for a Gluten Free Biscuit mix!
review/text: They were thick, like Bisquick biscuits. They tasted great. Would be WONDERFUL in Chicken & Dumplings...<br /><br />The only thing I did wrong when making them, was using Bob's Red Mill sAll purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in. It made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans... yuck! I used White Rice flour, and they tasted great ;)<br /><br />For a "buttery" flavor, put butter (or, if you are GFCF a non-casien containing margarine spread) on the top for a taste similar to KFC. Taste great with jelly in the middle, too. :) I froze the unbaked "left-over" biscuits, and they turned out well 2 months later. :)

review/summary: GF Personal Preference for EXCELLENT bread source
review/text: This mix has been a true life-changer for me.  I learned to bake from Southerners, so the recipe on the package doesn't work for my taste.  As noted by some other reviewers, I found the biscuits MUCH too hard and dry for me.  However, I also lived outside of Boston for several years and if you like the dry style of New England Scones, you'll probably like this, too.<br /><br />I make the biscuits in my food processor with some small modifications to the recipe.  Where Bob's recipe calls for 3/4 Cup of milk, I use 3/4 C of lowfat organic milk and 3/4 C of organic buttermilk for a total of 1.5 Cups of milk.  I also use half butter and half organic non-hydrogenated shortening.  The dough comes out of the machine very loose and sloppy, but you knead in a little rice flour to tighten it up, roll and portion with a biscuit cutter.  YUM!  Light, fluffy GLUTEN FREE biscuits.  We LOVE them!<br /><br />I get about 18 biscuits from a batch with this technique.  I line an airtight container with parchment or wax paper and store them in the fridge, then heat in the microwave for 30 seconds when I'm ready for bread.  One batch lasts me for a week when I'm the only person eating them.  If we have house guests, they go faster.

review/summary: Works well in nearly any recipe
review/text: I've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie.  To get height, I whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks.  They've turned out great and you can't tell it's gluten-free.  I've had less luck making biscuits out of it -- came out hard -- but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten-free flour mix.

review/summary: Made of Beans, tastes like Beans
review/text: The second ingredient is Garbanzo beans and when they were done they tasted of beans.  Almost a corn-bread like taste...but mostly of beans.  I couldn't even enjoy them with butter.<br /><br />As some have said, they would likely be great as dumplings, or anything else that hides the flavor.<br /><br />But to bite into them with butter, you will only taste beans.<br /><br />Also, I used the lower amount of recommended water and they did not rise and came out as flat cookies.  I used the highest amount of water suggested for the second batch and they really didn't rise any better.  I did not over mix or over knead. (yet some reviewers say you need to add much more water and really mix a lot to instill air into the mix)...<br /><br />I will say, that these could be used as dumplings or something like that.  To not waste these, I am going to freeze them and when I can make a main dish that is moist enough, I will spoon it over the top of these.<br /><br />I will try again, but not with something using bean flour in the recipe.  Now that I read other's reviews, they all seem to agree this mix doesn't make good biscuits but is apparently great for other things.<br /><br />I included a picture of them above.<br /><br />Also, being as the main ingredient is rice, these will not brown.  But that is typical of anything made of rice.  It stays white/light.....

review/text: These are some of the worse biscuits I've ever tasted.  They were very gritty and very heavy.  I tried making them several times (altering the recipe to try to get added lightness) and nothing really resolved the problem, especially the grittiness.  I have used many different Bob's Red Mill products and have loved all of them except this one.  I have used several other GF products from other producers, and, this takes the cake for the worst.  This is especially sad since Bob's usually has such great products.

review/summary: Great to use for 'newbies'
review/text: We recently had a houseguest who needed a gluten-free diet. Never having to cook for someone with this diet restriction before had us more nervous than my husband and I needed to be. We bought this product and made some great tasting baked goods and it wasn't as hard as we thought. We made scones and banana bread with wonderful success and also used Bob's rice flour to dust any surface needed. Seems to work interchangably with other baking mixes and easily in recipes calling for regular flour and leavening agents (baking soda, powder,etc...). We can tell a difference in flavor compared to the regular recipes we would normally cook but this was a very good substitute since we all ate gluten free that week. Our guest had no complaints and we'll be even more comfortable cooking the next time. Not having much experience yet with all the many gluten free products on the market, we give Bob's mixes 5 stars for ease of use and helping us make some wonderful tasting gluten-free foods.

review/summary: This mix is very versatile!
review/text: I have been baking for decades, and have been gluten-free for 11 years now.  This mix has been a God-send.  I use it wherever a recipe calls for biscuit mix and add 1/4 cup of fat per each 2 cups of mix used (gluten biscuit mix has fat in it and this mix does not... this is an advantage since you can add healthy fat, transfat free or healthy oils).<br /><br />When I make the biscuit recipe (per package directions, I only use half the fat called for per that recipe)in it which makes a lighter biscuit.  Adding all the fat makes for a heavier end-product (your choice of course).  The biscuits, scones (I use the same recipe and add 1 or 2 tbsp natural sugar), pancakes, pie crust, biscuit crust, and pizza crust I make from this mix are all excellent.<br /><br />One secret to good biscuits, scones, or shortcakes, is in the amount of liquid you add.  I never go by what any recipe says for this... go by how much it takes to easily mix the dough to form a moist, but not sticky ball of dough.  The amount of liquid depends on the humidity in your kitchen which varies by geographical area.<br /><br />Stir (rather quickly) the liquid in with a fork while you pour in liquid somewhat slowly, stop adding liquid when all the dry ingredients are moist (somewhere around 1 cup for the amount of mix the recipe states), and the dough will form a ball that does not crack when you are kneading it.<br /><br />I pat the dough to about 3/4-inch and cut it with a 3-inch biscuit cutter (or larger cutter for shortcakes, adding about a tbsp natural sugar with the dry ingredients), or pat into an 8-inch round and cut into wedges for scones. You should get about 8 or 9 biscuits or scones.<br /><br />I like to bake my biscuits and scones slightly apart at 425F (not at the lower temp the recipe says) and keep them in for about 15 minutes or until they test done with a toothpick.<br /><br />I use this recipe for muffins, pie crust (per recipe on package), and for cinnamon rolls. This mix has never failed me.

review/summary: Great for waffles, not so much for pancakes!
review/text: I don't know what it is with these gluten free mixes; they seem to be good for one thing or the other, but none of them are really all purpose. I love the waffles this mix makes, but not the pancakes. I didn't try making biscuits (or anything other than pancakes/waffles) with it because I loved the waffles so much! And after the pancakes were such a disappointment, I decided to use it for what it did best. From now on, this is the mix I will use for waffles!<br /><br />For pancakes, I have enjoyed Pamela's (for Bisquik-like texture, but add lots of vanilla - it makes them tastier!). If I want denser, healthier pancakes, I mix my own mix based on a recipe in the Best Gluten-Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt, which requires purchasing specialty flours, but it is worth it. The specialty flours are more nutritious than the Pamela's mix, which is mostly rice.

review/summary: Why Bob, why?
review/text: I just made a batch of these biscuits, the dough worked fairly well, I didn't have the recommended pastry cutter, but made do with cutting in the butter. My issues with this mix: the instructions don't tell you have many biscuits it should yield, they don't rise at all and resemble what my father used to call "hard tack" (dense bready biscuits meant for storage on sea cargo vessels). Bob's likes his bean flours in the mixes, I get it's probably to add some nutrient value to the otherwise nutrient poor rice flour and to add some body to the flour mix. The thing that gets me whenever I've tried any of Bob's bread-like mixes, chocolate chip cookies, biscuit mix, wonderful bread, etc. is that the smell while the product bakes is sooo off. It overwhelms my ability to want to taste the actual food, where I have to force myself to try it, almost a gag response. As far as I can tell it isn't that I am intolerant to the bean flours, it just doesn't smell like food that I want to eat. It smells like burning playdoh, completely off-putting. Bob's gluten-free flours and oats are super; these bean flour mixes just don't work for me in baked goods. Sorry if this was rant-like, I'm trying to distract myself while my I air out my apartment from baking these biscuits I'm not sure I can force myself to eat, maybe they'll be better cold.

review/text: I am new to buying gluten free products.I bought another brand it turned out good.(Namaste)I bought this product and tryed making bread and cinniamon bread with it. WHile fixing it I tryed some of the dough and it made me feel sick to my stomach.(and the taste wasnt appealing) I thought ok maybe its just because its not cooked. After it was done I ate some of it not to bad had a strong nut taste to it. But within an 1/2hour I wasnt feeling very good. Like when I tryed the raw dough. I dont think Im going to buy this one again. Thankfully I got this from our health food store and I dont have anymore hanging around.I will just try to make sure Garbanzo bean flour is not in my future purchases.
