review/summary: Would not purchase again
review/text: The first ingredient of this product is sugar, which explains the too sweet, artifical taste.  A good preserve should list the fruit (in this case, "figs") as the primary ingredient.  If you are looking for a true fig preserve, I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: One of many great taco sauce &gluten Free
review/text: I always like to make sauces fresh unless they meet my standard and it has to be GF!  Most of the Rick Bayless sauces are GF and we are so excited we have discovered this collection of taco sauces.  you can check out the ingredients on the frontera's website.). Dinner has never been any easier and absolutely delicious!  I kid you not and my hubbie has raved to his work colleagues of the experience!  Guess we will be getting some extra guests soon for dinner!  We added slices of peppers too, gotta get some greens in the mix! It works with duck and chicken.  I actually didn't think this was medium heat, more than mild but not medium like the key lime and cilantro medium heat.  I Hope Amazon will stock the key lime and cilantro soon!  Another must have in the larder.  I always recommend you try one sachet first before buying a bundle.  Wholefoods stocks this product.

review/summary: The A Plus of Couscous!
review/text: This is couscous like I have never tasted.  Any couscous I have had before trying this out doesn't even come near to comparing in quality, taste, odor (delightful) or anything else.  In short, this couscous is to die for.<br /><br />How is it different?  It is very light and fluffy, a pale golden color.  Not heavy or grainy at all.  Nothing imitation about it, no unhealthy ingredients.<br /><br />Some like their couscous sweet.  Some like their couscous with veggies.  I whipped up this dish with chopped onions and garlic sauted in butter.  This couscous is ready in a jiffy.  In fact, you barely have time to add your ingredients to it (I also added one tablespoon of olive oil, one teaspoon each of oregano and thyme, cracked pepper and salt, and of course the onions and garlic, before it is done (within a matter of a few minutes).  So it's good to line up your additional ingregients beforehand so you can add them quickly.  As for the outcome:  Yum Yum!<br /><br />Although a favorite food offering over a large part of the world, I never understood until now the popularity of couscous.  Now I do.  It will be a permanent part of my kitchen fare from now on.

review/summary: one of my favorite energy drinks/shots
review/text: This is one of my favorite energy drinks.  It is much more affordable than red bull or five hour energy which I also like as well.  The only thing is it is not as strong as others i have tried but if you are budget conscious and need a quick fix, these are a great option.<br /><br />If you don't mind mixing your drinks, the best "clean energy" experience i have had is with one of those energy stacks, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095D28JE">Energy Booster Stack - 90 Day Servings!</a>. I prefer it because it's cheap number one and lasts forever, but also because it works pretty quickly. Both for energy and speeding up the metabolism.

review/summary: Ordered in place of 5 hour...NO replacement!!
review/text: I have been on Autoship for the 5 Hour Energy drinks for a while here at Amazon, but this time they emailed me, on my TWO subscriptions that they couldn't fill them...and they suggested I try the Red Rain that customers buy this many times instead.  So I did.  I read some of the reviews...tastes better, lasts longer, etc.  So thought I'll give it a shot.<br /><br />I don't want to totally shoot them down ~ they're not awful, and they are cheaper than the 5 Hour Energy Drink...but you know they saying you get what you pay for?  Yup, in this case it holds true.  I didn't find them to taste any better, in fact I really liked the berry taste less, but regardless it's not a great tastes no matter how you look at it.  But what I really found lacking was the boost.  While it does give you that initial energy boost, it's not as fast or as great as that you get from the 5 Hour drink, and it does NOT last anywhere near 5 hours!  I have to drink 2 in the time I'd drink 1 5 Hour, and still find myself dragging.  I work the graveyard shift, so alertness is sometimes something I have to trick my body into...it really aint gonna happen w/ this<br />Red Rain Energy Shot.  In my opinion, it was a waste of my money.

I saved a few bucks with 6 hour power but it did not work.  I'm very happy with Red Rain and I'm excited to pay only $11 a case with subscribe and save.  The flavor isn't great compared to 5 hour energy but I don't care since I take these down FAST. If I bought these to enjoy the flavor, I'd buy a big can of one of those sugary energy drinks.

review/summary: Low Cost, Works Great!
review/text: Red Rain berry flavor tastes great and gives you the energy and focus to get through the day. You can drink the 2oz all-at-once or sip on it throughout the day. The directions say to use or discard within 3 days after opening. Refrigeration is not required. One bottle contains only 5 calories, 3g of carbs, 8333% daily value of vitamin B12, 2000% daily value of vitamin B6, 200% daily value of Niacin, and 100% daily value of Folic Acid.  It also contains a 2000mg energy blend which consists of Glucuronolactone, Malic Acid, Caffeine, Choline Chloride, N-Acetyle L-Tyrosine. The amount of caffeine it says is comparable to a cup of the leading brand of coffee. At the current price of $12.00 for a 12-pack, or $10.20 with Amazon's Subscribe and Save, it's much cheaper than the other leading energy shot product.

review/summary: Wonderful Product - Deserves More Attention
review/text: I recently purchased this product without the subscribe and save deal, and man, was I wrong! I will definitely be purchasing Red Rain on a subscription basis. This product tastes much LESS bitter than the leading brand, but tastes better. It is almost sweet, but verrry light on the palate. I quite enjoyed sipping it. I ordered the extra strength because it is cheaper and has more bang-for-your-buck. I generally will drink half a bottle at once and judge where I am over the next half hour. If I need the extra boost, I will go for sipping the latter half of the bottle over the next half hour until my energy is right where I want it, then save the rest for later. Brilliant! when you can buy an extra-strength shot at LESS THAN HALF the original strength leading shot price! I believe this product may be the "hidden gem" of energy drinks. It is hard enough to find a cheaper energy drink that even matches the higher-priced, but tasty, competitor(s), yet this one supercedes them all! I have tried 5-hour Energy ($$), Energy 2000 Berry Flavor (taste? energy?), Monster shots (ok), 6-hour power (ok), and above all, Red Rain Extra Strength Berry (the best!)<br /><br />The search is over!!

review/text: I started using 5 Hour Energy about 10 years ago while a long haul truck driver. Then, I would buy them from ebay in the 100's in order to get the best price.<br /><br />But since 5 hour has been doing its media blitz over the last few years it has increased in price to the point that Im just not willing to pay. Guess they have to pay for that advertizing somehow...<br /><br />I just happened to see this product on the shelf of a Walmart & I decided at the price, it was worth a shot. ( pun intended...)<br /><br />Red Rain works for me just as well as 5 Hour. The size,taste & packaging is similar but it comes in a 12-pack for less than a 5 hour 6-pack. As long as Red Rain keeps up the quality & keeps down the price Ill keep using it.

review/summary: A powerful kick, but not without some side effects
review/text: I drink energy shots on a daily basis. I struggle with chronic fatigue and without an energy shot in the morning I'm falling a sleep at my desk by noon. Anyway, I've tried them all: the balanced Red Bull Energy Shot (one of my favorites), NOS Energy Shot (delicious, but hard to find), 5 Hour Energy (too expensive), Rockstar Shots (taste awful)... I bought this because the price was so amazing. Let me tell you that this is one of the strongest energy shots I have tried. It's a really, really powerful kick. However, it did give me a pretty severe case of the jitters and some nausea (which went away quickly). I think I'm adjusting to them, though.<br /><br />Like I said, I've tried dozens of energy shots on the market. I can honestly say this one is one of the strongest.

review/summary: Not going to win any prizes
review/text: I ordered this because the price is much better than 5HE but I'm rather disappointed.  I take 1/2 a bottle of 5HE and it gets me going all day long including making me much more energetic for my morning run.  I expected this to be at least comparable considering it's "Extra Strength" but it's not.  I tried 1/2 a bottle and it doesn't work nearly as well as 5HE.  I've actually had to consume the entire bottle to get close to the same effects of 1/2 of 5HE.  I guess in this case you do get what you pay for...not much.  Considering I'm taking twice what I took with the other brand I'm not saving any money since I'll go through the product much faster.  If you're used to 5HE and it works for you stick to it. I am giving this 3 stars because it has partial effects and the taste is mild.

review/summary: I am a HUGE fan of 5 Hour Energy - Extra Strength. And I still am. But I was urged to try this product, and it WORKS! A+!!!
review/text: As the title states, I am a big fan of 5 Hour Energy - Extra Strength. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AS1A4Q">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength Berry 12 bttls</a> I use them because I'm terminally ill, and I'm sometimes so weak that I start to fall asleep even when my upset stomach is still in full swing. This can lead to a messy situation when you wake up vomiting. LOL The 5 Hour Energy - ES REALLY works, but a few people had urged me to try this product, and so I did. My immediate first impression was that it tasted MUCH better than the other brands, which can be pretty bad. As with the 5 Hour Energy product, I could feel this working right away. It didn't last quite as long as 5 Hour Energy, but very close to it. And here's the catch. It's literally half the price of the other brands. So if you think about it, two bottle for the same price is more energy for the same price. Honestly, I'm gonna do some more comparison's, but these were my initial experiences. I'm still right smack in the middle of my last shot, and it's working just fine. Because my vomiting and nausea is a regular thing, as is being completely exhausted from fighting my illnesses, my wallet definitely likes the idea that I can get twice the product for the same price. I'm a loyal customer of 5 Hour Energy, but that doesn't mean I can't recognize a bargain when I see one. Who knows, maybe 5 Hour Energy will reduce their price some as this stuff takes off and becomes more popular. And I'm guessing it's going to do just that. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />  Thanks so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/summary: Strong stuff with no jitters
review/text: Comparing this extra-strength Red Rain to a standard 5-Hour Energy, the ingredients and nutritional facts are almost identical.  Extra Strength Red Rain has moderately more niacin (40mg versus 30mg), reports 3g of carbohydrates while 5-Hour Energy doesn't list any, and the "energy blend" is just a little bit chemically different.  Other claims (caffeine equal to a cup of coffee) are the same.<br /><br />It would be reasonable to assume that Red Rain and 5-Hour Energy would perform almost identically, but I've noticed distinctly different sensations from them.  Red Rain doesn't give me the same jitters or uncomfortable rush that 5-Hour Energy does.  It doesn't feel like it hits me as strongly, but maybe that just means I don't notice where the energy is coming from.  It does keep me alert, and feels more natural.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good, too.  Better than 5-Hour Energy berry flavor.<br /><br />If you don't like the way most energy shots make you feel, this is worth experimenting with.  If you really need that weird "energy high" feeling, stay with another brand.  For the money, though, Red Rain is an extremely efficient product.

review/summary: Nice price, but not as potent as 5hr
review/text: Normally, I use 5hr energy (extra strength), when I need a boost of energy, but since 5hr has a higher price tag, I thought I'd try Red Rain.  I read reviews that said it's just as good, and the fact that it's 1/2 the price was why I decided to give it a try.  The price is good...but the potency is just so-so.  Red Rain also has a much milder taste, (I happen to like the taste of 5hr, so Red Rain tasted a little flat to me).<br /><br />It's been my experience that these energy shots affect people differently, so I would recommend giving it a try, because it may work better for you than it did for me.<br /><br />But, overall, I wasn't impressed enough to make the switch to Red Rain.  Personally, Red Rain just wasn't potent enough for my needs.  (I am a SAHM with 3 kids...so I often need BIG energy boosts to keep up with them!)

I didn't think that I cared about the flavor, but this stuff was difficult to swallow for me, and left a bad aftertaste.  Also, I didn't notice any boost in energy from it.

review/summary: I'm so awake right now
review/text: It's 3AM right now, and I haven't been able to sleep since taking half a shot of this stuff at 9PM to go work out. Not only am I working on homework while watching TV right, I've also managed to answer all of my neglected emails during this time and sewed myself five DIY dresses after coming back from running five miles at the gym. I don't think I've ever been this focused and awake, and I figured why not write a review I'm still in the zone.<br /><br />In terms of taste though, this baby is nasty. The sucralose leaves a very nasty aftertaste. It's also very sour, and I can barely taste the berry. I was convinced that this product is too hyped up until I realized that I fricken sewed five dresses tonight, and I still don't feel tired. Usually, I pick up a pencil, and I'm about to fall asleep from exerting myself so much. For what it does, I can deal with the taste since it is a mere shot.<br /><br />Furthermore, from drinking half the bottle I didn't get the usual side effects that comes with taking things such as caffeine pills (nausea, overheating, dizziness, etc.). I don't know what would happen if I took the full shot.... Maybe I should start my own dress shop. I am starting to notice right now though that I'm having trouble linking together cohesive thoughts. So I apologize if this review doesn't make much sense. I just went back through and found a bunch of mistakes and repetition in my grammar. It's not that I'm sleepy, I'm just starting to feel like I'm floating.<br /><br />Shipping was also second to none; my box came the next day all safe and secure and in perfect condition.<br /><br />All in all,if you're a caffeine junkie like me, ingesting enough caffeine in a day to kill a baby elephant, and your body's built a tolerance to just about everything, definitely give this a try! However, I would recommend getting all the important, cohesive-thought necessary activities done within four hours of taking the shot.

I do feel a "crashy" feeling later on in the day usually around 5 or 6 but if I just stay awake through it then it goes away but sometimes I really have to crash and take a nap. Knocked off one star because like one user said, there is some residue on the rim but I suspect that the product has been sitting on the shelves for a while and a tiny bit dried up. Doesn't really bother me and I just pour it all in my mouth without touching the rim. Definitely recommend if you want to save a little money. I even added a subscription so now it's less than $1 a bottle +free shipping which is the best deal I've come across.

All i can tell you is i have it setup for auto delivery after i bought the first 12 pk.<br /><br />also...I just bought a case (regular strength...they don't make ext strength) from Sams Club (Members Mark brand)and that was just as good as reg 5HR @ $23 a case (24)...kinda wish they would do an ES but i am very happy with this product and free ship :)

review/summary: If you like 5 hour energy, for the price - Red Rain is a good choice
review/text: Had been a 5 hour energy drinker for a while and was getting reoccurring shipments but the cost just kept going up.  These definitely don't have quite the same kick as 5 hour but the lasting energy feels about the same to me and for half the price, I can't beat it.  They taste smoother too, less tart.  I don't get any edgy feeling from drinking a whole bottle. I usually take half early in the day then half again before working in the evening and they keep me going.  Though, I have found that with any energy drink, if you are exhausted, they aren't going to keep you up like caffeine pills or heads up (ephedrine) but for maintaining focus during work, they work for me.

review/summary: Works well and tasted pretty good.
review/text: I bought these after reading some of the other reviews. In fact, i have since decided to add it as a subscription purchase. I dont think it warrants five stars, but certainly good enough for four. Why? Well, first, i'll start by saying that it really does taste good. That is definitely as advertised. The reason i knock one star off is because while it does give me a bit of extra energy, i have noticed that for me at least, it wears off in more like two or three hours rather than five or more. So, it is a good product, and definitely well worth the asking price, but not amazing. I like it, but i dont love it, and so four stars fits the bill perfectly for me.<br /><br />p.s. I dont understand the mention of sipping on it. There isnt really enough in the bottle for that, and it kind of defeats the purpose of drinking the whole thing to get that extra burst of energy.

review/summary: Doesn't Make me Alert
review/text: I'm a college student, and therefore I thought this product would be right up my alley: energy drink, cheap, bulk purchase. But I've been a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Flavor: Taste is good. It isn't bitter, overly sweet, or anything. These are really drinkable and I'm often kind of saddened when I hit the bottom of the shot.<br /><br />Energy: This is where Red Rain loses stars for me. I don't feel ANY increase in awareness or energy. Oddly enough it makes my heart rate increase substantially, but I'm left still feeling tired. Five hour energy works, coffee works, monsters work, but Red Rain does nothing but put miles on the heart for no reason.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this product. It's cheap, yes, but it doesn't wake you up or give energy at all. You get what you pay for sometimes.

review/text: This is a much better deal than 5 hour energy, so three stars for that.  In terms of its effects, it's pretty much the same as any other caffeine shot I've taken, including 5 hour and other lower-priced ones.<br /><br />But it doesn't get 5 stars because at $1 per bottle, it's still not cheap.  I'd recommend plain caffeine pills, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee</a>, which I recently switched to (after trying like every energy supplement on the planet) - it is a good balance of low cost but still has b vitamins & other ingredients besides *just* caffeine.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: As most others I compared this product to 5 hour energy shot that I occasionally take.  I had been picking up free samples of 5 hour energy at some of the bike rallies I go to. One particularly grueling day after about 9  hours of  traveling and attending a recent motorcycle rally I was REALLY dragging. My son offered me a 5 hour energy drink and within 10 minutes or so I could really feel the difference. I decided to buy some but when I saw the prices here on Amazon I balked. I noticed the Extra Strength Red Rain energy shots at about half the price of the 5 hour energy shots so after reading mixed reviews I decided to take a chance on a twelve pack. Sometimes at work I need a mid morning or mid afternoon pick me up that is when I usually take a half bottle of 5 hour energy. Generally within 10 minutes or so I can tell a marked difference. When I took the same amount of Red Rain energy shot one morning, after about 10 minutes I had to think if I could tell if it was making a difference. If any, the affect was very subtle for a half bottle of the Red Rain. The next time I drank the whole bottle and noticed a little difference in my mid morning blah, but definately not as much effect as the 5 hour energy. If I have to take twice as much Red Rain (whole bottle) and not feel even the same effect as a half bottle of 5 hour energy I may as well stay with the 5 hour energy next time. For those of you that feel you got as much a boost as the 5 hour energy I say, "Great". Red Rain just didn't provide ME with the "kick" that I got with the other brand so therefore I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Could be placebo effect, but who cares?
review/text: Gives me the boost I need to get through the afternoon "drowsies." I used to take NoDoz pills, 5-hour energy shots, Rock Star energy shots, and even liquid caffeine (no kidding ... it really was just straight liquid caffeine that you put into your own drink). This has allowed me to get off of all of them without the unpleasant side effects (including crashing later and belching!)<br /><br />I'm perfectly willing to admit that 80% or more of the effect is psychological. One time, I grabbed a bottle and almost immediately felt peppier. Then I realized I had set the bottle on the desk and didn't drink it!  So, read all the good reviews, convince yourself it will work ... and chances are, it will.<br /><br />I don't CARE if it's just a placebo -- it works for me and I subscribe to monthly shipments of two cases so I can have one a day and not run out!

review/text: I was looking for an alternative to the more costly 5-hour energy and I have found it in Red Rain.<br /><br />I feel that these "Extra Strength" energy shots work on par with the 5-hours.<br />It seems that the regular strength Red Rains give an energy boost of about 3 hours. Which could be beneficial in some situations.<br /><br />I do prefer the taste of Red Rain over 5-hour, but the difference is negligible, really.<br /><br />Energy shots are my preferred method of boost. I don't like drinking energy drinks as the sweetness and all the sugar gives me gutrot.<br />These are quick and the effect is immediate.<br /><br />If you like 5-hour energy and are just looking for something cheaper, this is it.

review/text: This product has been great for me. I got these in particular due to its 'extra strength'. While I can't say it does give me extra energy over a regular shot, it does work and at a great price point.<br /><br />Regardless of if you think these shots work (Its possible it is just placebo for me) but it does what its intended to do. Whatever the reason may be I do feel like I have more energy, more focus and alert and helps me in those times I am really dragging. If I'm tired and going out at night I will take one of these for that extra support. No crash, not too bad of a taste. I highly recommend these at this price point and save yourself some $$$ over that other popular 5 hour brand!

Yes I've read the past reviews that say they both have the same ingredients, but they don't mention the doses of those are not the same. Don't be fooled by the cheaper price and better taste. Who cares about the taste anyway? Go buy some candy if your looking for the taste. As far as the price, I have about 40 or so left from my shipment that if figure is a complete waste of money. That's about $40 dollars worth. I'd have rather had paid the $80 and had something that would actually work.

review/summary: If you like to make Moroccan food, this is an essential item
review/text: I have enjoyed Moroccan food for many years and have recently received a tagine pot for Christmas.  As I started to build a Moroccan pantry I knew that there were a few item that were essential.  This included preserved lemons, Ras el Hanout spice blend and a Harissa paste.  I found this one on Amazon and even though it seemed a little pricey I ordered a couple of jars.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />Zamouri's Harissa Chili Paste has an obvious red pepper flavor and is medium low to medium heat (depending on your taste).  Although the peppers are not identified on the label I am guessing New Mexican red and cayenne (this product is made in the US, by the way).  Still, the chilies are not overwhelming and several exotic flavors come through.  The first thing that I tasted was cumin although it is not specifically mentioned on the label.  Here are the listed ingredients:<br /><br />Fresh Chili Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Salt, Preserved Lemons, Garlic, Paprika, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Water, and other spices.<br /><br />I have to be honest and say that I am certain that when I visit a African grocery store I will be able to find a similar blend at a fraction of the price.  However, if that is not an option for you this blend is authentic and very, very flavorful.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBT7TC">Emile Henry Flame Top 2.6-Quart Tagine Red</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUX2QA">Ras El Hanout 4.0 Oz By Zamouri Spices</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979486">Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking</a>

review/text: Harissa Paste makes a tasty addition to many recipes beyond those calling specifically for this ingredient. With Southwestern fare, it has far more depth and interest than the typical hot sauce.

review/text: The lid was loose on the jar, the packaging was full of wet paste.  The box was also wet with leaked paste. The box was too big/or the packing was not enough to stabilize the jar in the box.  Open jar means do not use!  Too bad, I was looking forward to a lemon yogurt chicken recipe with a sauce that includes the harissa paste.

Great with bacon & eggs, chicken strips, or simply on toast,and a perfect addition to any cassoulet.<br />Happy.  Arizona. 2012.

review/text: I'm a single mom with four kids who eat cereal every day for breakfast.  So I am always out and bowls have to be washed everyday.  So I ordered these to give me a break.  The kids were happy as clams.  They taste just like fruit loops Mom! was the comment I got.  Plus it saved me from having to wash 28 bowls a week.  Which is awesome.  And the best thing was Saturdays I could sleep late because even the 5 year old was able to go to the pantry, grab a pack, peel the lid off and pour milk in it.  This product gave me extra time and even an extra 1/2 hour of sleep a week. I highly recommend them.  They are even portable so you can stuff them in school bags for snacks on the go.  We took them on vacation with us.

Sometimes he rings his door bell indicating he needs to go out, and just stands on the step and runs back in for his reward. We play a game of Find-it, and he searches for them in hidden places, and asks us to hide more. He has learned to sit,lie down, shake, bow, dance, and wave to get his nibble treats. Need I say more?

I am not that picky but these were so strangely bad that I am surprised anyone gave these a good review. Yikes...it all went into the garbage after several attempts to like these. The lime flavor was the least gummy, but why bother?  I will stick to "Garden of Eatin" brand from now on.

review/summary: Great Food for Dog with Sensitive Skin and Allergies
review/text: I took a star away because it is expensive, but otherwise no complaints.  I'm a big fan.  My doggie loves it and I love it because the product is high quality dog food all the way as advertised.  I did a ton of research to find the right dog food for my doggie given that he is prone to allergic reactions to lower grade dog food resulting in skin rashes and breakouts.  I've tried all the best dog foods recommended for dogs with allergies and this one is at the very top of my list.  Best of all, my dog's shiny coat speaks for itself.  The quality ingredients they use really do translate into a shiny coat on a happy allergy free dog.

review/summary: Solved my dog's skin allergy problems.
review/text: I have a lab/german shepard mix who is now almost 4 years old.  Beyond being a smart and awesome dog, she has allergies and has a very sensitive stomach.Her health is my number one concern.  Over the past few years, we have tried most of the premium dog food brands and have finally settled on Orijen.  Every dog is different, just like humans, so my dog's experience can be different from your dog.  Be aware that this food is very calorie dense so you will need to feed your dog less than your other foods.  My dog absolutely loved the taste, as she took to it like I was feeding her treats.  I know the Orijen food is pricey, but you will be feeding your dog much less than the others so it will last a lot longer.  But most importantly, her skin stopped itching, her coat looks beautiful, and she seems much healthier.  I highly recommend this food.

Grain free, high quality ingredients make all the difference. People always ask me how I get my dog's coat so soft and shiny and I tell them it's all through her diet. Of course this quality comes at a price...Orijen Red is pricey but you know what they say:"You get what you pay for." Despite the cost, my dog will continue to get Orijen Red and all of it's benefits.

review/summary: Real beef and high quality but expensive
review/text: Plus shipping, 55+13=68 $68/15.3Lb=about $4.4/lb. Real beef costs only $2.5-$3.5 a pound. Because of the cost, I'd prefer to feed my shepherd with real beef instead of processed beef kibbles. I supplement my dog with a few ounces (3-4) of half cooked beef a day with Blue Buffalo Chicken formula kibbles. She has sufficient protein, being an active household dog--not the Schutzhund K9 that needs higher amount. But this brand is def high quality--one of the trainers recommended it to me. My dog loves it but loves real beef more. I don't feed her with raw meat because I personally don't feel it's a good idea for household dogs like mine--dogs kiss us and the raw meat contains bacteria that's fine with dogs but not with human. I don't want my dog licks me and I get bacterial infection of any type. I may be overly worried. But anyways, I microwave raw beef to make it half-cooked for my dog.

review/text: the trouble is you never know what you are going to get.  Experiment they tell you sure but the alcohol content is so low I think it's a waste of money.  Yeasty after taste.  One week is good for fermentation I think.  Cocktails did not work for me.  A winery told me they leave bottles corked for a week or two at room temp.  Then you can put them away in the fridge.  I have not tried this because they tell you to throw the cap away since your bottle will explode.  I capped it for the fridge and nothing happened.  the fiz of fermentation is stopped after the third day almost anyway so I might try that.  Using paul newman's own grape and true juice blueberry were the best I had.<br />the company sent me free packets when I told them of the low alcohol content so they do try to please.  thank you

review/text: Let the buyer beware! These are not individually wrapped tea bags which are what led me to fall in love with Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey. What you will receive are six boxes of 50 tea bags that are produced with inferior bags. The characteristic aroma of bergamot was clearly lacking when I opened the box. Nevertheless, I tried steeping a bag using a smaller cup than usual. Even after a full steep (five minutes), this tea had absolutely no flavour. And, as this is a non-returnable item, I am out $40.00 (including the 1-day shipping). I'm chucking the whole lot into the bin. It is undrinkable. The price is attractive, but I'll be ordering my tea directly from the Harrogate folks from now on. If you can find the individually wrapped tea bags, buy them as the quality of the bag will prove to be superior, as are the flavour and aroma. Guess there's a reason why they don't show the bag in the description!

review/summary: Earl Grey
review/text: Didn't care for it. This is the only Earl Grey I have tried so I can't compare it to any other brands. I don't really think it is the brand though, I just don't think I like oil of bergamot. Any way, it tasted kind of bitter and soapy (no, my cup didn't have any soapy residue in it). Didn't finish the cup. There are several Taylors of Harrogate teas that I really like, this is not one of them.

review/summary: Excellent decaf
review/text: I find this is a perfectly balanced cup and actually, it's really wonderful with neither sugar nor milk, drunk after dinner with a small dessert perhaps (a cookie or biscotti.) The only issue I had with it--it's Columbian coffee and like many of the Central American coffees, it has a lot of acid. This makes it taste bright and good but one can have issues with the acidity (I do.) So I can only enjoy this occasionally. But it's delicious and a very wonderful balanced cup. I like it brewed at 184 degrees, a bit cooler than I brew my French roast in the Vue.

review/summary: Sharp Taste
review/text: I found that this decaf coffee falls into the taste profile of most diner decaf: strong, acid-tasting with a terrible aftertaste.  This is the only Vue decaf coffee I have had and I'm still looking for one I like.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Addict!
review/text: I haven't had soda in over 12 years. I don't drink coffee and I hardly touch alcohol. I drink water. Sometimes water can get boring. This peach flavored additive is NOT BORING! I love it! I cannot stop drinking this flavored goodness! I have finally found something that makes delicious water without a chemical taste. One bottle lasts for a week or two, so great value. The acai berry flavor and tropical citrus flavors (bought at Safeway) are also incredibly yummy but peach is my fave. Try squirting a dab into plain greek yogurt to make it more fun... I'm a squeezer for life!

review/summary: Invigorating!
review/text: It's definitely a daily must in my consumption of liquids each morning. The vitamin squeeze truly helps me complete a positive workout and still allows me enough energy for the rest of my day!  I squeeze as little or as much that satisfies my personal need!  It truly is the answer to bland water, as it has a natural fruity flavor without the after taste.  Now I will enjoy drinking my 8 glasses of water each day, as recommended! Love it!

review/summary: Amateurish Repackaging And Apparent Recycling: Slightly Distasteful And Not Gift Quality
review/text: Quite literally, I have never seen anything like this gift basket construction from Back Mountain Baskets represented here by the igourmet label. And unfortunately, I don't mean that in a positive way. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. Heck, these are even advertised as gourmet items!  Only a couple of items might actually qualify as exotic or gourmet.  At a $49.99 list price, there is maybe $20 worth of small snacks, most of which could be replicated at your local convenience store. If I had made a gift basket at home, it would have been classier and more tasteful than the horribly amateurish efforts made by this company.<br /><br />I won't even discuss the quality of the items included in the basket which I actually have some serious reservations about. This basket is NOT something that you would (or should) pay to have a professional company assemble due to packaging. Many of the included items are stuffed into boxes and wrapped rather cheaply with handmade labels. Okay, not a very deluxe or fancy presentation. But what's worse (and frankly unforgivable) is that the boxes used are not plain white gift boxes or something else presentable--no, they are emptied trash from other products re-purposed.<br /><br />Do you want your elegant food items (again I'm being generous with the item quality) in old cracker boxes glued back together? Just whose recycling bin have they been raiding? It's rather distasteful. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about--first is the empty box used and in parenthesis is the actual item inside:<br /><br />Keebler Club Cracker Box (pretzels)<br />Stauffer's Animal Cracker Box (other cookies)<br />Crystal Light Fruit Punch Box (candies)<br />Nabisco Wheat Thins Box (popcorn)<br />Jello Gelatin Box (cookies)<br /><br />These are but a few examples of boxes used to repackage other items. I got two of these baskets and they were both constructed in a similar manner. Seriously. If you paid to have an elegant gift basket, would you expect to find loose candies glued into a Crystal Light box? As I said, there isn't even the common sense and taste level to use plain white boxes. It would be an embarrassment to send this as a gift item. Due to the packaging, I even threw a number of items straight into the trash as I was not confident of their handling due to the obvious lack of professional standards. A huge disappointment and very unappetizing all around. KGHarris, 10/11.

review/summary: Worst gift basket ever received.
review/text: We receive several gifts packages every year due to family being scattered through out the US. We also annually receive gifts from customers sent to my husband, so I feel qualified in saying that this is the worst gift basket we have ever seen.<br /><br />The description does not go into the actual contents of each basket and from the other reviews I see there are similarities, but there is no theme in this package. Just seems like a bunch of leftover items thrown into a large basket trying to appeal to someone.<br /><br />As one reviewer mentioned the contents in each package are Laughably insignificant. Whoever would package 1.25 ounces of popcorn, 3 caramels or two pretzels in a box must be more concerned about quantity of items, vs. quality of the gift.<br /><br />In my opinion, too much wasted packaging and a whole lot of minuscule portions of nothing of any real value.<br /><br />I would not send this gift basket to anyone after having received it myself.
