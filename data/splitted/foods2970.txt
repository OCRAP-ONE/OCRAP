review/summary: Must Have Mustard
review/text: I had originally found this mustard at an Italian import store in Tucson and introduced it to family and friends. Almost everyone loved it. The exceptions were those people who don't like hot foods and even they liked it in moderation. The import store was having trouble stocking it, so I turned to the internet. I use it to coat homemade French bread dough when making calzones. I also use it as part of the marinade when cooking pork loin. For myself, I use it on sandwiches and hot dogs but I really like the horseradish taste.

review/text: This mustard is not nearly as spicy as the authentic product from Germany which I have tried.  This seems like an "Americanized" version which I would not purchase again in the future.

review/summary: The Mustard that Made Me Like Mustard
review/text: I used to hate mustard.  That was before I had Lowensenf.  Their extra hot mustard is a German classic.<br /><br />Several months ago, during a colder winter afternoon, my girlfriend and I tried this mustard when a friend-of-a-friend brought it over when they were making sausages and sandwiches.  We were hooked.  I was told that this mustard might be a little hard to find, since we don't live in a city.  So, when we found this item through an independent seller, we jumped on the opportunity and ordered a jar.<br /><br />Since the mustard is from Germany, the expiration dates in America run a little more quickly -- about two/two & half months.  However, that shouldn't be a problem because the mustard is so incredibly delicious that most people will find themselves running out of the product before it expires.  It is great on everything...  Meats and cheeses, breads, pretzels and you-name-it.  It is hot, but my girlfriend loves it and she never loves hot/spicy food or condiments.  But, I can't say that "it's hot, but not too hot," because that's not doing the mustard its proper favor.  The flavor is piquantly zesty and has a good lasting combination with food.<br /><br />If you are having a party with kielbasa, bratwurst, sausage and such, do yourself a favor and be prepared with Lowensenf.  Your friends will love it.  That's how I got hooked.

review/summary: Hot Stuff
review/text: I had been searching for a good German mustard to remind me of the sandwiches I used to buy there as a U.S. Airman, way back in another life.  I have finally found it; Lowensenf Extra Hot is the real deal.  I bought one jar, then bought four more.  It gives one that wonderful bite (well, wonderful if you like hot food) and makes your hair hurt a few seconds after it explodes in your mouth.  One note though - it seems to need to be refrigerated before achieving full ignition; don't use it right out of the pantry.

review/summary: enjoyable tea - this 100gram bag makes 80cups of tea
review/text: I like the flavor of this tea BUT I must confess that I appreciate bitter unsweetened teas as I know that is supportive of digestion and the beginning of assimilation and elimination.  While in the photo on this site and at Sunfood's website, the tea looks like chunks of bark, the bag that I received is almost a powder - more like slivers of bark.  I followed the directions on their website and mixed 2 tablespoons of Chuchuhausi tea with 8 cups of hot water and stirred and stirred and stirred.  It formed a rich tea darker than typical tea but not all of the powder was absorbed - I do not know, maybe all of it is at the bottom of my glass pitcher.  It is my first time to try Chuchuhausi tea so I can not compare this brand to others.  It was recommended to me because of how much magnesium oil helps me so I thought I might give it a try.  The flavor is enjoyable enough for me so I will go through one bag which makes about 80 cups of tea and then judge about purchasing more or not.<br /><br />Here is some more information I found about this bark.<br />Chuchuhuasi is a small shrubby evergreen tree with leaves and berries that resemble holly native to South America and Southern Brazil, grown in city landscapes for its attractive appearance and decoration. Clinical studies shown its effectiveness in treating ulcers, and cancer with research back to as early as the mid 60s-containing antibiotic compounds that showed potent antitumor and Antileukemic activities in very low dosages.<br /><br />In traditional medicine an application of the leaves of chuchuhuasi is stilled used for various types of cancer the most popular has been for the treatment of ulcers, indigestion, chronic gastritis and dyspepsia. Brazilian utilizes espinheira santa for acne, anemia, stomach ulcers, gastric ulcers, cancers, constipation, gastritis, dyspepsia, liver disorders and many stomach disorders. Slowly becoming more popular and known to health practitioners in the United States.<br /><br />Leaf extract is currently being used for ulcers for restoring intestinal flora and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria, as a laxative, as a colic remedy, to eliminate toxins through the kidneys and skin, to regulate hydrochloric acid production in the stomach, for nervous disorders, and to support kidney, adrenal gland, digestive, and immune infections. While research continues health practitioners around the world have an important and highly effective natural remedy for many types of stomach and intestinal disorders at their disposal.

review/summary: Africafe is hype and nostalgia
review/text: I've been searching for an Organic Instant coffee that has a robust state. Starbucks has Via but it's not Organic. Africafe is marketed by this seller as organic.The tin arrived and all it says is: "100% Pure Instant Coffee from the best Robusta and Arabica coffee beans".<br /><br />If it's organic, free from chemical additives AND processing, it should state so. Don't you think?<br /><br />In addition, it doesn't dissolve readily into cold water or Soy milk. In the morning(especially during the warm season), I enjoy making a cold/ice coffee with a 50/50 mix of Silk brand Chocolate Soy milk (light) and water. Very refreshing. I've been using Nescafe or Folgers crystals and both dissolve quickly and completely. Both products cost about $4 - $6 a jar. Africafe costs $24 with shipping!<br /><br />Bottom line: Save your money, brew Starbucks or other local organic roasted and keep chilled.

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.

review/summary: Metallic Taste is the Deal Breaker
review/text: Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.

It isn't one for someone who likes a real strong coffee though. It's not too strong,not too mild...just right.  The only thing I didn't like is that the "pack of 50" came in a plastic bag and not a box. Would have been nice if it was in a box so I could store it easier. So disription is misleading.

review/text: I ordered this coffee after having seen reviews.  Some reviews stated that the cups were not properly sealed and leaked product into the brewed coffee.  I did not find that to be the case at all.  The cups were all well sealed and I did not experience any leakage whatsoever.  However, the cups did not come in a box and were simply packed in a regular mailing envelope.  The coffee itself is good but lacking in body.  It is OK for drinking occasionally, but I doubt that I would want it all the time.  I have had a french roast decaf made for Keurig cups which I found to be much better.  I believe it is also made by Green Mountain.  However, I have not found it to be available in the 50-cup format.

review/summary: GM Vermont Country Blend k-cups - bang for your buck
review/text: I really like this coffee and the value over k-cups purchased elsewhere. The only reservation that I have is that, without fail, a number of coffee grounds land in my cup after the process is completed. However, I guess I will still want to buy this particular brand at Amazon.com as long as I can get it cheaper.($25 for 50 cups).

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS... IT'S DECAF! unless you like decaf.
review/text: I absolutely HATE how that dreaded "decaf" word finds it's way into descriptions like fine print. Now I have FIFTY of these things that I wasted 35 dollars on, and Amazon makes CERTAIN to not allow returns or exchanges. No one would buy this stuff if they did.<br /><br />If this were the real deal, I may even complain about the fact that there's 49 in the box instead of 50. However, it's one less piece of trash taking up space in the can, so at least I know to never order this kind of stuff again.<br /><br />EDITTING***<br /><br />So I'm changing my review of this. Wrote that stuff up there the day I got it and was still heated by my own mistake. My wife ended up bringing it to work where folks apparently think it's fantastic. Gotta give credit where it's due... if you like decaf coffee, this is a great choice!

review/summary: Received in plain cardboard box
review/text: This was so disappointing. I was happy to get the Friday deal on the 50 CT. To try this variety kcup. To my amazement I opened the outer box to find the loose k cups inside with coffee grounds leaked, but worst of all no protection or sealed package/box from Green Mountain with the name of the coffee etc on it. This is not safe and I called to complain . Amazon did take are of it, but I really am shocked and somewhat concerned at This practice - did they just buy bulk, try to sell it to us as a special, and hope I was dumb enough to drink ? It made me wonder...as someone said, would you buy something like this at a grocery store,like an open unmarked carton of milk? I think not.....this is my fourth purchase that has had damage or poor packaging .....I think I'll stick to local for my coffee . I cant comment n the flavor, sorry, it's not usable. I would be very curious if anyone else got a box like this?

review/summary: Great quality milk chocolate
review/text: Theo chocolate bars are all organic, and this bar is no exception.  I've been to the Theo chocolate store in Washington, and this bar is by far the most popular out of all the people shuffling in and out of the store to sample the chocolate pieces.  It is milky, but has decently sized hazelnut chunks within it to retain some crunch and hazelnut flavor.  At the store itself, it costs $3.25/bar, or $3/bar if you buy at least 6 bars.  I would heavily advise against shipping for a long period of time in the summer for these chocolate bars because they do melt pretty easily.

review/text: I am gluten-free, but try to go grain-free as well since grains irritate my skin and stomach. The Chebe mix makes a yummy pizza crust that fits the bill, and is chewy under the toppings and crunchy at the edges, just the way I like it. No funky aftertaste in this mix like in some gluten-free mixes. I have bought this mix many times and made it with a variety of different toppings, all delicious.

Granted, I'm comparing these to others that I've had and the best I've had which came fresh off the line at the Lindt & Sprungli Chocolate facility in NH during a tour of their facility.  I didn't expect these to beat those, but these were pretty good.  They were also fairly inexpensive in comparison to those made by Lindt.  With that said, I will order these again as they were very much enjoyed.

Voila - Blue Diamond Almond Nut Thins! Blue Diamond has improved on an already great snack with a "Hint of Sea Salt" version that is still plenty salty for me. With only 80 mg. of salt per serving (less if you consider the amount left over at the bottom of the bag), it makes a very delicious treat that sometimes I find myself consuming the entire box instead of limiting myself to 17 crackers! I'm positively addicted. I've also tried the Hazelnut Thins, which are also quite delicious, but the Almond Nut Thins are my favorite.

Blue Diamond Nut-Thins have pushed those two treats from the top of my crunch list. You simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap, and the almond flavor of these crackers is sublime. They are wonderful with dips, but they are so delicious, I actually prefer to eat them plain. Though there is salt on them, it is truly a "hint," because they qualify as low sodium with only 80 mg. per serving.<br /><br />At only 8 calories per cracker, Nut-Thins compare favorably to my mini pretzels, which are 5 calories each.<br /><br />Blue Diamond is known for nuts and products made with nuts, and they have several other nut flavors for these crackers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154US">regular almond</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154WQ">pecan</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5FV2">hazelnut</a>.

At the grocery store or Kmart etc, they are usually 5 dollars or more.<br /><br />Our dog loves these, as well as a few other treats made by this brand. These, he doesn't devour immediately, as he is able to chew/gnaw on them for a few minutes before they are gone. It is nice to find a treat that keeps him occupied for a few minutes, rather than one he just basically swallows after a chew or two - like a biscuit etc. These provide a nice mix of treat and chew toy.<br /><br />The ingredients are very simple and he has no issues with digestion. These and the Drumettes made by Waggin Train are his favorite treats. The Drumettes are also only a few cents over 2 dollars at the dollar stores, whereas at the grocery store or elsewhere are over 4 dollars.<br /><br />I and our dog would definitely recommend them!

I told her I was taking my dogs to the vet, and she ask me to call her back with my vet's name and his diagnosis so that she can contact one of their vets to compare notes.<br />Since speaking with this company, I have talked with a couple of friends who have also given their dogs these same treats, and also had very sick dogs.<br />I have given my dogs the Waggin Train chicken jerky treats, and have not had any issues what so ever.

review/summary: Convenient to use and store
review/text: The description may be a little unclear, so just to clarify, you are getting 12 boxes, each box has 3 packets, so a total of 36 packets.  Each packet makes 1Qt of milk.  Those of you that have purchased powdered milk before will see how convenient this this.  To get powdered for a reasonable price at the store, you need to buy the biggest box they have.  The problem there is that as soon as you open it, you need to find better containers to store it in, preferably air tight and not made of plastic.<br /><br />The smaller packets you get with this product remove the need to find secondary storage containers.  Because you don't have to open it all at once, you don't have to worry about the moisture making the milk go bad, or light reducing the vitamin quality.<br /><br />If you have never used powdered milk before, there are some nice benefits.  The main benefit to me is that it doesn't go bad.  I don't drink enough milk to justify buying it by the gallon, and even buying half gallon sizes it would go bad before I could use it.  With powdered milk I never have to worry about it going bad, nor do I need to wonder if I have milk on hand.<br /><br />Now, as for taste, I don't drink milk by itself, powdered or not.  I've read that if you do, it's best to mix it up and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I use it in protein shakes, where it tastes no different than regular milk.  I imagine it would be great for things like smoothies as well.<br /><br />Another great use for powdered milk is adding it to coffee.  Much healthier for you than powdered non-dairy creamer, and just as creamy and delicious.  And, unlike regular milk, the powdered milk will not cool down your coffee nearly as much.  I've gotten a few people hooked on using powdered milk in their coffee.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: This product is easy to mix and use. Convenient to keep on hand.<br />stores well--longer than recommended if kept in cool, dry place (such as the basement). Though with drinking it does taste better  after a few hours of refrigeration, it can be used immediately with good flavor.  For cooking, it can't be detected as different from whole milk. I first began using it to help a limited budget, but several months later when I could afford whole milk again my kids decided they liked the Mix n Drink milk better.

review/summary: OK
review/text: This milk is OK. It is not really for drinking and more for cooking.  In my opinion it has more of the flat aftertaste that powdered milk can have. Wal-mart Great Value is slightly better with Provident Pantry having the best taste.

review/summary: Very good milk.
review/text: But four stars instead of five because there is no pour spout on the side of the box like there is on the boxes I  buy in supermarket. We use this for baking, not drinking. With a spout, you pick up the box, slide the spout, tip out enough to fill a measuring cup, close the spout. This product has pouches. You have to open the pouch, pour into measure, reclose up the pouch which sounds good but it takes about 3 times longer. On the other hand, there is an advantage where you make a quart at a time. Each pouch makes 1 quart, which is extremely handy, no measuring.

review/summary: too expensive
review/text: The price of 43 dollars makes this product over 4 dollars a gallon for this product. I can pick up regular whole milk for a lot less than this.<br /><br />The price was around 22 dollars around July-August 2011  , less than 2 months ago.<br /><br />Buy it at 43 dollars and this product will go up even higher. Or wait until price drops back to 22 dollars.

review/summary: 12 cents a Quart price increase over night
review/text: This product was .78 cents a quart one day, which made it about .02 cents cheaper per quart than the local supermarket.  Now it's jumped to .90 cents per quart making it .10 cents more expensive per quart than the local supermarket.  I gave it 3 stars because of the massive jump in price but the quality of the product itself gets 4.5 stars.

review/text: These were great and easy to measure and mix.  My only issue is with the price here as I found these at a local store for about 2.00 for the 3-pack box.  That was only a couple of months ago.  So what gives with the prices here?  Amazon definitely does not have the best prices on groceries even though you think you should be saving money buying cases...I found this has seldom been the "case" for me.  I gave the product 5 stars but wish Amazon was more price competitive on their groceries as they are on other items.

review/summary: Pretty good tasting for instant non-fat milk powder
review/text: Non-fat instant tastes okay, it will never taste like fresh milk, but the SACO brand is probably the best tasting of the bunch. Mix it up and chill it well for the best flavor.<br /><br />What I do use this milk for is cooking and baking. I either make up a small pitcher of the milk for cooking or use about 1/3 cup dry milk powder with 1 cup water for the recipe.<br /><br />You can also use this milk to make homemade buttermilk, if you have some buttermilk as a starter. Search the web for a recipe.<br /><br />If you want milk to drink, using milk powder, I'd recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5HUW">Nestle Nido Milk Powder, Imported, (400 gm), 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> as it tastes is very good.<br /><br />Recommend for cooking and baking.

review/text: I AM LOWERING THIS REVIEW SINCE THEIR HUGH 25% JACK UP IN PRICE. $1.25 A QUART IS WAY TO HIGH TO BUY ANYMORE.<br /><br />I am pretty much disabled and hate it when I run out of milk. I'm buying this so I have reserve on hand when it's to hard to go to the store when I run out of milk. The 12 3qt bags is a little more expensive but I figure it will stay fresher longer and I will probably only need one bag a month or so. I have heard Saco is a good brand. I will add to this review after I have tried it.<br /><br />--Update: IT WAS GOOD AT $36 A CASE BUT NOW IS A RIP-OFF AT $44. THE 40 QT BOX ALSO JUMPED TO $44 PLUS $13 STINKING SHIPPING. NOW YOU HAVE A HUGE HIGH PRICE. IT'S NOW WORTH BUYING THIS CRAP ANYMORE.

review/summary: Disgusting - Should be zero stars
review/text: The title says it all, but it's worth repeating; this "stuff" is absolutely disgusting.<br /><br />I love peanut butter, but there's none to be found here. If you love or even like peanut butter, and like Jif peanut butter, avoid this artificial glop. I just threw out what remained of the jar because I couldn't choke any more down. Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />Read the ingredients and you're in for an unpleasant surprise..Right after peanuts which probably isn't more than 30%-40% percent of the total, you'll find "corn syrup solids" (a form of sugar), followed by (here's a surprise), sugar (again) and soy protein, etc. Most peanut butter contains added sugar, but not like this.<br /><br />The texture is grainy or mealy, the taste is artificial and overly sweet, and the experience is like a lab experiment gone wrong.<br /><br />I've tried to wash it out of the jar before throwing the plastic in the recycling bin... It won't wash out.. it forms this mass of sticky stuff that even scalding water can't dislodge. I let it sit over night. No good; this stuff won't move from the jar. None of this stuff is water soluble and I doubt that it's even biodegradable, let alone digestible.<br /><br />This stuff is so bad I felt compelled to let unsuspecting people know. I shared it with two other people; they won't go near it again. Abominably bad.

The cookies are nice and minty and have a chocolate coating on the bottom of each cookie.<br /><br />Unlike say, the Oreo 100 calorie packs, these actually taste like grasshoppers, only smaller.  Unlike regular grasshoppers though, the 100 calorie pack version is trans fat free.<br /><br />Overall, these are a great example of what a 100 calorie pack should be.

review/text: I'm not a huge fan of the Hershey's cookies and creme bars because there's always so much white chocolate.  This is a little more cookie-y so I like it a lot better.  The chocolate cookie itself tastes a lot like the cookie part of an Oreo, but a little less dense and a little less chocolatey.  The creme itself tastes kind of like the white chocolate in a Hershey's cookies n creme bar, but MORE like the icing on those pink and white iced animal crackers.  Overall, it doesn't taste a LOT like an Oreo, but it definitely tastes more like an Oreo than the actual Oreo 100 calorie packs.

review/text: While the overall quality of Keebler's line of regular cookies tends to be quite good, their version of 100-calorie shortbread cookies is a true miss.<br /><br />Pros:  You get a large quantity of mini cookies per pouch (in comparison to Pepperidge Farm 100 calorie varieties.)<br /><br />Cons: Any essence of a "shortbread" flavor was completely lost to these crisps' just-sweet flavor.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these in that future.  For those seeking a very decent portion-controlled shortbread-type crisp, I highly recommend either Nabisco's Lorna Doone (sweeter), or Pepperidge Farm Chessmen (very buttery) both in 100 Calorie Pouches.

I live about 250 miles away and the bag was GONE by the time I got home! I logged on to Amazon and bought a whole 12-bag CASE! They are buttery, crunchy-crispy, and sliced differently than other bagel chips. Instead of the doughnut-shaped cross-sections of all the others, these are sliced vertically, so they are the approximate size and shape of a quarter. Seriously, these are GOOD good!
