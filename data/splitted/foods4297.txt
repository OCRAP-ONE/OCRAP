review/summary: Did a 360 on 479 Popcorn
review/text: I am a college student, but even I wouldn't mind occasionally shelling a bit to get this great gift or snack. Originally, when I heard of it at a party, I thought it would be like any other popcorn. Yet, when I first had a kernel, it was airy and melted right in your mouth. Unlike other regular caramel popcorn, this one wasn't too sickly sweet and I could eat it all day.

review/summary: Bar none, the best caramel popcorn I've ever tasted
review/text: I've always liked the idea of caramel popcorn, but found most commercial products not a lot better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPKODY">Cracker Jack</a> - frequently stale, often unpleasantly congealed. Just not the magic that I remember from when I was a little kid.<br /><br />This, on the other hand, THIS is heavenly. I received a bag of this as part of a gift box, and the popcorn was delightfully crisp, coated with sweet caramel, punctuated with intense bursts of saltiness. It's not a ton of food, but it's a single serving - and that's good, because too much of this is not good for the waistline. This is not only the best commercial caramel popcorn I've ever tasted, but probably the best caramel popcorn of any origin. It may not have the warm, gooey appeal of fresh homemade, but it lacks none of the flavor.<br /><br />It's kind of expensive (for my budget, anyway). But, man, is it good.<br /><br />I recommend.

review/summary: Can't believe how delicious this is!
review/text: So I buy a decent amount of low calorie snacks and feel disappointed often with them... but not with this one!  I have a sweet tooth that strikes at night and this satisfies my craving with sweet and salty.  It tastes buttery and delicious and my daughter who is quite the critic of my low calorie food couldn't believe that the bags only had 100 calories.  I will order more and I am very happy with this popcorn.

review/summary: Great price, great quality bone
review/text: First I was shocked at the size.  A little bigger than advertised, actually . Second the quality of it was great - it didn't "stink" like some bones I've gotten in the past.  My dog is a little older now (10.5 years) so she doesn't go through bones as quickly as before, and this one lasted quite a while.  Very solid, no chips or sharp points to it and it doesn't snap apart like some more brittle bones have, either - it more or less grinds down with their chewing.  I highly recommend this product, and for only $5 you're getting more than you pay for in my opinion.

review/summary: Gave pause to the "destroyer"
review/text: Our 8 month old lab mix, also known as the "destroyer", will go through raw hides in about ten minutes flat.  More brittle bones in about a half hour.  After snatching this one on sight and prancing over to her favorite killing grounds, she proceeded to go to work on this bone.  After eating the more workable ends pretty good and a couple of hours later she was barking at it in frustration.  Funny actually.  She now growls at it when passing by and will give it a few minutes if she thinks you want it more, other than that, I think she'd finally met her match.

review/summary: Lasts for a couple days
review/text: This was between a 3 and a 4 star review and I decided with the 3. My dogs does love these bones but once the ends are chewed off and he stripes the rest of the bone clean he wants nothing more to do with them. I bought a pack of 4 from petco and at first I had to entice him to even get him to eat them. Eventually he started to like them but like I said, he stripes it clean, chews the ends off and he's done. It also only lasts about a day, sometimes two.<br />Another problem is sometimes small pieces come off which aren't a problem for my dog but might be for others.

review/summary: My local petsmart has the same bones (different brand) for $19.99
review/text: If you do not mind waiting for shipping (which was not long for me) than I fully recommend these bones and this seller. My local PetSmart has these same bones (different brand) for $19.99. My dogs, while usually well mannered, went absolutely nuts while I was trying to open the box and cellophane wrap. At the time of this review one dog has taken a break from mauling his bone and is taking a nap while the other is still going to town on his. All in all, both dogs are preoccupied and I am able to sit back and get some work done without interference or guilt of ignoring them. As others have mentioned, these bones do have a bit of a smell to them, however, I have never heard of a bone like these that do not smell. Also, what would make the dogs want a bone if they had no smell?

Best thing about it is that my dog loves to chew on this thing and I've been told it tastes great.  It takes him some time to deal with it as well, so it keeps him occupied instead of chewing up other things.

review/text: I got these as a treat for my dogs, as they normally chew rawhide. I have found that they don't go after them as much as the rawhide.  When they do chew on them, the bones seem to last quite some time. Also I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression, these are Huge bones and they are at a great price. I guess it just depends on the dog.

review/summary: Tea from Shangri-La.
review/text: Yunnan province on the mighty Mekong river in southwestern China (north of Vietnam and Laos) gained its name, which means "South of the Clouds," during the Tang dynasty (AD 618 - 907), when a local prince, having made the tedious journey to the Emperor's court, told his sovereign that he had come from the lands south of the rainy weather in Sichuan. The mountain-encased and until recently not easily accessible province is probably the location of the mythical Shangri-La, referred to in James Milton's "Lost Horizons," as well as home to the ancient city of Lijang (a UNESCO world heritage site) in the shadow of the mighty Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain, Bai horses, Dali marble and numerous medicinal products, including one of China's famous "wonder drugs," the white powder known as "Baibao Dan" (One Hundred Treasures Drug), which is said to cure everything from injuries to certain gynecological diseases, and frequently applied to clean open wounds and stop bleeding, stimulate blood circulation, and against inflammations.<br /><br />Tea plantation in Yunnan began about 1700 years ago, during the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279), when the city of Pu'erh in the South of the province became a major tea trading center; although at least in Yunnan's northwestern corner the tradition is probably even older and was imported across the border from Tibet during the Tang dynasty. Elsewhere, bricks of Pu-erh tea also constituted the first medium of monetary exchange used by nomads beyond the Great Wall of China, and their use has been recorded as early as A.D. 476.<br /><br />Yunnan is a broadleaf tea with a distinctly bright color and intense, lasting, slightly peppery or spicy taste. Unusually forgiving, Yunnan tea usually does not grow bitter, even when it is oversteeped.

review/text: Pieces can be large so I break them up but there are also smaller pieces and some powder.You should keep it in the original package and take out a week's worth or so at a time and store in a jar or plastic container as it can get stale once out of the original package. The 4 oz size is pretty large, like a large yogurt container.<br />Be careful about forgetting them in your pocket they can stink things up if left there for months.

They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.

review/text: Our dogs and cat love these liver treats. They are solid enough to keep their shape in training pouches, yet soft enough to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, because of their softness, when shipped in the larger-size container, the pieces breakdown into dust before arrival, so you really don't get too many more actual pieces than you get with the smaller container.<br /><br />They are "real" rather than processed, and appeal more to the animals that way. They last a long time (at least 2 months). I heartily recommend them.

review/text: I bought these as a healthier training treat for my dogs.  They absolutely love it!  In fact, they love it so much that I have to post a warning: Dogs love this stuff so much they'll do almost anything to get to it!<br /><br />When this product was delivered we did not hear the delivery van arrive.  As usual he put the box next to our side door.  When we came home later that day, I let the dogs out into the back yard to romp and do their business.  I heard a little growling going on so I went out to check on them to find that the dogs had found the delivered box of treats and proceeded to rip the box open and then they opened the bucket (It's a pretty weak lid but I believe they would have eaten the bucket if the lid didn't come off so easily) and they devoured about 1/3 of the bucket! Three days later, I had this bucket o'treats on top of my buffet where I dispensed it for dog training sessions in the house. (I leave dog treat bags in this spot regularly and they've never tried to take them before.) We were gone for the afternoon and the dogs decided to go counter surfing for it this time and ate a bunch more right out of the bucket.  Because this treat is so rich, they were not feeling well after it happened!  So do not leave this treat out where it can be reached!  It's too tempting for the dogs. And man, oh man, if you need a high value treat to work with your dog this one really does the trick for mine.

review/summary: GREAT INCENTIVE TO GET DOGS EATING DRY FOOD!
review/text: As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.  They are very light, but need to be given SPARINGLY.  I use tiny pieces of these as special treats for my "Charly," who adores them. Want to know a trick?  For those of you trying to get your dogs to eat more dry than wet food, take a few of the liver treats and literally crush the suckers into a powder.  It takes a while to do it in your hands, but you can always use anything in the kitchen to help.  Anyhoo....sprinkle just the bit over the dry dog food and VOILA!  I bet your dog will eat up the bowl.  Again, most dogs ADORE these Stewart's liver treats, so the smallest amount sprinkled will do the trick.<br /><br />My friend is a dog/cat rescuer and turned me onto Stewart's - not only because they are really good, but also because they are made in the U.S.A.  That means a lot when it comes to our pet products.<br /><br />My treats came very fast, too!!!  It's much more economical to get the larger tub and it will last a long, long time.  Or consider sharing wwith another dog lover!

review/summary: The bitter and the sweet
review/text: PROS:<br />Added sweetness without the added carbs<br />No effects on insulin levels<br />Safe for diabetics<br />Handy 1 g packages<br />0 calories<br />Organic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sweet, but with a different overall taste than sugar<br />Bitter aftertaste is not completely eliminated<br />The bitter aftertaste is accentuated by the amount of product used--the more you add, the more you get the aftertaste<br />Fine grained, non-sugar like powder<br />Expensive<br /><br />OTHER NOTES:<br />Packaged for sweetening beverages, not for baking (not bulked up enough to be used on its own)<br />A single package is supposed to be equal to '2 tsp of sugar,' but this really depends on your own individual taste<br /><br />Trying to decrease the amount of empty carbs in my diet, I purchased Wholesome Organic Stevia from another vendor.  I have never really been a fan of stevia before, but I have used Wholesome Sweeteners' products before and after reading the written-on-the-box statement that they had developed the 'Best Tasting Stevia in the World,'  I decided to give stevia one more try.  I can't say that this product blew me away or has made me love stevia, but as stevia products go this one ain't bad.  It compares fairly with other stevia brands that I have used in the past. I found that it made a reasonable sweetener for coffee and tea, so long as I was careful not to use too much.  (Use too much and that well-known, bitter aftertaste really shoots through.)<br /><br />Stevia is an all natural sweetener that is promoted as a substitute for table sugar (sucrose).  There are any number of brands and different forms in which stevia is sold.  Popular formulations of stevia include highly concentrated liquid extracts and powdered forms, such as the stevia sold here.  Stevia is often mixed with other substances to bulk it up and to help hide stevia's well known bitter aftertaste.  In the case of the Wholesome Sweeteners product, the stevia is mixed with organic agave inulin and silica.<br /><br />In its natural form stevia leaves are something like 30 to 45 times the sweetness of table sugar, but the purified forms of stevia can be up to 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar.  Commercial stevia is usually an extract from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, and, in this light, the Wholesome Sweeteners product is no exception.  The difference in commercial compounds is usually not the source of the stevia but rather the final purity/composition of the extract and how the stevia is extracted.  According to what I have read, the sweetness of the stevia is mostly derived from something called rebaudioside A, the major component 'steviol glycoside' that lends the sweetest taste to stevia with the least amount of bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Companies may argue about the proper way to derive and purify their stevia extracts, but the major deciders,of course, are your own taste buds.  Let me just warn you:  do NOT attempt to taste test this (or any) stevia directly out of the package.  If you apply stevia directly to your tongue, you will be overwhelmed by the initial sweetness of the stevia and then majorly turned off by the awful, bitter aftertaste.  Stevia needs to be mixed into a larger volume (such as an 8 or 12 ounce cup of coffee) before it is sampled.<br /><br />When mixed into a cup of coffee, the Wholesome Sweeteners brand compared favorably to other brands of stevia that I have used.  The sweetness was certainly there, but is not exactly the same as table sugar.  For me, stevia has a more cotton-candy like sweetness that you may or my not prefer and for some odd reason it seemed more pronounced in the back rather than the front of my mouth (I don't have a good explanation for this, but for some reason it seems so).  I am okay with this kind of sweetness, but I prefer xylitol and erythritol(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X71550">Swerve Sweetener, 16oz [1lb</a>]), which have a taste that is more similar to table sugar.  I didn't notice much of a bitter taste at first (1/2 packet in 8 ounces), but at higher concentrations (a whole packet in 8 ounces) the bitterness was definitely there.  Although it wasn't pronounced, it was disturbing enough to make drinking the coffee a less pleasant experience.  Xylitol and erythritol do exhibit a 'cooling effect' at higher concentrations that may disturb some people, but on the whole have a cleaner, more sucrose-like flavor--they taste more like sugar than the stevia does.<br /><br />On the whole, the taste was palatable at lower concentrations.  Since I'm not the kind of guy that likes to suck coffee directly through the sugar cube, this was okay for me.  But I will warn you that if you are someone who likes their coffee very sweet and you try this with stevia, you will definitely be disappointed by that bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you are into artificial sweeteners (we're talking taste here, not other issues), this stevia is definitely better than saccharine.  I've never really liked the taste of saccharine very much and saccharine has a much more pronounced bitter aftertaste.  In comparison to Splenda (sucralose), the stevia is probably a dead heat.  On taste alone, I'd describe Splenda's sweet taste as more similar to sugar, but I've always found the aftertaste of Splenda to be a big turn off.  At low concentrations, I'd prefer Wholesome Sweeteners' stevia, but at higher levels of sweetness, I'd prefer splenda.  Once again, on taste alone, I'd have to give a real edge to Equal (aspartame).  Equal's sweetness isn't completely sucrose-like, but it is closer to a more pure sweetness than stevia.  Equal also has a less pronounced aftertaste.<br /><br />That being said, the artificial sweeteners have their own baggage and plenty of folks avoid them.  In the natural realm of things, I prefer erythritol.  It is less sweet than sugar, but tastes more like sugar.  Erythritol also has fewer GI side effects and is lower in calories than xylitol (xylitol has 40% fewer calories than table sugar).<br /><br />Please note, that this stevia is not meant to replace sugar in baking.  Unless it is packaged with filler, it isn't bulky enough nor does it have enough sugar-like physical qualities to be a baking substitute. However, you can buy formulations of stevia that are bulked up with fillers or other sweeteners (inulin, erythritol, etc.) so that it can be used for baking.  As noted above, however, stevia has a distinct taste that may or may not work with your baked goods.<br /><br />On the whole, this isn't a bad way to go if you like the taste of stevia.  It is a reasonable choice if you like its unique, sweet taste.  For me, it tasted far better than the artificial sweeteners, saccharine and Splenda.  At lower concentrations, I found it to be a pleasant sweetener for coffee and tea and it's always nice to have another, natural sweetener to choose from.  However, I'm not ready to jump on the stevia bandwagon yet: I'll certainly finish off my box of stevia, but after that I'll be going back to my erythritol...

review/summary: The best brand out there!
review/text: Once my doctor told me to try Stevia instead of the Splenda, I was very cautious and skeptical.  First of all, it tastes a little different right out of the package, but mixed in with my tea I couldn't taste any of the bitterness the other reviewer is referring to.  It gives my tea a nice sweet, but not too sweet, flavor with one packet.  And, the ingredients couldn't be more clear: NO MALTODEXTRIN in sight! I highly recommend this one.

I LOVE this product! It has far less sodium and does NOT overwhelm like traditional soy sauce. You can use it just like soy sauce and will be guaranteed a fresh taste without the strong salty taste of most soy sauces. I replaced all of my soy sauce and teriyaki sauce with this product!!!!

Something that goes well with all sorts of Asian food and any kind of sashimi or grilled fish and chicken (well I haven't tried them all, but it would seem to so far).<br /><br />Bear in mind that it has no fat, so you will want to add a little oil on your salad as some vitamins are only fat soluble and so your 'healthy' salad without some source of fat does you far less good.

review/text: With an annual output of more than 1,500,000 lbs., the north-eastern Indian state of Assam -- situated across the border from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan -- is the world's single largest tea-producing region. Similar to Darjeeling, Assam tea is picked in a first and second harvest or "flush." While leaves from the first flush produce a full, refreshing aroma, Assam tea is particularly known for its second flush, whose cream- or gold-colored tips (or even entire leaves) lessen the tea's natural bitterness, thus giving it a softer, gentler note.<br /><br />Leaves Pure Teas House Assam is a second flush variety with characteristically malty aroma, nicely full-bodied, even if nothing for truly special occasions.

The Coffee Mix's samplers were the only ones that guaranteed that I would get twenty different K-cups instead of a random assortment that ends up having multiples of each. In the end, I got more than I wanted. They actually sent 21 different K-cups, some suckers, a coupon for 5% off my next order, and a coupon for two additional K-cups on my next order. The K-cups all arrived in perfect condition, and none of them expire for a long time. And they aren't just the icky sounding ones either, there are lots of K-cups here that I can't wait to try.<br /><br />If you want to try out a lot of different kinds of K-cups to find out your favorites, this is the sampler to buy. I'm probably going to buy their coffee or cocoa sampler next.

review/text: I planned to buy this as a gift so I decided to buy it for myself first to ensure that it was as good as people were saying. For one, the box was absolutely crushed when I got it, and the chocolate was stuck together. It did not have the dusty brown texture displayed on the cover, the chocolates were black like dark chocolate,and tasted like it too. I don't know if it's because of the condition, but I really can't enjoy these. I've tried chewing them, letting them melt, combining the two methods... eventually I gave up because the taste was making me sick in the stomach. I'm glad I decided to buy it first before gifting it and making myself look like a fool.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolates!
review/text: These Belgain Truffles are the best chocolates on the planet! I have only been able to find them at Amazon.com. The company who shipped them is fabulous. They were concerned about shipping them to Florida because the hot weather would melt them. Luckily within the week a cool spell dropped down into SW FL so the chocolates were shipped. It's hard to eat just one! I would definitely order them again.

review/summary: The melted chocolate problem
review/text: I ordered these truffles to give as a gift.  Luckily they did not arrive in time so I decided to eat them myself.  As others have mentioned,  they were previously melted and had turned into one hard block.  I thought it was probably a UPS problem but after reading reviews here, I guess it wasn't.

review/summary: Don't waste your money
review/text: This product arrived having been melted and reformed into a large misshapen lump.  I received no satisfaction when trying to get back my purchase price or have it replaced.  I cannot comment on flavor as it was inedible.  This product was sent in such a way that there was no protection (although it was winter).  I would think that anyone sending a perishable food product would package it appropriately.  Apparently, this company does not care.

review/summary: Best tasting truffles ever - just one problem
review/text: These truffles are the best I've ever had before. I bought some other chocolate cocoa dusted powder truffles this year too, for some other people and I went with a different brand then this. Don't get me wrong, they were also really good, but nothing compares to me. I paid significantly more for these then I did the other ones I tried, and although they looked the same, they definitely did not taste the same. The other ones were rich and tasted good and would satisfy your sweet tooth, but if you want to taste one of the best tasting truffles ever, these are the ones to get. I thought I wasted my money at first since I paid more then the others for these, but after tasting the difference I know I got my moneys worth.<br /><br />The only problem is that these truffles were melted together when I received them. So you literally have to break them apart and they have lost some of their shape, and you can no longer see the powered cocoa on the outside because they got hot and melted. Now I saw someone else complain about this too and figured I was safe ordering them because its the coldest time of the winter so I figured theres no way they can melt now, but they were melted anyways. All I can figure is they've been sitting around somewhere for awhile, but they taste very fresh so I'm not sure what happened. If you can live with the partially melted thing, then I highly recommend these truffles. Melted or not, they are still the best. Send me some un-melted ones next time to get 5 stars.

review/text: I have received these two different times as Christmas gifts and loved them!  I see that others have had trouble with them melting or sticking together.  They are delicate, but usually are fresh and if you refrigerate them briefly on a plate before serving they are less messy.  Very rich flavor and SO good that it's hard to eat just one or two.  Nice to give and to receive as a hostess gift or to give as a thank you.  Two thumbs up from a whole group of us who devoured them yesterday!

review/text: I received a pound of Buffalo Bill's hickory pieces as a gift, and enjoyed the size of the pieces and the consistency of the beef's tenderness and flavor. The box happened to come with a couple of samples courtesy of Choo Choo snacks, one of which were a few pieces of the maple pepper beef jerky. After finishing the hickory I went ahead and opened up the maple, and ate it all in maybe 30 seconds. This jerky is so unique and borderline mouthwatering, I actually broke down and bought a pound of it. It's just ever so slightly spicy, and the smell and taste of the maple syrup hits you at the start then lingers after you've finished it. I don't profess to be some sort of food critic, but I figured something this tasty deserved a review with a few big words. So if you like eating healthy and are looking for a nice treat, I really recommend this!

review/summary: Comfort food with a twist
review/text: When I was growing up, one of my favorite meals was a stack of my mom's hot pancakes with lots of maple syrup flowing over them. The Buffalo Bills Premium Maple Pepper Beef Jerky gives me that great maple syrup taste with a twist.  The classic smokey Buffalo Bills Premium jerky paired with the delicious warm sweetness of maple sugar and the robust taste of cracked black pepper all come together to create a wonderful treat. There is a good balance between the maple sugar and black pepper; both are strong flavors but neither overpowers the taste of this jerky. The size of the Maple Pepper Beef Jerky pieces make it easy to enjoy this treat any time. I'm glad the people at Choo Choo R Snacks are quick with the shipping; they make it so easy to enjoy my favorite jerky.

review/text: I am highly recommending you DO NOT give your dog Greenies.  My German Shepherd was given one by a friend.  He loved the taste and ate it wholeheartedly. However, within a 24 hours, he was vomiting blood and taken to the vet's emergency clinic.  Not only did the product tear up his throat, but he had an intestinal blockage because the Greenie did not digest easily.  He was at risk for emergency surgery, but my vet was able to help him pass it. He had to be on an IV for a week.  Folks, the packaging on Greenies even says it is fatal if not thoroughly chewed.  DO NOT RISK IT! I almost lost my best friend.

review/summary: Great in recipes!
review/text: Over time, I have used regular Progresso Italian bread crumbs when a recipe calls for bread crumbs. I had always been happy with that product, but when I saw the Panko bread crumbs on the shelf at our local grocery store, I had to give that a try!<br /><br />I am quite glad that I carried out the experiment. There is a different and distinct texture. The end result (for example, in a topping for macaroni and cheese) is wonderful. The box containing the bread crumbs notes that Panko crumbs are from the softer heart of bread, as opposed to regular bread crumbs that contain crust. Quoting the box: "The larger, flaky crumb has a texture that is great as a coating for baking and frying or as a topping on various dishes."<br /><br />I have now used these bread crumbs on Macaroni and Cheese, on chicken and pork dishes that I have fried or sauteed. It adds a nice taste dimension to the dish. So, I'm sold! I'll keep purchasing Panko bread crumbs in the future.

review/text: We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).  I have purchased other high quality chews for a lower price so I can't really justify the high price of these treats.  We spend a lot of money on our pets but this is the first treat/chew that I felt like they might as well have been chewing on my wallet! (I think my wallet would have lasted longer)

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH3M">Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Treats, Medium</a> actually worked really well. We have a medium-sized lab + something mix and she really enjoyed these. I'm generally not a big fan of dog treats, because they stink,, they don't help her breath/teeth much, they have funky things inside, and she has powerful jaws that enable her to go through just about any treat in a short amount of time.<br /><br />ODOR<br />As far as the smell goes, this wasn't bad at all. In fact, not only did it improve her breath, but there was a noticeable reduction in plaque. I didn't expect the treats to actually accomplish this, and was glad to see how well they worked.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />All natural and healthy.<br /><br />LONGEVITY<br />Unfortunately, the treats didn't last long.

review/summary: Quite the hit!!
review/text: When I first received Haley's (my dog) package of Zoe Anti-Oxidant Dental Chew Treats (medium size), I took Haley and 3 of the treats to my neighbor's house to visit and share with her dogs. All 3 dogs LOVED the treats and got very possessive of their own. The dogs range from about 15 pounds to 30 pounds.  It took the boston terrier the longest to eat.  There were no crumbs leftover at all.  Haley normally carries bones around for awhile to protect and guard.  She started eating her Zoe bone right away.<br /><br />These bones are similar to Denta Bones in style, but they have much better ingredients.  I've given Haley natural dental bones before, and these have a similar smell.  I'm not sure if it's the rosemary or what other ingredient.<br /><br />I am very impressed and pleased with these bones.  They seem to keep the dogs busy for a while longer than denta bones, so that is definitely a good thing!  I will be purchasing these for Haley in the future.  I doubt I would give her one every day because of the calories, but maybe she will get them as a special treat a couple times a week.

review/summary: Short life, strong odor
review/text: On arrival, I distributed a chew to each of three dogs under 20 pounds who do like chews.  They each went at their chew with a will, and in 15 minutes the chews were gone.  As the chewing was in progress, and lingering, was a distinct odor similar to horse weeds and other strong herbs.  I cannot say how "dental" the experience was, for such a quick gulp.  If one of the purposes of the chew is to occupy a pet for any extended time, this choice is a flop--but it must have been tasty.

review/summary: Dog Loves It and Perfect Size
review/text: My dog has been using Check-ups and Greenies for a while and he loves this new addition to his dental chewies routine. The medium size is perfect for my 25 lb. cocker spaniel. The bone is roughly the size of a large chicken drumstick bone. When I was opening the bag, my dog followed me around. I suspected he knew this bag of bones was for him. He grabbed the chew bone immediately after I offered it to him found a nice corner and went about his chewing. It lasted a good minute or two. This stuff is made of quinoa, gluten free, and touts anti-oxidant benefits. And I assume it tastes good because it actually smells pretty good. 5 stars for Zoe Anti-Oxidant Chew Bones and I would buy again and recommend to others. When my dog is happy... I'm happy.

review/summary: Benny likes it. But why Nutraceuticals in Dog Treats?
review/text: My cocker spaniel enjoyed these treats. They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.

review/summary: 4 of 5 Dogs Approve
review/text: Upon opening the package, the two young Jack Russell Terriers began bouncing up and down --they could tell from the smell that this was a treat they were going to like.  I was not at all off put by the vaguely minty, grainy smell but my wife did not care for the smell at all.  The two youngsters ran to their crates where they immediately devoured the chews in less than 2 minutes.  The treats were also given to a geriatric JRT, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an Australian Cattle Dog.  The old JRT also polished his chew off in a matter of minutes, it took the CKCS about 10 minutes and the ACD turned her nose up at the chew -- she literally pushed it into a corner of her crate and sat in the opposite corner as far away as possible from the treat.  The ACD is admittedly very picky about food and treats, but she absolutely loves bully sticks (as do all of the other dogs) which also last many times longer than these chews and cost less when one considers their staying power.<br /><br />In summary:<br />+4: Number of dogs liked<br />+0: Smell (some humans and dogs liked, others didn't)<br />-1: Cost<br />-1: Duration<br /><br />So, these chews get a score of two (2) given that all dogs in the house love bully sticks which provide much longer chewing enjoyment  at a lower cost.

review/summary: Nice Dog Treat - The Dog Liked It
review/text: What else can I say except the dog really liked these treats?  I didn't taste them, but after sniffing the something new for him treat and being a little skeptical he ran off with it and sat down to gnaw for a long time.  A good benefit is there wasn't a nasty smell to the treat before or after the dog eating it like there is with other dental-type pet treats.<br /><br />One thing I want to point out is the size of these treats - they are a lot bigger than a greenie and other similar pet dental treats, as well as a lot tougher which will take them longer to chew.  I have a small dog that weighs a little over ten pounds, so I broke this one in half which seemed like enough for him.<br /><br />See my tongue-in-cheek comment above about not tasting them, but I do believe there is a bit of salt in these, as a few hours after eating them he was extremely thirsty.<br /><br />Overall, this appears to be a good treat for your dog - time will tell if it helps his teeth!

review/text: It's hard to find products that are actually good for our dogs & their teeth but these are. What a plus to offer a "low calorie" dental bone. Our gal just turned eleven and has arthritis, so we have to really watch her diet since she can't exercise like she use to. She really loves them. I wish they were less expensive also but unfortunately so much of the stuff that is offered out there has some ingredients that are harmful or cause stomach problems.

review/summary: another great treat and it really works...
review/text: My one aussie was starting to get a tartar build-up on her teeth when I found this product.  They love them and I can notice a difference in my girls teeth.  The tartar build-up is less and less.  Thanks!

review/summary: Treats with a plus
review/text: We keep these treats on hand for friends who visit with their pets. We love dogs and have had them as companions ourselves, but sometimes that doggy breath is a little overwhelming -- one or two of these treats makes the pups happy and makes their presence a lot more fun. Of course, we always ask before treating, but our friends seem very pleased that we have a nutritional treat to offer their pet.

review/summary: Too Big for the Chihuahua but Perfect for My Medium Sized Dog
review/text: I have two dogs, a medium mixed breed and a small Chihuahua who has had a few rotted teeth pulled.  I gave both one each and the mixed breed ate it right up and finished it off in a couple of minutes.  The Chihuahua on the other hand chewed the end for a couple seconds before going into guard mode.  The broke it in half in hopes that he could chew from the middle which is smaller than the ends.  He was able to crew off a half an inch from the middle before giving up again.  At the end of the day, I figured it was too big for him and tossed what was left to my other dog that was more than happy to finish it off.

review/summary: These chew treats last but not one of our pup's favorites.
review/text: If our pup's opinion of these small dental chew treats changes, I will update this review.  I like these puppy dental chew treats because they keep her busy for a longer period of time than most chew treats.  She chews on them but she is not that crazy about them because she will quit chewing and leave it while she does something else.  I think it may be the mint flavor that is not her favorite because she has other mint flavored chew bones that she will chew on and then leave unfinished.  However, I am keeping these chew treats for back-up and am not sorry I bought them.

review/summary: Good treats
review/text: Dogs seem to like them ok.  They are easy enough to give and are not all that messy.  They are Greyhounds, so a larger Breed and these actually seemed to be a find size for them.  Hard to say if they have a good line to good Dental Health. Brushing your Dog's teeth is a good road to go for good dental hygene. They do have a bit of a stronger smell than some of the Dental Chew treats I have dealt with and a positive is that they don't contain gluten.

review/summary: Great treat
review/text: *I let my sister try them with her dog, 'cause she always complains about his breath. ;)<br /><br />(she says):<br />My dog found them really palatable and though I don't think I used them long enough to notice a difference in his breath or with his teeth - a dental chew is no good if the dog wont eat it.

review/summary: My Chiweenie loved them! Slight reprieve from bad breath.
review/text: My chiweenie didn't think twice about making mince meat out of these chew treats. Once she got a hold of one, she didn't stop gnawing on it until there was only a knobby end left. It didn't take her too long to do it either. As for helping with her bad breath - meh. It became minty bad breath, but it was still icky breath.<br /><br />My yorkie, on the other hand, didn't really care too much for these treats. He'd tried them only because the other dog was enjoying it so much, but never cared for them much.<br /><br />From an owner's point of view, I do like the good ingredients these chew treats have. They don't get sticky, they are not messy, and they smell ok. I would gladly buy these again seeing how much my chiweenie enjoyed them.

review/summary: My dog loved them!
review/text: My 21 lb Cockapoo loved these treats. He's only 1 1/2 yrs old and I brush his teeth regularly, so his teeth still look great and he does not have bad mouth odor. If the treats helped to clean his teeth it was not noticeable to me. I do wonder how effective the treats are at teeth cleaning and mouth odor because my dog was able to consume them very quickly- within just a few minutes. Perhaps the treats leave some sort of residue in the dog's mouth and on their teeth to prolong the effectiveness. I thought the treats smelled rather strongly of beef stock, though the ingredients list natural chicken flavor, rosemary, parsley, and vanilla among other things. The ingredient list is not too long and are all natural. I've found my Cockapoo to have a rather sensitive stomach and these treats do not upset his digestive tract. I try to buy only natural, limited ingredient foods and treats. Unlike other reviewers, I have had no issues with crumbs or staining from these dark brown treats. My dog tends to eat the treats on our beige leather couches and there has been no residue.

review/summary: Joy-Joy Says Order Some More Please!!!!
review/text: I have a 9 month old Boxer/Pit, she is an aggressive chewer.  These bones crumble some but, she vacuumed up the bit -n- pieces quickly; leaving nothing behind.  She enjoyed these bones but devoured them in less than 10 minutes.  The only thing negative was the smell - they are the strongest smelling treats she has encountered.

review/summary: Differing opinions
review/text: It's difficult to judge things on the taste of a dog, especially with a picky dog.  My dog appeared to like the first dental chew, yet refuses to nibble on another.  Gave it to a friend's dog and she enjoyed it more.  I'll give it 3 stars as an average, but it's all about a dog's taste.

review/summary: The dog loves them and they probably help his teeth
review/text: These treats are a huge hit with the dog; it's the only item he takes to another room to enjoy and be certain that we won't change our minds about it. They've got a tough exterior that he works hard at, but he likes it so well he never gives up. It's about 15 minutes from start to finish. That's a lot of good jaw and tooth exercise.<br /><br />Of course, when we ask him if his teeth feel cleaner, he doesn't say a lot, and a visual inspection doesn't tell us a lot. But with the way he works at these, we're certain it's doing something worthwhile.<br /><br />We've had other rawhide-like treats, and the dog abandons them after a while. Not so with these.<br /><br />We also liked the packaging, which was attractive, reseals nicely, and isn't extravagant or wasteful.<br /><br />The only thing we recommend you watch out for is to get a large enough treat size. We had a package of the "medium" size and for our dog, about 60 pounds, a larger size would have been better.<br /><br />Highly recommended --- by the dog as well as us.

review/summary: Doggies love these
review/text: These are kind of soft. I could break one in half with my hands, and give each half to my little Doggies.<br /> They love these, but it was hard to tell if this cleaned there teeth. As I just had my<br />dogs teeth cleaned.<br /><br />These Dental Chews are not something to keep your dogs buzy chewing on these, as they are soft, and they eat them in a short time.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy:<br />Brown rice flour, Organic quinoa flour,vegtable glycerin, water, pea flour, tapioca starch, carrageenan,  calcium carbonate, natural chicken flavor, carrots, apples , chia seed, parsley, L-ascorbyl-2polyphosphate, (source of vitamin C), rosemary, peppermint, vanilla, zinc gluconate, green tea extract (decaffeinated) mixed tocopherols (preservative).<br /><br />The medium is For 20 to 30 lbs dogs..3 to 4 a week.<br />I would not give 3 or 4 of these to my dogs a weeks. I do not think its nessasary, and it would be expensive.<br /> I use to give my dogs the Greenies, but some dogs have choked on those. There harder then these are.<br />since these are softer, I think it would do a better job of cleaning there teeth, and gums,<br />cause it rubs around there gums and teeth when they bite into it (if that makes sinse!)<br /><br />I think these are good for there teeth, and gums. Hopefully this will keep there<br />teeth cleaner, and there gums in better health, with fresher breath.<br /><br />I would buy these..

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.  In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: Slowly approached, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: My pups (aged 6 & 5) both enjoyed these, but since they talk I couldn't get their "official" position on them.  That said, having trained them extensively I'm pretty good at watching their body language.  When presented with these both pups were eager for a 'treat,' but after getting these in their mouths they both were slightly tentative to dig in.  Perhaps its because my pups normally get high-protein snacks like dried chicken breast, and they're not used to brown rice flour, quinoa flour, pea flour, & tapioca starch. Or perhaps it was the vanilla/mint flavor. Either way, it sort of reminded me of kids acting with trepidation about eating a new vegetable. But, after a few fleeting moments the question marks popping out of their heads went away and both pups earnestly chewed up their treats.<br /><br />The package says "Dental Chews" which normally speaks to an ability to remove tartar or freshen breath. The package states that the product "freshens breath naturally,"  so I assume the mint serves as a breath freshener, thus earning the title "dental chew" instead of "treat."<br /><br />That said, I'm pleased to know the product is wheat-free and corn-free, as I'm not a fan of feeding my pups either one of those all-too-common ingredients.  I was going to give the product four stars because the dogs didn't jump on them like white on rice, but then I realized that this is a very healthy treat that is a whole lot better for them than most of the stuff that's out there, and after the slight hesitation, both dogs seemed to enjoy these very much ... so five stars it is.

review/summary: My dog loved them - good for a special treat.
review/text: I'm not someone who gives their dog all-natural or organic food and treats as a regular thing, but I'm always willing to try something new. I swear my dog could tell by the crinkle of the package that they were for her, and she was at my feet the entire time I was opening the bag. I handed it to her, she grabbed it, and off she went. She devoured it, so I guess it was a success. They are quite a bit more expensive than her daily treats that I buy, but these are great for a now and again treat.
