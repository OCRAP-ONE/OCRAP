review/summary: It's what it says it is.
review/text: These are tablets of sodium saccharine, 1 grain per tablet. They're much more convenient to use than the powdered saccharine in the pink packets. If you prefer saccharine as your artificial sweetener of choice, this is an easy way to portion it out.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I ordered this from Amazon when it became difficult to find the 1/4 grain tablets locally. I like these even better. Less counting with the larger tablets and a better price. The tablets seem to dissolve easier than the smaller ones that I could buy from the local grocery store before they stopped having them. This works great for sweetening my iced green tea that I make by the gallon. Saves a lot of calories and leaves no after taste.

review/summary: good artificial sweetener that is greener
review/text: The tast of this sweetener is identical to others sold in packets and made from saccharin (Sweet N Low and its imitations) but its advantages over those products is that it is less expensive and it doesn't come packaged in all that paper.  The tablets are easy to use but my husband and I have found that the reported sweetening power of each of the "dosages" sold (1/4 grain, 1/2 grain, 1 grain) is exaggerated.  Decades ago there had been a case made against saccharin, suggesting that it was cancer causing.  I  recall reading that it was the sugar industry that led that crusade against a product that has actually proved very safe and really a godsend to diabetics. We have now bought enough to last us for over a year.  It is also going to be easy to leave a bottle at each of our children's homes so they will always be able to accommodate our needs.

review/summary: necta sweet
review/text: As a diabetic it is constantly difficult to access saccaran products with all the phoney nutrasweet products being shelved instead of saccaran which is the only true safe diabetic sugar substitute which will not accummilate in a person's body.  Nutrasweet takes over 24 hours from the time consumed to leave the body and a person consuming that product elevates their blood sugars without knowlege of what is happening to them.  The federal government's measurements for calories is how much calories is burned in a 60 minute period not until the total is burned off that's how manufacturers are fooling people into believing that most of their products are calorie free when they are loadedwith calories and dangerous to consume if you are suseptable to calories as a diabetic is.<br />I recommend all diabetics also take advantage of purchasing from this company or ones with these saccaran products they will control their condition better.  My knowlege is from being a controlled diabetic for over 35 years. Bill Benson Az

My main use is to sweeten tea and it works as well as the liquid sweetner and most of the packet type and is a lot less expensive. The only draw back is if you use too much it leaves a bitter taste.

I initially set out to find a cornstarch that was derived from non-gmo corn as the gmo cornstarch products make me very itchy.  We make our own homemade pudding on a very regular basis so that is what we first used this cornstarch for.  It only took one spoonful of the vanilla pudding recipe for us to immediately notice how smooth the pudding tasted.  Even my teenage son noticed the difference!!  I now keep my shelves stocked with this excellent product.  And by the way...no itching!

It's a very full-bodied coffee, but smooth. Doctor's orders, I can drink only so much regular coffee, and finding a decent decaf is a problem. This decaf is superb! In fact, my husband brought me a cup of decaf the other AM - and I couldn't tell that it wasn't "hi-test.!"<br />If you like a dark, deep, smooth coffee, give The Pod a try.

review/summary: Pamela's Gluten Free Bread Flour, 25 pound bag
review/text: I love this bread mix!  It is really as close to regular bread that I have found since going gluten-free.  This bag sets up to make 20 loaves of bread (3-1/2 cups each).  You will need to add 2-1/4 tsp of yeast to the mix.  I use a bread maker.  Nice thing for this mix is that you can use a regular cycle and don't need a gluten-free maker.<br /><br />Down side of this large sack is that it does not give you the recipe!  So, here it is for a bread maker:<br /><br />Pamela's Best Gluten-Free Bread mix<br /><br />3-1/2 cups Pamela's bread flour<br />2 large eggs<br />1/4 cup oil<br />Hot water<br />2-1/4 tsp yeast<br /><br />In 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure first the oil, add the two eggs to the container, fill the container up to the 2 cups mark with hot water.  Add 2 tbsp hot water.  Pour into bread maker pan.  Add the Pamela's bread flour to the of the egg mix.  Make a shallow well at the top of the flour mix and put the yeast into it.  Put into bread maker.  Set the bread maker at 1.5 lbs and at medium color.  When the bread maker is at mix, use a spatula to scrape the sides and corners to help mix the flour in. Remove the pan right after it is done baking (do not allow to remain in the bread maker for the warm cycle after baking).<br /><br />Remove from the bread pan immediately and cool on a wire rack.  Use butter to coat the outside while warm.  Cool before cutting.  Enjoy!<br /><br />For regular baking, you will have to look at a mix.

review/summary: Best GF bread mix at best price per pound
review/text: Let's face it: most store-bought gluten-free bread is absolutely terrible.  This is the best-tasting bread mix for making fresh gluten-free bread at home.  With this mix, I find that if I activate the yeast before mixing the dough and then keep the dough extra-warm after I shape it, I can get the loaf to rise just like wheat bread.  Priceless!<br /><br />It should be noted, however, this is *not* a good mix to use for pancakes or waffles, even if you add your own baking powder.  It is too starchy to make a good pancake or waffle, and it tends to stick to the pan or waffle iron even when plenty of oil is used.<br /><br />Update 12/25/2009: this mix is fantastic for pie crusts!

It does not require kneading, so it is faster than traditional breads.<br /><br />It does have ingredients that produce a slightly sweet taste, so lends itself to fruit & nut breads.  We have also been enhancing the nutrition by adding sunflower, pumpkin, and flax seeds in various stages of fine or chunky grind. A simple $12 coffee grinder does the trick. Add these after the other ingredients are mixed. Enjoy.

review/summary: Homemade bread, at last!
review/text: We've been making bread from this mix for over a month now.  I like it, my family likes it, and it's really not complicated or difficult to make.  It is a little sweeter than what you've come to expect from a loaf of bread, but not in any way is that a problem.  I find that toasting the slices at about twice the heat of normal bread does make it possible to use this for sandwiches, and it makes an AMAZING grilled cheese.  French toast was fantastic as well.<br /><br />We do bake the bread at a lower temperature for a longer time (325 for about 100 minutes) in order to try to get a good rise out of it.  Just know that the first couple of times you make the bread, it might not turn out great, but it doesn't take long to adapt the recipe to fit your needs.

With most other foods, I've managed to create recipes that are just as good as non-gf, but NOT with bread.  So I'll have to swallow my pride and bake from a mix. :) I'm really happy that its so healthy (most gf breads tend to be of the white empty carb type) and easy and delicious and that I can whip out 5 or 6 loaves of bread with only about half an hour of actual work!

review/summary: The best gf bread, hands down
review/text: We have tried many gluten free breads, this is by far the best. It has a very good flavor and is not crumbly unless it sits in the fridge forever, which it generally doesn't because all our kids love it.  It takes about five minutes to prepare, just throw the mix, yeast and a couple other things in the mixer...easy as a cake mix. And when you purchase this 25 lb bag it's inexpensive, FAR less than a purchased loaf at the store, which tastes gross anyway.  Works out to about $2.50 a loaf. Without this bulk size available we would not be able to have bread on our gf diet.

review/summary: Wonderful for Gluten-Free Baking
review/text: I recently purchased Pamela's Bread Mix in bulk and started using it immediately.  It was easy to use and the videos on her website give even more ideas.  Bread is a part of my diet so when I had to go gluten-free I needed to find my alternative and it is all here in one package.  Now I make a lof for myself and another for the family while it is hot!  Thanks, Pamela!

review/summary: Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix
review/text: I enjoy using this for bread - perfect every time.  .... and many other things - recipes at Pam's site.  But also can use it cup or quick bread/pancake/muffin stuff by mixing your own plain gf flours into it(oat, buckwheat, coconut...).  Pam's just makes it a little quicker/easier, since it's got most of the necessary gooey stuff already in it, at about twice the proportion you'd need for quick breads ... 1:2 proportion of bread mix and plain gf flours (just don't add any more goo stuff like xanthum gum and potato flour).

review/summary: Beautiful bread!
review/text: We have been gluten free for about 10 months.  Prior to this I had never baked  anything with yeast in it for fear that it wouldn't come out right.  Now, I refuse to pay for store-bought gluten free baked goods and so I must make my own.  But bread generally contains yeast, as does pizza dough and dinner rolls.  Pamela to the rescue!  The directions on the bag as well as the website are easy to follow even for a novice such as myself.  I have made several beautiful loaves of sandwich bread, cinnamon swirls, pizza and dinner rolls for Thanksgiving!  I am so grateful for an easy to use, tasty product.  I know that some felt the bread had an undesirable sweetness, but we have not noticed that and in fact used it for tuna sandwiches the other day.  I highly recommend this to anyone starting out on the gluten free journey.  I have also used it as an "all-purpose" gluten free flour in several cookie recipes with great success.  All-around winner for our family!<br /><br />ETA: We now use this as an all-purpose flour in many "regular" flour recipes and have not had any problems.  We have found the flavor of the bread to be bit flat.  To improve this, along with the water in the bread recipe, I add 3 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar.  This adds a bit of the sour flavor of regular bread.  To the pizza dough I add a bit of garlic salt and Italian seasoning.

review/text: This product is wonderful.  Gluten free bread is usually so bad - dry, tasteless.  Pamela's makes wonderful products that are so-o-o good.  This flour can be used for bread, pie crust, or pizza, among other things.  The pie crust is even better than the regular recipe I used to use.  We have not found any Pamela's product that is less than most satisfactory.  We will continue to buy these products.

review/summary: better than I thought
review/text: Three of us in our family of 6 needed to switch to a gluten free diet. Pamelas products especially the flour was a lot better than the other brands I tried. They are so expensive, I wished I would have had someone tell me to try this one 1st.  I use it for everything I need to use flour for.  I am making bread every couple of days using my once denouced bread maker.  My husband who won't go gluten free is eating all of my bread. I am also happier having the 25 bag handy rather than purchasing the little bags for $6 every couple of days. Buying it through Amazon the shipping was free which I really appreciated.

review/text: My family loves Pamela's bread mix.  I found I get the best price, usually, by buying in bulk.  I bought a large food grade container to hold it.  For my family with about 1-2 loaves a week the cost per loaf is in the $3.50 range now.  I do wish the price would stop increasing each time I purchase, but that seems to be the case with most things I buy anymore.  Amazon ship and save is incredibly easy and fast.  I love this service.

review/text: Need a wheat-free, dairy-free bread? This is it! I have allergies to wheat, dairy, nuts and corn. Finding bread I can eat in the stores is difficult, and when I do find them, they are expensive. You would never know this bread was wheat and dairy free unless someone told you. Its awesome! The only downside (for me) is that it contains xanthum gum, a corn derivative. Usually I don't react to it, but once in a while I get a little itchy. Otherwise, this is the best choice out there!

review/text: My Father recently went gluten free & I have been trying to help my Mom find things for him to eat. He ate lots of bread along w/ pies & other pastries so he was desperately missing his breads. So far he thinks this is the best tasting bread. I've tried it numerous times myself & like it. I would compare the texture to an english muffin bread. I've made pizza dough, bread and pumpkin pancakes w/ it so far & it's all been great! I'm going to try making pie crust soon.

review/summary: Lucky???
review/text: I have had the plant for three weeks and it is slowly dieing. Stalks are turning yellow, some are white.<br /><br />It was beautiful when I received it. I love the ceramic container with the frog. I have read and re-read the card that came with it to see if I was doing something wrong in my care. It said add water and keep out of direct sunlight. I even purchased the lucky bamboo plant food, but it's dieing. I'm very upset.<br /><br />The plant is in the bathroom where I had my previous lucky bamboo plant, a plant I had for 12 years, I bought it at a Jewell food store. The previous plant I just added water.....never gave it another thought. Our bathroom has a bamboo theme.<br /><br />I'm 63 and I quipped to my wife when we received this plant that it could possibly out-live us. Well, unless I die tomorrow, and yellow and white bamboo stalks can turn green again.....I was wrong about that assumption. I would steer away from products from this seller. The plant came in a USPS "IF IT FITS IT SHIPS" box, not really a professional packing and shipment container, to say the least.

review/text: I am, mathematically speaking, middle aged. My body is making some unauthorized changes but the worst has been the swollen ankles. I could not believe how big my ankles could get! I tried everything I heard of to try to slough off the water I retained, some of them quite unpleasant, and I feared that the second half of my life would involve serious cankles. This tea solved it. I drink a cup every day and have no more swollen ankles. I feel much better and now order it by the case. I might even get an ankle tattoo, something impossible just a few weeks ago.

This one is nice. I'm not sure how much it slims or suppresses appetite as he usually drinks it after he eats (I've told him a million times it's supposed to be the other way around). However we like drinking it nonetheless. Best price we've found is the bulk pack on Amazon.

review/summary: BE CAREFUL!!
review/text: Every person is different and therefore react differently to products. I bought this product last night. Well, I started drinking it from a mug tonight and just from 7-10 slow sips of it (it was hot) I threw up yellowish/greenish liquid stuff. Only liquids came out and it gave me a violent headache. Granted, it does taste good especially with two teaspoons of honey. But just about a half hour after those said sips, I was in my bathroom spewing not only the tea, but what seemed like tons of water/fluids. I have NO idea where all of the liquids came from given that I really have not eaten anything all day today (except for a cheese sandwich at 7am this morning and it is now 9:32pm) and I have only taken 7-10 small sips. This all happened within a matter of 25-30 min! :(<br /><br />I'm slowly recovering now because for some reason, it gave me a really bad headache as well. This may sound a bit over dramatic, but I kid you not, this is what just happened to me. :(<br /><br />If you're looking to lose some weight, your contents may spill out from your mouth and not from your behind. Good luck.

review/text: It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Citrus with Vitamin C flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It definitely has a serious citrus taste profile, though I guess that there might be a slight strawberry backbone in there somewhere. But boy, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice. My kids and co-workers can't get enough of this gum.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I agree with one of the other reviewers. My order was outdated (Oct 2011), but since the packages were well sealed I did not complain. The gum is fresh and I love the taste, although when chewing, it feels as if you should have two pieces going! A bit skimpy. I read that Vit C sugarless gum is supposed to be good for gum disease, so thought I would try it, although my gum disease is minimal. I will know more after my next dentist appointment. For the most part, I chew it after lunch and dinner. I love the taste!  Flavor is long-lasting, too.

review/text: I LOVE oatmeal but often don't find the time to make it at home, and I really don't like instant oatmeal (until now!). I would stop by McDonald's or Chick fil A occasionally for oatmeal, but that's an expensive habit at $1.99 to $2.59 a bowl.<br /><br />I found Abundance at a local big box retailer and it was on sale, so I tried it. It is absolutely delicious! Lower in sugar and salt than the regular microwave oatmeal too! Even those who don't like oatmeal should try it. I've tried Maple & Brown Sugar, which is tasty, and Apples & Cinnamon. I particularly like the Apples & Cinnamon. The apples are plump and taste like real apples. The addition of other grains gives the oatmeal a wonderful texture and contributes to a wholly satisfying meal.<br /><br />The measuring pouches are a nice touch; my workplace has bowls for our use, so I just tuck a few pouches into my lunchbag for use throughout the week. I don't have to worry about how much water, the measuring line on the pouch is very handy. Since I found Abundance, I've been eating oatmeal for breakfast nearly every morning.

review/text: I have to watch the sodium in my diet and came across Better Oats Abundance last year.  There are not many instant oatmeal products that are lower in sodium, so I was happy to find this one.  It has now become a staple in my house (as long as I can find it).  It is not as sweet as other instant oatmeal products, but if you like it sweeter you can just add some honey.  I have also tried the Maple and Brown Sugar but I think the Apples & Cinnamon is better.

review/text: So, I was looking for a healthier option than the oatmeal I was currently eating (market pantry apple/cinnamon reduced sugar). This product has half the salt of my previous brand, actually has 3g MORE sugar, but was not good at all. I even tried adding (at different times) honey, sugar, and syrup. None of these things helped. This product was completely unpalatable and inedible. I had other people try it and they had the same result.<br /><br />I have just come across a way to make this edible. Adding peanut butter, it's a simple fix but shows how it needs a complete flavor overhaul in order to be eaten. I normally love whole grains, I'm not a sugar addict, this product was just not good.

review/text: Better Oats has a real winner with their instant oatmeals:  not too sweet, genuine flavors.  Each package comes with it's own built in guide for measuring water and the oatmeal cooks in the microwave in two minutes.  We love this product in all flavors. Thanks Amazon for making it available to us.

review/summary: HFCS claim untrue.
review/text: Just received 3 gallons from amazon. Ingredients are as follows: distilled white vinegar, molasses, water, sugar, onions, anchovies, salt, garlic cloves, tamarind extract, natural flavorings, chili pepper extract. I am seeing no HFCS and these bottles are from New Jersey. I personally compared this to French's version which was found to be completely inferior to Lea and Perrins.

review/summary: Excellent General-Purpose Sauce.
review/text: Not too long ago, I picked up a two-pack of 15-ounce Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce at my local warehouse club store. It's been years since I had any of this product and, boy, does it taste delicious! I use it as a general-purpose flavoring agent on all sorts of things, not just steak. I even tried it with macaroni and cheese! It's an excellent additive for lots of dishes.<br /><br />It's billed as "The Original" Worcestershire Sauce and a lot of critics have pointed out that it uses high-fructose corn syrup rather than sugar in the recipe and, thus, is not the original recipe. Well that may be but I have no way to get the original formula from England so this American version will have to do. I'd like to try the English version, but, in the meantime, this American stuff is excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Worcestershire Sauce has much less sodium than Soy Sauce
review/text: Salt always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines.  Worcestershire Sauce gives me the benefit of Soy Sauce with less than one-fourth of the sodium.  As for the argument over high fructose corn syrup, diabetics would be much better off if pure fructose was used instead of pure table sugar (sucrose, cane sugar), which is half fructose plus half glucose.  Fructose is converted into glycogen in a person's liver and increases a diabetic's blood glucose only very slightly.  Glucose increases a diabetic's blood glucose very substantially.  Splenda (sucralose) would be the healthiest choice for everybody because it has no calories and does not increase a diabetic's blood glucose at all.  However, using Splenda might increase the cost slightly.  Soy Sauce tastes better than Worcestershire Sauce for some foods (sashimi, sushi) but Worcestershire Sauce tastes just as good as Soy Sauce for most foods.

review/summary: High fructose corn syrup
review/text: I had always bought Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce because I thought it was the original and the best.  Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS.

review/text: I ordered the chocolate, vanilla and strawberry/banana flavors. I love them all. As another reviewer mentioned, they came well packaged and frozen hard. I had to wait a while to try them. The vanilla is lovely. Very subtle flavor and not too sweet. It's not premium ice cream, but then I would never indulge in premium ice cream anyway. My calorie restrictions only allow for stuff like Skinny Cow and Arctic Zero is as good or better. I still find it amazing that I can eat a whole pint of this for less than 150 calories. Thank you Arctic Zero! I'll be a regular customer.

review/text: I bought this at a store down in Newport Beach a few weeks ago when I was visiting some family. This is some great stuff. The maple vanilla and chocolate peanut butter are my two favorite flavors. The chocolate and strawberry banana are good to, but these are my favorites. I usually like to eat it at night while I'm watching a movie. It's hard to feel guilty about eatting it since it's got less calories than a can of soda and it's fat free. The high protein content is an added plus too.

review/text: I loved the original formula for Arctic Zero, but as the company grew, they recently changed the formula and the great maple taste isn't quite there anymore.  However, at 150 calories per pint, it is still a decent dessert.  Of all the Arctic Zero flavors, this is still the best of the bunch.  It's not cheap, but is it a nice treat at the end of a long day.

review/summary: Calorie Count Hugely Undervalued Per Independent Testing
review/text: This product's label says that it contains 10 grams of carbohydrate (including 9 g sugars and 0 g fiber) and 5 g protein per half-cup serving. This should mean that it contains about 60 Calories, yet the label says it has only about half of that (34, for 150 Calories per pint). The manufacturer's website justifies the low Calorie count with a very scientific-sounding explanation of why the body will not absorb all the sugar, but there is no actual testing in humans or even mice to prove that this fairy tale actually matches reality.<br /><br />ABC's Today Show recently tested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002912506">Arctic Zero Maple Vanilla</a> along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002915VF2">Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter</a>, and found that "Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple had a whopping 46 percent more calories than the label. The Chocolate Peanut Butter: an incredible 68 percent more calories." If you do the math, 46% more Calories than 34 is 50 Calories -- a bit less than what you'd calculate from looking at the protein and carb, but still far more than the manufacturer claims.<br /><br />You can find the report by Googling "Rossen Reports: Can you believe diet frozen dessert labels?"

review/text: it's 136 calories for the whole pint!!! For anyone who knows ice cream, they know this is insanely low. (With most ice cream, the most you'll ever get from 136 calories is about 1/4 of a pint.) Anyway, I have had the maple vanilla flavor and the chocolate peanut butter. I prefer the maple vanilla but both are probably worth trying.<br /><br />A side note - as others have said, this doesn't exactly taste like real ice cream. It has a definite distinctive undertaste/aftertaste. Oh well. That's probably to be expected. Every once in a while I want to sit around and eat a pint of ice cream and nothing else will satisfies this want. When that time comes, this is the ice cream I'll reach for.

review/text: When you dig into it and let it melt in your mouth you can tell it's the xantham/locust-bean/guar gum at work.  That being said, this flavor is my favorite, because it really does have that maple taste.  If you can ignore the slightly gelatinous/slimy texture, this ice cream is for you.  Unfortunately, it's extremely expensive, and the cheapest I've seen so far is $3.99 a pint at Whole Foods.

review/summary: Greatest Invention in dieting
review/text: This stuff is simply amazing.  At first bite, it seems a bit bland, but after eating a little bit I forgot it wasn't regular ice cream.  If you try to eat it without letting it melt a little, it's rock hard and the texture is almost reminiscent of gelatin,but after a little melting it's just like any ice cream.  I particularly love this flavor.  I am a big maple fan, but this is mild enough that anyone who likes vanilla will probably like it too.  Great product!  I would recommend looking for it in stores before ordering online though, as it gets pretty expensive.

review/text: This was the 1st flavor I tried.  I purchased at my local store for WAY less money than Amazon is offering it for today!  $5.29 a pint locally.  However, Amazon does have a better selection of flavors available.<br />I have not eaten ice cream in years, the high fat upsets my stomach.  This a tasty treat for the person who does not have to have heavy fat and sugar content.  The only things that would make this product better is if it cost less and it was totally free of processed sugar.<br />Because of the cost this will only be a once in a while treat.  I do think I could eat a pint each day...

review/summary: Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple review
review/text: I first learned of Arctic Zero when I watched an episode of Dr. Oz last week.  I am not an ice-cream lover by any stretch but I am a health nut so I figured I would give it a try.  I bought my first Arctic Zero today, the vanilla maple, in a local grocery store.  I must say that I like it...4 stars.  I opened it right away when I got home and the texture was not hard, only just a bit icy but it spooned out quite easily.  I may let it sit out a few minutes next time to see if I get a creamy consistency. I DO NOT like sweet things and this was perfect for my taste buds.  Yes, it's not ice-cream, but I consider it a good substitute for us health nuts and others who are trying to stay on a diet.<br /><br />My local grocery store only had two flavours but I went to Whole Foods and got four additional flavours to try, both of which sell it for less than Amazon.  I would like to try all the other flavours so it would great if there were an option to mix and match any six, rather than a pre-determined mix...just a thought.  I would spend the additional $$$ to try the other flavours.

I loved it. Creamy and a bit gooey with a great vanilla flavor. Careful though! If it melts & refreezes (either in your care or before it got to you--as I believe was the case with one pint I bought), it will get an italian ice consistency, losing its creaminess.

review/text: I was having one of those days yesterday where no matter what I ate (staying within my Weight Watchers points, of course), I was hungry for more.  Everything seemed so small that it just wasn't enough!  Arctic Zero is really expensive, but it's a real diet-saver in this case.  It could have turned into an all-out binge, but it didn't because I was able to curl up with a pint of ice cream (for only 3 points) in front of the TV, and eat the whole darn thing for a whole hour.  And then, I was full, and I was ok!<br /><br />That's why I'm willing to shell out the $50 for this.  I just ordered another shipment yesterday.  I like the maple vanilla, but my husband doesn't.  We both like the chocolate, though.  It's really a matter of personal taste, I guess.

review/summary: The Best I've Found
review/text: I have to respectfully disagree with the previous review.  I've used many risotto rices and this is by far the best I've found.  It's flavorful and creamy.  I don't deviate much from the recipe on the box, and I find that I always get rave reviews from my guests.  Excellent product.

review/summary: Canaroli Rice
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W279DM">Carnaroli Riso di Molinella</a>  Very disappointing.  Did not come out creamy as expected even after adding plenty of chicken broth and stirring for a long time.

review/summary: Good stuff for desserts: know what you're getting.
review/text: This is the same review as at Whipped Peanut Spread 12 oz, and is the later, improved version of the product in the squat jars shown in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1Q1G8">Walden Farms Creamy Peanut Spread Calorie Free, Carb Free, Fat Free, Sugar Free</a>. The previous reviews for this product are one extreme or the other, I think probably for 2 reasons. First, the original "Creamy" version in the squat jars was kind of slimy and a bit weird; the newer one is improved in texture and taste. Second, this stuff has  a sweet, 'lite' taste like Reese's PB, so customers used to natural peanut butter or even Skippy, and expecting to use it to make a PB sandwich, probably don't care for it.<br /><br />By contrast, I think this stuff is great for low-Calorie peanut buttery desserts, like spread thin on low-Cal brownies or on fat-free ricotta with a drizzle of Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup (Low-Carb) 12 oz.<br /><br />Do be aware, however, that as with all Walden Farms products, this stuff DOES contain Calories: the zero Calorie labeling relies on the FDA's rounding rules (like all those products that claim 'zero trans fats' but contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils). Assume 3-4 Calories per labeled serving for all.

review/summary: Uh... Nope...
review/text: I like Walden Farms a LOT!  And I use their calorie-free concoctions with a relish.  However, this peanut spread is going to take more effort than I can muster.  The taste is way, way off.  Perhaps Walden Farms bit off more than it could chew with this peanut butter wanna-be.  Mind you, I haven't given up, and I plan to mix it with real PB to see whether I can make my own low-calorie peanut butter.  I might even mix it with my calorie-free fruit spread or my chocolate syrup.  I LOVE YOU, WALDEN FARMS, BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON THIS ONE.

review/summary: One of Our Dog's Favourite Toys
review/text: A very impressive toy. Our dog can chew his way through virtually anything, and is more than happy to have one of these, instead. It lasts forever, it doesn't chip or split, and our vet says that it's a great toy for a dog to exercise his gums and keep his teeth clean. Definitely one of the best buys on the market--it lasts almost a full year before it's just to disgusting to keep. High recommended.

review/summary: Isn't going to last long
review/text: So after reading all the reviews here we were excited to try another Nylabone for our Rottie who, putting it mildly, is a super aggressive chewer. He either has had or currently owns all of the largest Nylabones the company has to offer and we were happy to see the size of this one compared to his other large bones. Unfortunately the honeymoon didn't last long because within the first few hours of ownership he chewed off 1/4 of the green middle part. He starts with the nubs and gradually works his way onto larger chunks. He is always supervised with new toys and lucky for us he isn't a swallower of large chunks, although I'm sure we will find our fair share of green nubs in the yard tomorrow morning after his usual morning business - a nice little St. Paddy's day treat for us all! Oh yeah, it does smell pretty good overall as the mint hides some of the usual slobber stench so that's a plus as well.

review/summary: It is still a toy! After a month of getting absolutely knawed on!
review/text: My Rottie destroys toys of all kinds. Unbreakable, indestructible... Forget it ! He can CHEW! After a month, yes it looks gnawed, but the green band is still on it. It is his favorite toy to chew! It is loud w hen he drops it on the floor as it weighs a ton. But he loves to chew it in his crate! I highly recommend this for POWER or extreme chewers.

review/summary: Looks Boring to Me, but the Dogs Love It
review/text: I hesitated a long time before buying our first Nylabone chew toy.  They are moderately expensive and, frankly, don't look all that exciting.  But, the dogs love them.<br /><br />We have two Rhodesian Ridgebacks, one of which is quite a chewer.  He picks the Double Action Combo Bone (Souper size) to chew, hands down, over any other in his arsenal.  The toys do wear down eventually, but it takes a long time.<br /><br />We have two of these toys now and will replace with exactly the same model when they wear out.
