review/summary: Cattledog approved!
review/text: Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to "Go find".<br /><br />This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber "bars" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for "wait", "go find", "give" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.

review/summary: Not a challenge...
review/text: I wanted a new challenge for my terrier, and she figured this out in no time flat.  Then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits.  So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else.

review/summary: Dog snout doesnt fit!!
review/text: Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.

review/summary: Good toy, but not as challenging as wanted
review/text: I have a 4 year old Border Collie/Australian Cattle Dog mix, who is very food motivated.<br />I bought this toy after reading all the positive reviews from dog owners on this site.<br />A lot of the dogs referenced were Labs or Retrievers.. so I assumed this would be perfect for my pooch.<br />He figured it out rather quickly.. and even though he still loves to play it. Is done finding the treats in less than 2 mins. And if I am not right there with him (on the floor next to him), he will throw the toy around to just get the treats out.<br /><br />I will continue to use this toy with him, mostly to work on patience with him, but as far as "challenging" this toy did not prove effective.

review/text: Highly entertaining to watch.  Both of my dogs LOVE it.  The older one has a little more trouble with it,but he can do it!  He hasn't quit figured out that he has to move the yellow cups before the wheel will turn.  On the other hand my younger dog thought that removing the yellow cups WAS the game.  Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog.

review/text: I have put different treats under each of the yellow covers however, as hard as my dog tries she cant pull the yellow thing out of the hole.  I think the holes are too deep making it impossible for a small dog (she weighs 9) to get it out.  She was bored with trying after just a few minutes.  She was smart enough to know it wasnt coming out.

review/summary: Great Cognitive Toy
review/text: After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed/chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.

review/summary: a lil Large for the Small breeds
review/text: My morkie loves interactive games. Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, it is larger than I expected. As one of the other reviews stated, my small breed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.

review/summary: I'm not saying my dog's a genious, but.....
review/text: The layers spin very easily and my 5 year old female weimaraner cleared each slot of hidden treats in less than a minute. If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish. I even tried to use it to feed her dinner to slow her down, but that didn't work at all--she aligned it once and ate out of it like a bowl. Bummer, I spent over $20 for a piece of plastic that will end up in a landfill. Stick with frozen kongs...

That's an incredible length of time for her to spend on one activity. I'll be getting some more toys like this I think.

review/summary: Paw Flapper Fun, But Too Easy
review/text: I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles.

review/summary: Reviews for the Treat triad, Paw Hide, and Star Spinner
review/text: Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.

I stated with some yellow cups upside down (easier for her to grip them) with a few right side up.  She figured it all out very quickly.  It's lots of fun to watch her get the big yellow cups in her small grip, place them carefully all in one spot.  After a few times, she was able to grab all the cups placed in the red container the proper way.  She loves finding treats!

review/summary: Poorly constructed and designed
review/text: This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the "pegs" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is "buried") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.

review/summary: Moon Rover Rescue
review/text: This is a review for the Moon Rover Rescue toy.  While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.

review/summary: The Paw Hide is a great little toy.
review/text: Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!

review/summary: Good Toy
review/text: I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.

review/text: This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber "feet" on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work, he gets a treat.

review/summary: Nice, basic addition to the collection...
review/text: I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the "spin" and "flip" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a "cheater", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a "project in the works", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!

review/text: This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned.<br />I would not recomment this product.

review/summary: Not Much of a Puzzle
review/text: After the first go-round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a "sit" and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon-bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.

review/summary: 5 seconds flat
review/text: I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.

review/summary: Fun distraction for my toy poodle
review/text: My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically, this "toy" is really a puzzle for him to try to get the tennis ball out. It helps that my dog has small paws which can easily get inside the toy. Another benefit is the rubber is soft and is easily washable. It is particularly challenging for him to get the tennis ball

review/summary: Cattledogs love it!
review/text: This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, "Go find".  They love it, and will throw the "stump" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that "Go find" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.

review/summary: Too easily tipped
review/text: While I have been pleased with some of the Kyjen toys, this puzzle was a disappointment.  My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, "Are you kidding me?", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones.

Whenever i have guests i let rocky play with the moon ball and the rover. It keeps him occupied for hours. Its perfect for little dogs with lots of energy. Rocky has little paws that way he can stick his paws in the moon ball and retrieve the rover. Its easy to clean unlike other squeaky toys just wash with water and let dry and its ready to keep him occupied and lets me entertain my guests.

review/summary: My dog seems to like this puzzle
review/text: I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers. He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.

review/summary: Feedback from a pasta lover who has lived in Italy!
review/text: Okay, I'll admit it; I'm spoiled when it comes to pasta.  Having  lived in Italy for two years, my tastebuds found the 'real deal' and upon returning to the US, I've been searching for something even remotely approaching the velvety luciousness of a good Roman pasta product.  No dice.  Most pasta products I've tried end up a little too gluey/glutinous.  Other than the 'gourmet' brands which can be purchased via Dean & Deluca or similar outlets (for similar, mind-boggling prices) I've had to settle.<br /><br />Not anymore!<br /><br />My fiance' was diagnosed with Type2 diabetes a few years ago.  When we started dating, I began modifying my pantry accordingly, figuring it might not be such a bad idea for me to start watching my carbs as well.  I found Carba Nada while searching for a good pasta, which though low in carbs, might still *hopefully* taste even remotely like pasta, without that 'stewed tennis shoe' taste and texture (Think of Chaplain's famous scene, eating a boiled boot and twirling the shoelaces, a'la Romana).<br /><br />Skepticism turned to stunned disbelief - the taste is amazing, truly a wonderful, slightly egg-flour-y, slightly nutty and naturally buttery.  The texture is perfection, light and springy and never, 'shoe-lacy' chewy.  Top it with a bit of light butter, butter substitute, garlic and romano and you have heaven on Earth.  A bit of light-cream based alfredo sauce and you have pure Heaven.  Partner it full-tilt with your best hearty meat-based sauces and you are in Orbit-Houston-We-Have-Tastebud-Liftoff.<br /><br />Have I made it clear that this is truly GOOD stuff?<br /><br />put the water on, I'll get the cheese grater.<br /><br />Nancy Harding, St. Louis, MO.

review/summary: Spiked my Blood Glucose but Ultimately It's Worth It
review/text: The good:<br />1. This tastes really good to me. One of the better truly low carb pastas that I've tried.<br />2. So easy to cook - it only takes 5 minutes.<br />3. With regular pasta, I dislike al dente because it's usually too firm for my taste but with this, al dente is just right. It's not too firm and not mushy.<br />4. Only 24 grams of carbs + 6 grams of fiber and you get an entire 1.5 cups which is a much larger serving for way fewer carbs than regular pasta.<br />5. The subscribe and save price was very reasonable I felt and it's great to have it delivered right to your door.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1. Unfortunately this made my blood glucose rise from about 100 to about 150 within about 45 minutes of eating and it stayed up there for almost 90 minutes. Next time I eat this I'll know to exercise within 30 minutes or so of ingesting and I think that might take care of the blood glucose spike. Worth it to have some decent pasta.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that my husband had a bigger serving than I did and it didn't spike his blood glucose as many points as it did me most likely because he's more muscular and more active than I am.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars because I think it tastes really good, it has a good mouth feel, the price is reasonable and you get a good sized portion. Even though it spiked my blood glucose, I'm still going to keep this on the menu at least once a month.

review/summary: A GREAT LOWER CARB PASTA
review/text: If you're watching your carbs and miss egg noodles, Carba Nada is a good replacement. It isn't greatly low carb, but quite a bit less than regular pasta, so you need to watch serving sizes, but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well. The different flavours add more variety, and its also easy to toss with some butter, parmesan, and seasonings. Add leftover chicken or beef, and some vegetables, and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs.

review/text: I used to be able to buy this in a local grocery, but I moved to an area with far narrower shopping choices. However, this pasta is good enough that I have sought it out to order through Amazon. Lower-carb, higher-protein pasta that tastes excellent--the people in my new area love it,and although I just ordered a 6-pack, I can see that  I will soon need more. It's a great pasta staple, especially for more delicate dishes where a whole grain pasta would be a bit coarse--though I love whole-grain pasta, don't get me wrong. But this with just a bit of olive oil, garlic, basil, and fresh tomato and/or spinach--yum! Don't let this product go, Amazon! I need it!

review/summary: Best reduced carb pasta I've ever tried
review/text: I've tried many different low-carb pastas over the last 14 years. They all tasted like cardboard, didn't smell like pasta and disintegrated into grainy, pasty substance if even slightly overcooked (not that the texture was ever pasta-like to begin with). When I ordered the Carba-Nada, the most I had really hoped for was "edible" or that whatever funky grassy or cardboard-like flavors it might have could be masked with a bold sauce. The first surprise was that it smelled exactly like regular hard semolina pasta while boiling (I really love that smell!) I like my pasta al dente and this was most definitely al dente and sturdy like a good pasta should be. I ate a few strands right out of the pot with nothing on them and was surprised at how much I liked it. Bonus: With all that extra protein and fiber in it, I was more stuffed eating what's considered 2 servings (4 dry ounces, like "regular" pasta) than I've ever been with the same amount of "regular" pasta but the Carba-Nada has fewer calories. I saved even more calories because I didn't need to add a protein to my dinner. There's already plenty of protein in the Carba-Nada pasta itself. The best basic pantry item I've found in years.

I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta. I am happy that another low carb pasta is available for purchase for it is to my advantage to eat the low carb pasta. The last time I had regular pasta was a long time ago. Between the two pastas mentioned above I no longer feel I am missing much. 4 Stars!

review/summary: Fantastic!!!
review/text: I have a disabled son who is a very brittle insulin dependent diabetic, who loves food.  Now I can give him his pasta dishes and in a regular sized portion, not some dinky serving. Also one of the great things about the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine is that it's also high in protien.  This is one of the most perfect pastas ever.  I have even started eating it.  I can cook a whole bag, sprinkle it with olive or grape seed oil and refrigerate it and just add sauce or whatever I want to it.  It's good for a few days like this. I am very pleased with the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine.

review/summary: just awful
review/text: loving fettuccine and being diabetic i have been looking for a fettuccine i could eat,i was so excited when i saw this product on amazon,i purchased the 6 bag package of Al Dent-Carba Nada,i cant express my disappointment when i cooked it for dinner,stating it was awful is an understatement....It tasted like i was eating a cardboard box and no matter how much cheese i put on it didn't help the flavor.  I am now stuck with 5 1/2 bags and a big waste of my hard earned money.  Do I recommend this product......NOT in a million years save your money.  hopefully i will find a flavorful product and soon.<br /><br />Anyone need 5 1/2 bags of....insulation.......  j.sorenson

review/text: BEWARE the changing descriptions here in Amazon folks...when I first viewed this item, admittedly a convenient item to have in the pantry for a snowy day, the descriptions was for THIRTY-TWO (32) 1 quart (32-oz) cartons for around $33...NOT 12 cartons as the description NOW reads. I thought a dollar per carton was a pretty good price, but I NEVER would have ordered it at almost 3 dollars a carton...that's highway robbery.<br /><br />I am going to complain to Amazon, don't expect to get any satisfaction, but will try anyway.<br /><br />So be careful: anytime something here in Amazon sounds too good to be true it probably is.

They are definitely a crust crumb, and not to be added into meatloaf.  If you like Panko bread crumbs, but want whole grain, you have to try these!

review/summary: Surprisingly Good...
review/text: I became familiar with this powder, as well as many other dry products from Barry Farms, when my son was little and we were involved in scouting together.  Even years after he left the scouts I remained involved at the large regional camp here for the boy scouts teaching survival training. And I still do a lot of hiking and camping on my own. Powdered spices, veggies, cheeses, bullion, and various stocks were a staple item on camping trips due to their convenience.  Some of the dry wares were much better than others.  This tomato powder was definitely one that turned out to be consistently convenient and tasty, and thus worthy of recommending.  We used it when we made stews and soups and it added a flavorful tomato taste to the various broths and stocks.  I would not recommend this product for making tomato soup since its rather costly, and besides, dried soups are easy and cheap for taking along on a hike.  It is best used in enriching the flavor of a soup or stew, whether it be a ready made mix, or one you are making from stock.  It is very rich and surprisingly good.  I took one star off for it is a little costly for only the 2 oz. you get.  But for what its designed for, it is worth the price since you don't use all that much at once.  As I have stated in my other reviews of dried foods like Barry Farm brands, there will always be a core group of consumers that would never give a favorable nod to a powdered food substitute of any kind.  This powder is definitely not going to remind you of the old home days of native tomato's from Grammas back yard for sure.  If you feel you are one of those that never considered a dry substitute of any kind real food, trust me that this is no time to start feeling like Daniel Boone by trying out this powder.  However if you are one that does a lot of hiking and camping where cooking your own meals over an open fire is a big part of that experience, by all means this tasty powder would greatly enliven that experience.  Just remember its rather strong, and expensive, so use sparingly.  Recommended...

review/summary: Crammed full of Sugar - 21g per serving, 168g per can
review/text: I spent days trying to find decent mango puree in order to make mango shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every mango puree I look at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. 21 grams of sugar per serving, and an amazing 168 grams for the entire can. An average can of soda contains 45 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened mango puree, but I can't find it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Nice and creamy, good product from good fruit. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet fruit! There IS a market for unsweetened fruit, guys.

review/text: I have purchased this item in a larger can before and it is great mango pulp for cooking, desserts, etc.<br /><br />One of the six cans had a huge dent and it would have been obvious before pack was placed in shipping box.  Items were packaged very well so I don't see how this could have happened during shipping since the outside box had no signs of damage.  It is too much of a hassle to return all 6 cans because of one damaged can.  And I need one can for mango cupcakes that I'm making this weekend.  Due to anosmia, the dented can will probably be thrown away because I can't tell if it is good or bad.  I will probably not purchase this item again from Amazon and will buy locally if I can find it.

review/text: Spearmint Lifesavers have been my favorite for many years, and I've been buying them in bulk from Amazon because they're so hard to find in stores. I just opened a new shipment today and ate one, and it tasted terrible!  I thought perhaps I had received a different flavor by mistake, but when I looked at the label, it said "spearomint."  Then I noticed "New & Improved Flavor." What a joke.  The old flavor was delicious, and this one tastes just awful. This isn't just a minor difference.  There's no spearmint flavor at all, just a chemical taste and even worse after taste.  The ingredients are the same (sugar, corn syrup, natural flavor, stearic acid), so it must be the "natural flavor" which doesn't taste like anything natural to me. I have one old roll left, and I guess I'll have to really savor the flavor I love for the last time.

review/summary: Great Deal on a Favorite Flavor - but many are crushed
review/text: This is one of my favorite Life Savers flavors, and like almost all flavors, it has gotten hard to find it locally.<br /><br />I rarely see the roll version of anything other than Pep-O-Mint and Wint-O-Green. Remember the days when you could go into a store and find tons of Life Savers? Berry (was it called Mixed Berries or Wild Berry?), Tropical Fruits, Fancy Fruits, Wild Cherry, Butter Rum ... the original Five Flavor mix, and two of my long-gone favorites: Butter Mint and Tangerine! I really miss those days!<br /><br />I can still find the Butter Rum and Wild Cherry at my local pharmacy. They're both better for soothing a scratchy throat than any cough drop that they sell, so it makes sense that they'd have them there. In the supermarket I can often find them both - plus the new version of the Five Flavor mix (which isn't as good as the original), but these are individually wrapped candy in bags. They are bigger than the roll version, and I prefer the rolls.<br /><br />There was a gas station in my area that sold these Spear-O-Mint rolls, but they stopped about a year ago. I am so happy to have found a source for them here at Amazon. YIPPEE! Now if only they'd come back with the Tangerine and Butter Mint! I can't understand how the convenience store shelves can contain 100 different types of super mints (I can't stand the overpoweringly strong mints and gums sold today), but not make room for old fashioned, traditional Life Savers!<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />UPDATE:<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br /><br />I had originally given this product 5 stars, but I have now had to lower the rating to just 3 stars. I've opened six rolls of the Life Savers and three of them have contained completely crushed candies. Each mint is broken into 4-6 chunks and a bunch of minty powder. What a mess! Even the three that were not completely broken, were at least partially broken.<br /><br />The package seemed to be in good shape when it arrived with no signs of damage, so one can only assume that this damage was done before the product was shipped. I don't know how the remaining 14 rolls will size up, but it's not looking hopeful.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this product, and now I am so disappointed.<br /><br /># # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #<br />FURTHER UPDATE:<br /># # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #<br /><br />I've now opened just about all of the rolls of Life Savers and every single roll (other than the first three good ones mentioned above) contained broken candy. Most were completely shattered or contained about 80% broken candy. Just a few rolls contained at least half unbroken candy. As I've said, the packaging was not damaged at all, so these were obviously broken before they were shipped out. Most likely, they were stored and/or handled improperly.<br /><br />Oh well. I guess that Life Savers are getting to be thing of the past. You can hardly find good flavors locally, and obviously mail order is not an option. This sure was a pricy lesson for me.

review/summary: new and improved flavor is AWFUL!!
review/text: UPDATE:  My original review is below this update. but if you are looking for the original Spear O Mint flavor (which is great), these are now the "new and improved" flavor which is terrible.  It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like "conspicuously strong mints" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the "new and [not] improved" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their "taste tests" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]<br />These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.  I hate sugarless products and the associated throat dryness that comes with consuming them.<br />These are great tasting, sweetened with sugar, and also seem to act as an upset stomach reliever.

review/text: I have had trouble finding these spearmint flavored lifesavers at my local stores. They are good tasting to me, but are only lifesavers. When buying 20 of them I'd hoped, though, that it would be less expensive .. I think it worked out to over $0.70 a roll

review/summary: Best flavor
review/text: You cannot seem to find the little rolls of life savers around anymore.  Or if stores do carry the rolls, they only carry one or two flavors.  Wintergreen is good but spearmint is my absolute favorite!  The candy came fresh and unbroken.  Easiest way to keep up my life saver supply.

review/summary: Life Savers Continues a Great Product
review/text: The same great taste! I looked for Life Savers in several stores.<br />Apparently Live Savers do not sell well enough for stores to stock them anymore. But, Good ole Amazon came through with all the flavors and excellent pricing.

review/summary: great for older lab, she is like a puppy again
review/text: My 11 year old lab "Stella", loves to run, play, hunt. She started getting arthritis in her hips and the vet said. glucomsumine and condroitan (sorry about the spelling).  I found food called "good hips" on amazon and tried it. Then I found these treats at the local grocery store. Then they quit selling them. I looked everywhere and found them on Amazon.  I subscribe to the dog food from Amazon.  Stella is like a puppy again!  I recommend these items for anyone with a larger or older dog, it really makes a huge difference in the quality of life of our best furry friends. Stella thanks you!

review/summary: Heaven in your mouth
review/text: Oh my god these shells and white cheddar cheese are glorious. You really should buy CASES of these, they are so delicious. If you have a hearty appetite, this "family size" will serve one just fine. I can't get over how amazing it tastes. Not only that, but for this recipe the shells are perfect - they hold the flavor MAGNIFICENTLY! It only takes minutes to prepare. And be ready: you may begin shedding tears of joy once you place a spoonful in your mouth - it is THAT good. Plus it's organic if that's important to you.

review/summary: Best I've found...
review/text: For organic mac 'n cheese, this is the best so far.  Could be a bit cheesier or flavorful though.  Package size is perfect for this family of four (2 adults, 2 teen boys) and I make it as a side dish with a meat and usually broccoli, which complements it well.  To perk it up, I sometimes cook as directed then bake in over with a little shredded cheese and bread crumbs on top.  Yum.

review/text: For the eco-friendly, anti-corporate, slacker "freegan", this is the ultimate bachelor grub.<br /><br />Make it with soy milk and ground veggie burger crumbles for a sweet meal.

review/summary: Love it!  But don't love the price increase.
review/text: My only complaint is that it could come with a *little* more cheese, and I could also do without seeing the word "manure" on the back of the box...that's not necessarily something I want to think about when I'm about to eat!<br /><br />EDIT 10/30/11: One year ago I placed multiple orders of this stuff for $12.97 per 6-pack (S&S price).  Now they're asking $21 for it with S&S!?  I understand there is some inflation in food prices lately, but a 62% increase??  For some dried pasta shells and a packet of cheese powder, gimme a break.  Out of control!!!  For this reason I'm knocking my 5* review down to 3* and I've placed my last order for this stuff.  It was fun while it lasted, Annie!  Pigs get slaughtered.

review/text: These taste awesome, but it is a pain to unwrap every single one. I do like these better than the other sour belts on here that are not wrapped though.

review/summary: Really yummy!
review/text: I am enjoying eating this candy. The packaging is a little wasteful (individually wrapped). However, for this candy it is a good idea because the sour sugar grains would make a huge mess if you wanted to travel with some of these. This candy is not that bad for you compared to a lot of other candies because it doesn't have any trans fat (no partially hydrogenated oils). Other candies might still have it even if it lists 0g because they are allowed to write 0g of trans fat if the candy contains less than 0.5g per serving of trans fat.
