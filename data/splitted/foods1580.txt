review/text: The chips are awesome! However, there should be between 12 and 24 bags per case. 6 bags for the price is over priced. I only ordered the chips because my wife loves them and we have to travel too far to purchase them. On the upside, the chips are great!

review/summary: Healthy, Crunchy, Tasty, Great!
review/text: These mango chips are quite yummy.  They're a MUCH healthier alternative to potato chips, plus they taste great.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Small bags so they don't get stale.<br />- No added sugar, preservatives, or artificial flavors/colors.<br />- Crunchy without being overly hard.<br />- Full of flavor.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Not organic.<br />- Expensive.<br />- Makes fingers sticky.<br /><br />These are great if you're willing to spend the money.

review/summary: A very tasty (& healthier) snack!
review/text: Finally, I found a snack with REAL (& under 5) ingredients & with no preservatives! I tried Coconut & Pineapple chips so far, and loved both. A bit expensive for the size - I get them at the local shop for $4 a bag! This makes me pause & wonder whether to get actual fruit instead. However, for the days when I feel like skipping on healthy food & go for chips, these are awesome!<br /><br />PS: 4 stars because price is too high.

review/summary: Tastes wonderful - but....
review/text: These taste wonderful - on the flavor I have no complaints at all... afterall, I love coconut and that's why I made this purchase - these were meant to be a tasty and healthful little snack for the kids and I. I do, however, want to let others know that the amount per package is really small, the pieces are also not very large (after a short time of nibbling you almost feel as though you should have just bought a package of shredded coconut from the local market and toasted it in your oven... or even had purchased a fresh coconut)... as far as "bang for your buck" these got a thumbs down for me. I have no problem spending more money for healthy goods for my family, I see it as a very worthy splurge - but, these left me disappointed... bag full of air and a small palm-ful of toasted coconut...  :(

review/text: I was so excited for durian chips because I love durian fruit.  But these just taste like regular potato chips.  Absolutely NO indication that they are actually durian at all!  Considering durian has a very strong, distinct smell, and these chips have absolutely no trace of this smell, I'm pretty sure it's just potato.  What a huge disappointment.  And no returns??  never again.  DO not buy!!

review/text: so i purchased the mango and coconut just based on the other reviews, as people said they were so amazing, addictive etc.<br />i was looking for a yummy, relatively guilt free snack, and thought these might be perfect.<br /><br />ok. so i just tried both of them. the coconut is fine. nothing i'm excited to have to ever taste again but definitely better than the<br />typical 99cent variety that you typically find. i will try to put these in my kids lunch boxes and hopefully they will get eaten over time.<br />best case scenario.<br /><br />as to the mango-blech! really people? you LIKE these??! they are puffed up, and look like "mango fries" which sounds better than they<br />taste. these are simply gross and i know that even my kids never want to eat these--so these are a big, expensive, gross lesson, as these<br />go in the garbage.<br /><br />save your money, this stuff is nasty.

review/text: Way too salty for me.  I will give that my tolerance for salt is particularly low and there are very few chips that taste like anything other than a salt lick to me, but this was particularly bad. The barbecue flavor was strong enough to come through a little, but it was definitely a punch in the mouth and my tongue still hasn't forgiven me.

review/summary: Udi's Gluten Free
review/text: We've tried both the Udi's Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins and the Lemon Muffins.  The muffins are amazing.  The only negative I can come up with for this product is the amount of sugar used on the topping.  Other than that, this is the only muffin product I would buy.  We did try some other brands and they were absolutely horrible!!  If you're on a gluten free diet, give these a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Leave them in the freezer and take one out as needed.  WONDERFUL!!

review/summary: TO DIE FOR!!  BEST EVER-TOTALLY AMAZING!
review/text: I have been gluten free for 13 years, and am so happy that there is so much more out there to eat. The fact that General Mills reformulated Chex to make them GF is fabulous!  First main stream company to realize the huge need for GF products; hopefully many more will follow their lead!<br /><br /> I just tried Udi's products, and these Blueberry muffins are FANTASTIC!!  I can't believe that they are dairy free as well!  Most GF bread products have to be heated, or toasted to be edible-these are perfect right out of the package!  I dare anyone to be able to tell that they are gluten free!  Totally moist, flavorful, and filling.  My only issue is the expense-$2/muffin is outrageous, and the cost will prohibit many celiacs from enjoying Udi's products. I know that they will be a rare treat for me, although I keep thinking about them because they are the best gf product I have EVER ate!  Great job UDI'S, now just make them affordable.

review/summary: Good but not Great
review/text: Honestly these weren't bad but they weren't to die for.  First off there is no preparation instructions on the package(or the Udi website) which immediately I took away points for. I defrosted (take them out of the freezer and leave them out for 2-3 hours, I put them in the fridge the night before) then I put them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes. The texture looks like regular muffins but the sugar on the top is too much and went over to one side. The flavor is ok, but homemade ones taste better if you have a recipe you like. Overall I wasn't wowed by them and won't buy them again on the other hand the Udi Cinnamon Buns are really good.

review/text: These blueberry muffins are Delicious. A friend bought them for me as I've recently tested positive for Celiac. They are soooo good I ate all 4 in 24 hours! I will pace myself the next time. lol. I sprinkle a bit of lemon juice on them, a pat of dairy free butter, and heat in the microwave for 20 seconds. Heaven.<br /><br />Perfect for breakfast or late night snack. So glad they are available. They are kind of expensive but muffins at our local health food store are over $2 a piece so in that comparison I guess they win.<br /><br />Also, if I were to buy all of the alternative flour mixes and blueberries, it would have cost much more to make them myself.<br /><br />These are definitely going on the regular grocery list.

review/text: If you are on a gluten free diet, hell, even if you're not; these muffins are absolutely amazing. Not only are they gluten free, but they don't have milk in them either. A lot of times milk is in gluten free foods which makes its a no-go for me, so I'm glad that these muffins don't have either ingredient. To sum things up, if you haven't tried these, try them. You won't be sorry.

review/text: To be honest, I don't think I've tried these. Gluten-free products are just so rare [and expensive -- and usually horrible] that if I find them, I reserve them exclusively for my husband. But whenever these come in the house, I have to find a 'distraction food' for my daughter [age 7] so she'll leave daddy's muffins alone! He loves Udi's bagels too -- for sandwiches, since the normal gluten free breads are so weird [Udi's bread is okay, but the bagels are actually good -- I'm told].

review/text: I'm a baker with a child who must not eat gluten (ironic, I know). But as a baker, it's been really tough to come up with something GF that has the mouth feel and flavor of either home baked or store bought bread and muffin products. Udi's products have solved that issue. The bread tastes like real bread, and doesn't break when you make a sandwich or bite into it. The muffins are so good that you wouldn't guess they are gluten free (they actually have crumbs!)--particularly if you've been trying other gluten free products out there. I highly recommend Udi's products!

AND there's NO ASSORTMENT to speak of, both bags consisted primarily of OLD, busted up Reese's cups, with a few Reeses's Pieces & Reeses's Fastbreak bars intermingled.  The ONLY edible product were the 6-8 Reese's Pieces mini bags, the Fastbreak bars were "DUST" & the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were covered with a whitish powdery film, (this happens when candy/chocolate is "OLD" and/or out-lived it shelf-life!)  DON'T waste your money, it's bargain priced for a reason, it's OLD, CRUMBLED, and tastes TERRIBLE!

review/text: Vernor's.  VERNOR'S!  If you grew up in Michigan, or even lived there for a while, you've probably seen it.  Here in NC, when I ask for it people look at me like...well, like a Yankee.<br /><br />Canada Dry might be a bigger brand.  Schewppe's might be better-known.<br /><br />Canada Dry and Schweppe's are sugar water.  They're not ginger ale.  You want ginger ale, you want Vernor's.<br /><br />I sound like an advertisement.  I should be.  I am.  This stuff is wonderful.  It boggles my mind that Vernor's is not a national brand; I figure the other manufacturers must be paying them to not compete, because those other kids know:  if Vernor's had the kind of distribution and availability that those other alleged ginger ales have, those other alleged ginger ales would have to be removed from the market.<br /><br />I don't have any real knowledge of this, in fact I'm making it up as I type, but I have a pet conspiracy theory (that I made up, just now) that the whole reason Cadbury/Schweppe's bought the Vernor's brand was so if worse came to worst, they could always change the name of the place to Cadbury/Vernor's.<br /><br />Spicy, bubbly, with a ginger-and-vanilla-and-who-cares-what-else mix of flavors aged for four years in wooden barrels, Vernor's is the oldest soda in the US, and it's still the best.<br /><br />All over the world, people drink 7-up for an upset stomach; in Michigan, we drink Vernor's.  People make root beer or 7-up or sprite 'floats,' with vanilla ice cream.  In Michigan, it's Vernor's and Hudsonville.  During the holiday season, some people have egg nog; we have warm Vernor's.  Some people have spiced cider; we have warm Vernor's.  Some people drink rum and Coke; we drink rum and Vernor's.<br /><br />Some soft drink connoisseurs suggest that the taste of Vernor's is closer to some very small, regional, 'hot' ginger beers.  I've had a few of these myself, and while they're not bad...they're not Vernor's.  Certainly, if you think the national brands are how ginger ale is supposed to taste...well you, my friend, are grievously misled by the propaganda of the anti-Vernor's cabal.  Fortunately, I am here to save you, rip those blinders off your tongue (have a mixed metaphor) and show you the One True Path Of Ginger Aleightenment...the Path, of VERNOR'S.<br /><br />It is my eternal torment that even in this age of YouTube and Amazon.Com, I cannot find for my life a copy of a Christmas television commercial from the 1980's for Vernor's featuring Paul Stanley from KISS.  All you see is a goblet of Vernor's being passed from hand to hand, down a line, all beautiful hands with long nails and red polish, and the goblet is handed to Mr. Stanley, who looks dead at the camera and says (as only He can):  "You warm your Vernor's your way...and I'll warm my Vernor's...MY way."  That's some classic 80's regional advertising right there.<br /><br />I digress.  Vernor's!  It cures cancer!  It will bring you closer in spirit and action to the deity of your choosing!  It will reverse the aging process!  Take two inches off your waistline!  Stop spam e-mail in its tracks!  Ensure that the next federal election brings us true leaders of vision, courage, wisdom, and honor!  It endows all parents with patience, all children with obedience, all husbands with virility and courage, all wives with allure and wit!  Why, I bet if we sent a crate of this stuff to those ol' Osama bin Laden, he'd just surrender to get his hands on more!<br /><br />That's it.  That's IT!  Send cases of Vernor's to all the government, religious, and social leaders of the world, and it's a sure thing that we won't have to 'Imagine' world peace anymore!  Why, those antagonistic ol' dictators and politicians, insurgents, guerillas, rebels, factions, warlords, and the like will be so busy giggling at the bubbles in their noses they won't be able to THINK about war!  THAT'S RIGHT!  VERNOR'S IS THE KEY TO WORLD PEACE!!!11!1!<br /><br />*looks around and realizes the entire room has gone dead quiet*<br /><br />*ahem*<br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not the key to world peace.  But it's the best darn soda I've ever had.  It's next-to-impossible to find here in NC - although I notice someone has *finally* started distributing Squirt here - in fact, I can't say that I've ever seen it here.  My mom still has a bottle or two - GLASS, 20OZ BOTTLES WITH METAL SCREW-TOP CAPS - stashed in a hole someplace, but that's it.  Thank heaven for Amazon's new grocery item selection; they're far better priced than the small handful of other online distributors.<br /><br />Vernor's:  It really IS The One Of A Kind Soft Drink, With A One Of A Kind Taste.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  Neither I nor anyone close to me is employed by Vernor's, Cadbury-Schweppe's, Coca-Cola, Amazon.Com, or any other trademark holder mentioned in this review.

review/summary: Accept No Substitute
review/text: As a Chicagoan raised by Detroiters, I can guarantee you this is the best ginger ale in the world.<br /><br />My only warning; once you drink it you will likely not be able to tolerate the other brands again. This beverage has substance. It has bubbles that will make you sneeze. It stands up to bourbon and it laughs at ice. It might have supernatural properties as well - if I ever get a cold or flu and can't get any Vernor's &lt;knock on wood>, it might never clear up.I now live in New York; because I'm fed up with the other brands that are so very pale in comparison (pun intended) I will now proceed to spend more than is humanly reasonable on a non-alcoholic beverage because I want, I need, I must have some Vernor's and I can't wait until the holidays to get it. My husband didn't understand, he's from California. He has since been shown the way of the Vernor's, so when this case arrives I will have to hide it in the compost bin where he won't find it.<br /><br />John Henry, I tip my hat to your brilliant ode. And you, Vernor's, with your whimsical green and gold can and your spicy amber bubbles - you are the stuff of legends. I shake my fist at your strictly local distribution but admit in the same breath; only you would I spend $3 a bottle for.<br /><br />Please come to New York. I'm lonely and homesick without you.

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 , no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

I remember how it used to tickle my nose and make me sneeze.  It was great to still be able to enjoy that great taste, there is nothing that compares.  When my brother opened the box he laughed out loud, something he hasn't done in a long time... it seems he had just mentioned this product to someone a few weeks before and never expected to see it.<br />I ordered two eight-packs.  Only one showed up before Christmas and the other was apparently lost in delivery.  I notified the seller who was gracious enough to replace the missing eight-pack.

review/summary: Vernor's, they put the GINGER in Ginger Ale
review/text: I visited a pub in a neighboring city back in 1987 who had Vernor's on tap.  When I sampled this ginger ale, I completely gave up Canada Dry, on which I had been raised.  The strong (but not overpowering) presence of the ginger flavor reminded me of the old-fashioned soda fountain style sodas where the syrup and carbonated water never mixed until they were put in your glass.  This is what Vernor's is like for me.  Although the diet version is not as tasty to me, I drink the "fully leaded" version sparingly since it is heavy in calories.  Still, I think it is the ginger ale by which all others should be measured.  And yes, the bottled version tastes better than the canned.

review/summary: Vernors ginger ale
review/text: For a native Detroiter or anyone who has been lucky enough to taste Vernors it's the best pop/soda drink ever. Vernors is a ginger beer that's been around since the turn of the 20th century and was made in Detroit. It's refreshing and spicy and like nothing one has tasted with the closest thing I can think of being Jamaican Ginger beer which to me isn't as good as Vernors.  The fact that the companies  who now own it have done nothing to market it to a mass market is amazing to me.  You can't even buy it at the Det airport as the other- retailers that have the lease for selling pop/soda in the airport don't own Vernors.  It's wonderful to have retailers like Amazon who will ship it to you when you cannot find it in stores where you live outside MI. What a wonderful surprise to discover Amazon has several sellers that will send Vernors to you.  Thanks Amazon for your worldwide understanding of what people want.

At the lobby of this 5-star hotel where I was staying, a smiling hotel employee at the front desk handed me a beverage.  One sip of this cold, refreshing, drink and I just had to ask what it was.  It tasted like freshly squeezed lemonade, without the tartness or after-taste of sweetener. She then left and came back with this bottle of Teisseire Lime from France, a product which I was not familiar with.  I insisted on buying an unopened bottle to bring back home.  Upon returning to the USA, I immediately hunted for this product and found it on Amazon.  I promptly order several bottles in Lime, Strawberry, and Grapefruit flavors.

review/summary: What the drug wars are REALLY over.
review/text: I hate onions on their own, or as a topping on my burgers and sandwiches, and yet I love onion rings. When it comes to potato chips, I usually prefer the Baked line of Lays and Cheetos, or stick with basic reduced fat Pringles. Funyuns just never appealed to me for the longest time. When I was in high school, a few of my friends always ate these things before classes started, and then another bag at lunch time. Any food with the word 'fun' in the name sounded desperate to me, so I never tried them until a few years ago when a security guard at work literally appeared out of nowhere and went 'HEY MAN, WANT SOME FUNYUNS?', holding the bag out directly in front of my face. I felt like one of those kids in the drug program booklets about peer pressure. Since I was new to the job and didn't want to leave a bad first impression, I grabbed the bag, and the dude instantly took off just as abruptly as he had appeared. I took a single Funyun out of the bag, took a small bite, and fell in love. These are tied for the title of my favorite chip, side-by-side with the Riceworks Salsa Fresca that I discovered 2 or 3 years ago. Funyuns are sweet, tangy, have the right amount of salt, and eating just one small bag doesn't leave you feeling like you had too many.<br /><br />Normally I tend to eat healthy stuff, but when I see a bag of Funyuns sitting out, that sucker's toast. Come to think of it, I haven't bought any other chips aside from these and the Riceworks ones since I first had them. That security guard had to be some kind of undercover advertising agent for the manufacturer, because -no one- should just be giving bags of these things away. They even have the satisfaction guarantee where if you don't like 'em, you can get your money back. If you still haven't tried these, go get a little bag at your nearest convenience store immediately.

review/text: Oh how I love Funyuns. While I don't like onion rings and I don't enjoy onions on my food, Funyuns are totally different. They are in an onion shape, but with great unique flavor.<br /><br />I enjoy how light they are and you don't end up with a miserable greasy feeling after you've eaten them. You can literally eat a whole bag and not feel horrible afterwards because of how light and crunchy they are. They are like popcorn in that some people like them fresh and some like them after they the bag has been opened and they are a little stale. I like them best after the bag has been opened a day, but the problem is they never last that long! We always end up eating them all right away.<br /><br />If you've never tried Funyuns I definitely recommend them. Even kids love them too. Don't be fooled by the name, they are far more than just an onion flavored chip.

review/text: I seem to have entered my green tea "wave".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner.

review/summary: Great taste but way too expensive
review/text: I love the Kombucha Wonder Drink brand, especially the essence of lemon, and thought perhaps I could get it for less on Amazon than at the speciality grocery store.  No such luck.  It's $3.99 each at the grocery store, and almost $5 a bottle here.  Why or why must it be so expensive?  I'm trying to drink this instead of Dt. Coke but the cost makes me think twice.  But if you can't find it in your stores and don't mind the expense, I highly recommend the product.

review/summary: Everyone loves this coffee
review/text: Picked up the Donut Shop blend K cups after getting a couple in a sample mix, these were the first to go.  It's a med-bold blend, not wimpy but not overpowering. Great hot or iced, also provides a good base if you are using a Mocha or Hot Chocolate K cup to make your own blends like we do.<br /><br />Family came in to visit and this coffee was the overwhelming favorite.  We have the Keurig Platinum and brew on the 6 oz (med) setting, which allowed for cream and or sugar to be added and a nice coffee flavor to remain. I think it would be a bit weak if you used the larger settings, but we like stronger coffees. The warehouse pack turns out to be more affordable than anything I've found locally.

review/text: We have been enjoying this coffee..rich bold flavor...with family and friends.  Only downside is the K cups that are not recyclable, and we do re-use with other coffee to put fewer into landfill.  I wish they could solve the recycle problem, because it is excellent coffee.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/text: My dog took to these dental sticks the moment I introduced one to him. His breath smells the same as the dental sticks themselves, which is better than how it used to smell. Also, this product gets sort of messy. It might have been because of the saliva that was on the dental stick as he chewed one, but it left marks on the couch (the marks were easy to clean but I'm going to make sure he chews them on the tile floor or the rug instead). Overall, my dog loves them so I will continue being a Get Naked customer.

review/text: I started these in cardboard egg crates last spring, then transplanted in my back yard garden.  The stalks were HUGE - be sure to have something to stake them to.  I saw traffic slowing as they turned the corner on my street to get a view of the huge sunflowers over the surburban fence lines.  I live in a fairly new - barren - subdivision, but squirrles appeared and feasted on the flowers, and decided that my yard was a good place to hang out - which is fine by me.  The blooms were breath-taking!

I always give him a little of whatever i eat in addition to it, but he'll eat this plain, unlike some other brands like pedigree which he will refuse to eat. Science diet was almost as good, but he likes this better, and it's cheaper. For a great meal, pour half a cup of chicken of beef stalk over it and you'll have a friend for life.

review/text: Xylitol is fantastic for dental health.<br /><br />These mints are great because they don't contain any of the less-than-ideal additives (like aspartame-nutrasweet, saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.) that make most other gums and mints, even those with xylitol as an ingredient, problematic.<br /><br />The flavor is nice, the texture is fine, the appearance is normal (just a cute little white tablet).<br /><br />Note that these mints are manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />I wish that these mints could be purchased in smaller amounts, because the price for the 2-pack of these giant containers is quite a lot of money to spend on something you've never tried before.  I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in a 30-mint, portable little cardboard box or something, and sold it as an "add-on" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try them out.

review/text: Unfortunately, I am stuck with 480 mints that I do not like because you cannot return these kind of items to Amazon (which makes sense, I guess). Anyway, when you first put the mint in your mouth there is no taste.  Zero.  Then, as the mint gets crumbly -- not in a slow dissolve way but just a fall apart way -- you get a little mint.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but whatever the case I certainly would not buy this brand again, and I learned not to buy items I've never tried in such a large quantity.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Crisp breads are a very traditional food in Scandinavia. Rye is the most traditional flavor. The rye flavor in this crisp is very mild. Good choice for appetizers or with your favorite soups. Very crisp. For a real treat try with orange or other fruit marmalades for breakfast or anytime treat. Easily resealable in a quart [litre] ziplock bag. Long shelf life. Can last through the long Scandinavian winter until the glorious spring. Made in Espoo, Finland. Approximately 33 crisps per box. Only 20 calories per crisp. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJM4RY">Finn Crisp Sesame Rounds, 8.8-Ounce Units  (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT if the price is good
review/text: Finn Crisp Original are very tasty very thin "crackers" each 1 5/8 x 4 3/4.  The flavor is slightly sour, like (unseeded) rye, pumpernickle or sour dough bread.  Finn Crisp are wonderful with melted cheese (about 20 seconds in a microwave).  They can be used anyway you'd use crackers, with the benefit that they are less fragile, less likely to spontaneous disintegrate with the first bite---so Finn Crisp are actually better than crackers for dips and spreads and such.  In fact, a very tasty, very healthy (if you aren't counting every calori) is simply a thin layer of mayo on a Finn Crisp.<br /><br />I suppose Finn Crisp are healthy, fiber, minimal processing, no preservatives, and such.  However, Finn Crisp are simply my favorite crackers.<br /><br />OTHER VARIETIES<br />If you like the flavor of seeded rye bread (i.e., with caraway seeds) try the Caraway version (my favorate).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSPW">Finn Crisp Caraway Thin Rye Crispbread with Caraway, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a>  If you prefer a more neutral flavor, perhaps to use with very delicate cheese, then I suggest Multigrain Finn Crisp.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSQG">Finn Crisp Multigrain Thin Crisp, 6.2 Oz Boxes (Pack of 9)</a><br /><br />PRICE<br />$26 for a pack of 9 (or $21 if you sign up for a periodic shipment subscription) direct from Amazon is a fair price.  However, when Amazon is out-of-stock, I've seen the price as high as $42, which is excessive.<br /><br />Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

review/summary: Best cracker I have found
review/text: Finn Crisp are by far the best crackers I have found. They have all of the nutritional attributes you want in a crispbread (low calorie, high fiber, etc) and do not taste like cardboard! They have a wonderful texture that does not fall apart or crumble too much and maintain the flavor of dark rye bread. They are great if you are watching your carbs or just for snacks. Love them!

review/summary: Great little crackers!
review/text: I like these little crackers because 3 of them are only 60 calories. You can break them into pieces and use them in dip, or whatever. But the best thing about them is that they are made with rye flour. I'm allergic to wheat, so I depend on these little crunchies! I eat them every day. Great for Weight Watchers.

review/text: We practice a macrobiotic lifestyle, which cuts out most crackers and snack products.  Finn Crisps are one of the few that pass muster.  Love the flavor.

review/summary: You HAVE to be a sourdough fan
review/text: These are made of sourdough rye flour and the sour part is very distinct. I love sourdough bread but these are a bit too much for my taste. As a cracker they are OK, accurately described- thin and crisp. Will not be ordering them again.
