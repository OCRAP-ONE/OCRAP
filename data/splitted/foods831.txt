review/summary: Delish!
review/text: Before I bought a 12 pack box of this pasta I had found it in my local grocery's gluten-free section.  I used it to make a Paleo-friendly pasta salad and found it to cook up perfectly.  It was al dente, held its shape perfectly and tasted wonderful. There IS a faint corn taste to it, but if that's that is the worst thing a gluten-free pasta has to offer, I'm in.  The family actually couldn't tell the difference between semolina pasta and the Sam Mills - I only knew because I made it. I will be buying the 12 pack posthaste!  Worth every cent, in my opinion.

review/summary: First Try Is A Winner!
review/text: This was a first for my family.  I bought it at a local PA Dutch store on a whim.  Didn't really expect to try it, but tonight my daughter asked me to make chicken alfredo and I was all out of our regular pasta.  None of us have any wheat issues.  I read the back of the bag, followed the directions and went about making my sauce and chicken.  I was a bit worried at first just because I am the world's pickiest eater.  (Yes, my kids eat better than I do.)  Served it up, and the kiddos devoured it.  They didn't notice a thing.  I tried it, and I was super impressed.  If it can be eaten by me, then anybody will like it.  lol  I am excited to buy it again.

review/summary: A viable alternative to traditional pasta
review/text: I recently paired the lasagna corte with a braised pork and tomato sauce at a tasting dinner for a major California winery. Forty people were at the event and the praise for the dish was universal. The texture of the product is slightly grainier than traditional pasta, but nowhere near as gritty as whole wheat pasta, which I cannot stand.<br /><br />The corn flavor is subtle, but not intrusive and if you're looking to remove wheat from your diet this is a good place to start.

review/text: These are my favorite Sams Mills.  They are made in Romania.  They are great for casseroles, salads, lasagna and just with sauce (sometimes I just use 2 cans of Progresso soup per pound) and leftovers didn't become hard overnight.  I guess I like corn pasta better than rice pasta.  This was when amazon was selling the pasta itself.

They really looked real and it took a while before the kids realized they were candy. Also, they're real hard to unwrap with tiny fingers. All in all, they went over big and my son still has a modest collection.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I found this VERY delicious - to me it tasted like a good dish at a Chinese restaurant - spicy and flavorful.  My only caution is that the box is TWO servings, not one, so the calories aren't a nice, low 170 - it's 340 if you eat the whole thing (which is VERY easy to do).  I don't know if it should have been named 'Spicy Szechuan' because the paste included is actually made from a Korean dish - gochujang red chili paste - but I found this VERY tasty!<br />Pros: made in USA, natural ingredients, no MSG or preservatives<br />Cons: 2 servings as packaged so 340 calories, 58g carbs and 38% of daily sodium.

review/text: I can't believe how bad this stuff was.  I opened the noodle package and it smelled stale and awful.  The dehydrated vegetables didn't hydrate in the microwave time (I even added more time), and so I was crunching on them while trying to eat the noodles.  It was not a good crunch.  The saving grace was the szechuan sauce, which was good, but not good enough to cover the bad. I'd rather have Cup Noodles than this stuff.

review/summary: Love these noodles
review/text: I make these noodles with tofu and veggies.<br />First thing to do is to drain extra firm tofu and wrap it in paper towels and putting a heavy pot or can on top of the block of tofu for about 15 min.<br />Second thing to do is to heat up enough frying oil in a saute pan and toss chopped tofor in nutritional yeast. Then when oil is hot adding the tofu in one layer and letting it fry for about 5 minutes at high heat or until golden brown and then flipping it over so it can get nice and golden brown all over.<br />In the meantime, add sesame seed oil, soy sauce and thai sweet chili sauce into container with lid so u can toss tofu when is finished being fried.<br />Now u use stir fry veggies (i get mine at costco) and u saute them along with the noodles in a big pot with a bit of peanut oil or whatever soem oil u like to use for about 3 minutes and then add the noodle sauce and topping.<br />When tofu is ready u put it in container with lid and shake it until is coated. Now add tofu to veggies and noodles and toss. Add scallions and sesame seeds and enjoy!

review/text: I got these for convenience, and because it has no MSG. I found after following the directions the noodles weren't done enough for my taste. I added 1/4 cup of water, 2 T of olive oil and a tablespoon of tahini. I then cooked it on high in my 600-watt microwave for 2 more minutes, all the water absorbed, and it was just right. I think next time I won't use quite all the sauce as it seemed a little overpowering.<br /><br />I thought it made a nice full serving for lunch or a quick snack. With the amendments, this is a product I will buy again. I like the fact that the packaging is all biodegradable.

review/text: Peychaud's Bitters is the defining ingredient in the classic New Orlean's cocktail known as the Sazerac, allegedly the first "cocktail" invented in the U.S., dating to the pre-Civil War period.<br />As such, there's no substitute! It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system.

review/text: This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar.  They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesn't show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.<br /><br />I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping.  Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size.  I don't think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.<br /><br />So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac?  Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to "Absinthe Cocktails" by Kate Simon).  I'll keep looking for other uses...

review/summary: Didn't know this was anise flavored...
review/text: I'm no bitters expert but I bought it as a gift for a friend.  I was surprised when I heard that this was anise flavored because neither of us are fans of licorice flavored things and I wish the description had mentioned that.  I might have choosen another brand that didn't have that flavor.

review/text: I purchased these as a gift for family member that loves bbq pork. I warned them that i had never tried them so try them each before putting it on anything. Well, come to find out, they LOVE these sauces so much that they asked me where they could find them and bought more! So i had to try this for myself. The final verdict? If you or someone close to you like bbq on anything, i HIGHYLY recomend giving these a try!

review/summary: Great sauces, and fun to try
review/text: My wife bought me this sauce sampler for Christmas, knowing my love for BBQ sauces and dipping sauces of all kinds. Most of the sauces were quite delicious, but the best part is getting to try the several different styles - i.e., Texas brisket sauce versus Carolina mustard-based sauce.  I recommend this as far as taste and styles, but the price plus shipping added in made it quite expensive.

review/text: I love this salsa because it is natural and not too tomato based.  Some salsas are made with tomato sauce like base. This is diced tomatoes, onion, pepper.  It is salty which I love.  I have only had the mild.  My store has discontinued it.  I am bummed.  Love it.

review/summary: OK, this is not a Jewish company alright?
review/text: LOL<br /><br />The Goya Company has a very interesting history, and is probably the first manufacturer and<br />distributor of Spanish food products in the country. I think they suffer somewhat from having<br />their shelfspace pigeonholed in the Ethnic Foods section of most supermarkets next to strange<br />things like Matzo Balls and Gefilte Fish and other semi-inedibles. But they are nonetheless a<br />Spanish specialty company that has branched out into Mexican and Caribbean products, and have<br />manufacturing facilities in many strategic locations around the world.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the better commercially available salsas that you can find locally just<br />about anywhere. And it is properly made with the only ingredients tomatoes, onions, jalapeno<br />peppers, and lemon. A very mild flavor that will appeal to just about everybody. For a 17.6 oz.<br />jar, this stuff is a bargoon at under $3 in your local grocery.<br /><br />Be sure to check out their website for the expansive product line and recipes.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers, this is the best off the shelf salsa on the market today. 5 Pods

review/text: I love this popcorn, it's low in calories and sweet enough that you feel you've cheated on your diet while satisfying your sugar craving.  However, you ought to buy it at your local store (Wal*Mart carries it) for $2 instead of $15 a box like this item was priced on 4/3/12.  That's just crazy.<br /><br />If they ever have the caramel flavor again, go for that. It's even better than the cinnamon roll.

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: This gelatin tastes NOTHING like the Knox or other varieties you can find in the grocery stores and this is a good thing since those taste like sludge for the most part, to be polite.<br /><br />I drink one tablespoon dissolved in hot water to make a tea, twice a day. The taste is somewhere between neutral and pleasantly rich but in an extremely subtle way. I really enjoy drinking it in my teas unsweetened, although my housemates think I'm a freak for doing it, not that me filling the freezer with animal bones and organs and bee pollen and fermenting random stuff on the counter doesn't make me a freak already.<br /><br />I originally bought this as a way to get more protein after reading what I now know was a quite quackery-laden blog post. Gelatin is NOT a complete protein. It's pretty much just proline and glycine, and has no tryptophan. So don't order for this purpose. However, if you're ordering to help your joints, skin, hair, cellulite, nails, etc. I think that this is the best you can buy.<br /><br />I've been using it to get rid of cellulite (since it runs in my family) and it's a lot easier than constantly boiling bones and less gross than drinking bone broth at 7 am in the middle of the summer. And after doing this for a few weeks, my booty/thighs are looking shaa-weet! It's pretty crazy actually; I love this stuff.

review/summary: The best gelatin out there.
review/text: I ordered this because I've been participating in a bone broth challenge, and we are encouraged to also use gelatin (which also naturally occurs in bone broth).<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this, I recommend visiting the company's website; it has a lot of really good information, plus a couple dozen recipes for using gelatin.<br /><br />I was especially concerned about the MSG content, because I know that free glutamate typically occurs in gelatin.  Great Lakes has a whole page about MSG, though, including lab results indicating free glutamate content, etc.  It seems like a pretty safe product.<br /><br />So far I've been making homemade jello with my Great Lakes Gelatin.  Basically, what you do is heat up half a cup of fresh juice, add 2 Tablespoons of gelatin, and stir on low heat until it is totally dissolved.  Then let it cool, and add it into a bowl containing 1 1/2 more cups of fresh juice.  Stir until it is well combined, pour it into the container you want it in, and then let it set in the fridge for several hours.  I made this recipe with fresh cherries and lemon, and I left pieces of fruit in it, and added raw honey to sweeten it a little--it has been wonderful!<br /><br />Until I bought this I hadn't eaten jello in a long time because dessert jellos at the store usually have sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, etc that I avoid.  I'm really enjoying this Great Lakes gelatin, though.

review/summary: Love this gelatin, but i'm such a jello noob that i messed up the first time.
review/text: If it wasn't for a friend of mine who already used this product, i probably would of tossed it in the garbage after trying to use it the way the instructions suggest after the first time. So to help out anyone else, i'll post how i make jello here. I'll give you a quick recipe that i use to make cranberry juice jello.<br /><br />2 cups juice (i use lakewood cranberry juice, but you can use any kind of clear juice you want).<br />2 tablespoons of great lakes gelatin<br />sugar to taste<br />a 3(or 4) cup pyrex container<br />a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup.<br /><br />i start off by mixing 1 cup of COLD juice with the 2 tablespoons of gelatin in the measuring cup.<br />keep mixing till all the gelatin has been mixed with the juice, don't leave any chunks.<br />then let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />dump the cup of juice/gelatin into the pyrex dish, and then clean your cup, then pour<br />another cup of juice into your measuring cup. I then microwave this cup for 2 minutes (maybe another minute after i test it)<br />then take it out to measure the temperature. you want to try to get the liquid around 160F degrees. (should be pretty hot to the touch)<br /><br />then i mix in the sugar to taste, then add the hot liquid to the cold, and mix it.<br />it should all be clear after you mix them together, and then i leave it sit on the counter for a few minutes,<br />then put it in the fridge. It takes a few hours to harden.<br /><br />when i first tried to make this, i thought it was like other jello, where you mix it in with hot liquids.. which is a bad idea.. since you'll wind up with a wad of glue stuck onto your spoon. Then after i tried to just mix it with cold water like the instructions said, but this never solidified. It turns out you have to mix with cold water, then apply hot water afterwards to activate it to harden.<br /><br />i hope this helps someone.

review/summary: Aids Digestions
review/text: I used know Gelatin from Publix for an alternative source of protein. Most my meats are so high in tryptophan that I figured I was already getting enough in my diet, that I could take this as a supplemental protein also. This product tastes much better than know, also, after going to their site, it looks like this product is made from pastured grass fed cows (which is great if you are on the Paleo-Diet).<br /><br />Most Paleo people have heard of Weston Price. Some have heard of Pottenger. Pottenger did tests on cats and found that after several generations of eating cooked only food that they became short tempered docile, they developed tooth problems and narrowing of the jaws along with skeletal deformities. The reason Pottenger's studies apply here is because he recommended that people consume some gelatin with their meals. The reason he recommended this is because the Gelatin is similar to RAW food in its water-loving hydrophilic quality. Gelatin Loves water and Digestive Juices and if you eat a cooked meal along with some Gelatin it literally draws digestive juices towards it and aids in digestion.<br /><br />Because I follow a Paleo diet mostly, I eat a lot of fat (grass fed butter/coconut oil) and after a little while of stopping the Know Gelatin and waiting for this product to arrive, I noticed that my stools were gray/ashy, I did a lot of research and found that Gray is a symptom of undigested fats. From 12 hours after I took this product I was back to a normal nice brown color.<br /><br />I also have kind of weak/popping joints so...<br /><br />This product is pretty much exactly what I needed, wanted and recommend, and it tastes great, if you need a product for digestion or joints, this product couldn't get a higher recommendation from me.

review/text: I have a couple of old herniated cervical discs from an injury (nursing is physical). Have been taking 1 Tsb of the gelatin every day for about 3 months and the stuff is a miracle. No more neck pain, increased range of motion, no more grinding when I turn my head, all my joints feel great and my skin has never looked better. My 75 yr old mother-in-law also started at the same time and she no longer has knee pain (she was going to have bilaterial knee replacement). She couldn't even climb the stairs without horrible grinding and knee pain. No more. Please try this stuff before having any type of ortho surgery you will not be sorry. Takes about three to four weeks of DAILY use to see results. One more unintentional bonus I lost 5 lbs and she lost 20. Win, win, win!

review/summary: Useful and healthful
review/text: I am generally really pleased with gelatin since I started using it and this the best brand of it I have found. The best thing about this particular brand is the no-nonsense packaging. Pour it in and there you have it, without all the extra trash, package tearing, etc. With the bulk packaging, it is also impressively affordable.<br /><br />Gelatin does seem to confer the touted joint relief in my case to a degree, though not as much as I would have hoped. I also read that it helped with sleep, but I have not really experienced that at all (despite ~4T/day usage).<br /><br />It mainly adds quite a lot to my preparation of simple, low calorie meals. For example, it helps me use egg whites more readily. My favorite mixture is 56g egg whites, 4g lecithin, 7g gelatin, and 10g raisins. The taste of the raisins suffuses the gelatin and produces a healthful 115 calorie snack.

review/summary: This gelatin smells very bad when hot.
review/text: I used this gelatin to make marshmallows. When it was hot it smelled VERY bad. I called the company and they said, "the beef gelatin has always smelled more than the pork." The marshmallows came out very good, but the smell was so bad I remember it and it turned my stomach. It does not smell in the package at room temperature.<br /><br />Addition: After wondering why boiled cartilage would smell so bad, I looked at the FDA website. The production of gelatin seems to be completely un-inspected. The FDA has no jurisdiction over post food production items like this. The FDA says that this industry uses dropped cows and other items designated as not suitable for food.<br /><br />From the FDA:<br /><br />"Domestically, generally human food that<br />contains meat only in a relatively small proportion or that<br />historically has not been considered by consumers to be products of the<br />meat food industry (e.g., soup stock, beef flavors and extracts,<br />gelatin), is not produced under USDA inspection (see definition of<br />``meat food product'' in 21 U.S.C. 601(j)) and may be physically<br />available for use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics. Further,<br />even when excluded from human food produced in USDA-inspected<br />establishments, prohibited cattle materials may leave the<br />establishments for inedible rendering or destruction. These materials,<br />which previously have not been explicitly prohibited in human food and<br />cosmetics by FDA, might then be used in FDA-regulated human food or<br />cosmetics. For example, prohibited cattle materials leaving a USDA-<br />inspected facility might not be denatured sufficiently to preclude<br />their use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics.<br />  Under the Food Safety and Inspection Services' (FSIS') rule, SRMs,<br />small intestine from all cattle, and material from nonambulatory<br />disabled cattle must be designated as inedible. However, certain<br />products, such as gelatin and collagen (which are both covered by the<br />provisions of this rule) used in FDA-regulated human food and<br />cosmetics, have traditionally been produced from cattle material deemed<br />inedible by the USDA. Therefore, such a designation by the USDA may not<br />be enough to preclude use of prohibited cattle materials in FDA-<br />regulated products without additional regulation by FDA. Further, some<br />cattle are not slaughtered under continuous USDA inspection (e.g., some<br />are sent directly to rendering). Cattle material from these animals,<br />such as brains or bones which include SRMs, could end up as starting<br />material for human food, such as meat extracts or gelatin,<br />respectively. Furthermore, if prohibited cattle materials were used in<br />FDA-regulated human food or cosmetics, the rule would facilitate FDA's<br />ability to use the enforcement mechanisms of the Federal Food, Drug,<br />and Cosmetic Act (the act) that apply to adulterated products (e.g.,<br />seizure) to prevent human exposure to the prohibited cattle materials."<br />Federal Register - 69FR 42255 July 14, 2004: Interim Final Rule -- Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Needs Truth in Labeling
review/text: The ingredients list on Amazon is incorrect according to the label on the food. I purchased this food through PetFoodDirect, and their website has the same incorrect list, as does the By Nature website itself as of this date (July 17, 2011). The label on the food I bought says that the food also contains pea flour and menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite (a toxic synthetic vitamin K). I emailed By Nature about this, and received this reply on June 29, 2011 from Ray Devone, Customer Service Coordinator, Kent Nutrition Group:<br /><br />"Thank you for calling these apparent discrepancies to our attention! There has never been Menadione in any of our foods. In fact, we printed labels listing this ingredient and decided to forgo adding this controversial supplement to our foods - after the labels went to print. Obviously, we have not run out of this first printing of labels yet - and I have asked that we put a 'blip' somewhere with words to  that effect.  We did indeed switch from the controversial gums and carrageenan to pea flour and I have further asked that we update websites, as well as labels for accuracy sake.  To answer your question:  The pea flour is new; the Menadione never was."<br /><br />The label on the food also lists guar gum and locust bean gum, so I'm not sure what controversial gums the pea flour replaced.<br /><br />Anyway, if your cats don't like pea flour (mine don't) or you're looking for a low-carbohydrate food, avoid By Nature Organics Chicken & Chicken Liver canned cat food.<br /><br />Truth in labeling matters.

review/text: I don't understand the negative reviews - my cats LOVE this food. Not only is it soft and very easy to add water to, (I make it a little soupy so that my cats will get extra fluids), but it is extremely low in Phosphorous which is excellent for older cats with Kidney Disease, or Chronic Renal Failure. Most of the prescription diets for CRF cats are full of additives and smell terrible and my cats wouldn't touch any of them. I have looked high and low for a cat food that is Organic, No Grain, and Low Phosphorous and THIS IS IT! I am so very happy and so are my cats. Plus you can't beat the price for all of those factors. I hope they never stop making this food!

I am not an tea expert by any means but I love tea and am disappointed with the flavor & quality of the normal store stuff....to include many of the fancier brands of trendy teas.  I am impressed with all of the Kusmi-Teas I have tried Prince Vladimir, Petrushka and Bouquet of Flowers, Darljeeling n37, so far not disappointed!  I can no longer find it locally so am elated it's out here on Amazon!! and if you are concerned about the price, it is well worth it and the tin contains a decent amount of tea. I love the full size leaves that unfurl as they steep - not a bunch of itsy bitsy pieces like other teas.  Just be sure to let it steep a good 3-4min - unlike other teas which are more like 1-2min. This is a strong tea, which I prefer - but be warned it will also give you quite a caffeine kick!

review/summary: For me, a ZING that lasts
review/text: Due to a trial with a new med 3 years ago, I have been left with a salty/metallic taste in my mouth, all the time.  And it drives me crazy. So for me the answer has been to try gum that I can discreetly chew, or park in my mouth.<br />My two absolutely favorites are both from the "5" series of gums, Cobalt, and Zing.<br />Zing is my favorite, as it provides long lasting flavor and does not deteriorate as rapidly as many of the other gums do.  But as many others have stated, it is very, very rare that I find it in stores.  I am very happy to find it here.<br />I only use 1/3 to 1/2 piece at a time, so that helps stretch out how long a certain amount will last me.<br />And, given its rarity in stores, it must be that the majority of people agree with those here rating it with one star.<br />But not for me.

review/summary: Delicate, Slightly Sweet Vanilla Odor and Outstanding Taste...
review/text: Gevalia coffee is an excellent product; rich and full-bodied.  The French Vanilla Coffee takes Gevalia's excellent regular coffee to another level by enhancing it with a touch of vanilla flavor.  The flavor is not overpowering or artificial, even though the box says there is some artificial flavor used.  The fragrance of the coffee is slightly sweet, but the brewed coffee does not, when consumed black, have a sweet taste.  The vanilla flavor is enhanced, however, if one uses some type of sweetener; creamer elevates the taste into a more decadent realm.<br /><br />At one time, I purchased this coffee from the manufacturer; but, I like variety at breakfast and rotate four different flavored coffees.  Thus, I did not drink enough Gevalia to warrant regularly scheduled deliveries.  Further, the cost of the coffee plus delivery was almost $30.  I just could not justify paying that amount for 1 1/2 pounds of coffee.<br /><br />Then, I discovered some Gevalia coffees were available on Amazon!  The cost is approximately half that of the manufacturer.  I was concerned when my order arrived because the box tops were not glued down well.  Additionally, when I opened the first package, the "exhaling" noise usually accompanying the loss of the foil bag's vacuum seal was not present.  Neither was the coffee still formed, as Gevalia coffees normally are, into a solid block.  However, I am pleased to report the coffee's flavor and aroma were excellent; the packaging discrepancies do not seem to have affected this excellent product.<br /><br />In the future, I will definitely be purchasing my Gevalia coffees from Amazon.  While the flavor selection may not always be as extensive, the significant price difference is well worth that minor inconvenience.
