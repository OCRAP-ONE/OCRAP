review/summary: My Cats go Ape S*** over this food. Great stuff!
review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/text: This shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed Whiskas Purrfectly chicken he won't consider anything else.  He prepares to eat if I offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he's sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away.  He won't eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive. The pouch is not convenient but the fact that I know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Cats seem to prefer this brand
review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

review/summary: Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food
review/text: We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/text: Molly wakes me up early telling me it is time for her "breakfast".  She really loves the Sardine and Mackerel Entree.  I have to rely on her reaction, as I have not tasted it.  I give her half a pack in the morning and half at night.  I rescued her from the Humane Society, so I do not know what she ate before.  She is five years old.<br /><br />  Thank you for sending it once a month and I do not have to go shopping for it.  Eleanor Martin

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

review/text: Cats can be very finicky when they want to be, my cat will not eat 9 lives, friskies and only a few flavors of Fancy Feast so I have one spoiled cat!! But it seems to love Whiskas Chicken and Duck. Cats are very smart and have good hearing when he heard the UPS truck and saw me bring in this big box he knew his favorite Chicken and Duck was in the box. When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean. So instead of wasting money on food he does not like I am sticking with his Chicken and Duck.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NIJ4A">Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Duck in Natural Juices Food for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Unwanted Ingredients
review/text: I was interested in this food and so was my cat until she got ill from two magical ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />They do absolutely nothing for your cat but can cause health issues. She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

review/text: My Cats truly love Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Variety Pack. They love the variety. I serve food to my Cats at about the same times each day. When I began serving Wiskas Purrfectly Fish, and another Wiskas Variety Pack, the began to follow me into the Kitchen with great expectation when it was time for their Wiskas. They watch me prepare each of their dishes with great interest. They follow me as I place their dishes out for them, and then dive in with great gusto. They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that. My Cats enjoy good health, abundant energy, and a happy spirit. I am glad that I am able to serve them food that they enjoy and provides nutritional benefits they need.

Finally, I found this food. My cats will not even eat the same flavor even from another brand. I was so upset when Target put the individuals on sale and stopped selling them. Needles to say, when I found this on Amazon I was very happy. Reasonably priced for the amount and my cats are completely satisfied. Will also be ordering from here!

review/summary: Weaned my Kittens!
review/text: Not only do my full sized cats gobble this up but this was the only food that our 5 week old kittens would eat in order to go to new homes.  We were getting down to the wire and the kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away. I tried several kittens formulas and KMR-  and they wouldn't eat anything because they preferred nursing.  However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/text: Unfortunately, my cats are not fans of the sardine and mackerel pack. The sardine & mackerel has actual chunks of fish, but it seems the cats prefer the flaked tuna and the tuna and whitefish. Amazon sells a tuna-only version of this item, so I decided to stick to what my cats like and keep the tuna-only dinner.<br /><br />The price is comparable to what you will find at your local Wal-Mart. With the added convenience of home delivery with Subscribe and Save, this is a good deal if your cats like the sardine/mackerel dinner.

review/summary: Two enthusiastic paws up
review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/text: Whiskas came up with a winner as far as my cats are concerned; they love all three of the "Purrfectly Chicken" varieties.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in, however, has to be a cost-saving thing because it is totally terrible. It is messy, and the only way to get all the food out is to dig it out with a spoon, and dig some more, and dig some more.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars for the food, and 1 star for the package. I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that.

review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

I can't say/don't want to admit how long they lasted me, but I enjoyed every minute of their chocolatey goodness.

review/summary: Very good coconut water
review/text: I have been trying all brands of coconut water. I agree that the Vita Coco is perhaps the sweetest tasting coconut water. I bought the Naked Coconut water right when it became available (at a good price; keep an eye out as prices for several brands of coconut water has been fluctuating on Amazon). Anyway, Naked water is not as sweet as Vita Coco, yet not as sour as Zico. Naked water was certainly good enough to order more.<br /><br />I work outside in the Texas heat quite a bit. During this summer of 2010 (with temperatures above 100 degrees) I will work up a huge sweat, literally soaking my shirt. I found that drinking coconut water, of any brand, does wonders at refreshing me and giving me the energy I need to head back outside. Indeed, one memorable day I went inside to cool off; I was literally so tired that I thought I would not be able to go back out into that heat and finish my chores. However, after chugging down a container of cold coconut water and sitting for about ten minutes, I was amazed at how refreshed I felt. I was able to head back out and work up a new sweat. From that day on I have been a real fan of coconut water.<br /><br />I doubt the hype about being 'good for diabetes' and other health-related claims (I am diabetic and have found no difference in my blood sugar levels). However, coconut water does wonders at rehydrating the body: much better than Gatorade. Even Zico (which has been much maligned lately) does me great after a hot session in the heat.<br /><br />So, load up on coconut water. When you are overheated and thirsty, any brand will go down great. Keep an eye on the prices, since they seem to vary.

review/summary: Best tasting one right now
review/text: Fast forward to January 2012, this is the best tasting one out there.  I am a coconut water fan and have tried them all.  ONE used to be the best before they move their production to another country.  There is something about coconuts from Brazil.  They are not as sweet and offer a more nutty flavor if that's what you are looking for.<br /><br />This brand has a very subtle taste so if you coming from the sweeter brands, you will not like it.  With all the other brands moving their production to other countries and no longer using coconuts from Brazil, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Below is a review from about about year and half ago.<br /><br />I have tried about 5 brands of coconut water, Amy and Bryans, ONE, Nature Factor, Zico, and VitaCoco.  This one has the most subtle taste of all of them and looking at the nutritional listing on the box, seems to contain the least amount of sugar.  For some, it might taste like water since the flavor does not seem to come out compared to the other brands.<br /><br />Amy and Bryans and Nature Factor coconuts are way too sweet for my taste and I think they get their coconut water from Thailand.  Vita Coco tastes a bit tart.<br /><br />Zico used to be my favorite before they switch from all natural to concentrate and though I have not tried it, based on other people's reviews, it does not come close to any of these particular ones.<br /><br />So in the end, ONE coconut will be the brand I will continue to buy and if Zico comes back into the market, I might pick them second.  For my taste, the ONE brand tastes the best.

review/text: I'm from Brazil, and when I'm home I usually drink coconut water straight from the coconut. When I moved to the states I really missed tating real good coconut water, until I tried this product. Trust me people, this is the real stuff. It's not as sweet as the othe rbrands, and real coconut water isn't supposed to be, but sour coconut water means that they took it from coconuts that aren't ripe yet. This is the best coconut water you can get in the states.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I will be brief and to the point:<br /><br />I lived in Rio de Janeiro for many years.  A daily treat at the beach was to have a vendor hack open a coconut with his machete, and drink the water through a straw.  Naked 100% Coconut Water is as close to the real deal as you're going to get.  It tastes as though you were drinking it from the coconut itself.<br /><br />It's not a taste for everyone - especially if you like things sweet - but if you like the flavor of coconut water as it comes from the shell ... this is it!

review/summary: How Coconut Water Should Taste
review/text: This is exactly how coconut water SHOULD taste, and how ZICO USED TO TASTE before they ruined their product by adding sweeteners/modifying the formula.  The only coconut water that comes close to this one is the ZICO in the tetra pak, which I believe are no longer being produced.<br /><br />That being said, coconut water may an acquired taste to some.  I personally love it.  But, just because they don't add a ton of sweeteners and crap to this healthy product to make it taste like candy, doesn't mean that it's bad.  I don't get all these people who are knocking this product because it "doesn't taste as good as the other brands."  The only reason those other brands supposedly "taste better", which in my opinion, they don't, is because they are making the product less natural and less healthy by adding sugar and sweeteners.<br /><br />For those who want true, untainted coconut water, buy this product now!  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Closest to fresh
review/text: I am fortunate to live in Florida and can get fresh coconut water right off the tree. However, the harvest season does not last all year & I use Naked Coconut Water to carry me until fresh is available again. Also, when traveling, the packaged water is clearly more convenient! I have tried every brand sold on Amazon & can say this is the closest to fresh (Vita Coco (plain) is 2nd closest). It certainly does not equal fresh coconut water, but is the best from a package. If you are looking for sweetened or flavored water, look elsewhere. If you want good basic (packaged) coconut water, look no further.

review/summary: Worst of the major brands
review/text: Of the major brands that sell 100% juice, the Naked Juice has to be the worst I've tried.  The taste was horrible and the smell was foul- comparable to sour milk. Two separate containers and both had the same taste and smell. I will be avoiding this product, and will sooner drink the plastic tasting Zico.  I would recommend one of the others, 100% juice brands as an alternative.

review/summary: Tastes like its been sitting out awhile..
review/text: I was in middle of a warm work day and due to lack of other brands available, bought two boxes of Naked. I drank the first box and it was just off. It was lacking the natural sweetness and tasted like it had passed its prime. There's something off in the taste, almost as if they crush the coconuts whole and some of the shell got in and gave it that odd taste.<br /><br />Still willing to give it a chance, I tossed the other box in the fridge for a couple days until I could get my hands on a Zico and Vita Coco. Trying them all back to back, Naked juice loses significantly. My girlfriend said it made her want to throw up the first time she tried it. It lacks the freshness and subtle sweetness of Zico and Vita Coco. Naked seems to be more widely available, which is a shame because if this is someone's first taste of coconut water, they will be disappointed.<br /><br />Go with Zico (Tetra Pack, stay away from the bottle) or Vita Coco. ONE is decent but has a strange almost chemical/artificial sweetener aftertaste, like a Pepsi compared to a Coke, a bit sweeter yet odd.

review/summary: Great source of potassium, best tasting plain coconut water
review/text: We enjoy the Naked brand of Coconut water every day, the subscribe and save program is a nice way to get the best price.<br /><br />The Naked flavor is pretty neutral and lacking some of the "green" or "sweet" tastes we've found in Vita and a few other brands. This coconut water is good to add into sports drinks, add to juice or just drink solo. 10 times more potassium than sports drinks, so perfect after (or before) a work out, after a hot day of yard work, when feeling a bit dehydrated or if you are trying to meet your daily potassium requirements without a supplement.<br /><br />I found a case that was just out of date that I had stashed away and it tasted just as good as the in date with months/years to go. Good packaging!

review/text: I know taste is subjective, but I really like this plain coconut water by Naked.  It does not have any weird bean-ish flavor that I experienced with other brands and is fine to drink plain or mixed with juices.  It is not bitter or sour.  I even make a chocolate smoothie with it sometimes and it does not add any weird flavors to the chocolate, it is really delicious!<br /><br />I would take one star off for price, I think all coconut water is overpriced, but if you are pregnant this stuff is GREAT for keeping you hydrated.

It's definitely not as sweet or flavorful as ONE or Vita Coco, but if that's because it has less sugar then I'm fine with it.  I've always thought well of the Naked brand so I'm sure they know what they are doing.  I'm also pregnant so it's good to hydrate myself with electrolytes and I know coconut water is chock full of them and other good stuff.

review/text: My mom needs potassium due to her high blood pressure meds and she hates eating bananas. So my sister sent her a case of the Vita Coco brand of coconut water and while it tastes better than the ONE brand, it still has a weird chemical taste to it. In the meantime while waiting on the Naked coconut water shipment, we found out that real coconut water straight out of the coconut actually tastes really good, what you would imagine coconut water ought to taste like rather than the odd sweat taste from the tetra paks. Although the Naked brand coconut water doesn't taste as good as the real thing, it is much better than the Vita Coco and ONE brands.

review/summary: Naked coco water sucks
review/text: I've been a fan of coconut water since I was a kid and until recently, other than getting it straight from a coconut, it was hard to find pure coconut water drinks without a bunch of additives and sugars (although I enjoy those too). needless to say, after trying my first brand (O.N.E.), I've been on a coco water rampage. I've tried vita coco, amy and brian's, blue monkey, zico, c20, O.N.E., etc. most are good, some are whatever (zico, vitacoco). vitacoco has days in which it tastes ok and some days I must be getting bad packages cus they suck.<br /><br />Naked, however, sucks every. single. time. it hardly has that distinctive coconut scent/taste. good coconut water is supposed to be even more refreshing than water after a good work out but I don't enjoy the taste of Naked at all.<br /><br />unfortunately for customers, coconut water comes at a premium price and is hardly affordable per fluid oz, so if you're going to shell out $$$ to get some, get something worthwhile, like O.N.E., C2O, or blue monkey coconut water.

review/summary: Pretty good coconut.
review/text: Naked is a bit more neutral than Zico in my opinion, and tastier than ONE (I can't really explain how, but you have to try the two of them). I like Naked a lot, except out of the 4 cases I ordered, some of them in the 2nd case so far have tasted a little bit off, almost a little sour in aftertaste. Not expired though. I drank them all anyways to no ill effect, so I think I'll be safe in that regard.<br /><br />Also, no packaged coconut juice is going to come close to using a machete and hacking off a fresh one and sticking a straw in it, because I believe most of these are heat-treated for storage purposes. A sterile liquid from a coconut would harbor bacteria pretty quickly if it wasn't pasteurized. I might be wrong on this, but I remember reading somewhere that all coconut waters are pasteurized - a bit of a pity when you consider that you do lose some nutrient value.

review/text: Tastes almost natural, if the packaging is telling the truth, fairly healthy, best of all it seems to stay fresh over time ... suggestion, add some small pieces of pulp, Like Grace's Coconut water found here ... [...]<br /><br />-Richie Etwaru

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I love coconut water and have tried almost all of the brands out there. I used to drink Zico but now I only drink the Naked. It has a more natural taste than the others and although some people think it tastes more like water, I think it has the best taste without any after taste. Very refreshing.

review/summary: Best coconut water
review/text: I think the Naked Coconut Water is the best on the market.  I've tried other brands and find that this is the closest to taking a drink from an actual coconut.  It's truly coconut water without having to actually peel a coconut.

review/summary: I drink it room temperature
review/text: I ordered a case each of Vita Coco, Zico, Naked, and ONE.  I like my coconut water room temperature, which none of the manufacturers suggest as the optimal way to enjoy their products. Maybe this review will be useful to others that drink thinks at room temperature. I am comparing each of the four against actual fresh coconut water extracted out of a fresh young coconut, which I've been drinking for years.<br /><br />Here are my rankings:<br /><br />1. Vita Coco has the most natural flavor, with no off tastes, and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.<br />2 (tie). Zico tastes slightly citrusuy and slighty "green" (like a green banana).<br />2 (tie). ONE ends on a slightly bitter note.<br />4. Naked has an off taste that I do not care for at all.<br /><br />I threw out all of the "Naked" boxes after my taste test.  Zico and ONE are drinkable, but both have flavors beyond the pure clean coconutty taste of Vita Coco.  I won't through the Zico or ONE out, but I'll drink all the Vita Coco first.

review/summary: Good clean hydration
review/text: Coconut water is supposed to be the best liquid to rehydrate your body after a strenuous workout because it contains an optimum balance of water and electrolytes.  It is a natural remedy that tastes and works far better than the glorified sugar water that is gatorade, powerade, and vitamin water.  In terms of coconut water, I prefer vita coco's taste better because it tastes just like it came out of a fresh coconut.  Naked coconut water isn't bad but it tastes a bit flat, almost as if it has been diluted.

review/summary: Best coconut water
review/text: I grew up drinking Coconut water fresh off the tree in Asia and I am glad to find a packaged product that is so close in taste to the fresh coconut. I have tried other brands like Zico, Vita and Naked is the best.

review/summary: Really fresh coconut water
