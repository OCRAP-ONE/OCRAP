review/text: If you like munchy snacks with zing (some might even say it is 'hot') you will like this stuff. I used to buy it at Big Lots until it was no longer there, and liked it so much that I went looking on the internet. It's very much like a similar snack I've bought at Harry and David but much less expensive, and maybe even a bit better! Spicy almonds, peanuts(lots), cajun sesame sticks, cajum corn sticks and pretzels. Wasn't a problem to have to buy a box of 12 bags! Try it and enjoy!

review/summary: Helps with spitup but constipates..
review/text: I have to mix this formula with the regular Enfamil Infant and make my own custom blend.  If you use this formula on its own your baby will get majorly constipated. My poor baby screamed for a full day trying to poop.  After I started mixing the 2 formulas, we nolonger have that issue and spit up is greatly reduced.  Its so much better than adding rice cereal to thicken formula b/c this has no clumps and doesn't clog the nipples.  I mix up a pitcher of this formula b/c its hard to mix and foams up at first.

review/summary: Reflux LIFESAVER
review/text: Our three-month-old son has GERD and we were in dire straits trying to find a solution. The doctor tried several medications but it really didn't matter because he'd spit them up every time. She gave us a sample of this formula to try and voila! Our son still struggles with his reflux but he's not the vomit factory he once was. Bonus - he sleeps 12 hours straight at night now (don't hate me).<br /><br />We are converts. Our daughter was a Similac baby but Enfamil A.R. saved our sanity and our son's health.

review/summary: Great Product for Reflux!
review/text: I never write reviews however, after trying 4 different formulas we found a winner. Our little one has acid reflux and the doctor recommended this. It was so bad that she cried for hours. I noticed a difference with 24 hours. We use Dr. Brown bottles and we had to buy stage 2 nipples because the formula is thick. Yes, it can make your baby constipated however, I called the doctor and he said that it is ok to give 1 oz of prune juice and 1 oz of water daily to keep her regular. We also use gas drops at every other feeding to help with the gas.  FYI Target has there own brand that works great to  for a reduced cost $15.99 :).

review/summary: Causes Terrible Constipation!!!!!!
review/text: Yes, this formula does reduce the amount of spit up.... but at what cost? This formula caused my poor daughter to be so constipated that she cries every time she poops. She also pushed so hard that I found blood in her diaper! And it took her half an hour to finish only 4 oz because it's so thick and frothy! I just returned a bunch of this formula and bought Similac Sensitive for Spit Up, that has much better reviews in regards to it's effectiveness and no constipation. It only comes in Ready to Feed but it's worth the extra money not to see my baby in pain all day! I would not recommend this formula for any baby!

review/summary: Great Formula!
review/text: My daughter has a moderate reflux problem and this formula was recommended by her doctor.  It greatly reduces the amount and frequency of her reflux, and I find that once she had been on the formula for a few weeks she no longer had trouble with constipation.  Her doctor advised me to give her 1 ounce of prune juice diluted with 1 ounce of water whenever she went more than 30 hours without having a bowel movement, and that really does the trick to get things moving again.  She also said that only 50% of infants have long term constipation issues with the A.R. formula.

review/text: The whole point of this formula is to prevent spit up. However, our daughter could not drink it because the powder created too many bubbles once mixed (and we tried all the tricks - mixed it with a spoon, kept it in the refrigerator for hours...). We now feed our daughter the ready-to-feed Enfamil AR and it works like a charm. But the powder was not an answer for us.

review/text: My baby spit up alot since day one.  After trying a couple different kinds of formula, even ones that are lactose & soy free, I landed on Enfamil AR.  It started working right away...we hardly even need a burp cloth now.  Every once in awhile, I try to go back to Similac just to see if my baby has grown out of his reflux.  Every time he starts spitting up again, so back to the AR I go.  The Up & Up Brand (Target) with Rice Starch works just as good and isn't as expensive.

review/summary: Very helpful with acid reflux
review/text: This formula isn't the same as adding rice cereal to formula or breast milk.  Unlike when you add rice cereal, this formula is a smooth, easy to swallow liquid that's barely thicker than regular formula or milk.  It doesn't thicken until it meets the baby's stomach acid, which keeps it from coming up as easily.  Some pediatricians are okay with rice cereal at 4 months and others aren't - most seem to recommend waiting until 6 months, so check with yours before making any big changes!  Our son was refusing to eat breast milk or regular formula, and our ped said no rice cereal, so we tried this and he hasn't refused it yet (it's been a month).  It's made a huge difference for him.

review/summary: made my son's reflux worse...
review/text: My son is 3 months old and was just diagnosed with reflux, we were told to try this formula as it is supposed to be the holy grail of formula's to help babies with reflux and spit up.<br /><br />My son did not seem to have a problem drinking this formula out of his level 1 nipple, as it is a heavier formula.<br /><br />As for the spitting up, which the thicker formula is supposed to help prevent by helping keep food in babies tummy versus mommys shirt, it was a nightmare. The amount of spit up my son experienced did not go down, if anything it increased. Ontop of that, of course it was a thicker, oatmeal like consistency. He spat up so horribly on this one time it soaked his whole front of his shirt and it was horrible to wipe off, you can't wipe off the chunks easily...<br /><br />Also, inside the tub in the scoop wrapper there is a pamphlet that says their special formula won't make your child constipated, could not be further from the truth!!! My baby has been on 4 other formulas for his reflux and has never had a constipation issue. I literally fed him 4 bottles of this formula and the poor kid had major poop issues.<br /><br />I would not reccomend this to a parent with an infant with reflux, research other formulas first and use this as a LAST RESORT! Not worth the $$.

review/summary: LOVE!
review/text: My daughter is 4 months old and has reflux and this is the ONLY formula she can hold down and we've tried almost all of them.  We've even tried adding rice cereal (I know you're not supposed to, but let's be honest...we all do) to other brands, but nope, spit that up too. This formula actually helped her almost immediately.  Within the first day of using it, her spitting up drastically reduced.  It does constipate her, like other reviewers have said, but our ped said we could give her 4oz of apple juice every day to help with it.  We do that, and it helps a little, but we've found that the baby probiotic, baby giaia, works waaaaay better-don't get it on amazon, got to your local pharmacy and get it there.  It's expensive (like $30), but with the formula and the probiotic, my daughter is now an angel!

review/summary: It's a miracle!
review/text: My lo started choking during feeds and choking, gagging and coughing after feeds started at 2 weeks old.  I was breast and formula feeding.  We got referred to a gi pediatrician who said it's reflux.  Told us to thicken his milk w/ cereal and try zantac.  Thickening didn't help cause i couldn't get the right consistency w/ the right nipple hole size...and so still choking.  Zantac made it worse, after 3 days, i gave up on it, eventhough i know we're suppse to give it 2 wks.  Then gi dr. told us to try prevacid as well as alimentum formula.  Both made tings really bad.  He was having violent choking after his feeds, and i could hear all the liquids in his body moving, and waking up hrs after feeds choking.  I gave up the prevacid after day 5 and got an upper gi study and found out all structures were normal.  I found online Enfamil AR which has added rice starch that expands after they drink it in their tummy to help w/ spitup.  Lo wasn't spitting up alot but it was choking and gagging him cause it would come up to his throat.  So i tried the formula...today is day 5 and lets say it's been a miracle!  He is not choking during drinking anymore and only had a handful of times he's choked in the last 5 days which aren't even bad chokes, but more like coughs.  Where he would  to choke about 1 to 8 times after each feedings before.  I had to be extremely careful not to move him after his feedings before or he would likely choke...now I can move him more and he will not choke.  It seems like his choking is replaced w/ either nothing or a bit of spitup or a throat clear or cough at times.  I'm not giving any meds now.  The only thing is the AR can cause constipation for some, so I'm mixing the formula w/ 15 % enfamil newborn.  I may try adding some prune juice to one bottle a day to soften his stool.  So far he can go but it's a little dry.  I like the AR vs adding rice cereal myself cause it goes in like regular milk but thickens in the stomach.  I use dr. brown's #2 nipples cause its a tiny bit thicker than the enfamil newborn milk but it's perfect cause when the milk is too thin my lo chokes on it.  He is 7 weeks now.  By the way it's very easy to mix w/ warm water...no clumps and no clogging the nipple.

review/summary: Works for my daughter w/ mild spit up issues
review/text: My daughter does not have GERD or diagnosed acid reflux, but she did have a lot of spit up and gas with the formula we used for our first two kids (Good Start).  (To fix the gas problem, we switched to Dr. Brown's bottles.) Unfortunately Nestle doesn't have an already thickened formula, so we switched to Enfamil.  There was an immediate improvement in my daughter's spitting up.  Since she wasn't 4 months yet, I did not want to add rice cereal directly to her bottles (yes, adding cereal to a bottle is controversial, but one can decide what is best for their child).  Enfamil AR is not formula with rice cereal added.  It is just a component of the rice (I believe just the rice starch).  It is enough to thicken it up for many babies to easily digest, but it is not as thick as adding rice cereal.<br /><br />If you do decide you want to add cereal to the bottle at a later date, this formula does not work well for that.  It almost immediately becomes too thick to drink (no matter how little you add).  I tried using the regular Enfamil and adding cereal (she is older now), but she won't drink it.  Adding the cereal for my other two helped them sleep through the night better, but since she won't take a bottle w/ the cereal added, she is still getting up one or two times for a bottle at night.  The no spit up is worth it though.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because she still does spit up some, but it's a great improvement from before.

review/text: I bought thinking this was some special formulation, but it is not. Baby spat up just as much. Finally really read ingredients - it's the same as the formula causing spit-up plus some rice! It's cheaper and more effective to feed him the rice cereal separately (Pediatrician OK'd rice cereal at 4 months). So please don't buy expecting anything special.

review/text: Just tried this today...and it was delicious! I have tried Dr. McDougall's Non-Dairy Peach and Raspberry Hot Cereal before, and loved it. Maple Hot Cereal is very flavorful, hearty, and filling!<br /><br />I love Dr. McDougall's products, because they are so natural, with whole grain raw oats (not processed, instant oats), and use soy milk powder to give a creamy texture with out all of the added sugars that normal oatmeal products have.<br /><br />Also, this oatmeal is wonderful, because of the portion size. A usual instant oatmeal packet is skimmpy on size- I usually need two packets for breakfast. This product, however, is a good portion size, and it is convenient because you don't need a bowl to mix it (you use the product container itself, and just add water).<br /><br />Dr. McDougall's Non Dairy Hot Cereal products are the greatest store bought, and the closest to homemade oatmeal you can get!

review/summary: Delicious, healthy AND convenient!
review/text: Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Organic Maple is one of those rare finds that is delicious, healthy and convenient all in one! First, it tastes wonderful... like a really good quality oatmeal-type breakfast cereal should. It is very healthy in terms of sodium content, fiber, etc. And it is super convenient and fast to prepare. It's perfect on a cold morning when you only have a short time for breakfast... or simply bring it to the office with you and make it there with boiling water or in the microwave... right in its own container! I have been buying this product for a few years now and have never been disappointed. Like I said, it tastes great, it's good for you and most importantly for me (who always seems to be rushing to get to work!) it takes little time to prepare and you eat it right in its own container... all you need is a spoon. I would highly recommend Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Organic Maple to anyone who wants any of the above attributes in a breakfast cereal. It would be ideal for both children and adults. By the way, it is sweetened with organic real maple sugar and organic evaporated cane juice. No corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. The ingredients list is quite short... a good sign on any product, as you know you're getting the least processed it had to be. I do not think you would be disappointed with this product. It has everything you can ask for and nothing you wouldn't want in it. One note, I have a severe peanut allergy... on the label it states, "made in a facility that uses peanuts". I personally have never had any reaction. But anyone with a peanut allergy may want to take that into consideration when deciding whether or not to purchase Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Organic Maple. Like I said, my peanut allergy is very severe but apparently having the product simply made in the same facility where there are peanuts has no effect on the product. But please use your best judgment... I would not anyone to have an allergic reaction. Aside from that, Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Organic Maple scores an "A+" and five stars from me. It truly is my favorite breakfast cereal. However, it's a terrific, filling and healthy snack any time of day.

If you really want an outstanding hot breakfast, I would suggest McDougall's peach and raspberry cereal over this one. It is very tasty and has fruit in it.

review/text: The consistency is a little weird due to the types of grains.  And I must ask,why in the world would each cup be equal to 2 servings? It's a waste for those who are not doubling up on servings. It takes 5 minutes to prepare at which time the oatmeal is barely warm and needs to be reheated.  I expected fresher, bolder flavors. Typically a 'gourmet' type oatmeal in single servings has fresher flavor from the fruit and even a little natural sweetness negating the need for sweeteners, but not this one. Quaker Real Medley's outshine this product by far.

review/text: This is a wonderful product and the best feature is the fact that it is healthy and very convenient - the packaging is very good and preparation is fast.  The taste is wonderful.  Because it is high in fiber, it does help to control blood sugar which is always a plus.  It's fairly solid and the texture is nutty-like.  I never liked mushy, hot cereals.  Considering how much unhealthy, sugar and sodium ladened cereals there are on the market, Dr. Mcdougall's cereals are a real treat and I think the price is reasonable.  People don't think twice about shelling out money for unhealthy food; candy, soda pop, greasy snacks and yet they don't like to pay for a delicious, healthy product.  In my opinion, this maple, 4-grain cereal is worth every penny and I will continue to purchase it.  Hats of to Dr. McDougall for helping to promote healthy eating habits and doing so with great "taste."  Pun intended.  So far, all of the cereals I purchased, that Dr. McDougall created,  I have found to be of high quality and simply delicious.  Thanks, Doc!

review/text: I have tried a lot of healthy food and there have been times where everyone says it is delicious and I gag while trying to eat it.  Well, this oatmeal tastes great and is VERY filling.  For some reason at first I didn't realize the nutrition facts were for 2 servings so I was really excited that all that oatmeal only had 130 calories but not the case.  I'd prefer a one serving container and just get more but this works!

review/summary: Not as good as Original Rockstar
review/text: For the past few months, my local Dollar Tree has been carrying various versions of Rockstar. This delighted since I drink it regularly. I was even more so delighted to come across some Rockstar coupons which brought the price down to 45 cents a can when bought at Dollar Tree. I stocked up. Eventually they started running out of Original Rockstar, which is what I usually drink. I needed to stock up again and didn't want to pay full price, so I grabbed a few of these sugar free versions to hold me over until they got more original in stock.<br /><br />I do not like them at all as much as the original and here is why -<br /><br />  The sugar free version has that diet soda taste, which I kind of expected, but was hoping it wouldn't have.<br /><br />  It also has a little less carbonation. One of the things I love about original Rockstar is that it has that powerful,<br />  crisp carbonation, so I really miss it with the sugar free.<br /><br />  I find that the sugar free version actually bloats me alot more than the original.<br /><br />I have become pretty much immune to Rockstar as far as energy goes, but I love the taste (of the original) and so I drink one every morning, just like other people drink coffee. I suppose I am "addicted" to it just like people are "addicted" to coffee, too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the diet soda taste, or if you have tried original Rockstar and think it's too strong, you would probably like these quite well. I feel like this one has less energy benefits too.

I wouldn't pay 58 dollars for a 24 pack when I can buy them from Wawa for 1.99 a piece.  That would be well under 50 dollars.  This would make the cans around 2.42 a piece.  Multiply the 1.99 by 7% sales tax I pay in New Jersey and I would pay 2.12 a can.  This product is a still great and I think I am going to go out and grab one.

review/summary: Refreshing.  Works fast.
review/text: Gatorade is manufactured by Quaker Oats which is a division Pepsi. Heavily marketed and very popular, it is the official drink for the NFL, NBA and MLB and other major sports organization. It is an engineered drink to help rehydrate and replenish fluid during heavy physical activities.<br /><br />This powdered form is a more economical way of drinking Gatorade. Make sure you shake it enough to dissolve the mix. The taste is very similar to the bottled.<br /><br />I was introduced to Gatorade about 15 years ago when I played tennis with my cousin in Hawaii. I loved it especially the taste that is not so sweet as compared to other drinks. A very hot day and a ice cold Gatorade is just the perfect combination. It is very refreshing.<br /><br />Just a bit of a caution. Our family dentist warns us not to drink Gatorade on a casual basis. It is even worse than sodas when it comes to your the teeth. There is also a lot of sugar content.

review/text: My first experience with Novus brand tea was after my mother in law had gone to a coffee festival, and stocked up on tons of vendor give-aways.  Now, I buy this tea in whatever store I can buy it and whenever I can get it.  The fragrance of this tea is almost overwhelming.  I blend it with an Earl Grey and pour it over ice.  Although I do not sweeten tea, many people do, but I don't think anyone will need sweetener.  If they do, only a touch of honey.<br /><br />I like a "floral" taste, so if you do, you'll love this.  It is definitely worth spending the money to try.  Even the teabags are pretty...IMHO, they should be steeped in a clear, glass container.

review/summary: One of the top two brands of Decaf K-Cups
review/text: If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!

I hadn't tried it before, and was worried that I had made a big mistake, buying it. I was supprised after my first cup, at it's strength, and full bodied flavor. It is now my most favorite k-cup coffee. I was never into "Decaf" before, and I feel that this coffee will make, both Decaf and Regular coffee drinkers alike, very happy. Don't hessitate to try this blend, you will not be sorry.

review/text: It is difficult to find a good tasting decaf coffee. Often it's due to lack of selection and or attempt to please too many tastes. I tend to go for a strong yet "un-smoky" cup of coffee. Not too many decafs fit that bill. While this could be even a bit stronger for me it has the most body and flavor balance I've found in decaf yet...in traditional or K-Cup varieties.

review/text: We purchased two 24-count packages of Tully's House Decaf. Obviously something went wrong in manufacturing of these K-Cups.  After we began the brew cycle, very hot coffee came out over the top of the K-Cup and the compartment in many directions and only a portion of it went into our mug below.  Thinking it was only a problem with that one, we tried another.  When it happened again, we investigated more closely.  The foil seal over the top of the K-Cup is not complete.  Very hot water under pressure inside the K-Cup was forced up and out, along with coffee grounds, and sprayed quite a distance from the machine. Our Keurig is in the bedroom - what a mess!

review/text: We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig, typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.<br /><br />This is the only brand that we have purchased that has given us problems. Not only have the k-cups exploded, leaving grounds all over the machine both inside and out, but every single k-cup in the two 24-count packages has done this. At first, we thought we just received a bad batch in one of the two packages that was a part of the order, but when the k-cups in both of the packages did this for k-cup after k-cup (there wasn't a single one that did not explode and leave coffee ground in the coffee mug, machine, or outside of the machine), we knew it wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Since there is no return on food...buyer beware.

review/text: I just want to chime in with the other reviewers who noted the poor quality of these k-cups. Half of the k-cups I purchased explode in my coffee machine because the foil over the top of the cup is not sealed properly. Not only is it disappointing and a waste of money, it's a real pain to clean your machine after an explosion of coffee grounds. This is unfortunate because I think Tully's has the best quality coffee, particularly decaf, you can find out there in k-cups right now. I heard Starbucks is going to get in the k-cup business at some point. Hopefully sooner than later.

review/summary: Good coffee bad seals
review/text: Coffee rich and strong no problem. However about half broke open during the brewing process,getting grounds in my coffee and all over.  Obviously a defect in top cup seal packaging. Eventually I cut off the bottom of the cup and it relived the pressure so as to not blow seal.

review/summary: Nice tasting decaffeinated coffee
review/text: I need to drink more decaffeinated coffee. Thus, I tried this product out for my Keurig coffee maker. And I have thoroughly enjoyed the experiment! Some of the K-cup blends that I have tried are terrific, some are okay, and some don't have much taste. This product is closer to the good end of that continuum than to the bad end.<br /><br />It is labeled "extra bold." Perhaps not quite so. Still, it does have a rich taste and is a delightful way to begin the day.<br /><br />So, I am a satisfied customer and intend to keep drinking this particualr brand.

review/summary: One of the Best decaf K-Cups around!!
review/text: I love to have a cup of coffee at night but I'm always leery of how caffeine might affect me.  Tully's Decaf House Blend is perfect!!  During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker, I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!

Tullys decaff house blend has a nice Robust flavor, no acidic after taste at all..I felt like I was drinking regular coffee. As a matter of fact, Im gonna have a cup right now. Cheers!!

I even gave a cup to my husband without telling him what it was and he couldn't believe it when I told him that it was decaf. Amazon has the best price around too.

review/summary: I'd give them 5 stars if they didn't open while brewing
review/text: This is very good coffee, but nearly every one of these k-cups ends up opening at the top around the rim while brewing and leaves coffee grounds in the machine and also in my coffee cups. My wife and I have been through several boxes of these and it has been the same with every order. We haven't had this problem with any other brand of k-cups. We won't be ordering any more of these until we see from the reviews that this is no longer a problem.

But the reason I cannot give 5 stars is THREE times now I have had a brewing problem that I have not had with other brands.  TWO TIMES, the coffee went all over the brewing part and not a straight shot into the cup.  Today, I noticed several grains in my cup, so rathr than waste a cup, I strained it through a filter and enjoyed my cup.  I have bought Tully's before, but nt from this seller.

review/summary: Deliciously strong
review/text: I ordered these k cups by mistake, I meant to order the Tully's decaf French Roast, which I love.  This coffee is even better!  I usually don't care for house roasts, I was even really disappointed when I opened the Amazon box and realized my mistake.  I decided to try it instead of sending it back and I'm glad I did!  I like a darker and richer cup of coffee, and this one is nice and dark and very smooth.  It's not watery like many decaf coffees and it doesn't taste like the donut shoppe type coffees that I really dislike that decaf coffee always seems to taste like.  It also makes an excellent iced coffee on the smallest setting on the Keurig B70 Platinum.  I sometimes make iced coffee on the 5-1/4 cup setting and it still comes out pretty strong.  It's really the perfect decaf coffee.  Even better than at the coffee house!  You will not be disappointed!

review/text: Our negative rating is not about the coffee, but rather the k-cups construction.  The top was  not securely attached to the plastic cup and every cup had hot coffee spurting all over that section of our kitchen.  Of course after the first two mishaps, we just held an oversized cup up close to the bottom of the dispenser.  I hope they enhance their quality control and fix this problem because it was not just one cup.  It was every one in box.

Doesn't have that weak taste the Green Mountain decafs have. Have no fear of adding milk/creamer - this coffee keeps its flavor and makes a mighty tasty latte. Closet to Starbucks flavor I've found in a decaf K cup.

review/summary: Great taste but explodes
review/text: The coffee has a great flavor for decaf. I am disapointed in my most recent shipments. One in four of the k-cups explodes in the machine when prepared. The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.

I serve it to my husband sometimes, who hates decaf, and he likes it.  Emeril's was good, but I believe this is better.  For some guests in my house, it may be too strong.

Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.<br /><br />I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.

review/text: The breadsticks are pretty good. Many of them are broken when you receive them, but the flavor and taste is good in my opinion.
