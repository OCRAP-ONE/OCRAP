review/summary: Santana loves it....
review/text: My dog was and I repeat a WAS a Beneful eater.  However, I decided to try this brand and he loves it.  I have also purchased the chicken dry dog food.  The food is light and he can easily chew it.  There is a difference in price, the Chef Michael's brand is about $4 more than the Beneful bag at my local Shoppers.  But the higher cost is worth it for his enjoyment.

review/summary: yummy beef
review/text: My foster doxies gobbled this food right up. It arrived at the perfect time for one of them; he had been picking at his regular food and generally not feeling well, we found out he was having problems with a tooth and this softer dog food was perfect for him. Now that he's better, he still prefers it. I was happy that the first ingredient was beef, not beef by-product. My only concern is that it has food dyes, Red 40 and more, I know that there are organic vegetable dyes like beet juice that might be better for them. They've eaten half a bag in the last 2 weeks and no adverse effects. Good job Chef Michael.

review/summary: Sure to please the most finicky......
review/text: My thirteen year old mixed breed Lady loved this food from the moment we first put it in her bowl.  Typically she does not eat all of her food at one time but grazes through out the day.  She ate this each time it was put out in one single feeding.  For her it was a meal that was a treat.  Will be looking at purchasing other Chef Michael.

review/text: I wanted to try this Chef Michael's for a while so when it came I put Chef Michael's in one bowl and Beneful in the other.  Well, pretty much all three would sniff the Beneful then walk over to Chef Michael's and start eating.  The food itself didn't look too much different than regular dog food but the dogs (all three) seem to enjoy it.  They have been pretty quiet as too how much....but they finished the whole bag.  ha ha ha

review/summary: Snowball says Yum!
review/text: Our dog Snowball just ~loves~ Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin, and he will make a point of nosing around in the bowl to eat the "meaty bits" first, and then finish off the rest.  He's a fairly picky eater, but this has certainly been one of his favorites.  Our local grocery store isn't carrying this (yet) so this is one purchase for which Amazon Prime shipping will come in quite handy.

review/summary: My Dog's New Favorite Food
review/text: Our dog rarely eats her entire bowl of food at one time.  She usually eats a little and returns to it throughout the day.  That all changed as soon as I tried this food.  She quickly consumed the entire bowl when I poured it in.  In addition, she is more eager than ever for her food when I reach for this bag.  This has been surprising to me since I was sure dog food is dog food is dog food.  However, it is clear that this dog food is much preferred by our dog at least.

review/summary: Great - Just Possibly Not a Daily Food
review/text: I'm really torn on this dog food because I know my dogs really like it but i also know it really isn't filled with the best stuff for the animal. When i put it down my dogs went through the process of devouring it, treating it like a snack and not like food, and that was a good sign. They really liked it. I do try to give them treats now and again and give them at least decent food, but this was well beyond what they were accustomed to. That got me thinking whether this was the best thing for them or not and, reading the bag, I decided it wasn't. The ingredients read like a laundry list of items my vet says to avoid, and I don't think that's the greatest thing to feed them all the time.<br /><br />I guess the best thing to say on this is that it would be a superb addition to the diet of the animal, given that you did not use it as a main item. As a supplement, my dogs would love it and anything they love loves me back. since it did not clump or show any signs of being cheaper food that makes it great too, and the price really isn't bad. This was a trial bag, but i am going out to pick some up and use it when I think the dogs really deserve something they will savor.<br /><br />Thanks.

review/summary: dog knows best...
review/text: There are surely some tasty morsels in Chef Michaels Grilled Sirloin Dog Food and there are a few things which my dog wants nothing to do with. My 11 year old dog is pretty set in what she likes and does not like. She is about as discerning as a dog can be. She might have some cat in her as far as her taste buds go because she can be very picky. My dog, LueLue seems to pick some bits out and chow them down pretty fast and leaves alot lying all around her bowl. Then she also does that dog thing where she leave a little trail. I though this would be a good change for her but I can see that we are headed back to Beneful.

I feel that it is important to tell you that, as she aids significantly in this review.  With that said, she does seem to really like this food.  We are pleased and will definitely consider it in the future.  I have no clue what a finicky dog's verdict would be.  This bag is a good size for a trial run though and there isn't a shelter out there that couldn't use the unused portion if you Fido decided it wasn't up to his standards.  Daisy liked it!

review/text: My dog just plain loves Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. But, I'm not sure that's a good thing.

review/summary: It will certainly do for most
review/text: I concur with the majority of the reviews here: my dog seems to quite like this food. It feels a bit moist, looks somewhat colorful, and even smells a bit of beef. In other words, it certainly comes across as good-quality dog food. However, it's worth noting that the ingredients seem to be somewhat of a mixed bag.<br /><br />Beef is the most prevalent ingredient, which indicates a slightly higher quality of product. Look at the labels of many other bags of dog food, and you'll see that the first ingredient is usually some filler -- unfortunately, fillers seem to take up several of the succeeding slots on the ingredients list of this Chef Michael's product. So it's certainly not the highest quality you'll find, but it's definitely not the worst either.<br /><br />Bottom line, my guess is that it seems to be a bit higher quality than your average bag of dog food, and that makes it a bargain for the price. You could do better if you're willing to pay for it, but I think this food will do well for most dog owners.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but it isn't very healthy
review/text: This is like a junk food for doggies. My dog loved this, he scarfed it up and didn't leave behind a single crumb. I'd rather use this as treats than his actual daily food. Which is what I am doing with the remainder of the bag.<br /><br />Even though I am sure this dry food smells and tastes great to my dog, that is where my satisfaction ends. The ingredients aren't of high quality. It has artificial coloring, isn't a natural dog food and I think I am going to go back to Natural Balance.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a lean, high quality dog food!

review/text: My dog is really picky about what dry food she'll eat. It was only because I trusted the brand so much that I was willing to give it a try and I am happy I did.<br />Daisy has liked the food since her very first bowl - I didn't have to mix it with her old food and try to sneak it to her - really unusual for her.<br />I like the different sized pieces that are in the bag because the shapes seemed to make her eat more slowly, they probably cleaned her teeth good, and she seemed to get full on less food than what I was giving her before.<br />So far we have only tried 1 bag and part of a second but there have been no health issues and my trust in the Purina brand has paid off.

review/text: This was a great hit with the dogs (two Boston terriers). I mixed it into their blue buffalo and they gobbled it right up. However, the ingredients are kind of yucky - added colors and animal by products, as well as a fair amount of corn. I didn't see any extra itching or allergies to the food. I just prefer avoiding colors and by products.  I'll keep mixing it in as an occasional treat, though.

Using it as a snack or 1/4 of their meal, they have not had any stomach upset.<br /><br />There are dry kibble bits along with a more moist kibble.The more moist parts are flakes which seem elastic and rubbery.<br /><br />It has a savory scent which just calls them to the dinner bowl. You can separate the moister bits and keep them as reward or treats, another tip given by my vet.

review/text: My dogs loved this food. I wasn't surprised that the younger liked it. Her name should be Kirby.  Our older dog is a bit more picky, but seemed to really enjoy the food.<br /><br />As a pet owner, I'm not very fond of it. I think it's a bit pricy, especially for the amount. Also, I don't think it's good for them, too much soy, corn and added colors. I read somewhere that dogs really can't see colors so why was it necessary to add colors, especially since some dogs don't react well to color dyes.<br /><br />Even though my dogs enjoyed it, I won't be switching from our regular brand.

He looked a lot like me when I am sitting in front of a big bowl of my favorite ice cream.  You know the ice cream with all the stuff in it -chocolate, marshmellow and nuts that I should never eat very much of if I want to stay healthy.<br />But back to the dog food! The food looks more moist and appealing than most and the photo on the bag looks great so if the ingredients were not so clearly poor, I think this would be a big seller.  But  because of some really awful sounding ingredients, I doubt I will purchase more.  I will likely go back to the healthier one recommended by the vet, the one that keeps his coat beautiful and keeps him lean and fit.

review/text: My dogs seemed to like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, but after reading the ingredients, I realize there wasn't much nutrition. Yes, beef is the first ingredient listed, so that's a plus, but it pretty much went downhill from there.<br /><br />I'm not so keen on products such as soybean meal, soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn.<br /><br />These are cheap additives that do nothing but make BIG POOP because the dogs really don't digest much of these things. With 2 one hundred pound dogs, I'm not crazy about big poop in my yard. Also, corn does really nasty things to some dogs, dry skin, itchy hot spots and outer ear infections. We're sticking to Costco brand dog food, which is much more nutritionally sound.

review/text: I am not going to get into the nutritional side of this product because Brenda has done an outstanding job of covering that. The woman knows her dog food! I am simply going to tell you our dogs opinion of the taste quality:<br /><br />Beckham is a two year old whippet who is more pup than dog. He typically eats Purina One for meals, meaty bones and pigs ears for snacks and a denta-bites for his teeth. His breeder (who I am sure was glad to see the backside of Beckham) recommended the above, well, okay not the pigs ears but that is just so deliciously disgusting to impose on the kids. Beckham has also been known to eat grass, slugs, deer poo and other revolting items. What Beckham will not eat is Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Said Sirloin has been hand fed to Beckham, hidden in with his standard kibble and offered as a treat for not pulling on walks. Nope, nope, nope, Beckham is not having it. Chef Michael please report back  to the kitchen.<br /><br />Not recommended by Beckham. (Or Brenda)

review/summary: Especially good if your dog is a Vegetarian
review/text: On the back of the package there's the question "What makes a well rounded meal for adult dogs"?  Well, according to the Chef Michael recipe it's MEAL.  Though beef is listed as the first ingredient (and is about 28%) the rest of the meal is meal.  Soybean meal, corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, plus soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, ground yellow corn (corn flour), ground wheat (isn't this flour?), pearled barley and glycerin.  Additives include animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols and animal digest (duh!).  Other fun stuff like salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor (so it tastes like steak not meal) dried green beans and dried potatoes and a lot of chemicals.  If you're wondering why so many meal and other flours, it's so that they can say that Beef is the number one ingredient.<br /><br />The bag says all the stuff up above makes it "Grilled sirloin steak flavor and potato & green bean garnishes".  A "garnish" is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink, per Mr. Collegiate Webster.  In other words, it's there to make things look better, but better for who (or is it whom?).  Now my dog doesn't have that sophisticated a palate, he's a rescue from a West Virginia and he likes a garnish of dog poop with his road kill, vegetables are for 'sissy' metro-dogs.<br /><br />This is a 'well rounded meal for adult dogs' containing 23 essential vitamins and minerals. (Since so many of these Vs and Ms are supplied by those unpronounceable chemicals, I feel like I'm poisoning my dog while I'm making him healthier.)  Per the bag they (Nestles Purina PetFood Company) prepare it with care (no added artificial preservatives, just lots of natural chemicals) and you then serve it with love (love is not included, you have to supply your own).<br /><br />"Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures sustantiate that Chef Michael.... provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs.  (Just remember to change their oil every six months, rotate their paws and vacuum their coats periodically. 'I confess, I made that up.')  'The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a non-profit organization which sets standards for the quality and safety of animal feed and pet food.  ... there are non-voting advisors on each AAFCO committee who are mainly from industry, such as the National Grain and Feed Association, Pet Food Institute, and American Feed Industry Association. Unlike the FDA, AAFCO has no regulatory authority.'<br /><br />OK, let's remember that it's dog food.  Years ago we never bought dog food, the dog ate what we ate, with a little oil added from packed sardines to add luster to the dog's coat.  Dogs are carnivores.  In the wild they are scavengers and eat anything that isn't tied down, or tied down to long.  All these meals and flours are added for one reason and one reason only, 'THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN MEAT'.  Like most pet food, it's made to look and smell better to owners, most dogs could care less what it costs (unless they're an economics major) so I buy the cheapest I can find.  Make your own decision.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

Nutritionally it has a good generic base for any Dog: 28% crude protein (beef), 16% crude fat (min), 3% Crude fiber (max) and toutes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. (like the dog notices.)

review/summary: Lower-Quality Nutrition, Even if Dogs Love It
review/text: I'd heard that Chef Michaels was an affordable, good-for-your-dog food because it contained pure protein and vegetables. That's true, but there are also lots of junk ingredients that make it junk food for dogs. I won't argue that my puppy loves the taste. He's a finicky eater and has been since we brought him home, he hates seafood and lamb, and how his breeder got him to eat Taste of the Wild is beyond me, I question if she really fed him TOTW because he won't touch it.<br /><br />We can get him to eat Innova's chicken with no grains food, my preferred brand, but he will go a full day without eating anything before he'll touch it. And we even withhold treats to make sure he's good and hungry. The vet had us try a bunch of options, nothing worked, and weight loss became a worry after a full month of this pattern. Chef Michaels he eats willingly, so I've been mixing in a tablespoon into his good food and that seems to be the only way I've found to get him to clean his bowl. It's not an ideal method, but at least he's eating, and the vet said go with it and try to reduce the junk food amount over time, so we're giving that a shot.<br /><br />I won't pan Chef Michaels completely as it does have vegetables, barley, and beef in the ingredients. It's still not the best option out there though.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows, and it's the soy, ground corn, corn gluten, by-products, ground wheat, and flavorings that aren't great.<br /><br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.

review/summary: My dogs loved it but....
review/text: I've never seen my lab mixes so excited for any type of dog food before. They absolutely love it, even to the point of trying to crawl under the table to chase down a runaway piece. They eat is so fast, they're practically inhaling it so I've taken to mixing it in with their regular food. Unfortunately it really is junk food for dogs with very little nutritional content. I won't go into the long list of ingredients, but there is little to recommend it as a healthy alternative. I'm giving it 3 stars because I figure it's a balance between 5 stars for taste and 1 star for nutrition. I was also rather put off by how big the package looked, but how empty it felt. It's sold by weight, I know, but I'd estimate at least 25% of the packaging could be eliminated there was so much air in the bag.

review/summary: Like many others, I don't see this as a good long term food for pets...
review/text: Some of the other reviewers have gone into great detail about the nutritional content of this, as well as the price difference.  Not only is there no need for me to repeat it all, I don't think I could do it justice as they had.<br /><br />What I can do is agree with them - the dogs really like this.  But the dogs don't know what's good for them, and they don't know when to stop.  Our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit.  One of them, a labradoodle, scarfs up the food so fast that she has to have her small portions doled out to her in smaller portions.  And even then it seems half of it must go into her lungs since she's inhaling, not eating.  This made it even worse.<br /><br />As others have said, it's like candy for dogs compared to the other foods out there.  And while the dogs seem to really love it, the owners have to be the ones in control, and use common sense.  For a regular diet, I just don't see the content this offers as matching up to some of the better designed foods out there for pets.  Let's face it - in the multi-billion dollar pet industry, there's MORE than enough choice out there to find what's the best content and at a reasonable price.  I just don't think this is the answer for our dogs.

review/summary: Seems good to a human, not so much to a dog
review/text: Shockingly, my dog seems to prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.  Yes, if I put a bowl of beneful next to a bowl of chef michael's, she gobbles up the beneful.  I guess she can't understand the hype behind the Chef name.<br /><br />If it weren't for this basic problem, I would automatically assume that Chef Michael's would win paws down.  And if Chef Michael's is the only thing around she will eat it... reluctantly... after it sits there for most of the day.<br /><br />I was really disappointed that this was the case, as I wanted to give my sweet dog something "better" to eat.  She tends to shed if she eats poorly.  But I can't get her to eat Chef Michael's consistently enough to tell.  Oh well.  Whatcha gonna do.<br /><br />The Chef Michael's team missed the mark on taste for my little pupster.  Your dog may like it more.  I can only respond about my experience with it.<br /><br />I'll have to mix it in with the beneful to get rid of the bag (or just throw the half full Chef Michael's bag out, which rankles me a bit).  And since its sirloin perhaps it would make a good pizza topping.  But my family has these "standards".  Oh well.

review/summary: One dog loves it, the other hates it (4.5 stars)
review/text: My elderly (16 y.o.!) chow-shepard-lab mix loooooooves this food.  She will eat hers at blinding speed, then horn in on our other dog's bowl - and she never violates the "food bowl territory" of the other dog.  Considering the older dog was losing her appetite and losing weight (along with eyesight and hearing, sigh!) we are overjoyed that we've found a food she's willing to dig into. For this reason alone, I would give the product 5 stars, as I think her interest in the food may help her live a bit longer (i.e., she's putting on weight, which is a good sign - she used to weigh 48lbs, and had dropped to 37!).  That said, our chow-beagle mix, who is 7 y.o., absolutely hates the food.  I pour it into her bowl and she looks at me forlornly, sighs, then walks off into the yard in protest. I'm not sure she eats it at all (I think our older dog is eating both), which is why I'm also giving the younger dog other dog food/biscuits as a supplement.  Based upon my gratitude to Purina for creating a dog food my elderly dog loves, I'm giving the food 4.5 stars.  It would have been 5 if only I could get our other dog to eat it, too!

review/summary: This is a dog food that evidently tastes as good as it looks.
review/text: I so wanted to post a video of our dog eating Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, but my camera software would not cooperate.  I will therefore provide you a written testimony.  Shep, our rescued English Setter, has always been very finicky about his food.  Many times he walks away rather than eat something he does not care for.  Upon seeing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food in his bowl he took the time to fully investigate by sniffing and lightly tasting with his tongue and then drooling (Shep has a tendency to do that when he really likes something).  Then, he started eating and he ate and he ate, until it was all gone.  Then, like one of the three bears he examed his empty bowl numerous times in the hopes that more would appear.  He repeated this ritual with every meal until the bag was gone.  We're on our way to the store now to refill his pleasure palate.  I can highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: The Pups Loved It!
review/text: I know that most dog foods are designed to appear appetizing to the dog's owner.  This one certainly appears that way.  The smell is pleasing, and it actually looks like a meal.  Ok, not a meal that I would eat, but it looks like a meal rather than kibble.  With that said, my dogs went wild for this stuff.  I have a collie and a pointer/lab.  The pointer is the more aggressive when it comes to eating, and the collie, while older and larger, usually waits his turn at the bowl.  The moment I poured this bag into the bowl, the collie took over and the pointer was relegated to grabbing a mouthful and absconding to the other room to enjoy it.<br /><br />Needless to say, it costs a lot more than dog chow, and at this price they won't be getting it often, but this sure was a nice treat for the dogs!

review/summary: My dogs gobbled it up
review/text: I wish the ingredients were a little healthier because my two mini dachshunds really love this food. I should have read the ingredients first. The soy ingredients don't bother me as much as the food coloring does. (Added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color).  The green peas and vegetables in the mix aren't really veggies, but a kibble formed into vegetable shapes and colored to look like vegetables. I wish pet food manufacturers would spend less on making dog food look appetizing to humans and more in making it healthy for our pets.<br /><br />Although beef is the first ingredient on the list, most of the rest are grain products including soy, corn and rice. One of our dogs sometimes has a sensitive stomach and it's probably all the soy that doesn't always agree. Another ingredient is animal digest which could contain goodness knows what. I think I prefer the limited ingredient types of foods that my dogs normally eat, ones where I can recognize all the ingredients and they don't sound like something I wouldn't want to eat.

review/summary: My Dog LOVES Chef Michael's!!
review/text: Our dog grew up on Purina products and trust the name, so we were eager to try this food out on him. When I removed the bag from the box, our dog was eagerly sniffing it and seemed to be excited about the contents. When it was opened, he began to act like he does when we get his dog treats out, hopping around and begging for it. He couldn't wait for it to be poured in his dish and gobbled it right down. Unlike his normal Dog Chow that is left to eat when he is hungry, this has to be rationed or I really don't think he'd stop until it was gone. Instead we sprinkle it over top of his regular food and dole it out like a treat. He has no problems digesting Chef Michael's unlike the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006345MA">Purina Beneful Original, 7-Pounds</a> we tested on him a while ago.<br /><br />From our dog's point of view this food was "totally awesome"!

review/summary: Kind of like crack for dogs
review/text: I gave this food to my parent's dogs (country dogs that run around outside all day - a Blackmouth Cur and a Pitbull/Heeler mix). Both of them absolutely loved it and ate it a lot faster than they normally eat their food (especially the Cur). In fact, she had to eat hers a lot faster or the Pit would have been moving in on her bowl. Usually these two dogs eat their food next to each other, maybe a little bit of snapping or trying to eat each other's food but not too much. They were crazy for this stuff and more excited than usual to eat the next day. That's a really good thing if you have a dog that is finicky but maybe not so good if you have more than one dog and one of them might want to try stealing the other's food. I don't think this is the healthiest food choice but it's definitely something that dogs enjoy and is a perfect treat (or something to mix in with other foods to get them to eat it).

review/summary: Not a quality dog food
review/text: The dogs like it, as the other reviewers have said, but it doesn't seem to be a very good food for them. I wouldn't have gotten it if it hadn't been provided freely for review through the Vine program. The advertising sounds good but...<br /><br />Here are the GA numbers:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.) 28.0%<br />Crude Fat (min.) 16.0%<br />Crude Fiber (max.) 3.0%<br />Moisture (max.) 12.0%<br />Linoleic Acid (min.) 1.2%<br />Calcium (Ca) (min) 1.0%<br />Phosphorus (P) (min.) 0.8%<br />Vitamin A (min.) 14,000 IU/kg<br />Vitamin E (min.) 150 IU/kg<br /><br />Those are actually decent if not great GA figures. I think, though, that this food is a pretty good example of how to finesse GA numbers. Everything after 'beef' is mostly hard too digest filler material. Soy [except for soy hulls] is a rapidly fermenting fiber which means it doesn't do a very good job of absorbing water while being digested so the doggie may experience a laxative effect and end up with diarrhea. Yuk. My two dogs haven't seemed to have had that problem but I mixed this 4.5lb bag with about 3 pounds of very high quality food (small/regular breed version): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007794PBM">Blue Buffalo Large Breed Wilderness Chicken Adult Dry Dog Food, 24 lbs.</a><br /><br />It contains 'poultry by-product meat' which means the carcas minus the feathers. So, head, feet, gristle, etc. 'Animal digest' - google it for an eye opening description at wiki and then the other side of the story from Purina. Although Purina gives a pretty nice sounding description and I'm sure that the nutritional information is accurate, they actually confirm what wiki reports by way of ommission if nothing else. Purina can't be ignorant of what detractors say about this ingredient.<br /><br />The big chunks that are red to represent beef are soft. So if you use dry food because you avoid soft food for your dogs you won't care for this even if it is otherwise not a problem for your situation.<br /><br />I recommend looking for something else. The Blue Buffalo I linked is excellent but expensive.

review/text: After getting Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food I mixed it half and half with my dog's current food, just to avoid her getting the runs.  I could definitely tell she liked the new food since she seemed to be picking it out of her old food.  She has been eating the Costco brand salmon grain free food for years so this was a huge change for her since the second and third ingredient was some type of soy product.  However the most disturbing part is the oil.  I didn't realize it until after several pieces of kibble laid in my pantry for several days until I vacuumed it up and there were oil stains on my slate flooring.  Let me just say the Costco kibble doesn't do that.  We'll be sticking with the old brand of dog food for now, but my dog has appreciated a little variety in her diet the last few weeks.

review/text: The ingredients list on this is decent...first ingredient listed is beef.  There are still a lot of fillers (grains and meals) and several vitamins with 28% crude protein.  My test doggie liked it...didn't love it.  She wasn't sure at first about some of the pieces...set them aside and ate them later (she's not a picky eater).<br /><br />I prefer the Cal Ranch high protein dog food for an active dog (44% protein).  It costs way less too.  For dogs who do fine on most anything I'll just stick with Dog Chow...I can't see a difference with "higher quality" dog foods for most of my dogs.  Only the sled dogs/very active dogs and dogs with trouble keeping weight on seem to do better with higher protein foods.  Less active dogs just get fat on them.  I do supplement with a good amount of raw meat and fresh fruits/vegetables.  Something like this may be good for dogs who don't get good supplements to dry food.

He's a 3 year old Brittany and loves this food. Much better than the Costco stuff we tried before.<br />- The ingredients list doesn't read like a confusing blast of petrochemicals.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None, really.

Normally when we have switched foods there are some digestive upsets, but that did not happen with this brand.<br /><br />More than that she sat and ate it all when she was served. The dog food we normally give her has beef as its first ingredient and so does this. The only problem is that this is more pricy and the bag has no closure, so especially for a food she will search out, it has to be put in a metal container, which we normally do, but the bag does not stay closed. We had to resort to taping it shut twice a day - it would be nice, especially for the price if there was a zipper like closure.

review/text: We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-)

review/summary: Very Popular Chow, but Spendy
review/text: I've seen the commercials for this stuff, and they really got my attention for their sheer lack of any similarity between what they portray and me and my dog.  I don't wear modestly tight v-neck cardigans in lovely pastels with the sleeves pushed up just-so with a new crisp white t-shirt.  I don't live by myself in a stunningly designed and ridiculously immaculate apartment.  And my dog is a 105-pound golden retriever, not some yapping little toy breed that I can hold in the crook of my toned and oh so delicately furred (and tan) arm.  So is this product for that guy, or for me?<br /><br />Let's be honest here, the way this dog food looks (and is titled) has nothing to do with the dog.  This is all about creating impressions with the animal carrying the wallet.  It's clear I'm supposed to be seeing some kind of marvelous stew, a wonderful stroganoff, with glistening chunks of the choicest beef (the package calls them "tender pieces"), with delicious vegetable bits ("crunchy kibbles") thrown in for my own precious nutrition.  The bag photo even has it laid out delightfully on a wooden cutting board--I can't remember the last time I fed my dog from one of my cutting boards.  If my mouth goes all Pavlov looking at this product and remembering that for some reason they're calling it "grilled sirloin," then of course I'll want to feed it to my dog.<br /><br />So how did it taste?  Well, a taste test between Duncan's regular Kibbles and Bits and this product was somewhat inconclusive.  Chef Michael's tender pieces are definitely squishier.  They're not necessarily more moist, although I believe this is what you're supposed to think of this product.  The beef-like tender pieces were springy, kind of like beef jerky left out overnight so it's partially re-hydrated.  They tasted a little funky to me, almost like they were going bad, with a very subtle fishiness.  That may sound bad, but remember that dogs are omnivores and carrion-eaters.  The crunchy kibbles were completely indistinguishable from any other dry dog food I've ever had (yes, I was a fraternity pledge once).  The kibbles are crunchy enough, but not like breakfast cereal, not like a saltine, not like peanut brittle.  More like well-done-meat crunchy, except this is factory-pressed meal.<br /><br />The tender pieces look to me, well, like shredded scat.  Color and shape, that's it.  That's harsh, yes, but it's the truth.  I would think that since they are calling the product "grilled sirloin," then the tender pieces might have some kind of faux grill marks, but no.  The crunchy kibbles look like fake peas and little brown dog food bits, just like all the other dry dog foods.<br /><br />And what did Duncan think?  Well, he literally just inhaled this stuff.  As soon as the bag was opened he caught a whiff of it, knew it to be his kind of food, and went right for it, face into the bag with no hesitation.  The first couple of handfuls on the floor were gone in seconds, and for the seven meals he had of this stuff, it was gone in minutes.  No doubt about it, he really likes this stuff (I don't know if he's seen the commercials).  Maybe this is a function of it being something completely new to him, or this literally could be dog food orgasm chow, for all I know.<br /><br />It's important to note that within an hour of eating this, Duncan brought forth in the family room an extended, sonorous flatus the likes of which we could not recall.  Eye-wateringly powerful.  You've been warned.<br /><br />And it's expensive, which is the single reason I won't be buying more.  Having a big dog, we're going through a lot of food, usually buying the 40- or 50-pound bag.  Based on the current price for the 11-pound bag, that would be well over $80 a bag.  Sorry, but although my dog clearly digs on this chow, that price is prohibitive.<br /><br />Bottom line: Didn't taste special to me, but the dog sure did like it, and that's a plus. But it's just too expensive for a big dog.

review/summary: Not The Best Ingredients
review/text: I cannot recommend this dog food.<br /><br />Why?  because it contains poultry by-product meal.  I never give my dogs any dog food that contain by-products.  By-products are essentially the left over beaks, tails, etc. from animals that companies don't know what to do with, so they grind them up and call them dog food.  In addition, this contains ground wheat, and I've learned from past experience that wheat contributes to arthritic symptoms in some dogs.  I also don't like the "grilled steak flavor" which is obviously artificial flavoring and has nothing to do with meat.  That's how they can get away with saying this dog food has "grilled sirloin steak flavor."<br /><br />I am sorry to give a poor review.  I hate giving bad reviews.  But some of the ingredients in this dog food are just sub-par.  Sorry Nestle' Purina - I know for a fact that you make other quality products, but this isn't one of them.

review/summary: Sorry, I cannot recommend this dog food.
review/text: This dogfood is like candy to the dogs, they love it, but it is not necessarily safe or healthy.  The soy protien in this food gives them horrible gas. It's not just irritating for the owner, (I mean I have my dog on my lap all the time) but serious can be detrimental to your dogs health gas.  Yes, they will gobble it up and beg for more, but I decided it was not good for my two small dogs.  As many other reviewers have already renumerated in more detail the reasons why this is just not good, I won't say more.  But I am very picky about what I give my dogs.  They are part of my family, and if there is a hint of doubt I won't give it to them.  The gas thing cannot be good.  Purina is a reputable company, so use your own judgement, this is just my opinion.

In order for them to chew it without devouring and not swallowing it, I mix it with their regular dry food. Calms them down a bit. It's not crunchy, it's softer dry food. Very moist.

review/summary: My Dogs Surprised Me...
review/text: When I recently tested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food</a> on my dogs for another review, they dug around for the chewy/meaty pieces, and acted like savages with their dog feeder; I thought they would do the same thing with this dog food, but it was the green veggie-pieces that they dug out of the dog dish. Eventually they ate all of the pieces, but I was happy to see them take to the veggie ingredients over the meaty pieces.<br /><br />The change in their diet didn't seem to have negative affects to their overall health or their potty habits; if anything, they seemed to have more energy than usual, although they are naturally bouncy dogs.<br /><br />I would consider giving them this food again, if I could get them to stop digging for the green pieces first.

review/summary: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food
review/text: When I receive new products for Muffin I always worry she won't like them, she is a pretty picky eater. Well, from the first bite she has loved this food. She is a smaller dog (Peek-A-Poo) but she has no problem chewing on the larger chunks. I mixed it with her old brand of food so the change would not be too drastic. She was so funny because she picked out all the new stuff and left the old in the dish. I guess that she has made her choice, I will be purchasing this from now on. I am also pretty impressed with the price, it is comparable to what she currently eats, and as always, Amazon offers the free shipping.

review/summary: Appealing to our senses?
review/text: So first things first, My dogs loved it. They went for this food vs their regular food (lamb and rice flavored kibble).<br />But what this does is appeal to the owner who will visually agree to the packaging and the idea of feeding sirloin to their pets.<br />All in all, this is a fancy type of dog food, that smells very strongly (makes dogs love it more), but it as taken over the pantry and do not want this, therefore becoming unappealing to the owner.<br />The food is slightly rubbery, and seems to be semi-dry, vs regular dry dog food.<br />Also the package says to feed your dog 1 cup for every 10 lbs, that means my dogs would be eating 8 cups a day...each! I disagree with this.<br />This is a good treat for my dogs but prefer not to spoil them with this food.<br />Your dogs will love it, it just depends if you want to spend on and feed them this food.

However, soy, wheat, and corn are in there, bumping out the amount of meat by quite a bit. Dried beans and potatoes are nice, but why the artificial color? The shame of it is, there are some really fine and healthy ingredients, but to make the cost something most folks are willing to pay, there are corners cut. As an occasional mix-in, this might be ok, but honestly, after reading the label, I wish they used better ingredients and charged a bit more. I certainly would not feed this on a regular basis.

review/summary: My dog LOVES it.  1st ingredient beef, too!
review/text: My dog gives this 2 big paws up.  Now, to be fair, he likes almost any food, but I think I detected, if possible, an even greater enthusiasm than normal for this one.  When he had gobbled it up, he sniffed all over to see if possibly there might have been a crumb dropped anywhere, and then came to me to see if perhaps I felt like giving him an extra helping.  And, not that it matters, but this food does look fancier than the normal dog food I feed him, with some of the kibbles resembling hunks of meat.  I was also impressed that the first ingredient was beef, although there was also lots of other stuff that was nowhere near natural.  I would also say that the softness of the beef-look kibbles is probably not great for his teeth, but maybe that's not a problem for you if you brush your dog's teeth.  But definitely for taste, attractive look, and beef content, I give this a high rating.

review/summary: Junk food for picky dogs
review/text: I can't/won't feed this to my own dogs because of food allergies, and there's the mysterious "animal fat" and "animal digest" in this ingredient list which makes me a little nervous about which animal it came from.  Really, the ingredient list is terrible, it's a bunch of leftover food waste products made into dog food.  Beef is the first ingredient in the list, but when you add up all the forms of soy, corn, and wheat in the ingredient list, there's more junk in this dog food than beef.<br /><br />*BUT*, my family's dog is a picky eater and this Chef Michael's dog food is perfect for her because she's used to treats and flavorful table scraps (bad, bad habit that I don't approve of) and she snubs healthier kibbles.  Salt makes this kibble tasty.  With the ingredient list, this kibble reminds me of salted kinda-meaty Cheetos, complete with unnecessary food colorings.<br /><br />For my own dogs, this would be a 1-star food (honestly, I think this is junk and overpriced too for what it is), but this food does have its uses if you don't really mind what's in it and you have a picky dog and need extra flavorings to entice them to eat dry dog food.

review/text: I don't own a dog, but I do have friends who do. They own a small, fluffy white dog of a nonspecific variety named Momo. He was a stray, so they don't know how old he is, but he's clearly getting up there in years. I know they want to take good car of him, so when the chance came up to snag them a quality dog food, I did so. They fed him some of the food the other day.<br /><br />According to my friends, Momo initially turned up his nose at the food, and walked away. About twenty minutes later, he came back and started chowing down. He ate, according to them, far more than he usually does. They also commented that they personally liked the fact that it "looked like" real food.<br /><br />So there you go. Momo the dog likes the food, and his owners are pleased by it, too.

review/summary: The Dogs Ate It
review/text: I perfectly understand that the marketing of pet products is directed to the pet owner.  I have never actually had a pet demand a certain brand of pet food-- I do have cats who refuse to eat pate style cat food, which I think may be my own fault for giving in to them and buying the sliced bits in gravy when they turned their little kitty noses up at the pate.<br /><br />But anyway, the dogs definitely had a way of eating this dog food. The bits that represented steak went first.  The last bit was the green things-- which is kind of amusing because I once had a dog who absolutely refused to eat the green round things in Beneful.  She would delicately pick out all of the green things and leave them scattered around her bowl.  So when I found the green things from this brand scattered around I wondered if Lucy's ghost had shown up to protest.  Shortly after that I noticed that one of the dogs had finally eaten them.<br /><br />No one developed any stomach problems or itchies after eating it so it has a thumbs up from a human and pricked ears from three dogs.

review/summary: "Picky Dog" loved this food!
review/text: I had both of my golden retrievers try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to see if they would like it.  The 8 month old overgrown puppy will eat almost anything and he loved this dog food, which I expected him to do.  I wasn't so sure about the 9 year old "picky" eater, but she really liked this food, as well!  She will eat her regular dry kibble, but not until she is really hungry, and she will often skip one of her twice daily feedings after checking to see what is in her food bowl.  The morning she found Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin in her dish, she sniffed it, looked at me (I'm pretty sure she smiled) and proceeded to gobble up the food.  Of course her "brother" had already inhaled his and was hoping for more!<br />  This dry food is not shaped like regular kibble, in that every piece does not look or feel the same.  The best way I can describe it is to say that it looks like "dehydrated" beef stew.  The pieces of meat are irregularly shaped and flatter than most kibble, and the veggies (mainly peas and carrots) really look like vegetables.  I would describe the texture as thick, solid "flakes" rather than round or square pieces of kibble.  I detected no odor, although it must smell wonderful to the dogs.<br />  I have not used the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin for the dog's regular feedings as one dog is still eating puppy food and the other eats senior formula, so I can't really comment on the nutrition value, or how this food affects their canine digestive tracts.  What I can comment upon, is how much both dogs loved this food.  I've been using a handful at a time as "training rewards" and both dogs like the Chef Michael's food as much as their regular treats.  We can keep the dogs' regular bags of food on a closet floor to which the dogs have full access, but I've had to hide the Chef Michael's food, since I found a large golden head in the bag!  A 4.5 bag is not going to last very long at our house.<br />  I plan to discuss the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Food with my vet before feeding it to the dogs on a regular basis, but if she oks it, I will definitely purchase this dry food and add another star to my rating.  (Hopefully, it is also sold in a 20lb or 40lb size).  Until then, I'll use it as treats for the dogs, or for "dessert" on top of their present food.  If my "picky dog," who often refuses regular dog treats, eats Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, it's obviously yummy!

review/summary: Pricey Considering Ingredients
review/text: If one is looking to purchase this bag of dog food (I received one to review), the price is a bit high for the size bag considering the filler present within the food. The description makes a big deal out of the main ingredient being beef, but this is quickly rendered unimportant when one sees that almost the entire remainder of the bag is filler...including food coloring....perhaps to make the product more palatable to the server instead of the eater?<br /><br />This food can also help contribute to gas...I'm presuming that is because of the two different types of soy filler that follow neck and neck behind beef as the primary ingredients.<br /><br />I would agree with other users that Chef Michael's is best left as a treat/reward food as it breaks up a diet and may even create in-fighting for the last scraps of food...even if your pups don't usually go in for that sort of thing.

review/text: This is dog food and therefore, I did not consume it myself -- however, based on the colors and shapes of the kibbles, I think Chef Michael assumes that I will.<br /><br />My dogs ate the food just fine -- no digestive issues and no real complaints... but they are dogs... they would eat out of my cat's litter box if I let them.<br /><br />What struck me as a human is how colorful the kibbles are -- lots of reds and greens.  Really?  I'm guessing that isn't natural food color there but added to make the food look more appetizing to humans.  I'm not a natural health food nut by any stretch of the imagination but even the skeptic in me thinks that at a minimum, they are spending a lot of money on the appearance of the food where I would rather know that that money was going towards nutrition.<br /><br />Finally, I can't be sure but I do believe my dogs are actually "passing a lot more gas" since they have been eating this food.  If that is true, that is yet another reason not to use this food in the long run... my house is stinky enough as it is without the contributions of my dogs.<br /><br />[NCJVR]

review/text: This food smells good, compared to a lot of dog foods, has beef, soy, potatoes & corn in it, but ell liked. My cat likes the little pieces (I'll have to do something about that to be sure it'k OK that she's eating to fog food, or put it up or something?)<br /><br />Not at all "kibble". Looks like shredded jerky with smaller little bits in green & tan (I'm guessing soy & corn or soy & potato?)<br /><br />Well liked & disappears quickly! (practically inhaled!)<br /><br />The dog loves it & the cat even likes the smaller crunchy bits. Smells better than most pet food I've tried!<br /><br />If your dog likes beef, they'll love this! I was even tempted to try a bit it looked really good! Has added vitamin E & others for coat & intestinal tract. I'm not a vet, & don't know a lot about dog digestion, but this is a FAR cry from those round balls of who knows what. Looks & smells like real beef jerky (might even be?)<br /><br />Very well tolerated (both the dog & the cat like it!) Seems it would be easily digestible, as long as your dog digests beef OK.<br /><br />Does contain soy, and I'm guessing quite a bit, which is why I gave this 4 stars as soy that isn't fermented (along with most nuts) contains enzyme inhibitors which can be deactivated by soaking (such as with soaking almonds that BTW taste a LOT better that way!) or fermenting, which I doubt s done in the dog food, so I would investigate that further, as soy beans & nuts (at least in humans & from reading, apparently in dogs too) can reduce thyroid function, which is OK if your dog has an over-active thyroid, or Graves' disease, yet I'd look into how it is processed. I'm sure this action, if also true in dogs, like in humans can vary from individual to individual & it seems certain breeds are more susceptible to hypothyroidism than others. I've been told that some large breeds can benefit from soy, as they can be prone to hyperthyroidism. Stress also plays a factor in this in humans & I imagine dogs as well, so if you are looking for the the "best food" for your dog, you might want to get an intracellular nutritional panel (blood test by your vet) done & look at food analysis of different foods to find what is best for your dog.<br /><br />The soy may not be the best for all dogs, yet in others it may be essential to help your dog balance an overactive thyroid & if your dog's family has a history of hypothyroidism, it probably isn't the best. Best to consult your vet for your dog's needs, but I can say it gets gobbled up!

review/summary: I use it as a TRAINING TREAT, not a meal
review/text: My dogs really like this food.  It is a great reward during training.  It's hard to find a good variety of nutritionally balanced training treats, so I was happy to find this.  The yellow and green kibbles are of a typical kibble texture and a nice size for a treat for a dog up to about 50 pounds.  The softer, squishy "meaty" looking pieces are of variable size.  Most are larger than the hard kibbles.  Some are quite small -- there will be a very small portion of the bag that ends up as topping for a meal.  Nutritionally and economically, it is not as good as the Eukanubia I use as my dogs' main diet.  So I do recommend this for use as a training treat!

review/summary: My Dogs Say "Yes!" to the Flavor
review/text: The best feature about this dog food is that dogs (I have four) find it especially palatable. When it arrived, they sniffed the unopened package and would not leave its side. When it was finally offered to them (as a test for this review, of course), they were quite excited and gave it thumbs up. Note there is a package warning to mix it with old food over a number of days for an adjustment period).<br /><br />What's to like: The pieces are semi-soft and come in various shapes so they are closer to dogs' natural food in the wild. The drawback is that the semi-soft pieces will not contribute to teeth cleaning as does hard. But the dogs certainly find it more appealing and it makes their mealtime more enjoyable.<br /><br />(As I write this review, the dogs have gather round my computer as I placed the bag on the desk for referral purposes. Hope I can get through writing this piece without too much commmotion and distraction!)<br /><br />Some of the ingredients are nice: especially the vegetables (potato and green beans); there are a variety of vitamin supplements and the food definitely has a grilled sirloin steak odor. The beef is real along with grilled sirloin steak flavor.<br /><br />What is not particularly appealing is the poultry by-product meal (there is some nasty stuff in poulty by-products; four food dyes (they are labelled "colors") make the food look pretty but I would prefer the by-products and food dyes were eliminated. They seem to only serve a commercial purpose.<br /><br />Because of the semi-softness of the food, it can be served to all sizes of dogs (mine range from a chow chow to a bichon-poo). I would say if there is any problem with dogs not finding food offerings very appetizing, try  this food. In that department it's a winner.

review/summary: Fictional chef, mediocre food that my dog is inexplicably attracted to.
review/text: Clearly this new Purina line of pet food cleverly capitalizes on recent human food trends such as chef-made dinners.  The stylized food-porn photography on the packaging all target the pet owner that wants to feed the pet version of their own heat-and-eat chef-prepared meals.<br /><br />The advert:<br />Purina's Chef Michael's TV adverts suggest that "Chef Michael" is celebrity chef Michael Chiarello. However, non of the shots actually show the face of the man in the commercial although he is of similar height, build and complexion as chef Chiarello and is dressed in clothes of a style and color that Chiarello usually wears on his shows.  After some internet research, and an email to Purina, it can be concluded that chef Chiarello has nothing to do with this food. Wow! Just wow! How tricky of Purina to make a fake chef that is almost like a real celebrity chef and market their product with it.<br /><br />The Food<br />Pros:<br />+ My dog was immediately attracted to the bag when it was delivered.<br />+ My dog was really into this kibble and I managed to use it as treats for training.<br />+ It looks really nice to humans, with coloured bits making it look like it was some sort of dried pet gourmet-stew.<br />+ The first ingredient on the list is beef.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Questionable ingredient quality.<br />- The second ingredient on the list is soybean meal and the third and fourth are soy flour and animal fat.  The soybean meal and soy flour are fillers that also increase the chemical protein measurement of the food.  The fourth ingredient of animal fat from unspecified sources increases the platablity of the food to pets.<br />- Other questionable ingredients include corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn which is again a filler and is also not easily digested by dogs.<br />- Food coloring is also present in this food to make it looks appealing to us so we feel better about feeding this food to our pets.<br />- Mendaione (chemical vitamin K) is also added to the food; studies are currently being done on this chemical form of vitamin K and latest results suggest that it may be linked to liver toxicity, allergies and red blood cell abnormalities.<br /><br />My dog (after 2 weeks on this food):<br />+ My picky dog is inexplicably attracted to this food.<br />+ I can use this kibble as training treats.<br />- This food makes her have gas.<br />- This food makes her have several large greasy poops a day.<br />- My dog has been gagging in the morning and has thrown up undigested food a few times over the past 2 weeks. She seems to be intolerant of this food.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If this food works for your dog and your wallet, then this is s good food for your dog.  My dog seems to be be intolerant of this food although she really wants to eat it.  As I'm not looking at this food too highly mainly because of its lack of high quality ingredients and the semi-misleading adverts, I'm not too upset at this fact.  I'll be moving her back to her old food and donating the rest of this bag to the local shelter.

review/summary: The Dog Liked It, But I didn't!
review/text: I was really surprised that our dog actually seemed to like this.  Usually, he is extremely picky about his food, and he normally does not like anything not chicken.  However, he seemed to enjoy this.  I thought that was great, until I checked out the ingredients.  While beef is listed first, which is important, the two next listed are soy and soy by products.  While they do have value as proteins, the value is no where near that of real meat, and the price per ounce is higher than what I pay for a dog food with lots more real protein value.  When it comes to dog food, all protein is not created equal.  If your dog is larger or a working breed, this food really will not give him the best protein bang for your money.  Most of the other ingredients are filler and empty calories. I think the coloring is a real poor choice.  The artificial chemicals used in coloring dog food are really just added to make the human consumer feel that the food is better balanced and has more variety, the color has no positive impact on the health of the dog.  I prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients.  Not to mention that with the higher price per ounce, it is less filling and the dog will want to eat even more of it to fill the need for real protein.  While it may taste good to him, I would rather give him healthier food that is a better deal money wise and health wise.  I will let him eat it, since he does seem to enjoy it, but I am thinking of it more as a treat type item, and definitely not a regular part of his diet.

review/summary: Bow wow WOW!!
review/text: Pet products are always hard to review. You can really only base it on two things: does your animal eat it and is it good for them?<br /><br />We tried this food with three dogs. Kozmeaux (Shih tzu - Bijon frise mix), Gator (American Staffordshire terrier) & Grizzy (Husky-Chow mix). The larger dogs, Gator and Grizzy, will eat just about anything you will feed them, so it was no surprise when they enjoyed this dog food. The surprise came with Kozmeaux, who is a notoriously picky eater. He actually liked this food. So, this food passes the taste test.<br /><br />Next comes healthiness. Unfortunately, this food fails greatly in that area. It earns a 1 out of 5 stars from DogFoodAdvisor, with a large portion of its ingredients falling into the "controversial" category. Also, despite beef being listed as the first ingredient, it was found by analysis to contain only a "modest amount of meat", thus earning its one star rating.

review/summary: My dog likes it ...
review/text: One of my dogs is a picky eater.  You wouldn't think this would happen, but it does.<br /><br />Well, she appeared to enjoy this food quite a bit.  Maybe it helps that it has a variety of textures and looks like real food (as opposed to pelleted kibble).  Maybe it's the smell, which seems more like actual meat and vegetables.  Hard to say.<br /><br />The good news is that she cleaned her bowl (for a change) and wagged her tail the whole time she was eating.  I would recommend that anyone whose dog does not require special diet (our other dog does) give this food a shot.

review/text: The nuggets do have a "real food" look to them, though it was hard to tell if they were actually dried vegetables or flavored nuggets.<br /><br />A softer dry food, it had a bit more aroma than other brands.<br /><br />My dogs were excited about it when added to their regular dog food for a few days.<br /><br />Though, after time, I think they realized it was dog food and would hold out a bit for the little touches of people food I normally give them.<br /><br />The ingredients look decent for dog food.  A good choice if buying higher end supermarket dog food.

review/summary: My Dog Loves The Beef, The Brown Hard Pieces Not So Much
review/text: I like that this dog food has beef chunks and vegetables in it. I know some people are upset about the soy, but I don't see it as an issue with my chihuahua "Tequila". Tequila is very picky about his dog food and does not eat hard brown dog food for some reason. With this dog food being multi-colored and having beef pieces I was hoping he would eat all of it.<br /><br />Tequila perked up the second I opened the bag. You could tell that he loved the smell. I gave him one of the beef chunks and he immediately devoured it. I filled his bowl with the food and he excitedly ran over to it and started eating. When I walked into the kitchen later, there were hard brown chunks of food placed everywhere throughout the room. Dang dog! He did eat everything else in the bowl. So, he likes it better than a lot of other dog foods. As far as I know, there is not a dog food on the market that he will eat all of....so it gets four paws up from him. I would buy this food for my pup again.

review/text: I really tried to get my dog to eat some of the food from the bag that I was sent to review. I offered it to her several times. I even resorted to trying to wrap it in bits of ham the way that we administer pills to her. She is very picky and sometimes once you can get her to at least taste something she comes around and decide she likes it.<br /><br />In this case, it didn't work out. She ate the ham and spat out the dog food. After repeating this on several different occasions I took the hint and quit trying to get her to eat the food. For whatever reason, she's just not going for this one. It's not the healthiest of dog foods, anyway, so I'm not planning to give it another shot or try another flavor any time soon.

review/text: The Chef Michael's dog food by Purina is great. Usually my dog "Champ" takes a few minutes to decide if he likes a new food or not, but he dove right in and ate this food so quickly it was almost comical. I didn't have to mix this food with this because it was already very appetizing to him. There has been no problems so far with his digestive system and his coat is still shiny so I think that its doing him good and I'll use this as more of a treat than as a meal so that when he behaves, I'll reward him with this. Good job Purina my Champ loves this dog food!!

Perhaps it is a place that has a special steak, or perhaps our wife or our mother makes a special family dish that we savor.<br /><br />For those of us that love our pets, we sometimes want to offer our pets the same kind of treat. If this is you, Chef Michael has just the right food for your doggy's fancy. Made with good meat, what the company describes of "garnishes" of potatoes and green beans, and "prepared with care", this dog food attempts to spoil your puppy with dog food that promises healthy, yummy goodness.<br /><br />Our dog enjoys this food. We can't afford to serve it to him everyday, but we will pull it out once in a while.

review/summary: Bow-wow-WOW!!!
review/text: There are three dogs in our house: I-Don't-Eat-Dry-Food, I'll-Eat-Any-Kind-of-Food, and I'll-Eat-AnyTHING. We fed all three Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food at the same time but separately so we would know who ate what. Rocky (the dog that eats everyTHING)attacked his bowl with gusto and was begging for more. Mr. Peabody (the dog that eats anything edible) wolfed down his portion. The big surprise was that Charity, who will NOT eat anything but two flavors of Mighty Dog, went after this food like either a) she hadn't eaten in six months, or b)it's her most favorite food in the world. She gets fed twice a day, so it couldn't have been "a."<br /><br />Rocky's begging for more was also a surprise. Although he'll eat anything (eyeglasses, lightbulbs, birdhouses, ant traps, flea collars, etc.) he's never before begged for more as soon as he's finished (although he will check the other dogs' dishes just in case they missed a morsel).<br /><br />Please note: my five-star rating does not reflect how I would rate this product, which I did not sample, but on the dogs' enthusiastic response.

review/text: The dog and I disagree.  She loves it; I don't.  The title is misleading it states Grilled Sirloin, but it is based largely around soybeans, corn and wheat -- among the first few ingredients; this typical of most Purina products.  My vet has warned me about potential allergies like corn & wheat.  It also contains artificial colors, such as Yellow 6 and Red 40.  Artificial coloring this has been known to lead to bladder, and/or urinary track issues.<br /><br />Even when I fed her the recommended amount, 1 cup per 10 pounds, she seemed to remain hungry.  I don't recommend as a daily feed but, as a supplement - she gets to gobble it up & I don't have to worry about her nutrition or health.

Their owners feed them Purina Dog Chow but once we opened the bag and pour a bowl full for each they dove right in and went scurrying to the bag when we put it down-- something that didn't happen with Purina.<br /><br />When they came back, our neighbor, Ricardo, commented on how much the dogs seems to prefer the Chef Michael's.  Now, I don't know what they're paying for the Purina or if the Chef Michael's would be a treat here and there, but one thing is certain-- The Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin made quite an impression on those dogs.  They really, really love the taste of this stuff.

review/summary: My Dog LOVES This Meaty Sirloin Treat!
review/text: My dachsund just gobbles this up right away, he LOVES LOVES LOVES this grilled sirloin!  I mixed it with it Beneful, so as not to switch dogfoods on him right away and upset his small stomach, and he always picks through and nom nom noms the sirloin meaty pieces straight away before eating the rest of the dry food later, thats how much he loves Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food.  Dobey is pretty picky, too.  Often his food sits around all day and he only eats as he gets hungry, but now the second it hits the bowl, he swoops in for the kills and just makes light of CM dog food, then takes his time as usual with the rest of his food, lol.  Plus this is much healthier than his other dog foods we've been through (Meijer Dog Brand and Purina Beneful), so even though it is more expensive, it seems the cost is definitly worth it.  My dog insists I continue with this brand, lol.  He absolutly salivates now and stands by his bowl when it's empty, which he has NEVER done before.  He doesn't beg for people food nearly as much (still for meat, yes, but not caring as much for anything else), and when I say my dog begs, he has very good manners which involve just sitting and watching me eat lol.  He couldn't care less unless it's meat.  This new dried food just OWNS everything else he's ever had.  Highly recommended, the price might be higher but it's also healthier for your dog baby and he will just love and appreciate you and the food so much more!  I've never seen my little guy so active as he's been since eating this lately, I can't get him to come in from outside, and he's such an indoor dog, so that's a good thing, too!  5 stars all the way for me!  Just wish it was a little cheaper.

review/summary: Candy for Dogs
review/text: Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak dog food is candy for dogs. They, mine included, seem to snarf it up like kids love junk food.  The problem is that it IS junk food. It's filled with ingredients that should be avoided but are likely to be highly palatable to dogs and may also be appealing to their owners. Doesn't Grilled Sirloin Steak sound yummy?<br /><br />Let's start with the easy part, price. I feed my dog dry Eukanuba. To compare,  Chef Michel's costs 14 cents an ounce vs. 9.4 cents an ounce for Eukanuba. It is even more expensive considering that it contains 2% more moisture than Eukanuba.<br /><br />Now, what's the problem with the ingredients in Chef Michael's?  Here's the list of what's in it:<br /><br />Beef,  soybean meal,  soy flour,  animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice,  soy protein concentrate,  corn gluten meal,  ground yellow corn, glycerin,  poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Here are the questionable ingredients, in order of volume in contents:<br /><br />Soybean Meal and Soy Flour: the second and third largest ingredients in Chef Michael's. After removing most of the oil from soybeans by a solvent or mechanical extraction process, grinding the remaining flakes gives you "soybean meal." "Soy flour" is another byproduct of soybean processing. These are cheap sources of protein filler used to boost the protein content of dog foods. This type of protein does not provide the dog with as much usable protein as does fish, chicken, lamb, beef or other meats. All proteins are not equal in value to the dog.<br /><br />Animal Fat: the fourth largest ingredient, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal fat in dog food is obtained from the tissues of mammals and/or poultry in the commercial processes of rendering or extracting. This means ANY animals, including the "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse. This is NOT a quality ingredient.<br /><br />Brewers Rice: the fifth ingredient, is the small milled fragments of rice kernels left after milling whole rice.  Although it has calories, it has little nutritional value.<br /><br />Soy Protein Concentrate: what remains of soybeans after removing the water soluble carbohydrates from the beans.  Similar to soybean meal and flour, this is an inexpensive way to boost protein, but contains a very low quality of protein.<br /><br />Corn Gluten Meal: yet, another plant-based protein booster. Gluten is the residue remaining after corn has had most of its starchy carbohydrate washed out of it.  It has little nutritional value, and is used mainly as a filler and binder.<br /><br />Corn: an inexpensive filler with little nutritional value for the dog.<br /><br />Poultry Byproduct Meal: a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste made from what's left of slaughtered poultry after all the prime cuts have been removed.  This includes almost anything left after the actual meat has been removed: organs (the nourishing part), feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat). Although, by-product meals are meat concentrates and contain nearly 300% more protein than fresh poultry, they are less digestible than chicken meat. Also, there is absolutely no control over the quality and consistency of poultry and other meat byproducts.<br /><br />Wheat: See the comments for corn, above.<br /><br />Animal Digest: a broth made of animal by-products that is usually sprayed onto the dry kibble to improve its taste.  Although it cannot contain hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice, it is made of unspecified parts of unspecified animals. As with animal fat, there is no control over quality or contamination and may include "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse.<br /><br />Artificial Colorings: solely to appeal to the dog owner. These ingredients are of no nutritional value and are controversial.<br /><br />Menadione: a controversial form of vitamin K linked to liver toxicity, allergies and the abnormal break-down of red blood cells.  It is unnecessary in dog food.

Large amounts of soy give my dog (just a year old) horrendous gas.  I actually didn't read the label before I fed it to him which was completely my fault.

review/text: Our dogs love this tasty dog food.  However, our dogs have self-regulated their eating for years.  We can leave food out, and they eat when they want and have remained fit and trim.  However with this food, there is no self control.  They finish a bowl at a time and compete to get to the bowl.  So we are back to our previous dog food so we can get the weight back down and go back to the self-regulated eating.  I knocked this food by a star for its artificial ingredients including food coloring (I guess the colors are more for the owner's enjoyment), and another star for the large, chewy chunks which are not good for their teeth.  Clearly a mass-market product.  Folks that like to buy leaner, natural foods for their pets should avoid this product.

review/text: Go to Brenda Frank's excellent and compelling review and it is what I agree with completely.  Very good job Brenda and cannot think of anything you have left out.<br /><br />I found this from the University of Pennsylvania on the issue of feeding soy to animals:<br /><br />Soy has been linked to gas and deadly bloat in dogs. It is high in purines and is therefore a completely inappropriate protein source for urate-forming dogs. It is also high in silicates and promotes the formation of silica stones.<br /><br />This is just a small sample of the harm soy can cause your dog.<br /><br />When the world was touting the advantages of soy I jumped on that bandwagon and within time I became very sick.  I will not do that to my dog.<br />Kidney stones? Have you ever had kidney stones? well I have and it is extremely painful and I do not wish for my dog to endure it.<br /><br />I am a reviewer for Amazon and love doing this and I always try to give my best review being fair and objective.  This time I was thrown a curve, this is the first 1 star rating I am giving to one of the products that Amazon has offered to me for review.  My dog means the world to me and to even consider giving him something that is this harmful is not going to happen.<br /><br />Sure beef is the first ingredient but the following ingredients are so against anything I will feed my dog.<br />My dog has been fed raw meat, ground and frozen to kill harmful pathogens, for the past few years. My vet does not like this practice but admits my dog is one of his healthiest patients.<br />I was wondering if I was not being fair to my dog and felt he may like to try some kibble for a change.  But when this came and I read that it contained so much soy and soy byproducts I decided that my dog is getting a much better diet than this food can offer.<br />I am sorry I cannot recommend this product in all good conscience.

review/summary: Not a Crumb left behind ! (n__n)
review/text: I saw the commercial for this and thought I'd give it a try. My dogs are very picky eaters and often leave kibble behind in their bowl. I end up having to throw them out cuz they refuse to eat them again. I normally buy a bag of dog food with a variety of flavors and textures like Chewy pieces and meat filled nuggets, etc but often time they leave certain flavors/kibble behind. But when I purchased two bags of the Canine Creations ... OMG ! Not a Crumb nor Kibble was left behind. I believe it's made from freeze-dried beef and kibble pieces. Moose *One of my dogs* can be a pig sometimes when he comes across something delicious. He won't share with his sister. This is one of them. The daily recommended feeding is 1 cup so I put one cup but Moose would eat every last bit and not leave any for his sister. I tried maybe 2 cups so they'll be some left but then he'd just eat all 2 cups. I tried separating their bowls but she won't eat without her brother. So I just hand feed her and let him eat outta the bowl. I know spoiled but Chef Michael's Canine Creation is FOR SURE thee best Dog Food I have purchased. I'm gonna be continually purchasing these for my dogs from now on. If I could I'd actually rate this 10+ stars !!

review/summary: Dog rating: 5 stars. Human rating: 1 star.
review/text: My dog devoured this stuff like she was starved, so I know she would give this product a 5 star rating. As her owner, the only one can read the ingredients, I give it a 1 star.<br /><br />The amount of soybean, soy flour, soy protein, corn products and wheat is, hands down, the worst thing to give an older dog with a weak digestive system. The product may have all the vitamins and supplements needed for a balanced diet and yes, it does have "gilled sirloin steak flavor", but it's not a good everyday meal for my dog. Also, the poultry by-product meal ingredient just grosses me out.<br /><br />The $9.99 price for 4.5 pounds might also be cost-prohibitive for most dog owners. So, much to my dog's dismay, this is not a product I will be purchasing for her in the future. (Sorry Millie!)

review/summary: Dog likes it but after reading the label I don't
review/text: My bad - I got sucked in by the Chef Michael name. I know he is a famous chef so I thought he would have the integrity to only sell his name to a high quality product line. After reading the ingredient list I'm not so sure. Too much soy, not enough protein. Plus all the low quality by-products in it, I'm not going to let my dog eat anymore. Sure my dog loved it but I love him too much to feed him garbage.

review/summary: Your dog will eat it but it doesn't mean they should!!
review/text: Yes, the first ingredient is meat, but do not be fooled. The following ingredients include multiple soy ingredients to make up most all the protein content. All the soy and corn ingredients are conventional which means they are cheap, GMO, ingredients. The unimpressive ingredient list also includes multiple artifical colors...these are for the owner's benefit. If you want a healthy dog that lives a long time, find a better, natural dog food that doesn't rely heavily (if at all) on grains(Amazon offers a multitude of options). Dogs aren't designed to eat such high amounts of grains. When factoring cost remember that dogs won't need to eat as much if it is quality food, and ultimately you'll spend less on vet bills.

review/summary: Not impressed - food coloring in dog food?!?
review/text: Our dogs ate this food perfectly fine, but then again, they eat just about anything. We have a Weimaraner and a Husky. Both seem to love the smell and dove right in. My husband said he thought he saw some of the big chewy pieces in the dogs' poop the next day...maybe they aren't getting digested fully?<br /><br />I, like other reviewers, wasn't impressed with the ingredients list. Lots of soy and corn and by-products. Also, they have added colors! Really? Who is eating this...dogs! Dogs don't need colored bits. This is dog food being marketed toward humans who like colors. Silliness.<br /><br />The "chewy" bits are more rubbery feeling than "tender" and "meaty". Also, it seems pretty expensive for something that is loaded with soy and corn and by-products. The more I think about it and write this review the more I'm thinking it's more like a 2-star dog food. Not impressed.

review/summary: When did our pets become gastronomes?
review/text: The 150# Lab liked this product; the tiny Chihuahua turned up her nose.  Of course the Lab will eat most anything and the little princess must have her deli-turkey.  Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food seems to be a run of the mill grocery store pet food made by Purina with a yummy package photo to attract the humans who purchase these products.<br /><br />The ingredient list certainly has a lot of grains which can be viewed as cheap fillers to boost the profit margin for the manufacturer and not the nutrition value of the pet food.  To me this is just another bag of fancy pet food marketed to people who make their decision by looking at the picture on the package and not reading the label.<br /><br />I've noticed that several other reviewers questioned the ingredient "Animal Digest" or wondered what it is.  I looked it up and the unappealing definition is: (actually I'm not going to post but you can go to Wikipedia and see for yourselves).<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food is not a bad product; just another in a long line of Purina Pet Foods.  More affordable than the ones your Vet pushes, more affordable than the Chihuahua's deli-turkey but still more expensive than many other reputable brands.  And what's with this "Chef Michael"?  When did our pets become gastronomes?

review/summary: Our dogs love this food and treat it like a snack, it looks and smells good to me
review/text: We have Chihuahua's and they absolutely LOVE this food so much that it's like a snack to them. In fact the first couple times I filled up their food bowl they looked at me like wow you are giving me a whole bowl of snacks. Between the two of my dogs they will easily devour a medium size bowl in 20 minutes. Otherwise they may take all day to eat a bowl.<br /><br />I can't say I blame them because it looks and feels just like pieces of freeze dried steak with veggies included. Not that I would ever want to try but if I had to eat dog food this is what I would choose. I can honestly say that I think this is the most interesting dog food that I have ever seen.<br /><br />I will be giving them this food mixed with their regular food for now otherwise they will eat way too much.

review/summary: My Dog Won't Eat It
review/text: I would have thought my 2 year Corgi would have liked this, but he reluctantly ate only one bowl and then stopped eating it altogether. I left it out for him 24 hours before I decided not to let him starve, so I went back to his old food. I don't know why he doesn't like it. The food itself is kind of funny looking: the meat particles look like exploded, freeze dried chunks. Artificial looking. There are regular, round, colored morsels representing the vegetable part of the mix. I can't really comment on the rest of it. Never seen him reject a dog food before.

review/summary: It scores about a 5 out of 10 on quality, a 2 on price.
review/text: This is far from the worst dog food on the shelf. However, MUCH better foods are available for MUCH less money.<br /><br />If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you probably won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), this food includes corn. Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. The only good thing about this food is that beef is the first ingredient. After that, it goes downhill fast. There isn't another good ingredient until you get to dried green beans, and there's practically none in the bag (calcium phosphate and salt both come before the green beans). And that's the only other decent ingredient in the whole bag.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word "corn" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position ("meal" is okay; just means dried meat. "By-products" are not okay: that means ground up bones and toenails). This food does okay based on this one metric. Doesn't make it great though.<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, pedigree, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the "good food usually costs more" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />This food is incredibly expensive, over two bucks a pound. You can do a lot better. For that price, you can get any of the highest quality dog foods available locally.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the "dog whisperer" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the "but my dog likes this brand" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy.

review/text: If my dog likes something, he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn't, he'll give it a sniff and walk away.  He really liked Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food.  The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed, which seems unnecessary.  The first ingredient is beef, but there are a lot of filler ingredients as well, including "animal digest" and "poultry by-product meal".  Google those terms if you want grossed out. It's probably a decent dog food for the price, but if I continue to feed it to my dog, I will supplement with fresh meats, fruits and vegetables.

review/summary: The dog likes it
review/text: When I opened the bag the dog food almost smelled like food a human could eat, not that I was willing to test that theory ... but it's definitely the best smell ever from a bag of dog food.<br />The chunks are a good size for a medium-sized dog and mixed in are crunchy kibbles, but better than that, the chunks have a slightly softer-then-usual consistency, so the dog can chew them easily and appreciate more of the flavor, IMHO.<br />Because it's not the best thing to do to instantly switch a dog over to a new diet (you should do it in stages), I've been using a handful of the dog food as a treat after filling my dog's bowl full of his usual food, and he seems to think it's an acceptable luxury.<br />Dogs need a high protein diet, so anything will real meat in it is going to be a good for him/her. Chef Michael's bag doesn't say exactly what percentage of the food is protein, but it claims to have real beef as its #1 ingredient. The dog food includes potatoes and green bean garnishes (whatever that means - to me a garnish is for decoration) and 23 essential vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, none of the ingredients are organic.<br />Overall, I'd buy this if I had a smaller dog I wanted to give good food to, but the cost is a downer if you are feeding a larger animal.

review/summary: Chef Michael's
review/text: I admit, I have a picky little terrier/mix and so she can't bark for all dogs, but she did not care for Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin at all.  She is used to the chunkier, moist food, so maybe that's the reason.  I poured some in her bowl and she sniffed of it, looked at me, and then walked away.  The food sat in the bowl all day.  She didn't eat any of it.  I felt guilty after awhile because she just refused to eat it.  But, I let it sit there.  The next day, she still hadn't eaten any of it.  Knowing she must be very hungry, I got rid of the Chef Michael's and gave her some of her usual food.  She scarfed it right down.  So, for my dog anyway, I can't give this dog food a great rating.  Sorry.

They don't know when to quit with this food.  Chef Michael has definitely created a tasty meal.  I'm not that thrilled with the ingredients.  The first ingredient is beef and that is good, but too much grain after that.  I prefer more meat and less grain.  But, as for the taste, like I said my dogs can't get enough of it.  I don't think I will buy this as their regular kibble, but definitely for an afternoon treat.
