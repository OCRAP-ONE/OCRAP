review/text: I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.  Many women in my family use it as well.  This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation.  I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive.  I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :)  I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing!  LOL

review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: These bars are very tasty.  And I got a low sales price so they were much less overpriced than such bars usually are.  But I consider them to be more like slightly-less-sweet cookies than like health bars -- not that there's anything wrong with that.  They come two thin ones per pouch, so though you get 72 total, there are only 36 pouches.  And most people would consider one pouch to be one serving, so you're getting 36 servings here, not 72.  Also, the bars are extremely crumbly so I suggest having something underneath when you eat them to catch all those crumbs (or have a cordless vacuum handy if you eat these in the car).

review/summary: BEST fo all the FLAVORS! **** 46c per packet****
review/text: Like most of us I bought these for a snack. Great for emergency snack to at 160 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).<br /><br />These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.<br /><br />The APPLE CRISP is my favorite flavor!<br /><br />GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46 cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!<br /><br />Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 6 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 11 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium. Protein 3 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 2 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.<br /><br />Crunchy: These can be messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.<br /><br />For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!<br /><br />I also have the chocolate and they are very good, but this is my favorite<br /><br />Enjoy, I do.

review/text: I've long since been a Nature Valley fan and regularly buy a variety pack at one of my local 'big box' stores but, the price I could get by utilizing the 'subscribe and save' feature was, by far, superior to that of the big box.  They arrived fresh, in date, and 'in tact'.  I must say, I was a bit worried that they'd be granular granola by the time they were shipped/handled but, that simply didn't occur.  Two thumbs up!

Most of the time you'll see the Oats N Honey, Peanut Butter, and Maple as the only flavors stocked in stores.  I was lucky to find a local grocery which sells these, in addition to the Pecan flavor.

review/summary: Wow, APPLE, another real winner from Nature Valley !!!
review/text: Ever since I had my first Nature Valley Granola Bar I have never purchased any other brand. I love the fact that they are so crunchy. (My husband likes chewy ones, and he buys his and I buy mine). I always have some in my car in case I get hungry. That way there is no temptation to go to a drive thru for fast food! I have never seen this APPLE flavor before, and I could hardly wait to get the box from AMAZON open. There is NO flavor of NV granola bars I don't like, but this flavor became my instant second "favorite" (after Peanut Butter). When I eat these in the car I break the package in thirds cross wise (breaking BOTH of the bars), then I go back and break each to those sections in half lengthwise of the package. Then I split the package open the length of its seam and put it where I can reach it. By doing this I generally get 12 fairly uniform pieces and very few crumbs (which I eat later when the car is not moving). This method works well anywhere you want to eat them and definitely seems to generate far fewer crumbs.<br />I ORDERED THESE AS A SUBSCRIPTION JUST BASED ON HOW GOOD ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS OF NATURE VALLEY ARE.<br />NOTE: Another flavor I have never heard of: Vanilla Nut is listed on Amazon as "out of stock" with a place you can sign up to be notified when they are again in stock. They've been rated very well by past Amazon Purchasers so I am waiting with a dripping tongue (my dogs taught me that).

review/summary: boricha in Korea, Mugicha in Japan, any way you spell it, is refreshing
review/text: The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.  You must try some.

review/summary: Exactly What I Wanted
review/text: I spent last summer in Japan, and recently found myself missing the refreshing taste of barley tea.  The tea tastes exactly as I remembered. I dropped a single bag in a liter of water and left it in the fridge for two hours, and there was my tea.<br /><br />The smell of the tea bags pre-tea is a bit offputting, but it's well worth putting up with for the tea.<br /><br />Also, the bags are not for individual cups, but for pots or pitchers. This is what I wanted, but make sure you aren't expecting smaller tea-bags made for individual cups.<br /><br />Also, good deal for the price in my opinion.

review/summary: Mugicha hits the spot!
review/text: Mugicha is so delicious, especially when ice cold.  It really quenches thirst and has a nice, slightly astringent flavor.  It was the first thing I consumed when I first went to Asia, specifically Korea.  I drank it a lot in Japan too.  The Japanese drink it mostly in the summer but I like it year round.  Enjoy a glass today.  Oh, and it is so simple to make, just put a bag in a big jug and add cold water and put in the fridge, it is ready in 2 hours.  So easy!

review/summary: OK but not the best
review/text: First, this product is overpriced on Amazon... you can easily get this much cheaper at an oriental grocery store in most areas.<br /><br />Second, I found this tea to be good but it was just ok. I prefer buying roasted barley seeds from an oriental grocery store and making the tea that way. I wanted to try the tea bags for their convenience as the aforementioned method is not as convenient. However, the taste difference between making it the real way and using convenient tea bags is notable enough that I would not use this particular brand of tea bags (note: other vendors sell the tea bags will the barley seeds but too expensive).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />1. For convenience, it is a great product. However, for great barley tea, try doing it the real way with roasted barley seeds... the seeds are cheap (more characteristic of the Korean way)!<br />2. Buy from an oriental store if one is available in your area to save money - not Amazon!<br />3. Anyway you cut it, barley tea is a great tea!

review/summary: Tepid barley flavor disappointed
review/text: I really enjoy the natural decaf property of barley tea. I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching.

review/summary: More than it's worth
review/text: I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water.

All three push their bowls around the kitchen floor licking up every small bit they have left and then lick the other dogs bowls just to make sure they haven't missed anything. A very healthy food and if it looks that good to you, you could eat some too. It's made in a facility that also makes "human" food so it wouldn't hurt you if you were very hungry and had nothing else to eat.

review/summary: The perfect Hoisin sauce! Great in stir fry for sure!
review/text: I just used my new wok to make a stir fry, and took a gamble on this Hoisin. I usually use one from an Asian foods store. WOW, What have I been missing all this time!!?! Dynasty brand is so much better, deeper, and well...less weird than the type I was using. I didn't even know what I was using was that bad, I enjoyed it until I tried Dynasty. Now I'll never go back.<br /><br />It has that earthy, rich flavor that you can never quite identify when you go to a Chinese restaurant. I used to think I just needed to add more soy sauce to make my stir fry or beef and broccoli taste like it does when I get takeout. No. It's the hoisin!! You don't need much, but this will bring out that depth and richness you want in a sauce, thick or thin, to really taste wonderful.<br /><br />Personally, I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies (I know, life is short, frozen is okay sometimes!) and a handful of shrimp and a block of tofu cut up. I added about 1/3 c soy sauce (kikkoman, of course!!) and a dash, probably a 1/4 teaspoon or so of Dynasty Hoisin, mixed well and DANG! That was so good!!! If you like a lot of sauce you could totally double or triple it, adding hoisin to taste. I also added about 1/8th teaspoon oyster sauce, another one of those "Why is this beef and broccoli so good??" items, but you could leave that out.  Also, you could add cashews and sub chicken for shrimp and make cashew chicken! Yum! Enjoy!

review/text: Ok.  I've been making a lot of Vietnamese spring rolls at home with peanut sauce; they're surprisingly really easy, but I need a lot of Hoisin to make the peanut sauce.  Ran out of real Hoisin Sauce, and because I didn't have the time to go to the local Asian market, I took a chance with Dynasty (got it at Wal-mart).  The best thing I can say about the Dynasty Hoisin Sauce is that it's a small bottle, so I didn't feel too bad throwing it in the trash.  IT IS REALLY BAD!  There's no way anyone who likes to eat yummy food could possibly rate this sauce over 1 star.  I would give it negative stars if I could because I find it offensive to eat food that tastes so wrong.  I'm completely baffled by the 5 star reviews.  TIA?  Stroke?  Alzheimer's?  Tumor?  There's got to be a reason beyond just not knowing any better.  In my humble opinion, Koon Chun hoisin is the gold standard.

This Quaker cereal is different and I hope they don't cheapen it over time like the others are doing.<br />But $21 for a 56 ounce box????  Are they out of their mind??!!  One 28 oz box cost $4.50 in the grocery store, so 56 oz would cost $9.  Where do they get off charging $12 more is a mystery to me.  Unless I'm reading this incorrectly, and they are selling several 56 oz boxes for $21.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/1/2012: I see they have reduced the price from $21 to $11.24.  But it's still not $9 like it would be at the store, and what would shipping add to it?

review/text: Finn Crisp Multigrain are very tasty very thin "crackers" each 1 5/8 x 4 3/4.  Finn Crisp are wonderful with melted cheese (about 20 seconds in a microwave).  They can be used anyway you'd use crackers, with the benefit that they are less fragile, less likely to spontaneous disintegrate with the first bite---so Finn Crisp are actually better than crackers for dips and spreads and such.  In fact, a very tasty, very healthy snack (if you aren't counting every calorie) is simply a thin layer of mayo on a Finn Crisp.<br /><br />I suppose Finn Crisp are healthy, a good source of fiber, with minimal processing, no preservatives, and such.  However, Finn Crisp are simply my favorite crackers.<br /><br />OTHER VARIETIES<br />Multigrain Finn Crisp have a mild neutral flavor, excellent with very delicate cheese.  Finn Crips original has a slightly sour flavor, like (unseeded) rye, pumpernickle or sour dough bread.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJK0B6">Finn Crisp Original, Delicately Thin Rye Crispbread, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a> If you like the flavor of seeded rye bread (i.e., with caraway seeds) try the Caraway version (my favorate).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSPW">Finn Crisp Caraway Thin Rye Crispbread with Caraway, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a><br /><br />PRICE<br />$26 for a pack of 9 (or $21 if you sign up for a periodic shipment subscription) direct from Amazon is a fair price.  However, when Amazon is out-of-stock, I've seen the price as high as $42, which is excessive.<br /><br />Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

Its made of all healthy ingredients, all good grains. Yes it has carbs, but they are healthy carbs and only 10 grams for 2 crackers, which are good size cracker. I will eat 2 or 3 crackers with cheese or tuna, or sometimes peanut butter (for the protein) and I am full.<br /><br />I took the package to my doctor, and he said it was a good healthy cracker.

review/text: I always loved the Finn Crisp Rye w/o Caraway Seeds, but I had to order the Multigrain b/c they were out of the rye ones. Now I've got some of the rye again and I realize--I love the Multigrain! Maybe they changed the recipe for the rye ones--they're almost like sawdust when you chew them. The Multigrain ones are so yummy--you can just grab a couple and munch on them for a snack. They have a very slightly sweet taste, like whole grain products often do, but they go well with everything. My favorite thing to top them with is plain cream cheese with salt and pepper. If you like healthy foods and want an easy way to be good to your diet, buy these!

review/summary: Liked the bouilon, did not like the sell-by date
review/text: The boullion has a great flavor, albeit salty. It is saltier than other vegetable boullions that I have used (Repunzel is my favorite).<br /><br />I was very disappointed that the sell-by date on my six-pack is April 2012 (purchased January 2012). I suspect that this product has been sittting on the shelf for many months unless it has an end-date that is only a few months from the manufacture date.<br /><br />While I understand that I will still be able to use the boullion after April, as reviewers of other products have noted sometimes Amazon's food items are not fresh. Sigh - one of the perils of purchasing perishible items on-line.<br /><br />I subtracted one star for excessive saltiness and one for the closeness to the sell-by date.

review/text: My dog loves these rawhide bones. He's a black lab mix and it takes him a an hour and a half of pure chewing to get through one. You can tell that the bones are quality rawhide and thoroughly pressed (always a plus!)<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that each bone had a tag. A small issue, but only takes two seconds to take all of them off. (Just silly to waste paper I guess.)<br /><br />In total, these bones are worth it and will not break into little pieces on the floor. I will certainly buy these again in the future!

review/summary: Unhealthy
review/text: Don't feed Rawhides, they are unhealthy.<br />Sadly, rawhide bones are very dangerous to dogs. While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating "These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully. Anyone who comes in contact with these treats should wash their hands with hot water and soap. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from exposure and should avoid any contact with these chews."<br /><br />Read up.

review/text: I like the natural sweetness and high fiber content of this flour. I am using it in gluten free recipes in place of sweet brown rice flour, until I can purchase that.  So far the cookies made with it have come out well. It's also great to use in pancakes.  The key is only to use a little of the flour. Too much c. flour in any recipe probably won't have the results you would prefer.

review/text: I had all kind of trouble with my enlarged prostate. Even Mayo clinic Docs advised for surgery. I tried pumpkin seeds and then went to this oil taking one table spoon in the AM, another in the PM. I tangibly improved and have decided not to do the surgery. I do not need it. This oil is like a magic food for the prostate. I was told it is very good for libido, but I am content just to be able to urinate normally :-)<br /><br />The taste is absolutely genius. This is the best discovery for me on Amazon thus far as it changed my health and helped cope.
