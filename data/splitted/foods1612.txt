review/summary: You are paying for the box!! and......$5.00 in candy.
review/text: Small box of candy.  Not worth anywhere near $25.00.  You are buying the box.  I would suggest buying your own candy, most of it is still out there, and then make up your own novelty card.  Nice idea but not a good value at all.

review/text: I ordered this for my husband who is deployed in hopes of helping him remember some of his childhood, ie, buying candy from the local candy store..... The concept is a great one, but the amount of candy in the box was a JOKE, they were SAMPLE SIZE AMOUNTS..... you can go to your local Dollar store and create your own kit, pay shipping and still come out spending less money, Also the candy wrappers are the same as the ones you get today, I bought the 70's kit and it was nothing like the candy wrappers form the 70's..... I WOULD NOT WASTE THE MONEY.....

review/summary: Stale expensive candy!
review/text: Candy was stale the blow pop was soft and the candy was not from the seventies that I lived in.  We had no sour patch kids or Bublisious that was 80's thuff, I rember rain-blo and long sticks or gum or apple super bubble.  I only paid $6.99 at cracker barrel and that was a rip off.  3 tiny pixi stixx, 3 pc gum a pack of gum and 2 lolie pops at 2 other pc of gum and a 1 flavor lick a my stick.  always wondered what would be in one of these boxes now I know.  You will be very disappointed if you invest the money for maybe $1.50 worth of stale candy.

They send things like one (literally 1) small tootsie roll, and one smartie...  nothing in the the tiny box is at all special, and all is available at any CVS or Walgreens...  So MAD ! ! !

Hit up a Minit Mart or 7-11 and buy 3x the candy, put it in a gift bag, and throw in a card "Remember the 70s" for the same price.

review/text: This is a good brand. I got one container of this then looked around and now I purchase one pound garlic bags by CR and add balsamic vinegar and spices and get the healthy and delicious garlic from US. I did not know that majority of the garlic sold in stores are from China even the peeled ones in containers. Christopher Ranch garlic is spicy tasting by itself when raw but not when pickled or crushed. CR is not organic but it's fine with me. Bravo.

review/summary: Core Power vs. Labrada
review/text: A quick check of the label shows that Core power (honey flavor) has just as many carbs as it does protein. And a whopping 240 calories as a result. Something the carb conscious should be aware of. Labrada's Lean body "on the go" has only around 5 grams of carbs (depending on the flavor) and just 180 calories in the larger 14 oz bottle. The 12 pack also costs less. What Core Power has going for it is their unique honey flavor. Delicious! Although also delicious, I find Labrada's OTG vanilla to be way too sweet by comparison, but the cookies & cream is just right to satisfy my chocolate cravings.

review/text: This candy bar is fabulous, but I bought one king size bar at Wal-mart for $1.00 recently, which is a much better deal than this price in bulk. Go to your local Walmart and if they don't already carry this bar, ask the manager to get some in. I can't believe this bar hasn't taken over the world already. Poor marketing on Reese's part, I guess, because they are heavenly.

review/text: I'm currently doing the Jorge Cruise "low sugar/carb" diet (which works)and Matlitol is called for in some of his recipes.  Well, no where did it say that if you use it, you're likely to have stomach issues, and by issues I mean severe gas and diarrhea.  Sorry to be graphic, but better you know what you're getting yourself into before hand. It took almost 24 hours to "return to normal".<br /><br />If you have no issues with the above, give it a try, it tasted fine.  You may want to Google Matlitol side effects for more information. I will not make any more recipes that call for this.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience.  Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced.  I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate.  My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters!  Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little.  I still ended up with the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.  Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.  In case you're like me, ... it's not you ... it's the maltitol!

review/summary: These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.
review/text: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.

review/summary: Maybe too delicious?
review/text: Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty).

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3BM">Snyder's of Hanover Hot Buffalo Wing Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> If you like pretzels, buffalo wings, heat and salt you will love these.  They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven.

review/text: I am huge pretzel lover.<br />These in my opinion, are the best tasting pretzels out there.<br />They are TRULY finger licking good.  Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house.

review/summary: Brazil nut effect?
review/text: These taste great and they are my snacking weakness! however, they get on my nerves because the non-uniformaly shaped pieces exhibit the brazil nut effect where granular particles of similar/equal density tend to be on top aka the larger pretzel pieces tend to be in the first handful but as you eat more the smaller ones are always on the bottom of the bag no matter what you do. frustrating but unavoidable. just be aware.<br /><br />snyder should get a better pretzel chipper machine or whatever they use and keep the size consistent! if it works for potato chips why can't it work for pretzel???

I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2" x 3/4" - 1"  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot. I share them with my family & friends.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />1 oz. or approx 1/3 cup serving = 130 calories<br />Total fat 6g<br />~Saturated fat 3.5g<br />~Trans fat & Cholesterol 0<br />Sodium 260 mg (11% of your daily value)<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />~Fiber less than 1g<br />~Sugars less than 1g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A, C, & Calcium 0<br />Iron & Niacin each 6%<br />Riboflavin 8%<br />Thiamin 10%<br />Folate 20%<br /><br />I can't really describe the flavor so I thought I'd list some of the ingredients which make up the 'burst of flavor.'

review/text: Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag.

review/summary: Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels
review/text: Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  "Hot Buffalo Wing" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.

review/text: Machine does not work right. When you press down on the top of it to release a gumball, multiple gumballs fall down through the middle chamber instead of one. The gumballs get stuck on the way down through the machine. It is very frustrating for a child. DO NOT buy this product, spend a few more dollars and get a better quality product!!!

It must have shipped the same day they received my e-mail.<br />In these days of apathetic customer service, Taylor's Market is a true exception. Responsive and caring, they really make you feel like you are their only customer!<br />Aside from quality products at great prices, they have people like e-commerce manager Brian, who makes it his mission in life to ensure your satisfaction.<br />I can't recommend them enough. Yes, you can find the same products elsewhere, but you won't get the service you'll get here, and that makes a huge difference in your buying experience.<br />If you want quality and service you can trust, go with Taylor's Market. Their slogan should be Taylor's Made for you!<br />Thanks guys, you have a customer for life here.......

review/summary: Results of taste test!
review/text: I conducted a taste test of malted milk balls so you don't have to wonder. All are superior to bulk malted milk balls of uncertain origin.<br /><br />Ghirardelli: Best balance of chocolate with crispy malt inside<br /><br />Double Chocolate Malted Milk Balls: More chocolate, slightly less malt. My favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's: Clearly superior ingredients, the most malt flavor. My husband's favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's Pumpkin:  Very good but not what I expected. Instead of using pumpkin pie spices they use real pumpkin.<br /><br />All arrived carefully packed with cold packs (shipping is expensive).<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: This is my sixth order...
review/text: ... I must love the stuff.  I hesitated reviewing this product while I lived in NY as my local Garden of Eden had such a short supply. I didn't want too many others to catch on and jack my emergency stash.  So glad I found this on Amazon and at a decent price. While this coffee is more expensive that your run-of-the-mill drugstore brands it is definitely worth the price. I fix myself a delicious latte every morning for a fraction of the price in &lt;60 seconds. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />I have enjoyed this Rich Aroma davidoff as well as the davidoff espresso and davidoff fine aroma. For my lattes, this is the most scrumptious.  A little about my tastes so you can compare yours: I DO NOT crave chicory-coffee, I love cinnamon sprinkled on sugar-free or minimal sugar coffee.  I loooove Jack's Stir Brew Coffee (south street seaport lower manhattan), but if I am forced to go big-mega chain I prefer dunkin's regular drip coffee to starbucks.<br /><br />hope it helps.

review/summary: Not as sweet
review/text: I got hooked on these in Hong Kong where my American candy choices were Starburst and Skittles, both sugar rushes of the extreme sort.  This candy is not as sweet as those, but a bit sweeter than most Asian candy (many of my Chinese friends find it too sweet for their taste, but many of my American friends say it is not sweet enough).  I kind of like the middle ground, trying to cut back on my sugars.

review/text: Extremely tasty candy with a texture unlike anything on the candy shelves in America. Imagine, if you will, popping a piece of soft strawberry gum into your mouth and beginning to chew--the first few seconds are always the best, when you get a blast of intense strawberry flavor along with a firm, enjoyable chew, right? Then imagine that gum melting away gradually on your tongue, without losing any of its flavor, rather than enduring and just becoming stringy and bland. Very nice indeed.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried
review/text: I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.

review/text: I'm a really big fan of the Jack Link's peppered beef jerky, but it can be hit or miss with the freshness. This stuff was pretty good though. I think the Jack Link's has a better taste due to more flavourings (the secret is in the soy sauce they use, I suspect) where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more.<br /><br />I think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick, but maybe that's just me.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness. Too much sweetness for me.

review/text: Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand. Personally this puts me off this brand a little although others in my house do like the sweeter flavour.<br /><br />So it really depends what you want in your Teriyaki jerky and if you like it sweet or not.<br /><br />The jerky pieces are a good size though, they definitely give you some big jerky.

review/summary: Dried Broken Fava Beans
review/text: I was so looking forward to my dried fava beans.  When I opened the box, I was so disappointed.  The picture above shows nice whole fava beans with uniform color.  The ones I got were all different colors with lots to discard and way too many broken ones, and I don't mean just broken in half...broken in lots of tiny pieces.  I would never serve these to company unless I opened two or three bags and picked out the whole ones.<br /><br />The bags were packed nice and safe with plenty of bubble wrap.  I can only assume they were this way when they were packed.  I am very disappointed in the quality of these dried fava beans and wonder why Amazon even bothered to carry them.  It is far below their usual standard of quality.  You want fava beans?  Skip these.
