review/summary: Awesome Tea!
review/text: I have used this tea years ago and have always loved it.  My daughter was in Seattle visiting us this year and asked me if I wanted anything from the market.  I said would you see if they still sell that Market Spice Tea.  She brought me some and I enjoyed it so much that I went on line to see if I could get it that way.  To my surprise, it was there and easy to order through Amazon.  I am enjoying it as I write this review - yum!

review/summary: Market Spice is More Than Nice!
review/text: I started ordering Market Spice from Amazon when I found out they carried it.  I usually purchase the 1 lb (approx) size, but the last time I purchased the 4 oz - the reason being I would order it more frequently and the tea would stay fresher.  Next time I order, it will be the larger size again.  I drink quite a bit of Market Spice!  It is not for the "faint of heart" when it comes to robustness - I love it!

review/text: I can always count on NOW to provide a quality product. I use this in sweetening my homemade yogurt and smoothies. Just a few drops flavors your treat and then you may add fruits and other ingredients to complete your product. In my yogurt, the french vanilla cuts the sharpness and allows the flavor of your fruit to come through. Wonderful! Love the french vanilla. A little bit goes a long way. Nice way to sweeten without sugar or nasty chemicals.

review/summary: Tasty Raspberry Preserves
review/text: I liked Bonne Maman Raspberry Preserves. They are very good and for once the prduct tastes as advertized. A nice inclusion of some whole raspberries and a wonderful preserve to have on toast, or what it does, makes me feel like making a nice trifle. To me it would be better without the pitts, but then it would not be a preserve and would lose its great flavor in the process. Great for everyday, or a real treat in a dessert, good on the top of some vanilla ice cream.  Lila Hamilton

review/summary: Great stuff! My 13 favorite uses for white vinegar described
review/text: I use vinegar in many different ways at home, not just for cooking.  It is a great cleaner - cheap and totally green, no harsh chemicals.<br /><br />My favorite use for it is to clean suede shoes and boots.  Once suede is stained, there is about 24-48 hour window before the stain sets in.  I mix 40% white vinegar and 60% water solution, and blot the stain with a wet paper towel.  When the cleaning is over I stuff the shoe/boot with newspapers to make sure the shape is retained and let it dry.  Note that it should dry naturally, not next to a heat source like a radiator, as it the heat will damage the skin.<br /><br />Vinegar's magic ingredient is acetic acid. All vinegars are produced by oxidization of alcohol into acetic acid.  Since people have been making wine for ever, vinegar was an accidental by-product a long time ago.<br /><br />Here are some of my additional uses for vinegar:<br />1. I add a few tablespoons of white vinegar to water when poaching eggs.  It helps whites stay firm, so if you get an accidental crack in the shell the white will not leak out.<br /><br />2. Adding vinegar to wilted veggies will make them perk up.<br /><br />3. After cooking I don't like to keep the smell of onions on my hands, a quick wipe with vinegar removes the odor.<br /><br />4. When I had a garbage disposal i would mix vinegar with baking soda and put it down the drain. After the mixture fizzed for a few minutes I would flush it along with the smell.<br /><br />5. After washing stemware in some dishwashing linquids they become cloudy.  Cleaning them with vinegar removes the white cloudiness.<br /><br />6. Vinegar works well cleaning grout. I dip an old toothbrush into vinegar and can get stains and dirt out quite easily.<br /><br />7. Vinegar and vegetable oil (50/50) work well removing water stains from wood.<br /><br />8. If I have stains on clothing (food or sweat stains) I wet them with vinegar before putting in the washer. It helps to get out stubborn stains.<br /><br />9. My mom always added a cupful of vinegar to the rinse cycle. Acetic acid is not harmful to clothing, but it dissolves soap residue and dark clothing comes out brighter.  It also has a side effect of working like a fabric softener.<br /><br />10. In the winter I use vinegar/water solution (3-to-1) to wipe down my windows and it keeps them frost free.<br /><br />11. I have a few cracks in my drive way, rather than pouring chemicals on the weeds that grow from these cracks I use 50-50 solution of vinegar and water to keep them under control.<br /><br />12. I like to keep cut flowers on my dining room table, and to prolong their life I add a tablespoon of vinegar to the water along with a teaspoon of sugar.<br /><br />Vinegar is a very useful thing to have at home, I recommend it!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: I'm not sure how they do it but the teas from London fruit and Herb are more intensely whatever flavor they're supposed to be than any other herbal tea brand I've ever found. The apple flavor is probably the least intense of the bunch, with the blackcurrent tasting almost as strong as kool aid, but without any artificial flavors.<br /><br />My family loves this stuff but other than on line I've not found them anywhere outside of when visiting the UK

review/summary: Healthiest flavored water I've come across
review/text: I am trying to avoid both sugar and fake sugars.  Fake sugars may have zero calories but they are not biologically inert.  Some have turned out to have side effects, and I suspect that some are too new to be well-researched yet.  Just my opinion.  Anyway, that has left me looking for water that doesn't taste like plain water, but without sugar substitutes in it.  This water is subtly flavored, no fake sugar, reasonably priced...  Just what I was looking for.  The only negative comment is that the flavoring is perhaps too subtle -- but I imagine without adding something sweet, it's hard to do more.

The carob chips are now in a different packaging with "NOW improved flavor" written on the bag.  The remake of these carob chips was a BIG mistate... they are horrible.  They have no carob or chocolately taste - really no flavor at all except for a waxy surgary taste.  I gave them to my husband because his sense of taste is much blander than mine, but he told me to throw them away because they are not worth the calories.  If he won't eat something sugary, then I know it is bad.  Please don't waste your money on these.  I wanted to leave zero stars, but you had to check at least one.

review/text: I used to enjoy gluten-free carob chips as a kid, and I was sad that there weren't any on the market as an adult. The chips I remembered tasted great straight out of the bag. I was happy when I heard that Chatfield's Carob Chips were now NOT made with icky barley malt, and were dairy free. They aren't available anywhere in my area, so I ordered in bulk from Amazon. When they arrived, I ripped open a bag- and found them so sickeningly sweet I could hardly eat them. They honestly taste more like white chocolate than carob. Seriously, Chatfield, did you taste these before mass producing them? I can only hope they taste better baked into recipes.

review/summary: So Glad I Found These
review/text: The other brands of carob chips are sweetened with barley malt, so, no good for the gluten free. These are sweetened with beet sugar, and the carob powder itself is naturally sweet. It is dairy free (although processed in a facility that processes products containing milk). If someone is coming straight from chocolate to carob, this might not be a successful step. It's just not chocolate. It's carob. I like the flavor of carob. I really love these carob chips. I just melted a handful of them with a few drops of water, and put it on a pound cake I made. Delicious. I can't compare these with the old packaging version of them as some of the other reviewers are, but as someone who can't eat chocolate, and shouldn't eat dairy, these are not only the only choice out there, but they are delightful. Try them for yourself, and decide on your own.

Since the formula change, they are sweeter than they once were, but I see this as an improvement. They melt better, and they are more comparable to chocolate now than they ever were before. I melt them and mold them with candy molds for special occasions, and I mix in some nut butter to make a reeses type candy. Very good!

review/summary: Delivers A Real Spank.
review/text: I purchased this high quality Ass Basket recently and you can bet your bottom dollar that it lives up to all the expectations you would hope for in an ass basket. There was some confusion on my end prior to receiving this in the mail. I thought I had purchased a basket of donkey figurines. Knick knacks, if you will. One of my hobbies is collecting donkey statues, pictures and paraphenalia. I just can't get enough of these magnificent creatures. They have such personality, and their work ethic is something to admire. It's just amazing what can happen when a horse a pony come together in mutual affection. The title "work horse" really belongs to these proud creatures, and I have worked tirelessly to get recognition and state funding for these jackasses. When my package arrived at my rear door, I was originally furious, but threw some of this on a beef brisket and I tell ya, I got a swift ass kickin indeed! Even offered some to my neice Fanny. She went ahead and ordered her own Ass Basket and her whole family loves it! I have found this product to be a great gift to buy in lieu of flowers and hand lotion. I've started giving it to folks for all occasions, even weddings, as well as a friend's funeral. You'd think people would be offended, but the thing is, people like hot sauce whether they're happy, sad, married or dead. Think about it, who doesn't like a hot meal? That's what I'm sayin. Just be careful though. My dog ate half a bottle of this and it came outta both ends on my kitchen rug, which is wool. Can't get the stains out! Looks like it's a total loss but I'm gonna try Magic Eraser one more time.

review/summary: Silky and luxurious
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Colombian food, and I eat or cook it whenever I can, tapioca flour goes into one of my favorite items from this wonderful cuisine, I make Yucca Buns with a simple recipe that tastes better with this silky and organic flour than with the other tapioca flours I have found so far. Not to mention it's organic, something very important as this crusty old planet ages under our rule. This recipe that I now love, annoyed me to extreme lengths because I didn't understand the way the dough must feel and change into until I made it the second time, adding too much liquid made it too sticky once the cheese melted into the flour so I had to add even more flour to balance it out... not pretty in baking haha.  Tapioca starch can be used as a thickener or substitute for allergen causing flour, but I recommend checking the conversions for each online, also don't use it as a batter on a cutlet ( dip in flour then milk the bread crumbs then fry) it will come off in a gooey skin, even of a non stick pan. It's amazing for baking though and I love the boxes, I was quite surprised how tiny they looked, each box hold 2 cups of tapioca flour, and it takes me one box to make a double batch of Yucca Buns. I have adapted the below recipe from Ingrid Hoffman's Yucca Buns recipe from the FoodNetwork.com<br /><br />2 cups tapioca flour<br />4 egg yolks ( or 3 for less cakey bread)<br />2 teaspoons baking powder .... ( make sure its fresh and not expired<br />� tsp salt .........( my favorite is freshly ground in a mortar and pestle grey sea salt) also salt depends on how salty the cheese it. Ingrid's recipe didn't have any, I find it much better tasting with salt as the cheese melts and mends with the dough, so add a little more each time you make this until it tastes right, but don't over do it because it can go from great to over bearing, a small amount is good starting point).<br /><br />4 cups grated cheese.... ( Oaxaca is the original one from the main recipe, but also nice dry mozzarella works, use your favorite but it cant be the fresh one kept in water, has to be the hard kind you can all ready find shredded but I recommend getting your own and grating it, usually one large block of Sargento or Polly-O is more than 4 cups)<br /><br />*Extra bit I add - little pieces of cheese from leftover shredding, I put a tiny piece into each bun and wrap the dough around it, great when it melts and cooks. *<br /><br />To make, put the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl and mix, add the egg yolks, mix in as well, then add all the cheese. The dough will feel very dry and funny, keep squishing everything between your hands, it will take some hand muscle and a few minutes of kneading inside the bowl, once it starts coming together you can mix it on a large cutting board. I add a teaspoon or milk or cream if it's really dry, but wait till the last minute, this is a very dry dough to work with at first, once the cheese starts to melt it will come together quickly and be little sticky. Roll into oblong ellipses, line 8 per sheet ( non stick pan or a plain one rubbed w/ butter) and bake for 17-20 min under a preheated 350degree oven.  Sometimes I sprinkle extra cheese on top and broil it at the end. When they are warm and ready to pull out they will be pale golden, there will not be a brown outside. And these are quite flat, they don't rise into a ball or anything but that's ok.  As I mentioned before, sometimes when I roll the raw dough up I put a tiny bit of cheese I used fir shredding inside and seal it in, that creates this crusty lovely cavern as it makes a bubble on the inside, it's a crunchy cheesy salty bite at the end, yum!<br /><br />These are best fresh but also good reheated later, or toasted and smeared with butter. This recipe takes some practice to make but it's so worth it! I cant believe that I just wrote this, but its one of my favorites and I'm happy to share it, this flour works so well in this that I will be reordering as I'm about to run out, highly recommended for delicious home baking. I even taught my boyfriends grandmother (the are both Colombian) how to make these and she loved them which shocked me, I was confident in my baking but still to get a compliment from her on something she eats all the time is great, so I gave her a box of this flour to take with her in the end, it was a good day!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: As other reviewers said about the Red Velvet version of this product, let me be the first to say I wish i read the reviews BEFORE ordering this. I had never even been to Griddle Cafe when i was in LA--which is the reason for me buying this product; and i must say to those who are curious: SAVE YOUR MONEY!! You are better off going to your local grocery store and buying some Bisquick or Aunt Jemima pancake mixes for all of just $4, instead of the whopping $14 product. Oh and the extra for shipping & handling.<br /><br />This mix, whether with water or milk is just god-awful. My pancakes turned out to be tasteless, bitter, dry and the aftertaste is just horrible. I thought I was going to get something on the level of IHOP since a restaurant was going to sell their mix, but what I got pales in comparison. Excuse me, not to be compared.<br /><br />Again, read before ordering. Trust me when I say this. I had to trash this in the garbage.

review/summary: A little pricy but the best gum around... now
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago. (This stuff is also made by Hersey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while. The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer. Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample. If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, individual packs can be expensive. It can be less, per piece, here but multiple packs is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum. I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some. And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Could save you time--fill up the travel mug at home before work
review/text: I personally like a darker roast but I don't mind light roast coffee if aromatic and flavorful. This blend is similar to the coffee you get at any convenience store, gas station or diner. It's light, very bright and acidic and has an herby-grassy, almost metallic overtone.<br /><br />The Vue cup is longer and larger to hold enough coffee to brew an 18 oz travel mug. That's one of the interesting features of the VUE--the cups can be customized to hold more coffee for a taller mug. I found, for me, this tasted best at 10 oz, because I do add some milk to cut the acidity but I like strong coffee. It would be impossibly weak for me at 18 oz, but many people prefer lighter brews.<br /><br />If you like light coffee that is not terribly strong, this will appeal to you. I'd suggest that before you select past the welcome screen on the VUE brewer, you hit the settings and change the temperature to the maximum setting--for two reasons; one, you're going to want the coffee to stay hot all the way to work in your insulated mug and two, it seems to brew better, especially at high volumes, at a higher temperature.<br /><br />This is not my cup of...well, I can't say tea. It's not for me. But it comes out tasting exactly like commercial coffee you can get at your favorite morning stop. Since the VUE holds travel mugs (if you remove the drain base entirely), for those who storm out the door in the morning, cutting their time very close before hitting the morning commute, the combination of filling an insulated travel mug with the same coffee at the same price you'd pay at Filler'Up Farms, could save you five or eight minutes on your commute.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/text: I likewise have my doubts that I got the right tea even though it says Golden Mango on the box and individual packages.  It does not remotely taste like mango and is somewhat bitter.  I can't identify the taste, but it ties for the worst tea I have ever tasted.  I find it odd since other reviewers have commented on how good it is with a real good mango flavor.  I don't know if I'm willing to try this again.  Others who have tasted it agree with my opinion and are unwilling to drink any more of it.

review/summary: Only food he can eat
review/text: After so many GI problems, the knowledgeable saleswoman at the local pet store recommended Natural Balence Synergy Formula for my Schnoodle. From the day one, he could have it without any problem. My dog is the one who couldn't digest the expensive prescription "bland diet." The only reason for four stars is that it must lose the flavor at the end of the 5 lb. bag.  He doesn't show as much interest in eating it as when it was freshly opened. Little bit of low sodium chicken broth (1-2 teaspoon) solved the problem. Amazon has the good price and I don't have to make a trip to the pet store to buy it.

review/text: I've been trying to do a mint julep for years and I look up recipes but the stumbling block is always "simple syrup". I can even get mint leaves in the produce section of my local supermarket, but the issue is always that simple syrup. I even tried creme de menthe with the bourbon and it's like one other customer put it--the effect is like mouthwash. I finally gave the rest of the creme de menthe away and gave up. Then I read the reviews on this and I ordered two bottles, because if you get only one, the shipping is more than the price of the syrup. There's even a standard recipe for the mint julep printed on the bottle--a shot of the syrup, a shot of bourbon and a shot of water. I hope they keep this brand available because this stuff is going to be a regular item in the aperitif shelf of my hooch cabinet.

review/summary: treats seemed to be over-cooked or old
review/text: While the product shipped quickly, I was suprised that one of the two bags I ordered contained treats that were a lot darker than the ones I'm used to seeing.  I assumed that they must be OK, but once I started giving them to the dogs, I realized that they were either burned (hence, the darker color), or old, as they were VERY hard for the dogs to chew.  I wasn't going to submit this review, but one of our older dogs actually got choked to the point we had to  pull the treat out of her throat as she was unable to chew it.<br /><br />I buy these treats all the time in a local pet store, but ordered them here as I was on vacation out of state.  Never again.<br /><br />If you find these at your locally-owned pet store, you (rather, your dogs) will love them.  However, I would not recommend ordering them online.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in June 2012 so am still a newbie with all things gluten free.  You give up a lot on the gluten free diet--I'm also dairy free so it's even harder for me.  The up side is that you start appreciating the little things so much more.  When I tried the New grains cinnamon raisin bread with some peanut butter on it, it tasted like heaven--even better and more satisfying than I remember the one with gluten tasting.  I am fortunate to live in Utah where I can find New Grains at my local store and I have tried all their breads and I love, love, love each and every one. How amazing is it to enjoy great tasting bread that satisfies not only your dietary needs but your taste buds as well! The bread has a good texture and nice sized slices for sandwiches or toast. If you're discouraged with the quality of products you've been using, you owe it to yourself to try these products and find the taste and texture you've been missing.

review/text: I was lucky enough to have a grandmother who had traveled the world and had certain foods that she went great lengths to get at home. This marmalade was one of them. Some grocers carry them now, but it was hard to find at one time. Made in the United Kingdom, it is a marmalade for purists. No preservatives or artificial sweeteners here, they still use the ancient recipe. For real authentic marmalade that is so good you will not be able to eat the cheap stuff again, try this.

review/summary: The Very Best
review/text: Confronted with a cloudy, rainy, dreary autumn day? The cure is simple: A perfect snack. The necessary ingredients remind me of some of my earliest memories. Born in Scotland, my mother enjoyed the staples of the old country.  What could satisfy more than a cup of tea and a piece of wheat bread toast? Prepared authentically, each piece of toast should be slightly burnt. A couple of scrapes with a knife will cure that! When I smell bread burning in a toaster, I always think of my Mom in our kitchen making an afternoon snack. No toast is complete without orange marmalade. Ordinary jelly will not do! The only brand acceptable is Keiller's Dundee orange marmalade made with an authentic recipe dating back to 1797. Imposters, like the watery Bonne Maman of France and the Swiss Hero varieties, can't compete with the real thing. Since 1988, Keiller's has been manufactured in the Robertson's plant in Manchester, England (horrors!) The taste is still intact. It is a thick, tangy delight packed with sweet, thinly-cut orange rind congealed in a perfect jelly. Look for Keiller's distinctive white glass jar. Yum.

review/summary: Possibly  the best Bitter Sweet Orange Marmalade out there.
review/text: Love this Marmalade. If you like bitter sweet marmalade this is it. It has a wonderful orange flavor with lots of rind in it.<br /><br />Hard to find a great domestic brand of marmalade that is really good. This Marmalade was originally made by James Keiller & Sons and dates back to 1797. It was first made in Dundee Scotland, but recently they started making it in England. This Scottish marmalade is made from Seville oranges and contains more peel and zest than most other marmalades. Central European and California-style marmalade contains less peel and zest and so are less bitter.  I have been using the Dundee brand for quite a few years now. I must say that I enjoy there Three Fruit Marmalade a bit more than this one. It has orange, grapefruit and lemon in it. At times I can't find it in my local markets, whereas the orange flavor seems to be more readily available.<br /><br /> This Marmalade is extremely thick, almost as though it was concentrated. It has a somewhat strong bitter sweet flavor. A little dab will go a long way. This is not for everyone, if you like the sweet non bitter marmalade you might not like it. My wife does not care for it, and I think it's fantastic. Go figure.<br /><br />FLASH::::: JULY 2110 ::: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHITE JAR ??? I just bought a jar of this in my local Publix Supermarket and the jar is now clear, what a shame I loved those white jars they where so distinctive.

review/text: I never cared much for the original Cherry Coke, but I love the new Cherry Zero version. Twelve cans just don't last long around me as I will drink one after another.

review/summary: What was missing
review/text: I've been going espresso crazy for the last year buying the syrups and frothers, and most expensive coffees,  and they were good.  But now it just went to a whole new level,  this is what was missing,  the creamy flavorful ingredient is this,  no more star bucks,

review/summary: Tastes great!  Packaging leaves something to be desired
review/text: First the 2 bad things.  I've tried the Starbucks/Fontana and Ghirardelli both and the packaging on the Monin is very poor in comparison.  The plastic is thinner and actually broke during shipping.  It looks like the end where the lid is was hit and it pushed the lid into the bottle and cracked the top of the bottle.  Luckily it was a tiny crack and it barely leaked any at all.  The second packaging issue is that the standard sauce pumps won't work with this package, forcing you to buy their particular pump.  In this case I simply poured it into an old Starbucks jug that I have a pump for, which solved both problems at once.<br /><br />Now the good thing.  I've tried the Starbucks/Fontana and Ghirardelli both and this is 10x better than either one of those.  There's really not even much of a comparison.

review/summary: My New Favorite Snack!!!
review/text: These are quite healthy!!!  I never used to pay much attention to what was healthy or not healthy - but was more concerned with prices.  However, these are just a dollar more than the cheaper refined flour crackers that have a lot more fat in them.  I feel a lot better when I eat these crackers for snacks and it is a better value because I do not need to eat as many of them to satisfy my metabolic function.

review/summary: In the cat's own words.....
review/text: Purina Pro Plan Beef, Carrots & Rice Entr&eacute;e in Gravy opens with a fragrant spicy beef bouquet with notes of ripe carrots and fluffy brown rice. On the palate, the texture is full bodied, viscous and balanced. The flavor profile is a hearty beef blend with notes of fish that lilts gently across the tongue.  The meaty tidbits are packed in a generous amount of delicious lip smacking gravy. The taste lingers for quite some time (i.e. I can re-taste it when I burp - I like that in a food). Whether your taste buds prefer beef bourguignon or fresh mouse, this offering will be perfect for you.  I suggest you pair it with bowl of tap water and perhaps a mouthful of crunchy kibble. Enjoy - Steve The Cat

review/summary: Fairly Fine Cup of Tea...
review/text: This raspberry tea from Ahmad's of England, makes an acceptable cup of tea. However, the flavoring was a bit weak for my taste. A couple of reviewers referenced the raspberry flavor as strong and/or tart, whilst I found it to be neither. I would call this a medium-bodied black tea, with a rather light, red raspberry flavor. Fortunately, I found that a bit of sugar really helped to enhance the flavor. No adverse aftertastes were detected. It's four o'clock somewhere...tea time, anyone?

review/summary: Excellent Black Tea w/ Raspberry
review/text: Ahmad Tea is the best, I've tried 4 different flavors so far and all were great.<br />Passion Fruit Black Tea, Mango Black Tea, Raspberry Black Tea, and Apricot Black Tea.<br /><br />Ignore the previous reviewer who said this has no flavor, these are some of the most flavorful teas I've tried.  In fact I am not normally even a tea fan but Ahmad Black tea is simply the best Black Tea that I've ever tried and I find myself drinking it instead of coffee now.<br /><br />5 stars, Great Tea.<br />Brian @ Santa Cruz, CA

review/summary: Ahmad is still the best!
review/text: It's been harder for me to find Ahmad teas lately, so I'm grateful that it's carried here at Amazon.  One of my problems with herbal teas or herbal teas blended with black/green tea is that they're often too light, too sour, or both.  Even worse, when said teas are steeped too long (I tend to leave the teabag in), certain flavors become stronger than others, so that suddenly you're left with only a cinnamon taste, or some nasty cloying citrus flavor.  Ahmad teas, especially Raspberry, Lemon/Lime, and Apricot, have a heavy body to them, and can basically be left to brew indefinitely, retaining their original amazing flavor.  Let them steep in a thermos on a cold day, and it will become just about the warmest substance known to mankind.<br /><br />Hyperboles aside, get this tea if you like heavier teas with a distinct but not overpowering flavor.  I don't know how artificial or genuine the fruit flavoring is, but I don't care -- these teas are as close to perfect as you can get.  They don't even need milk or sweetener to be immensely satisfying!

review/summary: Good but strawberry is better
review/text: Smells more authentic than it tastes, it leaves a bitter aftertaste which overpowers the raspberry flavor, something that doesn't happen with Ahmad's strawberry flavored tea.  Both berries are close in taste so I recommend strawberry instead.

review/summary: It's ONLY Tea!
review/text: It's Tea. It was fresh, delivered quickly and is delicious. It's tea.<br /><br />However, Amazon is telling me my tea review has to be "at least twenty words describing your experience with this item" before it will publish my review. To that I say: It's ONLY TEA guys!!"<br /><br />OK then. Here goes. I put the filtered water in the Sunbeam Hot Shot Single-serve Beverage Maker and boil the water. Then, with deft agility at 5:30am, dispense the water into my favorite - and only - ceramic Starbuck's coffee cup. I follow that by placing the tea bag in said cup, then steeping said tea bag in previously mentioned boiling water for precisely 90 seconds. Afterwards, placing teabag in teaspoon while carefully wrapping teabag string around said teabag and spoon to squeeze out every drop of Rasberry goodness. Then, drink slowly and adoringly.<br /><br />Wow, how was it for you? I need a cigarette.<br /><br />Please rate this review. LOL  :P

review/text: I bought this raspberry tea on the previous recommendation however after brewing a pitcher of it, I find there is ZERO raspberry flavor in it. I tied 2 different strengths, brewing with 4 bags and 2 bags with the same result, Tastes like straight black tea. Wasted $20. I guess I'll have to stay with Walmart brand instant raspberry tea. At least it has a good flavor although there is a little to much sugar for my preference.

review/text: Red residue everywhere? Well of course you're supposed to decorate on top of wax paper or newspaper! I love all these color mists. They're so easy to use and give off a very nice look. For darker colors spray close, for lighter colors spray farther way. Be smart and decorate on top of your kitchen table using newspapers underneath :]

review/text: I love the concept of the color mist.  I purchased 3 bottles of the red mist to decorate 75 cupcakes.  The mist went on very easy, but because I wanted a darker red I had to keep applying it.  To say the least, I am not a big fan right now ... since my kitchen now has a red residue all over the counter tops!  :-(

review/summary: Tasty salami just not as good as it used to be.
review/text: First of all, Otto's service was great. Order processing was quick and shipping was very prompt.<br />I purchased about 4lbs of this salami from 3 different places in the last 2 months. Every time it tasted slightly different and unfortunately this salami is not as good as it used to be 4-5 yrs ago. The 1st piece I tried had a strange smoky taste. The 2nd and 3rd were under aged. The 800g piece I got from Otto's seems to be the most in line with what I remember. Unfortunately none of them had that overwhelming characteristic flavor. I am afraid Pick lost quality control over this product.<br />Still a great salami and I will buy again.
