review/summary: LOVE this candy!
review/text: My mother in law brings us several bags when she visits.  I have to hide it so it's not gone in less than a week. This candy was on my kids christmas list so you know it rates!  I have tasted others that are hard and no flavor but these are nice and soft and have a great strawberry flavor.  Do not understand the negative reviews. I will be ordering lots!

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: My favorite candy store sold this amazing strawberry licorice in small bags so it never had a brand name. I would go get a small bag every week. suddenly they started stocking a different, horrible licorice after being out of it for a few weeks. The new one was waxy and hard and had no taste whatsoever...well I take that back it had a slight taste of cough syrup. I started searching online based on reviews to find the one they originally stocked and I found it here! This is not hard and waxy...It is firm, but has a  matte look instead of a glossy look. It taste very fruity. This is my favorite strawberry licorice! SO much better than twizzlers and the like. Also, this is a good price on it.

review/text: Like another reviewer, I too was looking for the traditional red lace candy a lot of people are familiar with. I ordered these on a whim even though I was pretty sure they weren't the kind I wanted and I was really surprised at how good they are. The red laces I remember were almost like plastic and had little flavor, in my opinion, compared to these. They really are delicious and I would definitely order them again. They have a very nice strawberry flavor and I'll be looking to try other flavors in the future. A quality product.

review/summary: It's organic, but it changed my pie too much
review/text: I used this organic pumpkin in a pie this week.  Normally, I use Libby pumpkin, but wanted to try organic this time.  I prefer Libby.  This organic pumpkin from Farmer's Market really changes a pie.<br /><br />First, the entire texture is different.  It isn't nearly as smooth, and it is a bit dry.  The other ingredients are the same, so I know it's the pumpkin changing my pie's turnout.<br /><br />The flavor is also different.  Oddly enough, it doesn't have as much pumpkin flavor!<br /><br />Honestly, it makes my home-made pumpkin pie taste more like a cheap store-bought.  Really not nearly as good as when I use Libby pumpkin.  I'm say to say this, as I really prefer organic products, but when it changes the texture and flavor this much, I cannot recommend it.  Too bad I still have another can.<br /><br />If you do end up purchasing some to try, I'd recommend adding just a little extra sugar to your pie to help enhance flavors.  Add a little more cinnamon, too.

review/text: A lady At Sam's WareHouse got me hooked on this! She put it in tuna and boy it made it taste better. I like to put in my recipes and it is good in Canned soups Like Chicken Noodle. There was another one Lawry's made called Pinch of Herb but they stopped making it. Call them up and tell them to bring it back. I could not find The Salt Free 17 seasoing in the store any more and to order it from Lawry's was to high. Some one I know took the bottle and scanned it and said amazon.com has it! So I bought a few. Lawry's company said the store close to me that sells it is 50 miles away! Tom Thumb was the last place I found it till I got it from amazon.com. When you cook with this put it in first when cooking to make the seasoning soft other wise it is gritty. Like when adding it to soups put it in as you start to warm it up.

review/summary: Best seasoning for grilled veggies, stir fry, soups, etc.
review/text: I have used this seasoning for grilled veggies, soups, stir fry, cole slaw, etc. for several years and it is THE BEST. I haven't been able to find it in the local stores recently, so that is why I ordered it from Amazon.  It's called Salt-Free 17 because it jazzes up the dish so you don't have to use salt and pepper. It is also great added to melted butter and served on a saucer for dipping bread. All the ingredients (except for citric acid and corn starch) are chopped herbs, veggies, lemon peel, orange peel, and toasted sesame seeds. It has NO MSG.

review/summary: Good salt substitute
review/text: I bought this recently and it's pretty good compared to other salt substitutes available at the grocery store. This has more flavor than seasoning blends by Mrs Dash (which contain too much black pepper) and the store brands. It could use a bit extra garlic so I just add my own. I mostly use it at the table in place of the salt shaker.  It's also great for adding to tuna salad with a little low fat mayonnaise and a squeeze of lemon.

review/summary: Buy for your Fall, Winter, Holiday dishes
review/text: These dried mushrooms will produce the wonderful mushroom flavor that you need for your Fall, Winter and Holiday dishes--IF you are cooking from European or American recipes.  These are NOT the mushrooms used for Eastern / Oriental dishes. Use these to augment the fresh mushrooms you find in your market.  Also use them when you need mushroom flavor and haven't got any in the veggie bin of your frig.<br /><br />Spare no expense.  Buy the best Roland mushrooms you can afford.  The Roland brand puts out top quality products, and dried mushrooms--if stored correctly--will last you many years.  Keep them, cool, dry and out of the air and they will reward you with so much flavor, for so little money.  Be aware that dried mushrooms don't weigh much, so this pound package will go a long, long way.<br /><br />So--bottom line--you can save money here by buying in quantity--and you can get away with it because if kept correctly, the product will last and last.<br /><br />Go ahead and compare prices for dried Cepes and Bolets.  Now, don't compare "apples and oranges"--these Cepes and Bolets cannot be compared to other mushrooms because Cepes and Bolets are in a flavor class by themselves.  They are not substitutes for shitake mushrooms, either.  Shitake mushrooms are wonderful and produce a certain flavor, but they cannot be compared with Cepes or Bolets.

Honestly, Amazon, you need to offer this candy at a more reasonable price and stop expecting third party suppliers to offer it because they always jack up the price to unreasonable levels.  Your sales on this item must be almost non-existent.

review/summary: Best Dutch Process Cocoa We've Found
review/text: I don't know why Dutch Process cocoa is so hard to find in the United States.  We've looked for it in Florida, Alabama, Nevada, and Washington state and it's as rare as hen's teeth.  Of all the varieties we've managed to find over the years, Van Cortlandt's is the best.  Unfortunately, like the rest, it's rare in this area (it only seems to show up on special occasions).  We were very pleased to find it here on Amazon (sold by Nutricity).  Not only did its mere presence make us happy, but the price per box was actually cheaper than any of the sporadic local sources we'd found.  Adding icing to the cake, there was free shipping on the case, so we snapped one up.  An Excellent (5 stars out of 5) Dutch Process cocoa.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />BTW:  at the time of writing, there was no picture of the product on the product page, so I uploaded one of the box front and one of the nutritional information (showing that it IS Dutch Process even though nothing on the product page says so).

I even got my boyfriend started on them and he loves them too.  =D<br /><br />I would suggest finding a store that sells them by the can before you invest in a whole case.  I know that you can find them at Raley's on the West Coast.  If local health food stores don't carry them check to see if there is a Seventh Day Adventist Church near you.  The SDA Church typically has a book center that sells the Worthington/Loma Linda products.<br /><br />Edit:  I have also found Linketts in the natural food section of Kroger's here in Texas as well.

review/text: Like others here, I acquired a taste to these things when I was a child.  I can understand that they make some people uncomfortable; they look like slimy worms from a deep dark cave.  And their taste is nothing like a real hot dog.  They are sort of in a class by themselves like a Dorito.  You eat it knowing that it has to be one of the most highly manufactured foods in existence but, putting these considerations aside, I heat them up on toast and with a little cheese they are quite good.  If I had a can here now I'd eat it.<br /><br />But I don't have a can here.  Why not? Simple: $75 (and climbing) for a box of 20 cans.  Hey Loma Linda, I know that you had to torture a lot of wheat to make them contort into slimy worms but there really should be a golden ticket in one of those cans at that price point.  On second thought maybe I don't want to tour your deep dark caves.

review/summary: vege hot dogs
review/text: I really like these vege hot dogs and have been eating them since I was a young adult( 1970's). I fry them and when they have a light crust I eat them with mustard, relish and onions. They are an acquired taste and don't taste like a real hot dog, but the taste to me is flavorful in a vege dog kind of way! If you have never tried them before you might consider a single can from Kroger food store. They sell them in their organic foods section. If you decide you like them and also the idea of no risk of meat borne disease, then the best way to order is through Amazon.com. The deliver is great, shipping is free, and a grocery discount available at this time makes buying them with Amazon cheaper than through the Kroger grocery store. Hope this was helpful to you! PS I also prefer them over the Vegelinks, however my 12 yo grandson prefers the vegelinks, so I buy both.

review/text: I love linketts. I'm a vegetarian. I've had meat in my youth. They aren't meat. But they're a great substitute and provide a consistency and flavor to aid meat eaters in becoming vegetarian.<br /><br />Wow. I ordered these yesterday afternoon, and they arrived before noon today, in a snow/ice day when the city is shut down and everyone is working at home and schools are closed. Super saver shipping. Wow.

review/summary: Love These Veggie Hot Dogs!
review/text: I was raised on these, and now my kids love them!  We usually just heat them in the microwave.  They are good with soup, spaghetti-o's, dinner, lunch, etc.  I like them cold, sliced on a salad or in a sandwitch with lettuce, tomato, etc.  There is no meat in these, so you don't need to cook them.  They can also be used in most ways hot dogs can, except I don't think these taste that good boiled.  You can grill them, cut them into baked beans, roll them in Pillsbury Crescent rolls and bake, etc.  They are very versatile and a good source of protein that my kids will eat!

review/text: They are vegan, they taste like the meat hot dogs I used to eat before I went vegetarian, and they are pre-cooked so you can eat them right from the can for quick protein. They have a nice texture and taste, and are packed in liquid, which I drain off and then save them in plastic bags in the fridge or freezer. They freeze and thaw in the fridge with no problem.

review/summary: A favorite since childhood
review/text: I love Linketts, they have been a favorite since I was a kid. If you weren't raised eating them you might not like them but if you like trying new things and like other vegetarian foods you should try these. I use them just as meat eaters use regular hot dogs. They taste great fried with Worthington chili. You can also be creative with these and come up with some great recipes. One of my favorites uses brown rice, olive oil, onion powder, stewed tomatoes, canned black beans, and sliced Linketts and then putting it in tortillas. It is one of the greatest recipes ever just don't leave out any of the ingredients I once forgot to add the black beans and it wasn't even close to as amazing.<br /><br />Also since the Linketts are not meat based it not a problem to eat them straight from the can but DO NOT judge the taste based on that alone because they taste completely different when they are fried or grilled. Also I think most people would only like them fried or grilled especially people who are or were meat eaters.

review/summary: These make the best hot dogs!
review/text: If you like plain old veggie hot dogs, not the fancy apple or spice blends, then these will probably work well for you.  They're the closest thing I've found to a beef frank in a vegan version.  I've been buying these for years, since way back in the 70's in Berkeley when I first discovered vegetarian eating.  These are just plain old links with fairly thin skins that absorb the flavors of other foods somewhat when you add them to another dish.  They are the only ones that I use when making sauerkraut and mashed potatoes or with vegetarian baked beans.  I've cut them into smaller pieces and marinated them in vinegar and pepper spices to make a hot pickled sausage like you used to see in taverns in a big jar.<br /><br />It's sort of weird that they come in a can but they're packed in liquid which keeps them moist.  (It's always a challenge to get the first one out without breaking it).  I have a hard time finding this product in the grocery stores so I was delighted to find that Amazon sells them by the case and with Prime shipping it's a good deal.

review/text: I serve these as hotdogs for my vegetarian and Jewish friends who keep kosher. Once in a while meat eaters will try these and they like them, after I explain they aren't supposed to taste like meat and the texture might be a bit rubbery.<br /><br />I also serve them sliced up with fresh corn, or slice them into sandwiches, or make corn dogs out of them.<br /><br />Babies and toddlers also like them - just cut them in half so they can feed themselves. Much healthier than a hotdog with a bunch of mystery meats and unknown preservatives and chemicals.<br /><br />I've also diced these up into homemade vegetarian pot pies.

review/summary: Vegan Hotdog Heaven
review/text: When most people hear that you don't eat meat, fish, chicken, dairy, eggs, or cheese, they ask 'What DO you eat, salad and vegetables for every meal?' Loma Linda Linkettes are a very good meat alternative ~ not necessarily a weekly meal, but a tasty treat when you're grilling with friends or making chili-dogs (with vegetarian chili, of course)for game-day. Most of my meat-eating friends will eat Linkettes and not feel like they're sacrificing taste, and many of my meat-eating friends feed their children Linkettes instead of chemical-laden 'mystery meat' hotdogs. Purchasing from Amazon by the case is much more economical than buying individual cans at the grocery or health food store.

review/summary: Not what I remember.
review/text: I very much enjoy my canned hot dogs, and when I learned I could order them on-line, I was thrilled I could keep them in stock, ready whenever I wanted to eat a dog.<br /><br />Previously I ordered Veja-Links, but I saw these and the price was better (much!). They appear the same price now, so it must have been my lucky day, but once I received my new hot dogs and tasted them, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I was trying to find the ingredient list for the Linketts vs Veja-Links. One is Vegan and the other Vegetarian, and there is a difference, even in the liquid in the can. The Linketts are very soft and don't have a lot of taste. They just don't look as robust, either, a light pinkish/orange color (as is the liquid). They are more "lean", and from a healthy food aspect, I suppose that's for the best, but I eat my fake hot dogs for the taste. :) For me, this was a costly experiment, and the taste and texture are different enough to dislike the Linketts. I used to be able to eat these interchangeably, so I don't know if there have been manufacturing changes or not. I still have 10 cans to go.

review/text: For all you vegan and vegetarians out there, you can enjoy the taste of a goooood hot dog without the rubbery, bouncy kinds you get from the grocery freezers.  Plus, if your friends are the skeptical kind who won't eat vegetarian foods, try these for size!  Your friends may eat them all before you will.  You can search the all the stores to find these and if they sell them...they are priced TOO high compared to ordering a case which equates to half the price for each can.  You can try the Seventh Day Adventist, but you better get there before when they're first delivered or you have to wait until the next ship rolls in.  Ordering from Amazon is wonderful.  The best store that delivers to your door.  Loma Linda Linketts are the wayyyy to go!

review/summary: The BEST "hot dog" out there!
review/text: Over the years we've tried many different types and brands of vegetarian "hot dogs", and this is THE BEST.  For a time when we couldn't find Linketts we bought some other brands; they were okay, but JUST okay; better than nothing, but not really what we wanted.  Since we have Linketts again we haven't touched the others.  It's no wonder these keep going out of stock; they are wonderful.  When I first saw "Linkies" as we call them many years ago I refused to try them because they looked too much like meat.  I'm glad I got over that because I'd have missed these vegan treats all these years.

review/summary: Can't live without them!
review/text: My husband is vegetarian, and our 6-year old son and I are not, but all of us are fighting over the Loma Linda Linkettes, especially when they are just fresh out of the can.  They keep well in the fridge, and we found they have to stay in the liquid from the can to keep the taste.  To me, they kind of taste a little fishy, which I like.  We eat them cold with ketchup or without, or warmed up with a side of sauteed onions and tomatoes.  Mmmm... I think I'll go have one right now!<br /><br />The only problem with them is that they disappear from both brick-and-mortar and online stores.  Just like now, Amazon doesn't have them all of a sudden and they had no idea when they'll be back when I called to inquire.  Hope Loma Linda doesn't discontinue them, we don't really like any of their other products.<br /><br />Also, they may not be the healthiest thing on Earth.  True, they are veggie, but I don't think it's a natural pink coloring and I am not sure about other chemicals they use in them.  I don't really care though, it still beats eating mad cows!:)

review/text: I don't understand all the 5 star reviews here. I am a very health conscious eater, and I usually like meat alternatives. In fact, I usually like health foods that others find disgusting. However, this product has a ridiculously grainy texture and little flavor. More importantly, it's not remotely healthy! It is made primarily with wheat gluten, which is not exactly a health product and has little nutritional value. The amount of controversial food colorings, preservatives and corn syrup in this product are also disgusting.<br /><br />I used to be a strict vegan (for three years) and a vegetarian (for 13 years), but I've come to realize that eating products like natural, organic turkey dogs are a much better choice than eating wheat gluten and soy protein concentrate products. This product is a great example of vegan not necessarily meaning healthy. I got a package of Linkettes at a big discount,  and I would have been really upset if I had paid full price. At least they last for years, so I'll use the rest as my emergency food stash.

I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/summary: Not the best, but better than most
review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: The Goodlife Indoors!
review/text: I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.

We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

review/summary: The best Walkers shortbread
review/text: As a fan of Walkers shortbread products I was amazed and incredibly pleased with the homebake line of shortbread. These fingers are light, buttery, flaky and have a melt-in-your mouth deliciousness. They are perfect with a warm cup of tea with a friend.

review/summary: Walkers Shortbread HOMEBAKE Cookies
review/text: Fresh, delicate, and tasty.  Among the best cookies I have ordered.  They are better than the "non-baked" cookies.  Also, they were shipped promptly.

review/summary: The best shortbread cookies ever!
review/text: These cookies are always a hit, and I love them with my morning coffee.  There is a large Tin which I have also purchased which makes a good thing last even longer.  The smaller packages are great to give as hostess gifts.

review/summary: In my auto re-order
review/text: I have re-ordered this several times now.  They are sweet, crunchy, with a buttery base.  Usually one satisfies my sweet after dinner taste.  This one seemed to be a better value than the other Walker's I perused or ordered.

review/summary: yum yum for shortbread
review/text: These newer shortbread cookies from Walkers are so yummy.  I used to buy their regular shortbread fingers in the store and loved them, but these are a bit more rich-tasting and have a wonderful buttery flavor.  The original ones are a little bit harder.  These are a bit more tender.  I recommend them highly.

review/summary: Awesome shortbread
review/text: This stuff rocks. I have been a long time fan of the regular Walker's shortbread, but this tastes even better and has a better texture.  If you like their regular shortbread, definitely try it!

review/summary: Not as good as most Walkers
review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of Walkers shortbread so thought I'd order this 3-pack, particularly since it was available on Subscribe-and-Save. Sadly, I didn't like this Homebake recipe nearly as much as other Walkers cookies. It was kind of dry and not as buttery and sweet. They kind of remind me of plain scones with a lack of flavor. I'll stick to the regular Walkers shortbread in the future.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I bought 6  boxes of this product based on the two reviews.  My experience was entirely different than the previous two.<br /><br />The cookies were tasteless and dry.  It was like eating foam insulation which had been dried in your walls for a number of years.

review/summary: Not Enough Coffee
review/text: This rub was OK, but there wasn't nearly enough coffee flavor in it for me.  I put the rub on some chicken 3 hours or so before cooking it and could certainly taste the seasoning, but the coffee flavor was lacking.  I plan on cutting this with ground coffee next time I use it.

review/summary: This rub "ROCKS" on steaks
review/text: I sprinkle some of this rub on my steaks every time. Don't freak out about the "java". I'm originally from Texas... I know steaks. The Java works.<br /><br />Try it on chicken too.<br /><br />Boneless chicken breasts take on a nice color, with a bit of the "Java" sprinkled on the top.<br /><br />The taste... well...<br /><br />The taste is like you're sitting on a ranch, with the sun just setting on the horizon. Your sitting back, enjoying a hot coffee from a percolator (that's a none-electric coffee maker for you youngsters), sat upon a Tuscan Grill (another Steven Raichlen product to check out) kept hot by smoldering mesquite embers.<br /><br />And to top it all off... a nice iced tea.<br /><br />And for the record... CHARCOAL... not gas. Propane grills are only good for heat, not flavor.
