review/text: I was excited when I read the positive reviews, but when my almonds arrived a lot of them were crushed/broken.  It was a big disappointment and they were not particularly good.  Unfortunate buy on my end!  Maybe back in 2009 they were great, but my experience was not.

review/summary: For our wedding
review/text: Ordered these for our wedding.  A great bargain to order in bulk.  The guests complimented them as well!  I was nervous ordering online because checking in stores there were always some bags with almonds that were crushed and broken yet were more expensive.  But these arrived in good shape, not stale and perfect for guests.

review/text: I love this stuff - didn't know it had High Fructose Corn Syrup in it!  Grrrr<br />This is not product specific, but I have noticed that when I buy bulk on Amazon some of the companies ship out their close-dated items.  We purchase for our large family to save money, but it does not save anything to have to throw out what is out-dated after a short time.  I wish there was some way to communicate and find out what the products are dated are when I purchase here.

review/summary: Could work for other uses
review/text: I purchased an Axion 7" TV & wanted some protection for the unit when in storage or travel. Working great distances from home, I choose to pack a little house & stay near the jobsite. To kill time, I like to watch TV. I've had only a couple of them due to my insistence on buying good quality units. To assure these units I purchase last, I buy the protective covers that also act as a storage for the accommodating accessories too. That way there is less chance of equipment loss. How many times have I ran across a cord or a plug that I asked: "where did this go to?". Only to find the answer a few weeks later, after I've thrown it away.<br /><br />I'd say this denim case could be used for the small note books or Acer mini laptop. It is a stiff case & offers some protection. I wouldn't give it the Samsonite test however.

Outside of that, tasty tasty! I will always prefer Lavaza to Illy 10x over. Just smoother and richer on the senses without that dark acidity that I just can't stand.

review/text: After losing two full belt holes of girth around my middle in only 2 weeks after following the Wheat Belly diet  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609611543">Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</a> ) I decided to give up wheat flour entirely, and have had some trouble finding a suitable flour for baking.<br /><br />I originally used chana dal flour (also known as "gram flour," "garbanzo bean flour," or "chick pea flour". This flour, made from chickpeas, is available at any Indian grocery or here on Amazon under one of those names).  I continued to lose weight by using chana dal flour but it has a somewhat bitter taste.<br /><br />I then tried the Chebe line of flours ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACNWY8">Chebe Bread All-Purpose Mix, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>  ) which is manioc (tapioca) flour.  Very good, highly recommended, but the dough gets very chewy.<br /><br />I then tried cooking with just this coconut flour, in total disregard of the package instructions, which recommends not using this flour on its own but instead substituting a quarter of your regular flour with this.  Big mistake to ignore the package directions.  It wouldn't stick together and soaked up a huge amount of water.  Total disaster.<br /><br />I'm now doing as the package recommends and I genuinely love this flour.  It's totally delicious and I wish I could use it on its own, but it's just not realistic.  I'm now using a coconut flour-Chebe blend, with occasional coconut flour-chana dal flour days.  And I keep losing weight without any other changes to my diet.

review/text: This is the second time I've ordered this coconut flour. It's great to bake with. This is my favorite recipe to make with it. I have also used this basic recipe and leave out the chocolate and make a raspberry zinger like cake by spreading sugar free raspberry jam on top of the cake batter and sprinkling unsweetened coconut flakes on top before baking. I buy most of my baking supplies at Netrition because it's cheaper and only costs four ninety five for shipping no matter how much you buy. Here's the recipe for the coconut cake. I use 3 eggs and a little more coconut milk and use whatever sugar substitute you like. I use a mix of liquid splenda, erythritol and stevia extract.<br /><br /> Chocolate Almond Joy Cake<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />4 eggs<br />� cup canned coconut milk<br />2 teaspoons almond extract<br />� cup coconut palm sugar<br />� cup blanched almond flour<br />� cup coconut flour<br />� teaspoon sea salt<br />� teaspoon baking soda<br />� cups unsweetened shredded coconut<br />1 bar of 72% chopped dark chocolate<br /><br />1.

review/summary: Coconut Flour, not your usual flour!
review/text: OK, be sure you know this is really just ground up dried coconut!  It is NOT exchangeable with regular flour!  One must read about how to use it for success in baking.  However, if you think of it as protein powder, or a substitute for corn starch, it is easy to figure out.  A couple teaspoons in a smoothie, a little in the pan to thicken a sauce.  If you want to bake with it, there are recipes in cookbooks, many for free online - coconutoil.com, and coconuttraditions.com, I think. (Google it)  I mix a little in my kid's "just add water" pancake mix, with an egg,  a little melted coconut oil, some ground almond flour and whole milk or almond milk...it makes the best pancakes and waffles, a lot more flavor and texture, with a lot of added healthful things.  I am going to give it a try in muffins, I will follow the recipe as I have read enough reviews that this is not the place to "wing it" as I usually do!  But love the smell and I can't wait to taste it in baked goods!

(whole wheat) flour<br />1/2 c. coconut flour<br />1/2 c. water (or as needed to reach proper consistency)<br />1 tsp. soda<br />1 tsp. baking powder<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />Walnuts (optional)<br /><br />Mash bananas well and mix with beaten egg. Add sugar and mix thoroughly. Melt butter and add to the banana mixture. Sift together remaining dry ingredients and add to banana mixture. Bake in a greased 5x9 inch pan (2 lb. loaf pan) or two smaller pans. Bake at 350� for 1 hr. If using smaller pans, bake for 40 min. Bread is done when toothpick comes out cleanly.

review/text: I'm new to cooking without wheat/grains so it was a bit awkward at first. Though I have to say I love this product. If you want something to make breads for sandwiches I would not suggest this. It's great for making sweets though. Coconut flour is dense and requires more liquid than a wheat flour so that took some getting use to, but as a product this is excellent. It has a great flavor and aroma. I do suggest you keep baked products in the fridge though as I've found that coconut flour products spoil easier than wheat flour ones. I'm not sure why but it just seems that way.

review/summary: Great in gluten-free baking
review/text: I got this specifically for use in gluten-free baking, for a low carb option.  I generally stick to whole grains and nut meals for baking and wanted to use coconut flour to lighten it up a bit, change the flavor.  This is the first one I've used, so I don't have a basis of comparison to other brands.<br /><br />I do not bake with only this flour, but cut into others.  It is a bit sweet, so I cut back on my overall sweetener in the recipe.  As well, it leaves a slight coconut flavor, but not enough to interfere with the overall dish.  I am very pleased with the texture and  flavor.<br /><br />As well, this was my first add-on purchase through Amazon.  Interesting concept.  No question the low price is why I got this brand, and I liked that I didn't have to buy 4 pounds of it and risk not liking it.  The product and the add-on option were a good fit to try out the small quantity.  Definitely recommend both.

review/summary: Gotta Try - Love this Hot Sauce
review/text: I first experienced this Hot Sauce back in 2004 when stationed in Florida, there's a sub shop that I miss called Firehouse Subs.  Essentially great subs with tons of unique Hot Sauces on the bar you can try.<br /><br />While not very hot, this has a simple and enjoyable flavor mainly derived from mustard.  I have never been able to buy this in stores, but I'm glad I found it on Amazon.  The packaging was also a great job by the seller Hot Sauces 'n more.<br /><br />If you love sauces but want something minus the kick, you can use this on almost anything.  Absolutely must buy!

review/text: I'm an avid fan of the B.B. honey sweet mustard and the B.B. hot mustard. I ordered a case of this mustard thinking it would be as great as the others and because we often times mix the honey sweet mustard with cranberry sauce.  Quite honestly, neither my husband nor I care for this product much.  I can't explain exactly why but we just don't care for the taste.  I'm thinking I might use it for marinades and spice it up a bit or use it for glazes.  But as a garnish for meats or veggies it just doesn't make the mustard.

It's literally the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had!  It was very easy to make too.  My only reccomendation would be to put 1 cup less of chicken broth than the instructions say... it makes the soup less brothy and more hearty.

review/text: I purchased a variety of the soup flavors and I do like them all a lot. However, I am finding I have to either pre-soak the vegetables and beans  an hour or more, or cook them a half hour longer in order for them to be done. If they are not completely done, there is stomach upset. The veggies are so very dry they require a lot more cooking than the directions suggest. Otherwise, the flavors are great and the soups are hardy and filling.... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NGAT60">Frontier Soups Homemade In Minutes South Of The Border Tortilla Soup, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>

Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.

I live in a remote area of the wild west Rocky Mountains where Indian or Pakistani cuisine is completely non-existent in the form of a restaurant.  Purchasing a cookbook online, even our grocery stores don't sell the spices needed to create such dishes.<br /><br />I met a Pakistani woman on a flight from LA who introduced me to these Shan mixes.  She said they are very authentic, spicy.  All you need to add is the meat/vegies.  The instructions are printed in English on the back of the box and are easy to follow.  She sent me some and I tried them.  They are delicious.  And yes, SPICY!!!!  I was afraid to use the whole packet of spice for my chappli kabab, so I used 2/3's of it.  Even that much was alomst too spicy.  The flavor was magnificent.

review/summary: Arguably but not defintively Better than Greenies
review/text: My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows. Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs. Greenies. The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage. slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices.

review/text: My dogs like these the best and I'm glad if it cleans their teeth.  I bought a 32-count for what I felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more, hopefully for the same price.  I have two VERY picky eaters of food and treats, a toy and a miniature poodle.  They turn down practically all treats offered them.  These are their favorite (except for the gourmet duck treats from Costco that I can't find anywhere else).  These are really worth buying.

review/text: I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/summary: Minty Sweet Herbal Sedation
review/text: Between my third and fourth year of medical school, I did a four week elective at Bastyr University, an accredited university for CAM (complementary and alternative medicine).  I did this for my personal curiosity, it is something I want to understand better and learn about.  But there are also practical reasons for an MD to study CAM.  Whether they admit it or not, our patients are use alternative medicines in conjunction with, or instead of, physician prescribed medications.  It makes sense for doctors to know at least the basics of what is out there and what people are doing, so our patients can comfortably discuss these things with us.<br /><br />During a lecture on herbal medicine (with the 'H' pronounced very deliberately), the herbal practitioner discussed what was known of the biochemistry of Valerian root.  Apparently it acts on the GABA receptor in a manner very similar to way benzodiazepines act (like valium, xanax, ativan, klonopin...).  So when they recommend Valerian root for its sleep promoting and/or anti-anxiety effects, it probably really is an effective treatment.  But then it seems to me it is probably also not a completely benign medication (we know the benzos aren't).  I asked the instructor if people could become tolerant or dependent on Valerian root, or if it could interact with other medications the way benzos can.  She smiled politely, doing her charitable best to conceal her contempt for my ignorance and the attitudes she presumed were behind my question.  After a beat, she answered "no."  "You see, this is how plant spirits differ from pharmaceuticals.  The plant spirits only go where they are needed."<br /><br />I'm not sure if I flinched or if I successfully suppressed my knee-jerk spasm of skepticism.  But this is where the CAM stuff gets away from me.  I want to have an open mind.  I certainly believe there is wisdom and alternates ways of healing out there outside of western medicine.  But I had a hard time swallowing it when CAM practitioners want it both ways.  They use the hard sciences any time it supports the use of alternative medications, but the second the hard science conflicts with their beliefs, they fall back on mystical explanations.  I'm not saying there's nothing to that, but let's just say it's not something I can wrap my mind around.<br /><br />In general, I think the herbal medicines are probably effective and safe when used very moderately.  Just as you can't get in too much trouble chewing cocaine leaves (versus snorting refined cocaine), you probably won't run into troubles with an herbal tea made with Valerian (versus potent doses of benzos).<br /><br />I think a lot of physicians have no problem with people using alternative medications except for a concern about the unknown.  An MD is not trained to convert units of herbal supplements into standard benzo doses, for example, so it introduces confounders.<br /><br />I'm not down on the herbal meds but I do believe that, when they work, they work for the same reasons pharmaceuticals work:  They have active ingredients causing real physiological effects.  And a placebo effect factors in, but we all know by now that our prescription drugs are benefit from placebo effects, so that's a wash.  So know what you are taking, how much is considered safe, and talk to your doctors about it.  Don't fool yourself into believing that herbal medications are harmless because they are "natural."  If your doctor is condescending and automatically dismissive, get a new doc.<br /><br />Ultimately, the course challenged me to more precisely define what an open mind is.  I have an open mind, in that I'm curious, I'm open to learning, I don't believe I know everything, and I'm willing to listen to other perspectives.  But an open-mind is not a blank mind.  I have my experiences, biases, and education kicking around up there.  My open mind does not have to believe everything it hears.  I can have an open mind and still maintain a critical stance.<br /><br />By the way, I'm giving thumbs up to this product.  It's a nice tea, nice relaxing bedtime treat with just a bit of honey.  If you need it for insomnia of muscle spasms, just make sure you talk to your doctor about the udnerlying problems and mention any supplements or herbal meds you use.  Thank you for listening.

review/summary: It Delivers
review/text: I wasn't familiar with this company before buying their Valerian Mint tea bags, but I can say the purchase was well worth the money.<br /><br />The bags included are not the smaller ones normally used for single serving tea cups. They are large enough to brew up to 2-3 cups and ideal for smaller tea pots. Right there the price becomes reasonable.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is fairly agreeable, too; Peppermint is never a bad way to go when flavoring medicinal/therapeutical herbs. I usually drop in an extra bag of chamomile when steeping Valerian, so that helps with the flavor, too.<br /><br />Personally speaking, I feel the effects of Valerian tea much faster than, say, capsules of Valerian root one might buy at a natural foods store. I can recommend this as a soothing alternative to whatever you might normally drink to relax at the end of the day.<br /><br />If I had to list any specific concern, it would be the intensely vivid dreams that Valerian seems to produce from time to time, but nothing so mind-bending that I would stop drinking the tea.<br /><br />Lastly, avoid heavy or daily usage, beacuse the build-up in your system can lead to problems. You don't wanna be that health-obsessed guy In Newport Beach who died from a massive build-up of Echinacea in his system. Give your body time to flush the herbs out. They aren't always water soluable like Vitamin-B.
