review/summary: Like a frozen juice bar
review/text: I've tried quite a few of this Switch juice drinks and they all remind me of a frozen juice bar: very sweet, very tasty, and way too intense to be a drink. My teenage daughter -- she of the world's largest sweet tooth -- loves them, though. I love the similar IZZE sodas, and buy those every week. But I wouldn't buy this again. Unless she makes me.

review/summary: Good Black Cherry Flavor
review/text: I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans.

review/summary: A refreshing drink
review/text: This Black Cherry flavored drink from The Switch is a refreshing and tasty beverage that beats soda any day of the week.  Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Black Cherry flavor in particular tastes great, although the Starberry Kiwi and Watermelon flavors aren't bad either.  Refreshing, worthwhile, and much healthier than any diet soda or nearly any other carbonated beverage, The Switch is definitely worth trying out if you're looking for something refreshing, healthy, and tasty.

review/text: I had tried the Switch tangerine flavor before trying this flavor; and while I enjoyed the tangerine, the black cherry surpasses it.  I consider this to be a great alternative to the usual sodas, as it doesn't have all those nasty ingredients that sound more like chemical compounds than like something to ingest. I would definitely drink more of these.  Hooray for juice that tastes like a fun soda!

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I like the idea of a carbonated fruit juice.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I did!  Although being a fan of black cherry soda, I was expecting something a little different.  Generally, when I think "black cherry" I expect something with a little more "bite" to it than regular cherry.  This tasted more like a concoction of juices just leaning a little more on the cherry side.  Still, it was very good, and a healthy alternative to soda!

review/summary: Very good soda
review/text: For a soda that has no sugar added and no preservatives, this stuff is pretty good.  The Black Cherry flavor is strong but not overpowering.  The carbonation level is just right.  There is a very slight aftertaste but not enough to really bother, just enough to keep this from being a 5 star review. For an 8.3 oz. can it has 130 calories, 0 fat, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbs, 33g of sugar, and 0 protein. Recommended as a healthy alternative to sugar laden soda or to taste absent diet soda.

review/summary: Juicy Juice with fizz!
review/text: Switch black cherry cola tastes a whole lot like Juicy Juice with carbonation added.  Here's the deal - it's made with sparkling water and pure fruit juice from concentrate.  It tastes great!  But as a healthy alternative to soda?  Hmmm!  Well, it is all natural.  It also gives you 100% of your Vitamin C.  But it has the same calories as a Coke, and packs in 33 grams of sugar per can.  So it's got vitamins, but it also has some high calories and lots of sugar to boot.  Does it taste good though?  Heck yes! I would drink it as a treat, or in place of soda when that is appropriate.  Great taste!  It's also refreshing.

review/summary: Very Cherry
review/text: I reviewed the watermelon flavor of this drink as well, and found it ok. I'd use that one as a mixer, but probably not drink on its own.<br /><br />As for the cherry flavor - don't like it. I'll admit that I usually don't like cherry flavored things, but black cherry (like this drink) is usually OK. I also like cherry soda, so I figured this would be ok.<br /><br />Well, unlike Chery Coke or something similar, this is JUST the cherry flavor (duh to me) and not the coke, so I don't like it. Too cherry for me. I also gave it to my husband to try - he is a soda drinker and does like cherry. He said he didn't think it was carbonated enough. He was also confused if it was supposed to be an energy drink or not, probably because of the small can size. He said for en energy drink not bad, but for a soda not great (funny how energy drinks get a free pas on tasting bad).Neither of us finished it.<br /><br />So conclusion - if you really like cherry flavor, you'll probably like it. If you don't, you won't.

review/summary: Flavorful Juice Drink
review/text: I tried this The Switch Black Cherry flavor as well as the Watermelon Strawberry.  I happen to like black cherry as a flavor for beverages, so keep that in mind as you read this review.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />The beverage was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not at all tart.  It tasted similar to other black cherry carbonated drinks I've had.  I would compare it in taste to Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer with Switch being a tad more "soda" tasting.  It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:<br />* 130 calories<br />* 15 mg sodium<br />*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)<br /><br />So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.<br /><br />It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.<br /><br />PRICE:<br />The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.<br /><br />Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as "natural" as say all natural juices.  However, if you want a carbonated drink, The Switch is better for you than soda.

review/summary: A tangy taste.
review/text: This is a pleasant combination of a very tangy texture lift to juice. I liked the flavor and would drink this beverage on a regular basis. I must point out that it's really not a 'unique' drink. My husband described it as simply a 'carbonated juice' texture, but we both liked the flavor. If you prefer carbonated, sparkling juices and drinks with an extra boost in the 'fizz factor', you'll enjoy Switch. At zero fat and high vitamin C, it's a better choice than many drinks on the market and could easily replace my soda pop craving.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

review/summary: Delicious & refreshing
review/text: Wow. I don't just like this product, I love it. It's so good, you can forget that it's also pretty good for you.<br /><br />Switch is 100% juice, reconstituted with sparkling water to give it some carbonation.  It isn't as 'fizzy' as regular sodas, but I think that's a good thing.  It also isn't quite as sweet - another good thing. There is NO added sugar of any kind - just fruit juices.<br /><br />Don't expect it to be 'low calorie'. Fruit juice has lots of natural sugars and they add up to 130 calories for an 8.3 oz. can.  It is still a healthy alternative to the chemical and artificial ingredients of regular pop.  Like all good things, enjoy it in moderation.<br /><br />I tried two flavors for Vine reviews; both were good, but the Black Cherry is outstanding.  It has really clean, rich, true cherry flavor. This is the one I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Sparkly Cherry Treat!
review/text: The Switch is an alternative to juice or soda... It is a sparkling juice made with a concentrated juice blend, reconstituted to fresh juice concentration with sparkling, filtered water.<br /><br />I tried both this and the Kiwi Berry flavors and I have to say that Black Cherry is by far the more accurate and rich flavor... I am a big Dr. Brown's soda fan and think Dr. Brown's makes the best Black Cherry soda, but if I had to choose a favorite (and not a diet favorite, a full carb version) I would choose The Switch. The flavor is much deeper, and fresh...<br /><br />The Switch does have as many carbs as regular sodas, as it is juice...It's important to remember that juice and regular soda both have sugar- just different types.  The Switch is very sweet, this is full power juice, not sparkling water with a meager splash of juice.<br /><br />I think this would be a great alternative to traditional soda/pop for kids (on special occasions of course) and it is definitely like a more sophisticated soda/sparkling beverage for adults...<br /><br />Yummy stuff. Not an everyday beverage for me as I watch my carb intake (due to type 1 diabetes) but this could be worked into many different types of meal plans...

It reminded me of medicine I took as a child or cough medicine they have now over the counter.  As far as the product though, I like it.

review/summary: I know it's not a soda
review/text: But it could really use some more carbonation. A bit more fizz might take the overpoweringly cloying taste down a notch, and make it more palatable. As it stands, it's far too sweet and leaves a strong syrupy aftertaste that burns your throat and makes you thirsty. It's a very small can, but I could barely get through half of it before I was reaching for the water. On the plus side, it does actually taste of black cherry.

review/summary: Grown up Cherry Pop!
review/text: I'm reviewing based on taste and whether or not I felt it is worth the money and if I'd purchase it again.<br /><br />First, the taste was wonderful. It reminded me of the cherry pop I drank as a kid but a little lighter and less syrupy and less bold. It has a great sparkle to it, refreshing (unlike a lot of carbonated beverages in my opinion), and yummy. It was like a little can of cherry delight.<br /><br />Second, it's listed for about $23.00 here on Amazon for a case of 24. That seems expensive given the cans are small. However, looking at the nutritional features of the drink - 100% vitamin C, no preservatives, added sugar, etc. - it seems like a better deal. But then again, I'd be more likely to buy these for my son and not myself so in that case, I'd probably be more likely to go with the flavored water juice pouches which are less expensive and have the vitamin C and no sugar, too. So unfortunately, I don't see these as being a great value.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Taste 5/5<br />Value 3/5

review/summary: Tastes like Juice but not a Substitute
review/text: As with other varieties of this product, it tastes as advertised, Black Cherry, but I'm wary of any health claims.  While it may be made of juice it isn't juice and juice isn't as good for you as the solid fruit.  In this small can, only 8.3 oz, there is 130 calories so be wary of that too.  If you love soda pop I think this could be a healthier version but if you don't, don't start drinking this this. Make sure that you like the actual taste of the fruit in question and not a soft drink version because this is the real deal in terms of taste.

review/summary: better than soda pop
review/text: This is better than any commercially available Black Cherry soda pop I've tried, which is saying a lot since I'm a big fan of the stuff.<br /><br />It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice.<br /><br />It is lightly carbonated; about as fizzy as day-old champagne. Just enough to tickle the tongue and add a little crispness. Doesn't have the sharp bite and acidity of soda.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely juicy, not sugary like soda. But, it's not very complex. Think juice box. Despite claiming to be "black cherry", I'd say the primary flavor is actually grape. The company uses grape juice as a base for most of their products for sweetness. The cherry flavor is a very similar to a Jolly Rancher.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid as a preservative.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'd say its worth buying. Its a refreshing drink that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later.<br /><br />My only criticism is, it needs more cherry flavor. I'd recommend a higher dose of cherry concentrate and substituting some pear juice for grape juice because pear has a more neutral flavor.

But at 8.3 ounces I was pretty close to done before I noticed it.<br /><br />The taste was light but distinctly black cherry.  I gave my younger son some to get his opinion.  He said it was good.  He usually drinks Sprite.  He also likes some of the flavored sparkling water and said that he likes this better.  He also likes a lot of juice and prefers it to this because the "fizz" took away the "juice" taste.<br /><br />Overall we both liked it and would drink it again - definitely one of the better beverages of this type we've tasted!

review/text: The Switch Black Cherry Juice beverage is extraordinarily refreshing, is as sweet as soda, with no added sugar plus 100% US RDA of Vitamin C. What more could you ask for, well I'll tell you, MORE! The can is only a skimpy 8.3 Ounces which barely rose above halfway in a normal sized drinking glass. Since it has no added sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners I felt like I could drink more, it did not seem as "heavy" as soda, yet had all of the taste. Drinking this as an everyday beverage however would not be economically feasible for me, since I would have to drink 2 cans at a time to satisfy my quench. The taste itself is great, it totally reminded me of "Dr. Brown's Black Cherry Soda". It was not too tart and not too sweet. It had a pleasant after taste, which just left me wanting more...

It is very good, and given that one can find very few things that are all natural in a can these days, it is a smart alternative for those who consume too much soft drink.

review/text: Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />Prior to trying this, I enjoyed both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">kiwi berry</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">watermelon strawberry</a> flavors. Those were good on their own and decent with a pastry, but black cherry is a different case. First of all, it smells like grape, perhaps white grape. Secondly, it tastes like a flat cherry soda or a carbonated cough medicine. And honestly, I taste a hint tomato soup in there. Try it for yourself! It's an OK flavor, but not as great as I expected. But the can is cool - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.

review/summary: Great Soda Alternative - Just don't like the price!
review/text: First, this is a household that VERY rarely drinks soda of any type due to health concerns and a deliberate decision to eradicate soda from our diets. Having said that, there are times when you really would like a soda. The Switch soda seems to fit the bill as a soda alternative...no sugar, no preservatives and no artificial sweeters - just carbonated fruit juice. So far so good. The taste is pretty good and quite comprable to "unhealthy" sodas - to the point that my other half didn't think it was healthy at all...he liked the flavor very well.<br /><br />The only reason ths didn't get a full five stars is the size is relatively small...something I personally didn't mind because I actually like the size and shape a LOT but spouse didn't...he felt it was just far too small...and the price. AT roughly $1 per can, this is considerably higher priced than a regular soda - however, in keeping with other healthy alternatives.<br /><br />Pro's -<br />Good taste (can't tell this is healthy) that isn't "over the top"<br />Nice level of carbonation - just right<br />Healthy alternative to a standard soda<br /><br />Con's -<br />Price<br /><br />Debates -<br />Size - 1 liked size other didn't like size (wanted larger size)<br /><br />Bottom line...<br />I would probably purchase this if the price was lower but being a non-soda drinker would be unlikely to add this to my shopping list at this price. I probably would buy it via a vending machine when out and about and wanting an alternative to plain bottled water or soda (which I dont drink).

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I tried this product with and without ice...it was equally good either way. Carbonating fruit juice was a new idea to me...I could picture serving it in champagne flutes to people who don't drink alcohol.  What I found surprising was that other juices were listed as ingredients in addition to cherry.  The manufacturer had to have gone through a lot of trial and error to make a drink that tastes 100% cherry, as this one does.  When the grandchildren come over, they are so bored with cartons of apple juice.  This will be a good alternative for them for special occasions.  The fact that there is enough Vitamin C to fulfill the minimum daily requirement puts it over the top in my book.

review/summary: If you've gotta have a sweet drink...
review/text: Let's face it, people love their drinkable carbs. I spend much of my day lecturing on the evils of high fructose corn syrup, and my patients spend much of their days knocking back cans of it anyway.  Diet soda's no better, still taxes the pancreas and heaven only knows what those fake sugars do really.  Shall I recommend a switch to Switch?<br /><br />Shared my can with the office staff today.  "Good flavor" "Deelish" "This would be great over ice with vodka" (??) "Nice fruity taste...what is it, blackberry?"  "Great flavor, tastes like cranberry."<br /><br />The bottom line?  Switch got ten thumbs up.  If you've gotta have a sweet drink, I'd recommend it, but personally, I don't think all those grams of carbs are the way to go.

review/summary: Tasty soda
review/text: This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. You can taste the grape juice in the mix.  It's as powerful as the black cherry flavor.

review/summary: Thought it had a great taste, but a bit pricey!
review/text: The Switch soda's are a, mostly, excellent alternative to real soda. They cut out some of the worst traits of the major colas like: perservatives and added sugars. Don't let that fool you though, they aren't really a "health" drink due to the high calories. They have almost as many calories per serving as an average Coke product. This black cherry flavor has 130 calories.<br /><br />They are slightly more expensive than soda as well, and unfortunately the portions are smaller so if you are factoring this expense on dollar per oz you'll come up short with the Switch sodas. If you are more intersted in flavor than cost, these are definitely a better alternative to soda or fruit juice. The carbonation gives them an extra kick like soda, but they have the great sweet taste of juice without the acidic, artificially flavored taste of Coke or Pepsi products. I would take one of these over a Cherry Coke any day!<br /><br />I tested one can then decided to buy a whole case of 24. Packaging was very sturdy and weathered delivery well. That being said, it is a carbonated beverage, don't leave it sitting on your doorstep too long in freezing temperatures.<br /><br />Just to wrap up, I'd highly recommend them if you don't mind the cost to portion ratio, and aren't under the missimpression that it's a healthy beverage.

review/summary: Carbonated juice
review/text: This beverage reminded me a lot of Jones Black Cherry except it doesn't feel as "syrupy" and it was a little more sweet.  (But not in a good way.)<br /><br />When the package arrived I happened to be very thirsty, so I opened it right up and drank it without chilling.<br /><br />It tasted pretty good until the after taste hit me.  For a drink that advertises to be 100% juice it has more of an artificial after taste then I think it should have.  The taste reminds me of children's chewable vitamins.<br /><br />In general I would suggest mixing up your own version of this by combining juice or juice syrup with soda water.  Not as convenient, but probably more refreshing.

review/summary: With a natural black cherry taste, it's all about tasting the meat.
review/text: Well Black Cherries are not steak, so what do I mean by meat.  I mean that when I eat cherries, and grapes, and other largely hollow fruits, I find the taste is in the textured pulp, just under the skin, what I call the meat. Most black cherry drinks I've had in the past despite the fancy names, could not capture this aspect of the taste, but I definitely detected it here.<br /><br />I enjoyed every drop of this drink, and was surprised that it was carbonated, something I usually only find with non-alcoholic grape drinks during the holiday season.  The carbonation works well with the 100 percent fruit juice blend.  I guess it all comes down to price and shipping, if the price is not too bad, and Amazon carries this product, I would probably buy enough, or combine it to get the free shipping.  I could do with a supply of these in my fridge.

review/summary: Great taste, with a hint of apple
review/text: I'll start off by saying we're a family of soda drinkers. My daughter likes Sprite, and my wife and I drink one or two cans of Coke a day.<br /><br />Our family tried this for dinner one night, and everyone in the family really liked it and asked for more. This includes our two year old and four year old.<br /><br />Overall the flavor isn't overly sweet, so it doesn't have quite the cotton candy feeling that you get from Coke. While it isn't as sweet, it still tastes very good. There's no odd aftertaste, and it's not dry like sparkling water.<br /><br />The only complaint I might have is probably specific to the cherry flavor. While it was good, it definitely tasted a little bit like apple. It was almost like sparkling cider.<br /><br />I did appreciate that everything in the drink was natural, while still tasting great and not being incredibly expensive.<br /><br />We'll definitely have The Switch again, though maybe in a different flavor.

review/summary: This tastes more like apples than cherries!
review/text: I like apple juice, but when I drink a beverage that is supposed to taste like black cherries, I want to taste black cherries!  The overriding flavor in this drink is apple juice.  If I concentrated hard enough, I could (almost) detect a faint taste of cherries; I won't buy something if I have to concentrate to detect the flavoor I want to taste.<br /><br />If you like apple juice more than cherries, this soft drink would be perfect for you.  It's got plenty of carbonation, and it has no added sugar or artificial sweeteners (which is why I gave it two stars).  Even without the sugar, it's plenty sweet (without being too sweet).  If you want a flavor other than apple, try the tangerine.  Of the three flavors I've tried, tangerine is the only one to actually taste like it's supposed to.

The amount of carbonation was perfect, and the taste was sweet, but not too sweet.  My kids tried it and liked it too, and although they don't regularly drink soda, I would let them have this now and then as a treat.  I'm impressed with the ingredient list as well, and if you are going to drink a sweet carbonated drink, this one would be a better choice than many others.  It reminded me a bit of the soda my mom used to buy at the "Pop Shop" as a kid.  No aftertaste, either.  Worth a try!

review/summary: Surprised by full flavor-found it better than ice
review/text: We received out "Switch" today. I was curious about how an "all natural" soda would taste, having had my palate "spoiled" by articificial flavors such as the major brand sodas. When I received it, I wanted to compare it to something comparable such as Cherry Pepsi (my favorite soda).<br /><br />My first impression was that it was very sweet, especially because I first tried it without ice. It's not as sweet as a soda with artificial sweetener but definitely sweeter than some other softdrinks on the market. I did not look at the ingredients until I tried it with ice. With ice, it was definitely more easy going down. The carbonation, overall is not as overpowering and "gasey" as regular sodas, but the ice toned down the sweetness to a desirable level. My variety was cherry,but I actually tasted the grape more, than the cherry.<br /><br />The packaging is sleek, and conveys the purpose (appealing to those seeking refreshment, while foregoing all of the mystery incredients found in some other sodas). The message to "switch" to this soda is prominently displayed on the can. It is an obvious marketing strategy,but a bit "obvious" in its execution-if the drink makes a big splash, I wonder how they will use that blatant message in campaigns. The soda has significant sugar content, so it is not exactly a "diet" drink, but it certainly appeals to those that care what is in their drink. Overall, a pleasant experience.

review/summary: Refreshing and Easy to Drink
review/text: My family no longer eats processed food or drinks sugar-heavy carbonated drinks. I wanted to taste this because it seemed to be a good combination of juice and carbonated drink.<br /><br />Because refrigeration reduces flavor, I poured the Black Cherry Switch over ice. Another adult and I split the can, to get two different responses. We both agreed the black cherry flavor is rich and true. There is an initial vegetal smell when you pour and then smell the drink. This is actually a good thing. It smells "real" and pleasant. Carbonated drinks often smell chemical.<br /><br />You can tell it's black cherry even with your eyes closed. (Many flavored drinks depend on color to inform your taste.) The color is pale red, which looks natural. The can says "no artificial colors, no preservatives, no sugar added, no corn syrup, gluten free."<br /><br />The ingredient list includes apple, grape and cherry concentrates. You can taste the apple, and it is pleasant. Neither one of us could taste the grape concentrate.<br /><br />The carbonation is soft, which means the bubbles are medium-sized and don't cause burping. I am a big fan of soft carbonation, as it doesn't make you feel bloated. The other adult who tried the drink does prefer hard carbonation, but enjoyed this because it tasted more like a juice drink.<br /><br />There is a nice smooth mouth feel, and no after taste. The drink tastes clean, not too sweet, and refreshing. The can contains 8.3 oz of liquid and as 130 calories, and 33 g of sugars, for a total carb. content of 35g.<br /><br />In comparison, a 8-oz. can of Coke has 105 calories; 8-oz. of Tree Top apple juice has 120 calories. A large banana has 172 calories and 40 grams of carbs.<br /><br />While I never recommend replacing water with juice, I do get tired of drinking nothing but water, and The Switch Black Cherry is a delicious change that combines juice and carbonation. The Switch also comes in other flavors, which I did not test.

review/summary: What I like and what I don't like
review/text: My family and I spent 12 years in another country where cherry juice was readily available and very much enjoyed! I ordered this in hopes that this would satisfy our desire for that delicious taste. I found some things I like and some things I don't like about this product.<br /><br />First, things I like:<br />This product is 100% juice and has a taste that reminds me of the cherry juice we used to enjoy overseas.<br />It is a potential substitute for soft drinks.<br /><br />Now the things I don't like:<br />Fruit juice--at least this fruit juice--is too sweet to quench one's thirst. Perhaps if it was diluted with Seltzer water, it would do the trick. If you give this to kids, limit quantity and give them a drink of water afterwards so they don't get thirstier and thirstier as they drink.<br />While this is 100% juice, it isn't all cherry juice. The first ingredient is apple juice, the second grape juice, the third is cherry juice. Makes me wonder if the "natural flavors" on the ingredient list are to try to boost the cherry taste.<br />It's expensive--nearly a dollar for an 8 oz. can. At that price, I wouldn't keep this around to drink any old time.<br /><br />So there you have it.  I wouldn't buy this on a regular basis, but if money is no object, you might want to give this a try and see what you think.

review/summary: Make The Switch you beverage of chioce.
review/text: Like the Kiwi-Strawberry product, The Switch Cherry is also an excellent product that exceeded my initial expectations.<br />I'm something of a connoisseur of sodas, a fanatic in fact, cherry sodas being my favorite.  The Switch Cherry has an excellent flavor and  no funny after-taste common to artificially flavored carbonated beverages.<br />The use of natural flavors and no additional sweeteners makes this product appealing, especially given the recent revelations of possible health problems associated with High-fructose corn syrup. The use of real fruit juice, gives me high-hopes that our High-fructose corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.<br />The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  As we've become a society of excess, sodas, colas and other soft-drinks have not been immune,  The Switch brings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy 8.5 ounce serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.<br />I can also envision huge potential for this beverage in the department of mixology, with bartenders coming up with new mixed drinks featuring The Switch, to numb the economically and socially depressed masses.<br />An all-around excellent product that I will certainly be looking for in stores.

review/summary: Taste, the Final Test
review/text: Let's begin with the packaging: Smart, appealing. "The" (upside down determiner) Switch has a fun name, the can is hip, and says natural. The Yin yang symbol of a double-ended arrow says it's something different. But the swirling arrow can give the impression of a spearhead tail, which I'm sure is an unintended image.<br /><br />Switch is all-natural fruit juice, and the ingredients are a shortlist of -- well, carbonated fruit juice. Big thumbs up, when you compare the list on every other soft-drink can. The portion size is 8.3 oz., which probably less than you're used to in a canned drink. Personally, a can of soda is too much for one serving, so the smaller portion can be seen as a plus. At over $1.00 per pop (if you'll pardon the intended pun), if you're a soda drinker and want to get more of less for less money, well you'd be guzzling the Wall-mart store brand by the gallon, wouldn't you?<br /><br />The final test is the taste. Other reviewers seem to want something different. Because I'm not a big soda fan, I wasn't comparing it to anything else. What else is there like this? How much black cherry taste do you want vs fizz? That's the bottom line. The Switch seems to me to be a wonderful flavor, satisfying. It was a pleasant experience without guilt. Try it and see for yourself.

Unfortunately, I count calories, and I don't want 130 calories for something that tastes like a slightly fizzy apple juice drink. The flavor was supposed to be black cherry, but it tasted strongly of apple juice which makes sense since it's one of its main ingredients.<br /><br />I simply don't see myself "switch"-ing to this drink rather than my diet black cherry (or diet cherry cola) soda. If I want to drink a vitamin drink, then I turn to Emergen-C which is much lower in calories and packs a huge vitamin wallop. It also adds a carbonated feel to juice products when I choose one of those. So, unlike the advertising, I did not find Switch to be "the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION."

review/summary: Just plain sugar water
review/text: I got a can in the mail. Open the can and saw that the calories are from 35 grams of sugar (fruit juice) and nothing else, I thought to myself, this is all sugar melted in water and carbonated, I drank a sip and could already feel sticky in my mouth on the teeth. It's going to rot my teeth for sure and leave a sticky mouth feel. Carbonated just not like what I would call a good carbonation like soda or mountain dew. It's less carbonation than those but has as much sugar or more than a can of soda. This is just sugar water. And, you can basically imagine, putting 35 grams (about 35 teaspoon of sugar, melt it in a warm water and then cool it, and that'd be exactly what this is... less the carbonation). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. it will shoot you through sugar high and make you crashing down like make you fall asleep while driving.

review/summary: Feh
review/text: This cherry soda tastes strongly of... cherries. That doesn't sound too surprising until you taste this product and compare it to other nominally "black cherry flavored" products you may be familiar with. This is the genuine article. It's as unlike Dr. Pepper as beef jerky is unlike Kobe beef.<br /><br />Now, if you think drinking a can of fresh cherry juice would appeal to you, I think you'd probably like this. It tastes bright, natural, and real. But it turns out that large volumes of pure cherry juice just isn't to my personal liking, and I suspect the same would be true of many other adults. I've therefore given this three stars, not for execution (which is flawless) but for concept (which may not appeal to everyone.)

review/text: I really enjoyed this flavor Switch. The cherry flavor comes through clearly, even if it contains mostly other fruit juices. The carbonation is wonderful, similar to Izzy juices - which I like very much too. Although it is somewhat sugary, there is no corn syrup in this product and the relative small size, 8.3 ounces rather than 12 ounces, seems like a good idea.

review/summary: Better than expected, but not perfect
review/text: My first thought when trying this beverage was that it tasted like Cherry Apple Juice with light carbonation.  The cherry flavor was not really that noticeable or at least not as powerful as I expected from a drink claiming to be Black Cherry.  It is not a heavy like a cola, but lighter in the style of Ginger Ale.<br /><br />As other posters have said, the ingredients are listed in this order: "Sparkling water sufficient enough to reconstitute Apple, Grape, Acerola and Cherry Juice Concentrates."<br /><br />Why was Cherry not the main flavor?<br /><br />This beverage is for those of you who are looking for great taste (not enough cherry though) without added sugar, corn syrup, and other ingredients that are not good for you and that can be found in other drinks.<br /><br />Would I drink this again in the future?  Yes, but only if it was purchased by someone else.<br /><br />Recommendations: Larger can (only 8.3 oz) - More Cherry Flavor<br /><br />Last thing that does not affect this review:  When this can arrived for me to try, the top was covered in a thin layer of dust and dirt.  Make sure you wash the can off before you drink it.

review/summary: Bait and Switch
review/text: The idea of a carbonated 100% fruit juice seems like a good one, but for me Switch doesn't deliver on its promise.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the fruit juices here are from concentrate, and though the flavor is supposed to be black cherry, that benighted fruit is supplemented by larger portions of apple, grape, and acerola fruit.<br /><br />What in the world is acerola?  I'm fifty-something, and I've never heard of it before.  Or is this some chemist's name for a synthetic fruit, as "diamonique" is the synthetic version of diamond?<br /><br />Well, whatever.  The point is, a buck a pop is pretty pricey for such a little can of soda, and most folks will probably prefer a regular-sized can of black cherry soda for the money.<br /><br />I also think this is a little over-carbonated for my taste, but drinking it with ice might solve the problem.<br /><br />Finally the can design is hideous.  If it weren't for the three cherries pictured, you might think that this was a can of drain unclogger or something.<br /><br />So I've taken the bait -- and now I'll Switch back to my real favorite, fresh apple cider.  Even here in NYC, a gallon is only $5 at the farmer's market, and the stuff tastes better and is actually good for you.<br /><br />It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature!

review/text: After reviewing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> I was a little reluctant to try this as the Izze drinks were really strong, and in my opinion overly carbonated.<br /><br />However, this drink had the perfect mixture of carbonation and flavor. It certainly tasted like Black Cherry to me and was easy to drink. Where as the Izze drink had to be sipped because of too much carbonation.<br /><br />The only drawback I can see with this product is if you buy the case of 24 cans it amounts to almost $1 per can, when the cans are only a little over 8 ounces. That makes this a rather expensive can of fruit juice/soda.<br /><br />Based on taste alone though, I really enjoyed this and can easily see myself drinking this again.

The can size is  slim (we've gotta watch those calories, after all), but it's all about the taste inside the can. It's zesty, bubbly, and packs a powerful punch. The Black Cherry tasted a bit more like grape to me (it could just be my taste buds) and the aftertaste was a bit harsh. But I will definitely consider buying a whole case.

review/summary: A bit too sweet for my liking
review/text: "The Switch" seems to be another take on carbonated fruit drinks. It immediately reminded me of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO">Izze</a> line of drinks that I've tried in the past...same size, and same basic idea of just fruit juice and carbonated water. After trying this one sample though, I'd have to say I prefer Izze. The black cherry Switch that I tried had a decent enough flavor (very mild cherry flavor but still pleasant), but it was really sweet, and had even more sugar per can than Izze, which was already pretty high. I think these drinks are a nice alternative to sodas, if you just have to have something with fizz and can't take artificial sweeteners. Definitely a better choice for kids who want something sweet but at least a tad healthier since these are natural sugars with a lower glycemic index. But it's still a simple sugar, and there's a LOT of it in this drink, 33g in 8.3 oz. The price is also pretty hefty, at almost $1 a can. Personally, I think I do just as well getting fruit juice of my choosing and adding some club soda to it for fizz. But when I am in the mood for something sweet to pack for a hike, etc. and just have to have something, I'd probably look for Izze drinks first.

review/summary: Sweet and tart - The Switch Black Cherry is a yummy treat, but it's soooo sweet.
review/text: The Switch says that their sodas have no added sugar - but it's a bit of a dodge because they add a ton of concentrated fruit juices (apple, grape, and acerola join cherry fruit juices).  All that sugar totals a whopping 33 grams in an 8.3 oz can - far more than, say, Cocoa Cola for the same volume (27g).  The black cherry flavor, however, is tart and real and true and its yumminess transcends all that (natural) sugar.  The color is real too - a lovely brick red with a hint of fruity opaqueness.  The carbonation is light and feels right.  All in all, The Switch Black Cherry is a real treat.  It tastes just like the cherries in the cherry pie I get at the diner.  Sweet and rich, with a lovely dose of tartness; there's no false note in this big rich flavor at all.  The only downside is the cloying sweetness that creeps in the aftertaste.  35 grams of sugar is just too much.  If they had toned it down a bit this would be a much better product, in my opinion.

I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.

I thought 100% juice would be a healthier alternative, and the can is a reasonable serving size (8.3 ounces/130 calories).<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry tastes exactly like cherry Juicy Juice, only lightly carbonated.  So I imagine people who like JJ will appreciate Switch.  Unfortunately, like Juicy Juice, it is extremely sweet.  I almost didn't finish the can because it was so sweet.  For kids who love soda, this may be a good alternative - it does have 100% daily Vitamin C.  However, I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Not because it is healthier being "fortified" (with 10% of C, B6, niacin) but because with only 70% juice and 30% sparkling water, it is a little tart and far less sweet.<br /><br />Overall, might be good for kids and adults with a sweet tooth.

My favorite so far is Kiwi Berry that I thought was very good.  Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.<br /><br />This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.

The serving size is good, too.<br /><br />I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.<br /><br />My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:<br />Kiwi Berry:  5 stars - would buy again<br />Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars - would drink again, but probably won't buy again<br />Black Cherry:  3 stars - would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it

review/summary: Ugh, too sweet
review/text: I can't tell who this is targeted to, but it doesn't seem to fit kids or adults, in my opinion.<br /><br />It's a small, skinny can - just 8.3 ounces, compared to a typical soda can at 12 ounces.  It's all juice and there's no sugar added, as promised.  But there's still 33 grams of sugar, compared to 35 grams in a full sugar version of regular Coca Cola.  They also aren't kidding about not full carbonation.  It's not exactly flat, but it's close to it, and it actually needs the carbonation to cut down on the sweetness.  This is some seriously thick-tasting juice to my palate.<br /><br />This is something like an amped up Welch's, according to my taste buds - slightly more complex tasting, but not as interesting as a Snapple or any one of the similar individually bottled fruit drinks out there.  It's hard to describe, but with a less sweet juice, you can pull the flavors apart and say, tell the kiwi and strawberry apart in the drink.  This isn't that kind of juice.<br /><br />The "black cherry" is made up of apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices - reconstituted - with filtered sparkling water, so it's not particularly bad stuff, but aside from the 100% daily dose of vitamin C you get, there's nothing here to recommend it over a glass of orange juice either.<br /><br />Sorry, if I want a carbonated fruit drink, I'd rather add ginger ale to a Snapple or Sprite to CranApple or something - this is just way, way too syrupy, even for a kids' drink.  Maybe it's being targeted as something convenient and fun for kids, but it's an awful lot of sugar for an alternative to soda.

review/summary: Good-tasting soda, Nice for a Special Treat
review/text: The Switch Black Cherry soda has a light, fruity taste and less fizz than a regular soft drink. It's a pretty color -- sort of  a deep maroon.  It would make a nice addition to a fruit punch which you might mix for a party.  I put the can into the refrigerator overnight and then poured it into a glass with no ice.<br /><br /> I enjoyed it very much, although I must say that the black cherry flavor is not really dominant.  It tastes fruity, and it has no chemical taste like some fruit-flavored soft drinks.  Overall, I think it tastes better than  Juicy Juice, which it kind of reminded me of.  Actually, "black cherry juice" is the third ingredient listed -- apple and grape juices are listed first.<br /><br />I like the can size (which is less beverage than a regular 12-ounce soda) because I constantly find myself opening a Coke and then not finishing (and thus wasting) the remaining soda.  So this 8.3 ounce size is perfect for my taste.<br /><br />Switch soda is advertised as being more healthful because it has no added sugar, but that's not quite the case if you read the product's ingredient list.  The juice used has sugar, it's just not artificially sugared, and it has no artificial colors.  So it's all juice, but those juices have sugar.  It's more healthful than a regular soda, though, since it's all-natural.<br /><br />Switch is a little pricy.  I buy it for a special treat for myself or my daughters since it is something different from the regular soft drinks, and it has doesn't contain artificial ingredients.  We also like the Tangerine/Orange flavor, but are not crazy about the Grape.

review/summary: tasty, all natural, but NOT low-calorie
review/text: While the premise of this drink is good (all juice, no sugar added), it fell short for me.<br /><br />First of all - the taste. While supposedly Black Cherry, I tasted a hint more grape than black cherry. And, the ingredients label confirms that the primary juice is Apple, then Grape, and THEN acerola and black cherry. It's not a bad taste, but not one I was expecting.<br /><br />Secondly, if you're looking for a dietary drink, look elsewhere. Although the label would lead you to believe with "no sugar added", the nutrition facts give the real story for all this juice: 130 calories in the tiny 8.3 oz can!<br /><br />For comparison, that's MORE calories than Coca Cola Classic (97 calories in 8 oz).<br /><br />To be fair, this can of Switch should be better for you in moderation - it has 100% of your daily Vitamin C, and no corn syrup (unlike Coke).<br /><br />One final note - the label claims "100% juice carbonated", but this is juice from concentrate, reconstituted with sparkling water.<br /><br />Ultimately for me, the small portion, high calorie count, and just-ok taste will leave me with other choices. (Honest Tea has some FANTASTIC low-calorie, no artificial sweetener choices).

review/summary: Great flavor and healthier than sodas
review/text: I love Cherry Coke and Cherry 7up so I had to try this flavor and once I chilled it in the refrigerator my 11 year old and I popped it open and we both liked it tremendously.  This product has the right amount of juice blends and it tastes tart and the carbonation doesn't overshadow the cherry flavor. This was by far our favorite flavor and my daughter has already asked if I will order it. It is healthier than sodas since there is no added sugar and it has 100% fruit juice.  If Amazon has sales on these I will be buying them for me and the kids.

review/summary: Guilt Free Flavor!!  (With no Soybean con attached!)
review/text: The first sip gave a pleasing cherry flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. "100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want."<br /><br />2. "Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION."<br /><br />3. The logo has "THE" placed upside-down and reversed, atop "Switch," with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: "100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below]and cherry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts

review/summary: Good taste, right size
review/text: This soda is lightly sweet with a touch of tartness. It comes in an 8.3 ounce can (many sodas are too large for my taste). It has a sweet, full cherry flavor. It reminded me somewhat of Myers sparkling soda but with a less sugary taste.<br /><br />As a point of reference my favorite soda is Sprecher's root beer for its mellow, creamy taste, plus it uses honey and cane sugar instead of corn syrup. My least favorite soda is Coca-Cola because of its overly sweet taste, corn syrup, and caffeine. Most people love Coca-Cola so if you do you probably won't like this soda.<br /><br />I would definitely try this soda again.

review/summary: The Switch vs. Soda
review/text: The Switch bills itself as "great tasting healthy alternative to soda" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against another black cherry soda that I drink and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Black Cherry (Per Serving)<br />15.7 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.2 g Carb<br />4.0 g Sugar<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Black Cherry Soda (Per Serving)<br />14.2 Calories<br />3.3 mg Sodium<br />3.7 g Carb<br />3.4 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars, The Switch Black Cherry didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it I was hoping for a nice flavor with this one and I got it.  Even with the main two juices used in this drink being Apple and Grape, the cherry flavor came through very well.  Much better than the Orange Tangerine version.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages although I was not impressed with the nutritional facts, the taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was preferred! The only complaint would be the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce), but I could see buying this as a treat to have around in addition to other sodas.

review/text: Take a 100% black cherry juice (no "from concentrate" here) add just a little carbonation, and the result is magnificent!  Even better, my Wife who does not like to try new foods loved it!  There is no aftertaste, and the flavor is outstanding.  I appreciate the quality of the ingredients from a health perspective, no sugar or corn syrup added, for example, but I really couldn't get over the taste.<br /><br />The carbonation level is not like that of a normal soda.  It is about the same amount of carbonation as a Red Bull.  In other words, just right, especially on a hot day when you're really thirsty.<br /><br />Buy this now!!!

review/summary: Sorry, I "Switched" back!
review/text: The Switch Black Cherry,<br /><br />When I first saw "The Switch" I was really energetic to find a good tasting and healthy alternative to drinking regular soft drinks, although I am normally a diet soft drink drinker.<br />Upon first opening my can of Black Cherry I could immediately smell the scent the black cherries. With my first taste, it was diffidently real juice and it went down very smooth. It was not until I started tasting the effects of that wine-cooler after taste that my taste buds started to dislike it. Within a few seconds of my first drink, I could sense the taste of a fermented beer like taste. Because I am not much of a wine drinker, nor do I like the taste of beer that has had a chance to sit idol for some time, I believe I will pass on further purchases of anymore "The Switch" drinks. It just doesn't fit the taste of what I'm after in a soft drink replacement.<br />I give the Black Cherry flavor a 2 star for its true black cherry flavor, but the stale beer taste forbids any score higher than that.

review/summary: Belch juice
review/text: That's what I would've called it.<br /><br />Anyways, there's not much to describe as it tastes exactly like you are probably imagining.  Cherry flavored juice with added carbonation.  I admit I was curious to see what 100% carbonated juice would taste like as opposed to something like a lemon-lime soda that contains almost all water and almost no juice.  My first impression is that they made a good decision in keeping the carbonation lighter than the average soda (still enough for a belch or two).  My second impression is 100% juice just doesn't taste good carbonated.  I think I would have preferred the juice just by itself.  Finally, at approximately one dollar per can I would most likely skip this for a sixteen ounce bottle of juice at roughly the same price if I were in the grocery aisle.

review/summary: I'll drink, but I won't switch!
review/text: Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review!<br /><br />Switch is a new, delightfully tasting carbonated drink. I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.<br /><br />Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!<br /><br />In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.<br /><br />As for its can slogan: "100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't," I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. "What you want" is "100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment." I agree with all of those. So far, so good.<br /><br />Let's look at "what you don't" want: "No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free." True on all those.<br />Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.<br /><br />In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.<br /><br />I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.<br /><br />I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.<br /><br />Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: "May I have more, sir?"<br /><br />Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age?

That allows me to keep this review short and sweet, though maybe not as sweet as this drink. The Switch is a fruity, unique beverage. Carbonated juice is a good idea, but the overall flavor is weak and the quantity is small. This might still be good for making a break from the regular cola (or diet cola, or water, or sports drink, or whatever) drink rut, but I really can't picture too many people picking up cases of this to consume on a regular basis. It is tasty and original for when you are in the mood for something different, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.

review/summary: Different! New!
review/text: Please excuse the first part of this review being the same as the review for the Kiwi Berry flavor, but the facts are the same for both products.<br /><br />I always enjoy reviewing a new product wondering what I will find, so I was pleased when given the opportunity to review "Switch."  What is "Switch," a new refreshing drink  that will dazzle you.<br /><br /> The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink,but has a catchy saying - "100% of what you want 0% of what you don't."  What does that mean?  According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink, especiall children.  But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, nor will our children, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />BLACK CHERRY SWITCH:<br /><br />It was definitely full of the rich flavor of cherry.  If you like that taste you will truly like this one.  It isn't sweet, tends to be on the tart side and has a little punch to it, which was nice in a way, but to me a little overpowering.  Since it was carbonated you felt as if you were drinking a soda, but you were not.  The flavor was pleasant and the drink refreshing, not as good as the Kiwi that I tried, but  different than other drinks which makes it fun.  I don't think I would purchase the cherry flavor of this drink however for personal use, but to each their own. If you want a different drink, that appears to be healthier than soda, Switch is for you.

review/text: I love fruit juice and I love carbonated beverages so I really expected to love this drink. Unfortunately, that was not the case.  First of all, the portion size is diminuative in comparison to drinking a canned soda. I did not find the taste to be very appealing. It just didn't taste like black cherry to me, at all. It had a harsh flavor with a strong aftertaste and the carbonation was very mild - almost tasted flat. As other reviewers have pointed out, too, it is relatively high in caloric content even without adding additional sugar.  It is great that it contains a full days supply of Vitamin C but, for me anyway, that does not justify the cost of the product or the weird taste.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it, and I wouldn't throw it out or anything, but I suppose I found it a bit boring.<br /><br />To be fair, I do not drink that much 'regular' soda anyway. This one had good flavor, just like carbonated cherry juice (maybe a *little diluted). It was refreshing and did not have any bad aftertaste.  It is all natural, has no corn syrup, no caffeine, and no artificial colors.  Plus, as a bonus, you get 100% of your vitamin C for the day.<br /><br />For what it is worth, my wife loves sodas, especially cherry and felt the same way. Her current favorite, Dr. Brown's Black Cherry, sells in cases of 24 cans (12oz cans) for about a buck a can, too.  Dr. Brown's has high fructose corn syrup as the second ingredient, with Cherry flavor as the third and a artificial color at the end of the list.<br /><br />If you are trying to find an alternative to all of the chemical brews available out there, this could be a viable alternative for you.

review/summary: A Great, More Healthy Alternative to Soda Pop  (but I don't love this flavor)
review/text: I love carbonated drinks. Coke, Pepsi, Red Pop, Creme Soda... I think what makes me prefer them is the carbonation. Somehow, it makes me slow down and enjoy the drink more.<br /><br />However, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water. I don't like that. There's nothing good or healthy about HFCS, and I get enough of it in the various foods I purchase without having to drink several ounces of it every day.<br /><br />This product, The Switch, is a great alternative to regular soft drinks. It's basically just carbonated fruit juice with some preservatives added. It gives me that zing I like in carbonated drinks, but without any of the high fructose corn syrup (of course fruit juice has its own sugars). It's much healthier and tastes great.<br /><br />That's what's good about this item. The only bad thing I can think of is that the cans are TINY. I'm sorry; I'm an adult male, and I can't be satisfied with an 8.3 ounce can of juice. Two cans is about right, and at the price they're asking, that's about a dollar and ninety cents to get close to the quantity of a typical bottle of soda pop (20 ounces). Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, I guess so, but I would think it would make a 24-pack go quickly in my case. I really wish they'd just package them in 16.6 ounce containers, and then still sell as a 24-pack.<br /><br />This flavor, Black Cherry, does not sit with me well. To be fair, I'm not a fan of cherry juice anyway, but when you introduce the carbonation to cherry juice, it ends up tasting more like cough medicine than a tasty beverage. That's just my opinion, of course, and I'm sure fans of cherry juice will love it. Personally, I would like to see just plain Strawberry, and I'd probably like some other berry choices like Mulberry, Blackberry, and Raspberry. Cherry, for me, isn't the ideal choice, which is why my review of Strawberry-Watermelon gets five stars, but this one only gets four stars. Quality-wise, they're both the same; My biggest grip as concerns this review is this specific flavor.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to recommend this product if you want a fizzy drink without the crud you find in most other soft drinks. This is at least real fruit juice, and while I can't say that carbonated drinks of any kind are "good for you", I can at least say that this one is made with good intentions and won't make you feel like you're bloated after downing a couple of them. I'm going to "subscribe" to one of their products soon, just to see if I can notice a change in my weight, energy level, and general health by switching (Hey!, See? Good product name!) to something that is a bit more natural.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may vary. I'm sure your taste does.

The cost of this product (at nearly $1 for an 8.3 fluid ounce can) is also prohibitive. At this time, I can see myself purchasing it as it is far more economical to buy other fruit juices.

So, although the fact that there is no sugar and that Acerola (Vit C) is one of the ingredients, and although it goes down clean and refeshing, the taste of Switch Black Cherry is disappointing.

review/text: This was the healthiest thing since, well, fruit. One can contains a whopping 33 sugar grams and 35 carbs. While it may be "natural", be careful how much you drink! As far as taste, it was just OK. It tasted like bubbly apple juice, even though it said "black cherry" right on the can the taste was just plain ol' apple juice!

review/summary: Not bad, yet nothing great -- way overpriced
review/text: As an avid soda drinker, I know what I like. I haven't been drinking it much lately for reasons of health, so the thought of a healthier replacement is always a good thing.<br />Well what we have here is pretty much what one expects from a carbonated juice, as that's what it is. It certainly doesn't taste anything like normal black cherry soda, a favorite flavor. If anything, it tastes more like sparkling grape juice -- but seriously, almost $1 for an 8.3oz can, in a 24 pack? It's just not worth it.<br />I can see this working as a great substitute for soda for kids, but otherwise I don't see this particularly worth the purchase.

review/summary: Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff
review/text: As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">Black Cherry</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.

review/summary: Another great concept with not-as-great execution.
review/text: Black Cherry Switch is 100% juice (a mixture of juices actually, but more on that later) combined with filtered sparkling water.  It has no sugar added or corn syrup, no artificial colors or preservatives--these are all positive attributes.<br /><br />I think the concept of combining fruit juice and carbonation in a small-shot serving (8.3 ounces in a slim can) is just fine.  My problem with Black Cherry Switch in particular (the only flavor I have tried) is that cherry juice is listed fourth out of four juices this beverage contains (the other three are apple, grape and acerola juices).  As a result, the cherry flavor ends up battling (and getting trounced by) these other flavors.  The end result was, for me, inadequate cherry flavor.<br /><br />Will I run out to buy more Black Cherry Switch?  No.  Even though the beverage was refreshing, the cherry flavor was too muddled by other juices and too low in the ingredients list to give me the punch of black cherry flavor that I expected and wanted.<br /><br />Would I buy more Black Cherry Switch if it had a more distinct cherry taste?  Yes, it is highly likely that I would buy it at least occasionally.

review/text: I chose a cherry flavor to test, because I like cherry tasting candy and beverages. I came home from work today tired, thirsty and ready for a break. I was happy to find The switch had arrived, and it was already nice and cold since it is a really cold day.<br /><br />I sat down with my laptop and my switch ready to take a break. I took a nice long drink and found that this tasted nothing like black cherry to me. I reminds me more of Robitussin cough medicine. Another flavor might be more tasty, but I won't be purchasing this product for myself. I will stick to the much for refreshing and flavorful IZZE beverage.

review/summary: Wow! Better than I expected!
review/text: My wife and I shared our first can of The Switch tonight with dinner. First we noticed the size of the can. It's just a bit shorter than a Coke can, and about half as big around. The pop top worked well, opened very easily. We enjoyed The Switch black cherry drink with our meal of baked tilapia, steamed zucchini, and a wonderful homemade tomato broth with tortellini and sausage.<br /><br />The color of the drink was quite pleasing. We joked that it looked like a sparkling rose' with a hint of amber. We swirled our drinks and inhaled the bouquet. We noticed there were no artificial odors. It smelled faintly like a fruit juice of some sort--though no distinct whiff of cherry.<br /><br />The carbonation was light, but not too light. For us it was just right. The flavor reminded me of the black cherry sodas we had at home when I was growing up--just a tiny bit lighter and a bit less sweet. All in all, this was a pleasant drink, tasted fine, and contained nothing more than some fruit juice concentrates, water, and ascorbic acid. We both enjoyed it.

review/summary: Like a juice box, but in a can with bubbles.
review/text: The Switch has everything going for it.  Cool "extreme"-sounding name, symmetrical tattoo-able logo, shiny-colored can, the promise of 100% natural goodness, and vitamins.  Everybody loves vitamins.  Problem is, it isn't particularly enjoyable to drink.  Now, I drank it down no problem and didn't find it unpleasant, but it's not something I would seek out again. I gave my wife a gulp and I'd print her official statement, but I don't think Amazon allows most of those words on the site.  It was the basic "tastes like [add four word combination of profanities here]" assessment.<br /><br />The Switch basically tastes like a kiddie juice drink, but carbonated.  Personally, I can only drink a can or two of anything carbonated in a day without suffering digestive tract issues so I'd rather just drink some lemonade, orange juice, or even Gatorade (it's got electrolytes!) if I'm on an anti-soda crusade.  If you crave a bit of the bubbly and are on a health kick or nostalgic for your childhood,then give this a try.  It ain't half bad in my opinion.  Hell, if you're a vegan it will probably be the best thing you've tasted in years.  I applaud the concept of all-natural soda, but I don't see "Switchaholic" entering the American vocabulary anytime soon.  Give it a shot if you're curious, but remember our American motto: if it's not going to kill you, it probably tastes like crotch.

review/summary: First Apple, Second Grape and then a touch of cherry flavor
review/text: This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice.  These clearly make up at least 80% of this juice by volume. I was hoping for something with both more flavor punch and a more noticeable cherry flavor. I also prefer more carbonation than the very low level in this sparkling juice.  Instead this juice mix has a very light red or pink (blush) color due to the minimal amount of Acerola present (also called Barbados Cherry) followed by even less cherry juice.  To my taste, this juice mix has less zing and character than even a good non-alcoholic sparkling cider or sparkling grape juice.  What I look for in a sparkling beverage is a good sweet/sour contrast enhanced by the carbonation.  Instead the Switch folks have chosen to call a juice mix that is primarily apple and  grape juices "Black Cherry" when in fact it doesn't even have the flavor intensity of a good Black Cherry soda.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this is not horrible stuff by any means. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  What you are getting is primarily the taste of apple juice and white grape juice with just a touch of cherry flavor and color. Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion ("No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives" is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely "natural" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.

It's just carbonated juice.<br /><br />However, I didn't really quite catch that 'black cherry' flavor.  It tasted more like apple juice than anything else.  Nonetheless, it was still good!

review/summary: Tasty Cherry Switch
review/text: The 8 ounce can was nice.  These days you get super-sized everywhere.  Bottom line this is fruit juice that has been carbonated.  I tried two flavors and found them similar in taste.  Very high caloric levels and carbohydrates, too.  They may not add sugar but that could be because there is so much already in it from the grape and apple juices used by many manufacturers to sweeten all kinds of drink products.  The cherry flavor was a littel light as well.  Good points, they use a very high quality level of Vitamin C from Acerola cherries.<br />I would have preferred a more concentrated taste or heavier presence in the flavor.  Maybe they will try that in a newer drink?

review/summary: At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For
review/text: UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I "ordered" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below).  I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: "A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE."  Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be "healthy."  Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain.  Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The "diet" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of "off the diet."  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a "wolf in lamb's clothing" for those who consider themselves "heath conscious."<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />"The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]"<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as "Carb" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Black Cherry with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?

review/summary: Very good soda alternative, just expensive.
review/text: The switch black cherry is a very good product. I love a drink that has no artificial and/or high fructose corn syrup. It is a great refreshing carbonated beverage. Amazon is about the only place I can find this stuff. Luckily, with Prime it doesnt cost anything for shipping. However, the downside is the cans are rather small and the cost is rather high. I would make this one of my primary drinks if it was less expensive. Also, while this isn't "good" for you with the amount of sugar it has, at least it is natural fruit sugar and is not as bad for you. But keep in mind this isn't something you want to drink a 25 pack a week as it is still high in calories due to the high natural sugar content.<br /><br />Flavor wise I have tried the fruit punch and the black cherry so far. I would have to say black cherry is my favorite.

review/summary: They should all be called Apple
review/text: I got this juice on the gold box deal one day, and I had pretty high expectations.  The problem is, the flavor is not varied enough, they are all primarily apple and grape juice (although I haven't tried the orange flavor, which one reviewer said tasted much different).  This doesn't necessarilly mean this juice isn't good.  Actually, the black cherry juice goes amazing with pizza, so I do recommend it, especially over less-natural drinks, like ones sweetened with Aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup.  All in all though, the flavor of this juice just doesn't impact you as much as it should for being black cherry.  It honestly does taste like apple sometimes.  It's not as bad as the kiwi-strawberry though, that flavor is just too sweet, and doesn't taste remarkably like strawberries OR kiwi.  This is still a great drink relative to most soft drinks, just wasn't well executed.  I'd rather pay a little more and get a better quality one, but that other fizzie juice, "Izzie", doesn't appear to have any significant difference in juice composition besides extra vitamins.  I'm gonna try it though the next time I go to the grocery, since it has less sugar (and sugar is something Switch has a little too much of, imho) so hope to keep updated.

review/summary: Neutral - my preferences reflect heavily
review/text: I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally "gummy", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is "no sugar added" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can't recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here - I'll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one.

review/summary: Nice alternative to soda
review/text: Switch is a great alternative to soda for those who crave the carbonation of cola or other soda.  It contains no added sugars or corn syrup and purports to be a healthy alternative.<br /><br />I found the black cherry version to be fairly tasty and satisfying.  Why not give it five stars, then?  Several reasons:<br /><br />1. the carbonation overwhelms the black cherry taste<br />2. the 8.3 ounce can is small<br />3. the cost of a 24 pack of these small cans is high.<br /><br />I would like to try other flavors to determine if the carbonation problem is prevalent.  A few are apparently available including grape and orange.<br /><br />This is a good idea that could be great with a few changes.
