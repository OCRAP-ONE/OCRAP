review/summary: They're not bad
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

review/summary: Fantastic little treats!
review/text: Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!

review/summary: Great 100 Calorie Treat!!
review/text: I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!

review/text: Of all the 100-calorie pack snack products I've tried (and there have been many!) these are my absolute favorites. The funny thing is that I don't even like Oreos, and am not that crazy about chocolate. However, these Thin Crisps are exactly that, thin and crisp. They are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger.

review/text: They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.<br />I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams.

review/summary: Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling
review/text: These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

There's simply nothing better on the candy marketplace than this masterfully concocted product, so be glad that the owners and creators have found a way to bring it to the masses.  Given their emphasis on small batch quality over quantity, it can be hard to find in a lot of grocery stores, but now anyone with a computer can rightfully gorge themselves.  I've emailed the folks at Funley's via their website to inquire as to whether they're putting actual crack in the little treats (as they're so damn addicting), but they just say that the only thing in there is "fun, love and chocolate-y goodness".  Sounds like they're trying to protect their recipe, but who can blame them.

review/text: I contacted the company regarding their claim that the product is:<br /><br />"All Natural" and has "No Artificial Anything".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these statements to be no more than marketing hype, as the product is not non-GMO.  Even when the Funley's marketing person responded to my query, he re-stated the claims above, then stated that the product is, in fact, not non-GMO.<br /><br />It is arrogant to assume a consumer's memory is only a sentence long--that we aren't "smart" enough to understand that two statements in a short email are contradictory.  Funley's is another company that has abandoned honesty in favor of trickery in marketing.  While the product may be tasty, the marketing is distasteful and dishonest.  There is nothing natural about GMO ingredients; it's common sense.<br /><br />If you are not aware of the problems with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), such as preponderance of soy and corn on the market, please visit your favorite search engine and get started!

They reminded me of a snack my mother used to prepare and I have been hooked for a few years now. While I am discerning about my snacks I accept that they are usually sinful. What a pleasant surprise to find that over the years Funley's snacks have become free of preservatives, trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. Now when my kids ask what I have in my mouth I can offer them a stix in the mud snack with a little less guilt - they say a sweet tooth is inherited genetically....

review/summary: Not Your Fathers Powdered Eggs
review/text: Most people that buy powdered eggs tend to use them in recipes as a replacement for real eggs.  My introduction to instant eggs was not so indiscreet.  I first tasted them on a camping trip with my sons scout troop quite a few years ago.  It was late spring and getting warmer so we were concerned about bringing real eggs along.  We had the "Honeyville" brand that is available here on Amazon as well. I found them to be surprisingly good scrambled.  In fact when done right they seemed indiscernible to me in respect to real eggs.  Same texture and flavor.  I decided to buy more powered eggs years later when I started to do more numerous hikes that took me further out into the wilderness, and I found myself missing the taste of eggs over an open fire. Being the frugal gourmet that I am I opted to try the Barry Farm egg powder over the Honeyville for it was a bit cheaper. Not only that, but I already owned and have used Barry Farms chicken and beef bouillon powder for quite some time and found them both to be excellent in soups and stews.  I am pleased to announce that my being a tightwad this time around was very well placed, and rewarded. The Barry farm egg powder taste very good when prepared right. I make them here at home as scrambled quite often.  And as a recipe substitute I find they are undetectable as to be compared to real eggs. They are most definitely just as good as the Honeyville brand. (Although in all fairness, I have noticed lately that Barry Farm is just about the same price now as the Honeyville. I still prefer the taste of Barry Farm).  The only suggestion I would make to anyone that wishes to be adventurous and make scrambled eggs with this powder is make sure you grease the pan well.  They stick something awful if you don't, just like real eggs.  There will always be a core amount of folks that would never attempt cooking or tasting powdered eggs either scrambled or in a recipe. For those that fit into that category don't bother to get adventurous now.  For those of you that have tasted these before, or are tempted to taste them now, I highly recommend Barry Farm egg powder.  They're nowhere near as bad, or the same powdered eggs soldiers used to tell horror stories about when talking about the cuisine of their war years...

review/summary: powered eggs
review/text: Item came before expected ship date. I made scramble eggs with it, on the first chew my brain was like what in the world is that but on the third chew my brain was like oh I see where there going with this, I taste the eggs. I do not recommend eating these as you would fresh eggs but I have baked with it and it produced excellent brownies. In the future, I will only bake with these eggs. I only give the product four starts because it didn't came in a reseal-able bag ( I wish it came in a container) and it wasn't very tasty cooked by its self. Over all, I am very satisfied with the product and I will use it strictly for baking.

review/text: OK- - So I had to go old school when I ran out of GPB Conditioner... I admit I was more than a little skeptical about trying this (everyone else harps on the egg-white condish recipe), but I must say I loved it (a little aloe + egg powder go a long way to conditioning a girl's hair). Can't say much foodwise--I'm a Vegan.  But, as far as home conditioners go, it's more than alright, it's definitely a keeper for those who have the time to experiment with recipes. Sometimes hard to find, but definitely a great product.  A+

review/summary: A tender bean with many uses
review/text: The Eden Cannellini beans have a nice texture and a simple flavor that blends well with other foods. I also find them more digestible than some other beans.<br /><br />Good mashed as well as whole, I have used them in place of tahini with garbanzo beans to make a nice, light hummos, mashed them and mixed them with seafood and herbs/spices to make a South-American (Brazilian?) style fritter (dried shrimp is traditional I gather, but anything you like can be good -- the beans hold everything together and are mild enough to let the other flavors shine through. Lightly dredging in flour gives you a crisper surface if you decide to try it...), and more.

review/text: I guess the title says it all.  Some beans (like pintos) are as good or better when soaked from dry and cooked at home than the canned version, but I much prefer canned cannellini beans.  I use them in Italian tuna/bean salad and in soups.  The cans drain easily.  There could be a few more beans in each can and a bit less liquid, but all in all they are most satisfactory.  I feel a lot healthier knowing I'm not getting any BPA poisons along with my tasty white beans.<br /><br />We eat very little meat so it is important to me to use the best beans, and in my opinion Eden brand is the best.

review/summary: Great canned product without excessive salt or harmful chemicals/preservatives!
review/text: I LOVE these canned cannellini beans. They are organic, which is important to me, and do not contain any of the harmful chemicals/preservatives that so many canned products have. I also love the fact that there is no salt added, another hard to find quality in canned goods.<br /><br />While I do prefer to make my own beans from scratch, when in a pinch, these serve me well. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the product or experienced the problems that a couple of the other reviewers have had. The beans always come out creamy and delicious...they are good enough to eat on salads (after a rinse of course).<br /><br />The Subscribe & Save option is great for these, too, because it works out to be less than what I would pay in my local grocery store for the same product. Plus, buying products by the case is not only easier, but it leads to a well-stocked pantry. I will always keep these beans on hand.<br /><br />I love Eden Organic products, but this is definitely my favorite!

Now need to figure out how to return it.<br />It would be better of someone marked this tea as "Ceylon tea with ***".<br />If you are fun of infused teas - you can try it.

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

review/text: These crackers are a great way to get whole wheat into your diet & into children's.  They are low in fat & sugar, and they taste great.  I haven't met a child yet who doesn't like them.  The ingredients are good as well.

review/text: 1.  I love  Amazon's grocery/makeup/cleaning products subscription service.  It is only beta now, but I truly hope they will continue it.<br /><br />2.  This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.
