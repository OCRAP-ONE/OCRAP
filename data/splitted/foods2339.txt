review/summary: Great subtle flavor, electrolytes, and no sugar - yes!
review/text: A household of athletes, we love Nuun.<br />The flavors are all refreshing and subtle (you can always tweak how much water you add to make it more or less robust too) and never taste artificial. What's especially great about Nuun is that it's in quick dissolving tablets so you don't have to pre-mix or measure anything. Just take a tube of tablets on a longer bike ride or run without hauling all the water or a big tub of mix -- just one bottle and a water source along the way is all you need to mix up multiple servings as your activity goes on.

review/summary: Best coffee replacement
review/text: If you have to, or just want to, give up coffee, this is the product that can take its place.  I loved my coffee, and I was very sad to have to give it up, but I don't feel like I'm missing it at all with Ayurvedic.  The moment I tasted it, I knew I wouldn't want to be without it.  I didn't even finish the sample before I ordered more.  I have been sharing this with anyone who is interested.<br /><br />I tried Pero, and I thought it tasted like sunflower seeds, plus it has MSG in it.  Ayurvedic is all organic and contains no MSG and tastes VERY much like coffee.  Customer Service is extremely friendly and helpful, and I look forward to being a long time customer.  [...]

review/text: Okay,okay.. I must admit, I was skeptical. After years of drinking coffee and than having to stop....oh my goodness, I thought I'd have a melt down. I tried several coffee alternatives and each time I was so disappointed, so much so that I gave up looking; knowing that I'd have to get use to drinking Pero, you feel my pain, right?<br />Last week I was introduced to Ayurvedic. I was BEYOND SHOCKED! Can I just tell you, it was like an answer to prayer. Seriously, this coffee alternative is so close to the "real" thing that if I were blindfolded, I don't know that I could tell the difference.<br />Thanks Ayurvedic for restoring my faith.

review/summary: Unbelievable - I do believe it would pass for coffee...
review/text: I had to give up coffee some years ago when I became caffeine sensitive.<br /><br />That was hard - I really loved my morning ritual of deciding what I was in the mood for, grinding the beans, boiling the water, running it through my old drip-cone straight into the cup.  Ahh, what I wouldn't give for a handful of half Illy and half New Mexico Pinon Roast, ground as fine as it will go, brewed strong, and sipped black.  Coffee drinkers will understand.<br /><br />I have since found any number of other things to drink, but still miss my coffee sometimes.  For a while, I tried decaf, but yuck.  I found a perfect decaf tea (PG Tips decaf is indistinguishable from the regular tea), and have come to enjoy a number of herbals and other brews, but have never a decent decaf coffee or coffee substitute.<br /><br />I found this stuff by accident online and bought a sample out of curiosity.  I liked that it was organic, and there's nothing in the ingredients that turned me off.  I really didn't expect it to be anything like coffee (they never are), but I thought it might be good in its own way.<br /><br />When the sample showed up, I ran a cup through my old drip-cone, and it was just ok.  A little watered down - I think I didn't use enough for the big mugful of water.  The funny thing though, was that it tasted like watered down coffee.  Just the way coffee used to taste when I didn't use enough for the amount of water.<br /><br />Second cup I used two big spoonfuls directly in the water and boiled it for 5 minutes.  After a minute or two, it started to smell like... well, coffee.  When poured, it had the same dark brown color and opaqueness I remember, and suddenly I was holding a cup of coffee.  I drank it black.  It was a passable cup - very satisfying - I actually stood there and gulped it down in the kitchen.<br /><br />It's smoother than I remember coffee being, less "bite" - probably because it doesn't have the same acids and oils that coffee does - but it does have a comparable taste and richness.  I never really liked flavored coffees, but the vanilla is very light - more a scent than a taste - and doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />In fact, if you'd handed me a cup of this when I could still drink coffee, I might have looked at it sideways and asked where you found such a smooth roast, but I wouldn't have questioned that it WAS coffee.<br /><br />That's pretty impressive - kudos to whoever developed this stuff.  Don't know how they did it, but I'll keep on drinking it.  I also look forward to giving it to some coffee drinking friends and waiting until after they drink it to mention that it isn't coffee =o)

review/text: I gave up coffee about six months ago and had been drinking various types of teas and herba matte since then. I stumbled across Ayurvedic Roast on line and decided to order a bag to see if I liked it. Like it? I love it! I really like coffee and don't mind tea but one thing I really missed with tea was the full body texture of a cup of coffee. Ayurvedic Roast comes very close in texture and I really enjoy the flavor. Just ordered myself a 4lb. bag so I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

Where Ayurvedic Roast is different, is that I really enjoy drinking it; it has a wonderful vanilla aroma, and a deep rich flavor.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, my mom, who very much _is_ a coffee drinker actually really likes it too, so I always make sure to keep a good amount in stock in case she comes by :)

review/text: I can't drink coffee anymore because I have a caffeine allergy, so I was hoping to find a product that had a similar taste to coffee that I could sip on throughout the day.<br /><br />I've tried a few similar products, but this is the best.  Does it taste like coffee?  Put it this way... if you walked outside your house and saw an elephant doing back flips while drinking Ayurvedic Roast, your focus would remain on the elephant instead of thinking "what is in my coffee cup?".<br /><br />I guess a more useful analogy is, it's like a veggie burger vs. a real burger.  You need to treat the two separate.  I like veggie burgers, but I don't order one if I feel like a hamburger.  Temper your expectations with this product and you'll really enjoy it.  I drink it with a little bit of milk and a splenda.  I'm looking forward to trying it iced.

review/summary: Good for you, but does not smell or taste like any coffee
review/text: I really wanted to like this stuff because I need to cut down on coffee consumption. I was very excited to receive this "coffee." The minute I opened the bag I noticed it smelled nothing like coffee at all. It was interesting to recall that one of the reviewers stated in a blindfolded taste test you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and real coffee. Hmmmmm. Anyway, I made it exactly like I make my regular coffee, and it tastes nothing like any coffee I have ever tasted anywhere (and I've had my share of desperation java in the past). I was very disappointed in the taste.<br /><br />The flavor is not really "bad," just totally different from that rich coffee aroma and taste. It looks like coffee, though. What I ended up doing is mixing it with regular coffee. This helped a lot, and it reduced my intake of cafffeine and acid. It tasted okay mixed with regular coffee, and that's what I will probably do in the future. Will I buy it again? Probably. If I feel okay and my symptoms improve I will try to stick with it. Like I said, it's not bad, just different. It is possible I will get used to the taste.<br /><br />I did a lot of research on the ingredients in this product. They can be good for your heart and help you feel calm. This could be a good thing. I just wanted to take the time and post about the taste and aroma.

review/summary: Not the best in my opinion.
review/text: This coffee alternative is not my favorite. It has a funny aftertaste like burnt bread. But if you are a black coffee addict and like the taste of old black joe, this is probably your best bet. I myself have never cared for the taste of unsweetened, uncreamed coffee anymore than I prefer unsweetened cocoa. To me, it's not good coffee unless it tastes sweet and creamy. I realize that this is not what most coffee hounds prefer, but I also know that a lot of us like cream and sugar in some degree. Another problem with this otherwise excellent blend of roasted grain and herbs, is that it soaks up a lot of water and tends to clog paper filters, not allowing all of the hot water to brew through to the cup. It swells up quite a bit more than coffee, and tends to overwhelm paper filters.<br /><br />One of the best alternatives to coffee, but not the best I've tried.

review/text: My Mother-in-law loves her morning coffee.  Because of medical conditions she could not have caffeine at all, which the products for non-caffeine on the market do contain caffeine.  We found Postum on line, which just did not do the trick and is very expensive.  We tried another substitute which was barely better.  When I ordered the substitute from Ayurvedic it was a big hit once I adjusted the amount.  She loves it and is now enjoying the start of her day with a good tasting coffee drink.  Thank you Ayurvedic!!! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for an excellent coffee taste with no caffeine.  Charlene Bedaw

review/text: I ordered this for my husband who is trying to quit coffee. I didn't like the taste of several of the other coffee replacemenents that I tried on Amazon.<br /><br />I wanted to see if he could tell the difference between this and his regular coffee.<br />I brewed a cup for him, and he remarked,"oh, is this some new brand of coffee?".  He really thought it was regular coffee!<br /><br />Someone here mentioned that it tastes like weak coffee, but I think they just need to adjust the amount when brewing. I used 1 tablespoon to one cup of water, and that proportion suited my husband well (he doesn't like his coffee too strong).<br /><br />Obviously this didn't taste 100% like coffee...after all, this is a coffee substitute, made from grains and herbs and not real coffee beans. However, I was satisfied and would recommend it to my friends who are trying to quit coffee.<br /><br />I brew this for myself with milk and sweetener, and I'm not claiming to be a coffee house gourmet, but it tasted just like a real latte to me!

It would not brew in the k-cup, I think its too dense when it gets wet.  So I then tried it in a regular coffee maker.  I followed the directions on the bag and the beverage came out weak.  It was undrinkable. So I tried the coffee maker again, but this time I added extra grounds and it still came out weak.  Last I tried my French Press and it worked pretty good. The taste is not bad, its similar to coffee, but it does have an aftertaste. Whats missing is the bitterness in coffee that I like. I actually prefer Teeccino over this.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: NOT  %100 organic.... Per the box, they are %70 organic.
review/text: The crackers are OK.  I am looking (note present tense) for a graham cracker that is organic, and these taste fair but the big ding comes from them not being %100 organic; the description did say %74, to be fair.  For $1.50, I can get the  14 ounce store brand box of graham crackers that use graham flour, and save some money if I'm not getting a truly organic product. YES, most of the ingredients are organic.... but one turd in a pool sends everyone running for the deck.  BUT, they are GMO-free- and that does help somewhat.<br /><br />The flavor.  Hmmm.  Well, they're OK.  I'll use up what I got. Maybe.  There is a mild cinnamon flavor that isn't awful, but not what I wanted. I like cinnamon, but I wanted more of a honey graham flavor. The texture isn't really 'crisp' either.  They're not soggy, but it wouldn't take much to make them soggy if they were used in something like a pudding dessert.  I won't reorder them.  For a natural product, there's a funny flavor and aftertaste.  Glad I got the Xylitol gum in this order to kill the aftertaste.

review/summary: MUCH better than dried herbs but not as good as fresh, of course
review/text: I purchased one variety of this product at a local gourmet grocery store (this review is for the Italian Herb mix.)  I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then.

review/text: The whole concept is flawed. Anything you freeze into a single container will quickly meld into a solid lump. That's exactly what happens with these frozen herb products - they form a hard, icy lump that you cannot dispense. There are much better products where the herbs are frozen into small cubes for easy dispensing. I have no idea why a company would try to sell something that is so obviously defective.

review/text: This product is very expensive for what you get. The herbs are stuck together in an icy clump which makes it difficult to dispense and then if you don't want the extra moisture/water in whatever you're making, you're out of luck.

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: The gum texture is too thick, and seems to stick to dental work.  The mint flavor is barely detectable, and the pieces of gum are too big (presumably because they are the same size as ordinary pieces of gum, which contain massive amounts of sugar).  It's a good idea, but at least this flavor is not very good.

review/summary: This is the only orzo I buy!
review/text: DaVinci brand orzo is different than any other brand I have ever seen.  Orzo is a tiny form of pasta, but most orzo looks like long-grained rice.  DaVinci's orzo is tear-shaped and much more pasta-like.  My favorite way to make it is with chicken broth, either cooked in broth on the stovetop to a risotto-like consistency or baked with sauteed chicken pieces, herbs, spices and broth in the oven.  In both preparations, the pasta soaks up the chicken broth and plumps up to become a mouth-wateringly creamy and comforting dish.  Baked chicken & orzo is one of my favorite comfort foods for colder weather.  In fact, I'm having it right now!  Yummmm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am not able to find DaVinci brand pasta where I live now.  I'm considering buying from Amazon but, since it is sold by an Amazon partner vs. Amazon, the shipping is as much as the pasta...as a result, I'm still undecided.

review/summary: NOT THE SAME PRODUCT AS THE PICTURE
review/text: I have always purchased this orzo from the store because it is the only kind that is like round flat discs and not over sized grains of rice. The picture displayed here shows the shape I am used to and I was excited that I was able to buy it from Amazon because I haven't seen it in stores lately. I ordered it in bulk with expedited shipping since I was going to use it for an event in two days. Well, when it came in, it is not the disc like shape that is displayed, it is the over sized rice shapes that I did not want. So, I have 24 bags of orzo that I don't want but have no choice but to use since the event is tomorrow. I called DaVinci and no one there could explain why this was different, I will not order any DaVinci products again. This is not a slight against Amazon, however they are displaying a picture that is inaccurate.

You'll really enjoy the flavor after it has simmered for about one hour, at very low temperature.

review/text: This is NOT the regular roast Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee that came along with your Keurig Coffee maker, but a much lighter roast. The picture is misleading and shows the k cup that matches the regular roast. The light roast has the word Noisette written under it. I ordered two boxes and received this lighter roast, I noticed the word light roast on the box as well. I complained and was told that they would send me the regular roast, but to my dismay they once again sent me the light roast. I find the light roast taste similar to run thru coffee and has a weak hazelnut flavor. I am very disappointed in this whole transaction and will order straight from the wholesaler next time. Sorry, Amazon I really love shopping with you, but ya'll drop the ball on this one.

review/summary: Decent, not as good as Green Mountain Coffee Brew Over Ice Hazelnut
review/text: I purchased this due to originally trying Green Mountain Coffee Brew over Ice hazelnut and loved it. I thought they used the same coffee and just slapped a Brew Over Ice logo on the product but they do not. The Brew Over Ice variety offers a better hazelnut aroma and tastes a bit more like hazelnut all around. While this Hazelnut K-cup isn't bad, it's not the best, it's definitely not the worst. I typically do not drink flavored coffee (Unless it's at Starbucks) but I was expecting a lot more hazelnut than this has offered. If you're looking for a good coffee with a hint of hazelnut flavor, this is great. If you want to be hit with hazelnut flavoring try something else or buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RM">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: I like Green Mountain coffee and have for quite some time. These K-Cup packs seem to lack the punch of freshly brewed Green Mountain in can get at your local neighborhood convenience store. This particular blend I found rather lackluster and just plain weak. Still, it was good in a pinch.

review/text: It was a little weak for my taste however I do like the flavor of it. If you want a light flavored coffee this is a nicely flavored coffee. If you have more of a taste for a medium strength coffee as I do this might not be for you. I personally won't buy this one again but I can't recommend against it as it may be perfect for some people.

review/text: ROLAND FANCY RED SOCKEYE SALMON, 14.75 ounces,lists two ingriedients on its package: Red Salmon, and Salt.  Missing from the ingredient list, is "water". It must be water that is the unlisted ingredient --what else would packers put into a tin of salmon that is liquid in nature?  At any rate, before I opened my first can, I shook it -- and heard much liquid inside.  When I opened it, I pressed the top inside, whilst letting water run, and squeezed the top down tight on the salmon.  This practice takes out much of the salt of any canned fish.  When I had finished doing this, I measured the empty space.  It was approximately 1 1/4 inches!  This, from a 4 1/4" long can!  So much water had filled the can!  And yet, "water" is not listed amongst the ingredients!<br /><br />The fish inside was happily, (mostly), devoid of skin and bones.  Of course, SOME skin and bones remained in the fish -- but somewhat less of these than I have found in other salmons of the same type and size can.<br /><br />The "red salmon" inside was slightly less intense in colour than I have seen in other red salmon.  Perhaps this is because this is NOT "Wild Caught" salmon.  Nowhere on the tin does it say "wild caught", so this must be farm-raised salmon.  Which is fine for those who wish to save a little money and buy farm-raised salmon.<br />I guess.........<br /><br />This salmon has the "OU" of the Jewish Orthodox Union, the highest mark of kosher quality in the USA.  It also has a nice long expiration date.  The tin I am looking at expires in Sept., 2014.<br />The flavour is pleasant --but not as intense as some sockeye salmon I have had.<br /><br />My advice is to shake ANY can, (of just about any food), before it is bought, to adjudge how much water is inside.  This product, though not listing the amount of water present, (or even listing water as an ingredient, AT ALL), certainly had a lot!

Accidentally, I found this in Amazon and since then meal time with my baby is fun. She enjoys this flavour very much and this is definitely better and nutritious than Gerber or Earth's best brands. I dont understand why Nestle has not entered this market in the USA, eventhough they market breast milk supplements like good start. My daughter would never eat the gerber brand cereals before and would be very fuzzy throughout the meal time. Cerelac is definitely a life saver.

review/text: Wow.  I was really excited to try these; unfortunately, after struggling through about six bites, I had to throw it away.  Immediately out of the microwave, the bowl reeked of melted plastic.  At first, I thought I had melted the bowl, but after inspecting it and attempting several bites, I discovered it was the scent of the noodles and broth.  The noodles were super fine, which I like; however, I couldn't get past the super slimey feel.  They almost seemed like they had a glue-like consistency.  I only cooked for two of the recommended 2-3 minutes.  I don't know if you get different results with the boil and pour method, but I disliked them so much I'm not willing to give that a try.
