review/summary: Pretty solid decaf for a Keurig coffee maker
review/text: Drat! I have just been ordered to reduce my intake of caffeine. So much for my K-cup (with caffeine) to start the day followed by a 20 ounce (with caffeine) coffee at work. What to do? My approach? Move to decaf.<br /><br />My first experiment with a K-cup decaffeinated coffee is Newman's Own Organic Special Decaf.<br /><br />I'm not really excited about decaf, but orders are orders! So, trying this has been a rather pleasant surprise. I would have wished for a bolder more distinct taste, but the taste is pretty smooth and the coffee is pretty good. If I have to drink decaf, in short, this will do nicely.

review/summary: Dangerously delicious
review/text: I always liked coffee before, but never drank it daily.  Now I drink up to three cups a day.  Love this stuff.  And it's just too easy to brew.  An added benefit is that when I have a cup of coffee in my hand, it's easier to stay on a diet.  Instead of reaching for something to eat, I sip this coffee.  There's always a fresh cup that is delicious and satisfying.  (Not being a coffee connoisseur, I did not appreciate the subtleties that subconsciously had been turning me away from coffee in the past -- a cup that is less than fresh might not taste "bad" but it does not call out to me and say: "Drink me!")  This coffee is so easy and so good, I fear I am becoming addicted.  Organic K-cups are not easy to find.  I haven't found them yet in supermarkets.  The Newman brand is the roundest and tastiest of any I have tried, and the decaf is great.

review/text: I have always considered Newman's Own products to be quite good, so I was excited to try out this coffee.  I was dissapointed from the first sip.

Serve salsa on top, perfect mix of sweet and sour.

It said this: Salmon Magic(tm), Chef Paul's newest creation, is a unique blend of carefully selected herbs and spices with subtle accents of dry mustard seeds.<br /> After I received it the first ingredient listed was Sugar. My problem is that I don't like sweet tasting food unless it's a dessert. I tried to like it but I could hardly get through dinner. If you like your food on the slightly sweet side it will probably be fine for you.<br /><br />P.S. I really like his Seafood and Blackened Redfish Magic.

"Certified Organic"  must contain an actual label from the agency itself.  The purchased product contained no such label and instead had a description as "Certified Organic".  As much as I would like to believe that this was an oversight, Im afraid from my direct experience with the owner/seller that he was simply preying on the grey area of "Certified Organic". QAI has been informed of this misuse and false advertisement and is taking action.  If you are curious about this product, call the agencies before you decide to buy from this seller.

review/text: I got these as a gift for my grandma. I really wish there was a warning when ordering these about the gastrointestinal distress that ensues after consumption (seemingly more so than in comparison to other sugar-free products). There was no warning on the bag either!! She has spent the past two days in the bathroom (sorry, over-share) and is really mad at me. She did say they were tasty though.

review/summary: Can't Beat It!
review/text: I'm on a very strict diet and am trying to lose about 30 pounds over a two-month period. So far, I'm down 14 and it hasn't been a month yet. I don't particularly like going hungry so I eat a lot but the stuff I eat is very low in calories (and high in fiber, I might add). It's about 90 % vegetarian except for a few sources of animal protein including Egg Beaters and Non-Fat Milk. Low calorie veggies are fairly east to find, the trick is to make them interesting. As such, I pick up a variety of pickled items. One is a large jar (32 ounces) of Frank's Quality Kraut. The smaller container shown here is exactly the same product, just a different container size. It's an excellent kraut. Fine tasting. Goes well with my other veggies and with my soy protein products. Plus, it's only five calories per serving. Can't beat it!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Nice taste, texture of canned tuna
review/text: This product would be excellent tossed with noodles and/or salad, or baked in casserole.  So far I've used it in salmon tacos and also added it to artichoke dip on crackers.  Both times the dish was excellent.  It would also be good with scrambled eggs... anything in which you would want and pre-flaked consistency to your salmon.  Not too salty, not too oily, feels very nourishing, yum.<br /><br />I point out the consistency because I was hoping this would be more of a trail-side snack/ finger-food kind of thing based on the tags reviewers had given it.  It is not jerky.  It definitely needs to be eaten with a utensil.  If you had no utensil, you could eat it with chips/crackers if you had a bowl in which to dip it, or a tortilla and you can pour it onto the tortilla. It's very good on both.  But I would only eat it with my fingers if I was starving and desperate, because it is not finger-food consistency.  So you know, prepare to have a vector for this food.  Lolz.  Maybe not good for day hikes, but great for camp sites.  Also great in the pantry for surprise guests.<br /><br />P.S. _ I have only opened one pack out of the four packs so far, but if that is representative - not one single bone or any kind of skin/gristle or foreign object was found and you can see pieces of salmon fat which are so good and healthy for you to have in the unadulterated state...  Not too much to where it is overwhelming, just enough like the good cuts of meat kind of thing.  It feels/tastes/looks like a good value for the convenient nourishment it offers and I was happy to serve it and eat it.

review/summary: Good coffee, but 26.3 ounces, not 32.
review/text: This coffee was very good, being at least the equal of the best of the 7 different coffees I have tried thus far here from Amazon.  It was very fresh, had excellent aroma, and produced a very nice brew in my French press.  Upon receipt of the coffee I noticed that the bag was nowhere near full.  I have had other coffees come in less-than-full bags, but this one seemed to be way off. Since I sell merchandise online myself, I have an accurate postal scale.  The "2 pound" bag came in at almost 6 ounces less than a full 32, including the weight of the bag.  From previous orders from Amazon, other coffees seem to be based on the "as delivered" weight, not on some sort of weight prior to roasting.  The bag itself did not have a breather, so it is hard to imagine that almost 20% of the weight was lost in shipping. Don't know what happened here but the result is that I feel I payed almost 20% more for the beans than the advertised price.  I am curious if others have noticed this from this company. I would like to think that I simply got a careless shipment and not a care-less policy.

review/text: Really an outstanding coffee. Consistently good flavor from bag to bag. We have been enjoying this for over a year and have not been disappointed with the Sumatran Dark. The roast is optimal -- luscious and aromatic, like espresso, not over-roasted and burnt. Love the fact that it is organic and fair-trade also. The value is excellent, especially with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />I can't say the same of other varieties of Altura that I've tried; I've only been really pleased with the Sumatran, not others. Also, this coffee blows away competing (and much more expensive) offerings from Jeremiah's and Appassionato which lacked freshness and full flavor.<br /><br />Truly a quality buy! Full 5 Stars - Highly recommend!

review/text: I love coffee, i have tried so many in the past and happened upon the cafe altura. Now, every other coffee out there is just so-so. I occasionally give another recommended brand a chance but it never comes close to this one.<br />When you open the bag the quality is clear: The smell is intoxicating - not fake like flavored coffees and not 'burnt' like starbucks, but rich full COFFEE flavor. Also, the beans are visually oily, not wet or nasty as i have heard of some coffees in the past but just shiny with the oil (where all the flavor is)<br />Because of the quality of this coffee i use less, the taste will tempt you to take it black, and its organic from an ecologically-minded farmer....sweet!

review/summary: Excellent Coffee, but make sure you can store it!!
review/text: Before I begin let me just explain where I am coming from. Though I am by no means a coffee expert I have become a little more sophisticated just in the regard that I own a french press as well as a chemex cofffee maker and grind my own beans as well. Though I like some of the standard coffees out there (especially Peets), I am trying to broaden my horizons and try new coffees. I decided to give this brand a try just because I saw it was a top coffee seller on amazon and had received mostly postive reviews.<br /><br />When I received the bag I opened it up and it smelled wonderful. as many coffee drinkers know,opening and smelling a new bag of coffee beans is almost as good as drinking the coffee itself. As for the coffee though, it was superb. I think the best way I can describe it is to say not too strong, but not too weak so it's perfect for someone looking for the best of both worlds. also, it is not as acidic as other coffees (which I understand is a common chracteristic of Sumatran coffee in general) so that was a positive for someone like me who loves coffee, but is always popping antacids.<br /><br />There are a few things to keep in mind though. This is a huge bag! It's like 3 standard supermarket bags in one. so if you drink a ton of coffee a day or have a big family of coffee drinkers, that might not be a problem. However, for someone like me who is single and drinks one or two cups a day, it prevents a bit of a challenge. The instructions tell you to put the bag in a ziplock bag and refrigerate for prolonged storage, which is what I did. Two weeks later the coffee still tastes good, but not as fresh as when I first bought it and there is still over half the bag left! If anyone out there has any suggestions on how I should store this coffee other than refrigeration, please shoot me an email.<br /><br />But other then that the coffee is great. Just make sure you realize you are going to get a lot of it unless there is a smaller bag for sale on amazon, which I do not think there is.

review/summary: Great coffee at a great price
review/text: This is one of the best coffees I've ever tried at home, and better than most that I can find out and about. When I first opened the bag and put a few ounces in my grinder, the kitchen was filled by by the savory, smoky fragrance of this exceptional coffee. The roast is dark, but not too dark. The coffee doesn't taste burned or bitter and it doesn't smell "skunky" when it's brewing the way Starbucks roasts do. It's smooth up front without any acidic sharpness, and the finish is, well it's fantastic. I can't describe all the flavors in the finish (nutty, smoky?), but after each sip things just keep getting better and better.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is not a small bag of coffee. Typical bags are in the 8-10 ounce range. This one is 32 ounces. I filled the hopper of my grinder, and put the rest of the coffee in a big zipper bag stored in a dark cupboard. The coffee kept that way for a couple of weeks with no noticeable loss of flavor. You can do the arithmetic to see how inexpensive this coffee is compared to other whole bean coffees, but by my reckoning it's about 2/3 the price for a vastly superior product.<br /><br />This was my first taste of Cafe Altura coffee, and I'm thoroughly sold on it. I had to go digging through my email to find the right brand for a re-order, but it was worth it. I've tried two Cafe Altura coffees thus far, Sumatran Dark and Peruvian Dark, and both were delicious. I'm re-ordering the Sumatran Dark and another Cafe Altura coffee I've not tried (haven't decided which). I expect to try them all by the end of the year.

Probably not a good thing, but not all bad either, and a testament to the coffee.  A fresh pot for guests always elicits "..what kind of coffee is this?

review/text: I ordered this coffee the first time about a year ago, and it was amongst the best beans that ever passed through my Jura espresso maker. At the time the packaging also looked like the one shown on this picture (black).<br /><br />However, I since reordered twice, and in both cases the coffee has a horrible, burned aftertaste, probably from getting burned in the roasting process. This coincided with a change in the packaging style (which is now green). As a matter of fact, I am having a cup of it as I write this, and I can't wait for the beans to be finished so I can put something else into my machine again.<br /><br />NOT recommended as it is now! If you ask me, go with the "Biodynamic" (whatever that means...) French Roast instead, I just had that and is was GREAT!

review/text: This is my second try into Cafe Altura coffee and I must say I am again impressed.  I have tried the Peruvian, which is very good.  However, the Sumatran is just a bit better.  Is stronger than Peruvian and has a very complex taste that makes a cup of coffee something to appreciate for more than just Splenda and creamer.  This coffee is not for the faint of heart.  If you have acid indigestion issues, I would not recommend this.  This is definitely something that could cause some acid reflux.  For those without that problem, the strength makes this coffee that much better!

review/text: I like my coffee really strong, and with this coffee I can go from unleaded to jet fuel mode depending on how I feel. A lot of coffee can get very bitter and can even give you an upset stomach if you grind the beans too fine. Not this stuff.<br /><br />With the average price of coffee going insanely higher, I think that given the quality and quantity, you get more than you pay for with this.  I have had every kind of Starbucks coffee, and none even come close to this ..oh... and this is ORGANIC TOO! Why buy overpriced, average coffee, when you can get something like this?

review/summary: By far the best for the price
review/text: I was looking for a dark roast, organic, fair trade Sumatran. I was pleasantly surprised to find something so specific. We had tried brands from Trader Joes, Sprouts, and a couple of online vendors but we found nothing this consistently good and for such an excellent price. We go through about 6 pounds a month, so it was important to us to find a good price. It is full-bodied and complex and is the first coffee I've ever been able to drink black due to its smooth, rich flavor. We buy it through the subscribe & save program, so it comes right on time just as we are finishing up the last of the previous purchase, and we receive a 15% discount on its already excellent price. Especially since we are living rural now, we don't have to make a frantic run to the store or buy something of less quality until we have time to make it to the city.

review/summary: Not your typical cup of coffee
review/text: Forget what you hear about the military running on it's stomach, it's coffee. Back then my only experience had been with the standard production line coffees until I was deployed in Europe. I got spoiled to say the least. Over the years I've developed a taste for the Indonesian coffees. The deep rich earthy undertones have always caught my taste and as a result become one of my favorites. If you like a deep rich full bodied cup of coffee then Cafe Altura Sumatran Dark Roast is an outstanding choice. Rich,smooth,full bodied all describe this coffee. If this is indicative off the other coffees in this line then I've found something special. Try this, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Surprisingly good coffee for the money
review/text: I have been a Starbucks fan (of sumatra coffee)for the past several months, but it isn't cheap.  I opted to try this coffee as the price was right, and it was organic.  I was  pleasantly surprised at how good this coffee is.  I think I actually like it better than Starbucks (I know, heresy for true Starbuck fans) as it is a little more mellow in flavor but yet still full (a paradox?).  For those of you who look at color and quality of beans, these are a beautiful dark brown, large, clean, and shiny (but that doesn't mean diddly in taste).  Hey, want to try something new?  Try this, I don't think you will be disappointed. One minor thing is it does come in a rather large quantity (32 ounces)which means you have an opened package for a while (assuming you grind your beans as necessary) but you can put it in an air sealed container or bag (the company recommends that and then refrigerate, but I have read a bunch on that best way to keep coffee and theories abound--some say freeze it--to me the verdict is still out as to what way you go).  Just keep in mind, if you only use a little bit each day, the coffee will go stale after a while, I don't care what method you use to extend freshness, but that's only my opinion.  I am following their advice and keeping it around refrigerator temp in a sealed container.

review/text: If you want organic coffee, this is probably one of the cheapest you'll find.  However, in this case you get what you pay for.  The coffee was fresh and oily, and has an ok, but not great flavor.  BUT the beans had a strong urine smell that was off-putting.  The coffee did not smell like urine once brewed, but the smell of the unground beans was truly awful.

review/summary: Coffee Novice - New to Grind & Brew
review/text: I just purchased a new Capresso Grind & Brew machine and this coffee was my first choice based on the reviews and reasonable price.<br />I'm very impressed by the freshness and SMELL of these beans.  Heavenly!<br /><br />The end result is also very good...although for me lacks just a bit of complexity.  It is rich and smooth, but somewhat mellow in personality.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...I'm going to enjoy every cup of these beans as my Capresso gently grinds the beans just before brewing.  I have the machine set to grind at largest/coarsest setting.  It is a conical burr grinder...so it is not burning the beans as it grinds.  I don't think I could improve the process used to experience this coffee.<br /><br />Would definitely re-order...but will also try other styles from Cafe Altura to inject some variety.

review/text: I love a bold, strong coffee.  Some dark coffees are too bitter to enjoy, but this one has a nice balance of bold and smooth.  My husband and I prefer drinking 1/2 decaf in our morning coffee, so we blend this bean with Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Mocha Java Decaf Whole Bean Coffee (also purchased here on Amazon).  Together, they make an excellent robust morning coffee.<br /><br />Five stars for this relatively inexpensive bean!

If you enjoy the rich and complex dark roasted bean buy this and you will be in love.

review/text: I bought this based on other reviews. Wow, I'm disappointed. Maybe, (let's give them the benefit of the doubt), I got a bad batch. I knew something was up when I opened the bag and smelled how skunky it was. Thought, hmm, that doesn't smell much like coffee. Not fresh roasted anyhow. Brewing in my Bialetti was a big disappointment. Tasted like it smelled, old socks. Weird aftertastes. I drink my coffee black so it is of course less forgiving. Perhaps one can get by with crutches to mask the flavor but it shouldn't be necessary. I'm going to cut this with espresso beans to mask the flavor somewhat and try not to feel to bad about my wasted purchase. Will not buy any of their products again.
