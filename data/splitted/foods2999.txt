review/summary: The BEST candy EVER!!!
review/text: I've tried the rest, but this is the BEST!<br /><br />I've been eating See's candies since I was just a kid!  Easter was one of my favorite holidays, because my mom would order See's large easter eggs, we would get to pick our favorite filling, Chocolate or Chocolate Walnut, then we'd get a medium chocolate egg, I would always choose the Bordeaux (by far the best flavored candy See's sells), you could get the divinity if you liked that.  The buttercream is always a huge favorite at our house.  You have your choice of Dark or Milk chocolate. Choose your own liking!  I prefer Milk chocolate.  Another of my favorites is California Brittle.  Also, the Vanilla Nut Carmel (no chocolate on this one), but very tasty!<br /><br />Just remember the Assorted premade box doesn't always have the best picks in it.  If you like nuts and chews, that's one of the better choices.  I prefer to go down to See's and select my own mix!  Pecan turtles--just melt in your mouth.  Try the truffles if you like!<br /><br />Never did like Godiva or Fanny Farmer, once in awhile I could take a piece of Helen Grace or Lindt, but they never live up to my standards.<br />See's is the perfect candy and it makes the perfect gift for family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, service company's and the postal person.  Don't cross anyone off your list until you surprise them with a gift of See's candy for the Holidays.

review/text: We ordered the box of candy for an anniversary gift along with a separate order of flowers.  The flowers arrived in a timely fashion but the candy arrived 6 days later.  When they arrived they were completely melted and had reformed in the box.  The recipient called to say what had happened.  A replacement box was sent a week later.  We don't know who to blame for the delay in shipping or for the manner in which it was shipped.

review/text: I just received my honey from this seller!  Fast shipping and the best price I could find for Active Manuka honey including shipping!  I hope that it works for what I am using it for (to kill H Pylori, for gastritis, esophagitis, and duodenitis), but I am very pleased with the taste, the shipping, and the packaging.  Thanks so much!  So even if it doesn't work on my H Pylori I will enjoy this honey! Based on the research it should work combined with the Mastic Gum I will also be taking.  Thank you Stakich for making this a little more affordable for us!

I purchased mine through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for $8.73 per order *I got 2* 'cause it was such a good price! These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!

review/text: I add 1/2 cup of the original Fiber One cereal to the 1 cup serving of the Fiber One Honey Clusters. I also add some dried cranberries (Craisins).  The taste is excellent and packs a full day of fiber.  Fiber One Honey Clusters has 13 grams of fiber and 160 calories. Fiber One Original contains 14 grams of fiber and just 60 calories. So for 220 calories in cereal, plus 110 calories in 1 cup skim milk and 25 calories for the 1 T. craisins you get 355 total calories and 28 grams fiber in one bowl!  Sure beats donuts and coffee and you're not hungry till lunch!

review/summary: It's okay.
review/text: This Nishiki rice is pretty much the standard American medium grain rice that's not so bad when it's first cooked.  It's until you eat premium quality rice like tamanishiki and koshihikari that you'll know Nishki is a sub-par rice sold anywhere else.<br /><br />If you want QUALITY sushi it starts with the rice.  Nishiki is not something I would personally use.  You'll know the difference right away with the texture.<br /><br />But of course, preparation can make a huge difference.  Wash your rice and let the rice sit in the bowl for 20 minutes to soak.  Re-rinse and measure the water again and turn on the rice cooker (or the pot if you're cooking manually).  If you don't have a rice cooker though I would get one.  It's worth it and very cheap for a simple rice cooker.  Feel free to read my review on tamanishiki rice.

I used to have to drive across town to an Asian market where the price was far too high and the employees were far too rude. Then I had to haul 15 pounds up to my apartment along with my two year old and whatever other groceries I had. Now I can just order from Amazon, save money, free shipping, and hey, someone else is paid to haul it up the stairs for me! It's great!

review/text: I ordered these in the winter and they were ok.  But the last two orders which were in Spring and now in June came and were completely in a mangled mess of melted chocolate and broken pretzels.  Not at all appetizing, in fact disgusting.  After contacting the company and letting them know the problem they simply gave us a credit of $13 for our trouble.  That's laughable since the whole box is ruined and these pretzels are not cheap.  I order chocolate through the mail all the time from See's in California and have never had a problem with the chocolate melting to this degree.  Its a problem that you need to fix before I will ever be back.

review/summary: So good!
review/text: The non-chocolate-covered glutino pretzels didn't do much for me, but these are SO good. They're pricey, but meet a craving--and I thought I'd never get good chocolate covered pretzels again. These taste exactly the way I remember their glutinous cousins tasting, but admittedly it has been a few years. The texture is also what I remember.<br /><br />The price listed on amazon today matches what I can get locally, give or take 20%, but I don't have to buy I bulk locally.  They keep well when the bag has been opened-at least half a week without going stale. After that, there are simply none left to try.

review/summary: Best peanut butter substitute there is.
review/text: I used to get this same soy butter under the Great Value label at Walmart. However, Walmart seems to think that it is a regional product or something (since when are peanut allergies regional?), and doesn't carry it in any of their stores within a 100 miles of me. At first I had my local Walmart order it for me, but the last time I did so it was such a long, drawn out, frustrating experience I gave up on them. Guess they don't really want my business. Hurray for Amazon for making it available!! This same product is also carried under another label by Amazon as well: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026BQKT6">"Tastes Just like Peanut Butter" SchoolSafe Omega 3 SoyButter(NOT SoyNUT Butter) Kids Love It--6 jars/case Economy Size 17.6 oz. $4.49 ea.--100% Nut Free , Peanut Free --2 year shelf life</a>

review/summary: Good, flavorful peanut butter alternative.
review/text: As others have mentioned, this soy butter tastes really good, and has a flavor that is similar to peanut butter. While I like the I. M. Healthy chunky soy butter and chocolate soy butter a little more, this is my favorite creamy soy butter, and the one I usually buy, because it makes a very believable almost-PB&J sandwich.<br /><br />I'm now very sure that CGB Soybutter is relabeled by Wally World and sold under their Great Value name. I bought them both and compared them side by side. Same size and shape packages, same ingredients and nutrition information, both made in Canada, and most importantly, identical taste and texture. The only differences are that the GGB butter has a blue lid and Wally's has an orange lid, plus the labels are of course different.<br /><br />At the Walbert near me, the Great Value version sells for $2.97 a jar, an astonishing $2 cheaper than the I. M. Healthy goes for at the local discount grocery store. It is also lower cost per jar than this CGB 6 pack (@ $3.69 per jar), even with free shipping. However, I'd guess that for some people, not supporting Wally World is well worth the 72 cents. Plus this version comes right to your door.

review/text: I bought my product, which was 6 jars of soy butter in May.  When it arrived I discovered that it expired in January, giving me 7-8 months to eat 6 jars of it.  I loved the flavor of the product, it is quite better than any of the peanut butter alternatives that we can purchase at the grocery store. Next time I need this product I think I will find another mom with a peanut allergic kid and split the case so I don't have to eat so much in such a short time.<br /><br />I'd give the flavor 5 stars.

We have looked everywhere, but not found one that tastes as good (her words) as this one.  Thanks to A. Arickx and her review I was able to order this great product.  Consistency is that of peanut butter, but no allergic reactions. If you are looking for a good tasting substitute for peanut butter, try this one.<br /><br />Even though I do not like any of the peanut butter substitutes, I will admit I could eat this one if I had to do so.

We went a number of years with no peanut butter, but as our kids got older we decided to start trying peanut butter substitutes. Nothing was even close, until we found this product, which I believe is the same they used to sell in Walmart under a different label. This is excellent and almost exactly the same as peanut butter. It is not cheap (it was a lot cheaper at Walmart), but it is well worth the price. All my kids love it, as do I. Purchase and delivery was easy also.

review/text: I ordered two boxes of these bones for my commercial kennel.  I chose the Sportmix products because I was assured by their customer service rep (who responded to my inquiry within the hour) that the ingredients and manufacturing are US-based.  I do not purchase foreign pet food ingredients - particularly China-made pet products.  I am thoroughly happy with the apparent palatability of the bones.  The dogs fall over each other to get one.  I am a little dissatisfied with the condition of many of the bones - about 20% of them are broken due to packaging.  They are not stacked - just loosely placed in the box to be knocked around during delivery.  This is the only thing I can fault, though.  Otherwise, a fair priced, quality, USA MADE product.

review/summary: One of the Best Bars I've Had in Years!
review/text: One rule I always try to follow is to never go to the grocery store when I'm hungry. Well, I missed on this one tonight. All was well as I visited my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market until I passed the baking chocolates. There sat a tray of Cadbury Crunchie bars. I couldn't help myself. The label said it was made in St. Bournville, Birmingham UK. It was 190 calories, but I'd been good all day. Into the cart a bar went, and I opened it first thing when I got home. Man, was this thing good! The outer chocolate cover was excellent but the best part was a crunchy caramel-like interior. I can't describe it. It tasted a bit like the inside of a Heath Bar, but it was better. It was part solid and part like a really stiff and crunchy foam. Did I mention that it was delicious? Mmmmm! One of the best bars I've had in years. To be honest, I don't consume many candy bars, but this one was certainly excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: When I was a kid I used to love Violet Crumble candy bars.  They are difficult to find and very expensive.  I found these in my suggested items and gave them a try.  This is a great replacement.  The chocolate is lovely.  The honeycomb center is perfectly crunchy without being hard.  What a treat.

review/summary: AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
review/text: I got this candy bar because it seemed to be similar to the violet crumble which my family used to get and were obsessed with. I just wasn't willing to pay $6 a bar!<br /><br />I'd say this bar is great and inexpensive, a good alternative to the crumble.<br /><br />But what really stood out was the customer service! I can't say enough good things about this company, I've never been so impressed. There was an issue with the post office, and it seemed the post office was sending it back to NY! Jof not only gave me his cell phone number to try and see what we could do but sent a new package the next day (2-day air so it could be here by Christmas). Jof saved the day and went well above and beyond!

review/summary: Delicious Combination
review/text: First can I say that the seller of these candy bars is very thoughtful and they included and ice pack so the chocolates didn't melt in shipping. I grew up eating these candy bars in Africa so was delighted when I found them here at amazon. The honeycomb center is crunchy and melts in your mouth along with the milk chocolate coating. The only problem with these candy bars is they don't last long. They are that good and once others in your family find out about them they will disappear even more quickly. Maybe order 12!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious.
review/text: Someone bought these for me by mistake. The first time I tried a bar, I thought it was a little too sweet. But by the second bar, I was hooked. There's only a little bit of chocolate on the outside, so you can hardly call this a chocolate bar. The magic is all in the honeycomb candy middle. It goes crunch, then it melts in your mouth like honey-butter. You really have to try it for yourself to understand how delicious it is.

review/text: These are my second favorite candy bars.  I like Violet Crumble a little better, as they are a little smoother.  However, being that both are hard to find, I'm happy to take either of them.  If you're having problems finding them in the states, check your mall candy store.  Some of the chains carry them, and others can order them for you.  It would be nice if you could pick them up anywhere, but this way it makes for an extra special treat.  They are more expensive than regular candy bars.  The prices here are a little cheaper than I've paid in the past, but you also have to figure in s&h.

review/summary: tastes bad, tastes stale, obsolete inventory?
review/text: 1) these candy bars were apparently made for overseas distribution but never got there.  I ordered from a company in Mass. figuring that all the reviews talking about candy with asian/indian language on the wrapper might be avoided but it was not.  Seems you will get these "overseas" bars wherever you get them from.<br /><br />2) I wanted the VIOLET CRUMBLE but it is not available in the US anymore.  Some reviewed these and said these bars were close to if not better than the VC.  I disagree greatly.  Although they are both a form of "sponge" candy with a chocolate covering, this bar does not come close to the VIOLET CRUBMLE.  The "sponge" center only makes me think the word STALE, and the chocolate has something wrong with it.  Not even close to the quality of the chocolate used on the VC.  Indeed after just a small sampling from the first bar, I was so disappointed I tossed them all in the garbage.<br /><br />Too bad.  Guess I'll keep on looking for the VC.  Hail Flavius!

review/summary: From Pakistan, not England
review/text: Imagine ordering chocolate that is supposed to be from England and receiving chocolate wrapped in paper with Pakistani language(Urdu)all over it. Yes, it contained English translation but I didn't order candy from Pakistan. I ordered candy from England thru Trade Concepts. The candy is rather stale and old and tasted like cheap milk chocolate. If this indeed comes from England, why do the wrappers indicate they are from Pakistan?<br />I also ordered the "Flake" These too are from Pakistan. The center is not flaky or crunchy or crumbly but rather stale and old.<br /> Because of the Urdo language all over the wrappers, I can only assume that perhaps Trade Concepts imports from England, removes the wrapper and then rewraps them in their own wrappers? I'm sure the FDA would be interested in this practice.<br />This review refers to the seller Trade Concepts

review/summary: Does not taste like the Lipton Yellow Label Tea I've had + no expiration date on package
review/text: I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT "foil-wrapped for freshness" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  There is another listing for Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon at an even higher cost, but it is also sold by the Indian grocery, so I don't know why they have 2 listings at different prices if the tea is exactly the same.  I am very bummed.

review/summary: Tangy-rich citrus flavor!
review/text: This is one of the more sucessful of Celestial Seasonings Zinger genre. In this case the flavor of rose hips and hibiscus does not overpower the other flavors (unless you brew longer than 4 minutes). The aroma of this ruby potion is deliciously citrus and full bodied. The flavor of the tea is sweet red grapefruit and orange. Very tasty! I imagine this would make an excellent ice tea. Also, it is caffeine free and has added vitamin C--45 mg.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Be in readiness for favorable winds." Chinese Proverb.

review/text: I love spooning this on top of ice cream. I always loved the inside of the Whopper candy specifically because of the sweet and grainy malt bit, which you can in essence recreate by topping ice cream with this stuff and mixing it in. It works with just about any flavor ice cream you would want as well. As your ice cream melts, you get yourself an ice cream shake (you can add some milk to thin it out). I probably put way more than I really need to on top of my own servings, but with 4 packs to use up, I can afford to indulge a bit.

review/summary: This stuff is addictive...
review/text: I have occasionally joked that this is drinkable heroin. When a really good "malted" is served to me, my eyes tend to cross as my lips embrace the straw and I will sometimes not stop sucking on the straw until that awful slurp at  the bottom sounds off indicating my fix is ended. I have used Horlicks in the past and it's quite good, but I still consider Carnation as the real thing. I've had some "no-name" syrups and I believe another brand used to be available in the US, but they were useless.<br /><br />I do think there's something genetic about my love of malt (just as I despise okra or green peppers). With this apparent withdrawal of Carnations from the supermarket shelves, it's obvious that the malted thing needs to be revitalized. Young versions of "ME" who have this genetic preference are waiting for this ultimate "comfort food" be a popular item once again.

review/text: I'd been looking for malted milk powder and bought some Ovaltine, which is good but has a lot of other flavors with the malt, and then I tried Horlicks from England, which is very malty and nice but contains "vegetable oil," though the site says it's no longer hydrogenated, and then I found the Carnation Malted Milk here. Well, let me tell you, that opening the first jar sent me back to about age six. Of all my childhood memories of sweets, a malted is one of my favorites, and this stuff is exactly what the doctor ordered. I mean it's perfect. How many things can you say that about? And the ingredient list is short. No polysyllabic NASA chemicals, AND NO HYDROGENATED FATS OR TRANSFATS! I feel like writing a letter to Nestles and begging them to keep making this exactly as it is. I can't say enough about how much I love it.
