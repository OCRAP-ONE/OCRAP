review/text: I brewed this coffee in a 24 oz double walled tumbler that I filled three quarters of the way with ice.  I then added cream and sugar to taste and enjoyed a very good cup of iced coffee (better that Dunkin Donuts, IMHO).<br />I am assuming that there must be double the grounds in the k cup because the flavor is not diluted.  Definitely worth a try!

review/text: Before I am judged too harshly let me say that what I mean by "for any of the women in your life" is that we all have women that know who really deserve to be thanked for all that they do for us.  Wife or girlfriend (not both!); mother; grown daughter; co-worker;  assistant; your child's teacher; etc.  And what can say "Thank you" better than a gift basket of wonderful, decadent, delicious chocolates?<br /><br />I sent this to a customer of mine.  She is the head of her company's training department and I wanted to send her something special on her birthday to let her know how much I appreciate the work that she does in helping my company to train and teach their employees.  I knew that she was a dark chocolate fan and this basket has quite a bit of high-quality dark treats.  She called me the day that she received it and she couldn't thank me enough!  She was blow away by the variety and quality of the chocolates.  I will certainly be buying more in the future.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored "cake".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.

review/text: I bought these for a cute celebration of St. Patrick's Day for my Team Members.  I was trying to decide between the little boxes and these and chose the cup over the box because of the convenience of just adding milk to the cup.  Though the idea was still cute, each cup had very smudged artwork and the cups all had black ash on the outside of them while sealed in the General Mills box.  It was so bad, I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  The cereal seemed to taste the way it should, but since I bought these for their branding and aesthetics too, I was disappointed. Next time I'll get the small boxes instead.

review/summary: Strong Ginger Taste, no bitterness, delicious!
review/text: I love Ginger flavor and these candies deliver. The flavor is sweet but strong which sometimes brings water to my eyes and makes me cough a bit. They really have a nice, smooth flavor, with no bitterness.<br /><br />Ginger has been used by many cultures all over the world for medicinal purposes. My personal experience is that these candies help quell nausea. There are times when no pills or even water will go down, but I can suck on a few of these and the nausea eases up so I can then take the required meds.<br /><br />Also, when it comes to times that my asthma is acting up and I have taken all meds as directed but not gotten relief, sucking on a few of them seems to help clear the air ways a bit. This may just be specific to me.<br /><br />Most importantly these things just plain taste great. Once I start eating them it is tough to stop.<br /><br />Note on sellers: I ordered from an alternate vendor by mistake recently. What I received was a clear plastic bag with no product information or markings of any kind filled with some kind of Ginger drops that looked a tad beat up. It took well over a week to arrive when Claey's delivers within a few days. I'd highly recommend sticking with buying directly from Claey's. Their packaging is great, they are very responsive in quickly filling orders, and their candies are top notch.

review/summary: Great Mid-Value Treat for Your Dog!
review/text: I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.<br /><br />Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.<br /><br />I note these as a "mid-value" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.<br /><br />They are not "mid-value" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them.

review/text: Found these at a local Trucchi's supermarket, but they don't always carry them. Snow's clams are the worst, mushy and tasteless. Atlantic clams are not bad and around here go for $1.50 a can. These cost me $2.99 locally when I can find them and they're worth the extra money. It's cheaper on Amazon though especially since I have Amazon Prime and get free shipping. Starting to do more and more food shopping on Amazon now that we signed up for Prime.<br /><br />Open a can of BarHarbor and just smell the juice. You'd swear they just came out of the ocean...by far the best tasting clams I've ever had. Tastes and smells like they were just harvested. We have spaghetti and clam sauce one a week...my favorite meal. Olive oil, garlic, fresh basil, red pepper, parsley, little butter, salt. Yummy!!!

review/summary: Bar Harbor vs. Snows
review/text: Wanted to help out on the comparison with this relatively expensive brand of canned chopped clams and Snow's, a brand easy to find in supermarkets where I've lived.<br /><br />The textures are very different.  Snow's has additives to retain some semblance of fresh clam's springiness; being "natural," Bar Harbor's are somewhat rough/chalky, but not so much to be unpleasant (I've tried both cooked briefly--under a minute--for clam sauce with pasta).  Interesting also that Snow's has added sugar, probably a small amount.  I find both delicious, with the flavor of Snow's clams a little "louder," a plus for Snow's.<br /><br />Some other relevant considerations.  A can of Bar Harbor clams has 150 calories and 8g of protein, whereas a clam of Snow's has 75 calories and 4g of protein.  To me, this is a plus for Bar Harbor--seems to mean more food in the can (I always eat a whole can, which is supposed to be 3 servings for both).  On the other hand, while I've never opened two cans side-by-side, I haven't noticed a striking difference in the volume of the meat.  Also striking that a Bar Harbor can has 150% daily value of iron, compared to only 6% for Snow's!  So something about the Snow's processing seems to be draining nutritional value.  Snow's has slightly more salt, too.<br /><br />OK, I think these are some good considerations for the buyer!  Myself, I'll probably buy Snow's regularly just for its cheaper price, and occasionally upgrade to Bar Harbor whenever I feel I need to eat more iron.  Bon appetit!

review/summary: Eight O'Clock Coffee, Hazelnut Whole Bean, 33-Ounce Bag
review/text: Having retired on Maui Hawaii, my wife and me enjoyed the Hawaiian Coffee Blends containing Hazelnut flavoring sold by Costco, on Maui. That Blend and other's from the Islands after many weeks of drinking always began to overwhelm our desire of Hazelnut flavoring. o over come this we began mixing our old well excepted UBand Coffee in equal parts to the hazelnut finding a great tasting coffee that always remained our favorite and our stateside visitors too.<br /><br />Our older years are now being enjoyed on the central Oregon Coast and finding the Hawaiian Hazelnut Blend Coffee costing from $20 to $30 per pound, which we consider excessive. Then someone suggested checking our Amazon, which we did with complete satisfaction acquiring the 3 3 oz Whole Bean Eight O'Clock Hazelnut Coffee for less than $15.00 for 2 pounds. Four heaping Tablespoons full of beans into the top of out common coffee bean grinder and grind for about 10-12seconds produces a awesome 12 cup pot of Hazelnut hint of great coffee. A match of our efforts on Maui years ago.

review/text: I've been drinking Eight O'Clock Hazelnut coffee for years.  I don't think I've ever had the experiences of some other reviews, such as a weak flavor.<br /><br />To me, the flavor is consistent.  The coffee is a little fresher when you grind the beans each day, and you can't beat the price on Amazon!!  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: PERFECT EVERY TIME.
review/text: We've always had to search and then wait for our local market to have these beans available.  I was tired of buying the pricey coffee just to get decent beans.  With the automatic delivery it's so easy.  I don't have to get to the store for the umpteenth time only to find yet again, they're out of stock.  I love knowing every single cup of coffe I make (we grind the beans each morning) is perfect every time.  Without fail.  The subscription is great as you can skip a delivery or add an extra one whenever necessary.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZOG2B0">Eight O'Clock Coffee, Hazelnut Whole Bean, 33-Ounce Bag</a>

review/text: I was a little hesitant about buying coffee online but prices in the stores have been going up, up, up! So when I found Amazon not only sold coffee, and my favorite eight o'clock hazelnut, and Columbian at prices less than I was paying and if I joined Subscribe&Save even a lower price I thought, "whats the gimmick? Is it almost out of date?" Well since my first order in May of 2011 I have re-ordered 10 times and have told 3 of my friends that are also ordering from Amazon their favorite coffees, and yes they all have been pleased. Subscribe and save is not limited to coffee I am planning on increasing my purchases and just want to say "try it you'll like it!" Thank you Amazon!!! Keep up the good work.

review/summary: Very weak coffee with little Hazelnut taste.
review/text: After I purchased and then received four 11 oz. bags of dark Italian roast Eight O'Clock Coffee from Amazon early this January, I was so impressed by the full bodied flavor and good rich, smooth taste of that coffee that I ordered this 33 oz. bag of Eight O'Clock Hazelnut Coffee.<br /><br />I wish I had not done so. This is a very weak and bland tasting coffee with little to no taste of Hazelnut in the mixture. The dark Italian roast Eight O'Clock Coffee has a rich taste with very dark brown beans , but the coffee beans in this coffee are a bleached out light tan color that produces a weak tasting bland coffee.<br /><br />To make an halfway fair tasting cup of coffee, I've had to mix some of the great dark Italian roasted coffee beans into the grinder with these pale, wrinkled sub-standard coffee beans. I'm not unhappy to see that it is presently out of stock here at Amazon. Any coffee drinker who buys it after trying good coffee beans is going to be sorely disappointed.

review/text: Panko breadcrumbs, for anyone that has not used them, are the best things for fried chicken, fried fish, crumb toppings and anything else you can think of for breadcrumbs. They don't get soggy, or fall off the meat/fish. Some products are not what they are trumped up to be. Panko breadcrumbs are the exception. I gave a box to my girlfriend and we both profess to be good cooks. She has a yen for fried chicken and was just amazed how well the panko breadcrumbs held up. Her husband kept raving about them. I am glad I bought 6 boxes, you will be too.

review/text: The product itself is great, but the packaging could have been better - a box would have been more stable than the envelope it arrived in - as some of the product leaked during shipping.  But more importantly, I was very disappointed that the expiration date was only 4 months from delivery. We've used this product for many years, and have always had at least a year or more on expiration date.  We were expecting to be able to use the product through at least summer 2013, making the quantity acceptable.  Now, we must use it all by November, 2012 - which is sooner than we anticipated.

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

review/summary: my favorite cheese curls
review/text: My local grocery store had to stop carrying these because the distributor dropped them. I tried other stores with no luck. These are the only cheese curls that really taste like cheese and don't taste like you're licking salt. I'm so glad I still have a source to get them.

review/summary: Amazing cheeze curls
review/text: I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!

review/summary: Best cheese curls period
review/text: I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack. No artificial cheese flavor, excellent crispy texture and sharp cheese taste.  I'm on my third case now and will continue to order this gem of a snack.  Worth a try if you love cheese curls.

review/summary: OMG These are the Best Cheese Snacks!
review/text: I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE Their Pills!!
review/text: When I found out my dogs needed to take pills for an extended period of time, I was really not looking forward to the ordeal of getting them to take them.  I saw this package of Pill Pals at the vet's and figured it was worth a shot.  This  product is amazing!! When I put the pills into the Pill Pals, my dogs literally beg for their pills as if it was the greatest treat in the world, and seem sad when they can't have any more for the day.  The instructions say to sandwich the pill between two Pill Pals, but I have found that depending on the size of the pill, it is easy squish one pill into a Pill Pal and have it entirely surrounded by the treat, as the consistency is firm yet pliable. If your dog hates pills, you should definitely try these Pill Pals!!

review/text: My cats very quickly stopped eating the Greenies brand 'Pill Pockets', but my boyfriend found these at his vet so we gave them a try.  I have made it through 3 pouches and 1 cat still purrs every time he gets his pill, while both still eat them quickly and w/o pill fights.  The texture is much softer and pliable then the Pill Pockets and are not as prone to drying out.  The vet no longer carries these, I hope they remain available online.

review/summary: So convenient and dogs love them
review/text: I discovered these at my vet's office and they are a blessing!  I used to wrap my dog's pills in pieces of processed cheese slices; but the cold, slippery cheese didn't want to stick to the pills and I spent a lot of time massaging it (warming it up) to coat the pills.  Since my dogs need thyroid and allergy medication several times a day, I was excited to find these where the pills could be easily inserted and completely hidden in a few seconds.  The air-tight sealable pouch keeps them moist and fresh.  My dogs love them and view them as a treat--double happiness!

review/summary: Dogs Love Them!!!
review/text: My dog is on two long term medications.  One is "really bitter", per my veterinarian and my dogs reaction to the taste the first time.  The second makes him salivate like crazy.  I tried wrapping the pills in cheese, putting them in wet food, and anything else I could think of.  Unfortunately, I wasted several pills because he would spit them out.  Then I tried Pill Pals.  I sandwich 2 pills between two of the Pill Pals, and make a ball so the pills are completely encased in the chicken treat, and he gobbles it down.  My other dogs go crazy at the smell, and I end up giving them one as a treat.  I highly recommend this product!

review/text: Our two dogs like these sweet potato discs quite a bit though it took them a few minutes to warm up to them. Though they seem to like the taste quite a bit, the treats are too chewy for either of our small dogs to handle whole.<br />I cut them up with scissors and feed them to the girls in small pieces. These are a natural treat made out of sweet potatoes.<br />The only factor that might give one pause is that these are a product of China.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I fell in love with this product.  I find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda.  This product has saved me.  I use it in everything I would use regular sugar for.  My favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet.  Talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines, this is the one for me.  Now I want to find a "brown sugar" variation of this.  Raley's supermarket used to carry Smart Sugar and then quit stocking it.  I bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until I could find another source.  Thanks to Amazon, I can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely.  I'll be placing my order for 5 bags very soon.  Thanks to everyone involved in the production of Smart Sugar!

review/summary: Best sugar replacement out there
review/text: I have been using Smart Sugar for 2+ years, but then the local grocery stopped carrying it. So sad. I am pre-diabetic and lactose intolerant, so I make a fab ice cream using smart sugar and coconut milk in a Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. So easy and tastes great. Smart sugar also does well in baking cakes & other baked goods. I have tried pineapple upside down cake and date cake as well as bran muffins. If you use this Smart sugar with a high protein, high fiber soy, coconut, and ancient grain flour mix, the carbs stay really low on baked goods and is balanced by high fiber. Enjoy! Thank you Amazon for marketing this great product. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FV9VSC">Smart Sugar</a>

review/summary: My Favorite Sugar Alternative!
review/text: I first used Smart Sugar about three or four years ago. I bought it at Raley's, which, unfortunately, has stopped carrying it, This is the only low-calorie sweetener that I can bear to use. It doesn't have a funny "aftertaste" that I usually sense in low-calorie alternatives. One of my FAVORITE things is that there is NO ASPARTAME! That stuff makes me physically ill. I have actually lost some weight using Smart Sugar instead of regular sugar. I hope it becomes available everywhere soon! I have only been able to get it from Amazon.com for quite a while, and, as of this post, they don't have it. I hope they haven't stopped stocking it as well!

Thank goodness you can buy it from amazon.  I pray that they keep producing it since there is no where else to go for a product this good.<br />Maybe the company could try Whole Foods.

I pay around $3 for a 6 pack at the grocery store, so this seemed like a really good bargain.  Boy, was I wrong.  I didn't get 6 boxes of the 6-packs, I got ONE six pack.  Which, according to amazon, has a retail price of 20 bucks!  That's insane.<br /><br />Fortunately, a quick chat with customer service refunded my purchase, but I was still disappointed to find it was ONE pack and not 6.

review/text: I use a lot of ground cayenne pepper.  This is the third kind I've tried in the last year, and it is by far the best.  It is spicier and has much more flavor than the other kinds.  And one kind I tried was grown, dried, and ground by some family members and given to us.<br /><br />This cayenne from Badia has simply the best flavor.  And it's spicy!  I don't need to use nearly as much as with other brands when I cook, and I still get more flavor.  That alone makes it worth the extra money and time waiting for it to ship.  You don't need to use as much.<br /><br />This cayenne is a nice, dark red.  Very, very finely ground.  There is only a shaker option, and luckily, it doesn't come flying out.<br /><br />I still cannot get over how much more flavor and spiciness this Badia Cayenne Pepper has versus other ones we've tried.  It has flavor, not just spice.  I don't want any other kind anymore after having used this.  Superior quality product.  If you enjoy cayenne pepper, I would highly recommend going organic and choosing this one from Badia.  It isn't a brand I've heard of until I purchased this, but it makes me want to seek it out with other spices in the future.

review/summary: Terrific dietary supplement and entertainment value in one!
review/text: Let's be honest - 35% of your recommended daily fiber in a "candy bar" that makes you want to eat the whole box is great thing.<br />13% of your saturated fats in one bar? Not so good. I believe it balances out for the most part and there is definitely a benefit to making fiber taste good.<br /><br />Just don't eat more than one until you are used to them.<br /><br />The chicory root fiber that is in these (and FiberOne) and every other clone product is an incredible generator of intestinal gas in many people. People who eat a lot of foods high in fiber will not likely be as affected, but some will be caught quite by surprise with what happens a couple of hours after you eat one. Reports of people scaring their pets and waking themselves and loved ones up from a sound sleep with the substantial and epic flatulence is not as exaggerated as you might think. Marathon farting with longer durations and louder volume than you have ever experienced is fairly common.<br /><br />The good news is, the gaseous emanations are very often "all bark and no bite" (to put it delicately) and so can be very entertaining if you have small children or an immature husband (or wife). Just do not eat them prior to bed, church, yoga class, boardroom meetings, dates, long car trips with passengers, crowded movies, using public transportation, job interviews, dentist appointments, doctor's appointments, family reunions ... well, you get the picture.<br /><br />However, if you get selected by the IRS for an audit, eat a whole box (5 of them) about 1 hour before the scheduled time. This also works for meetings with any government officials or any people you DO NOT wish to ever invite you back.

Don't get me wrong, sugar is fine in reasonable amounts but for diabetics it may not be good to eat this bar.<br /><br />Also.... be prepared...these can cause BAD gas. Start out slow !

review/text: We absolutly love these! They are great tasting, and satifying as a morning or evening snack. We are watching our weight, and will often times have this as our dessert after dinner. We want somthing sweet, but still healthy. Apparently everyone is catching on to how good they are because we can never find them at our local grocery store we shop on a regular basis. We didn't want to look all over, so I went on line in hopes of finding them and did on Amazon.com. Not only did we find them, but they are a little less expensive than buying in the store. I bought a full case and took advantage of the "super saver shipping". A case is 60 bars, and for 2 of us not too many. You can always freeze them, and take out a box a day ahead of when you are wanting them. Again, WE LOVE THEM. Hope you enjoy too!<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton
