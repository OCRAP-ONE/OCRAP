review/summary: Smells great but no taste
review/text: The coffee smells great.  I was so excited to try it because of its wonderful aroma.  I was very disappointed in the taste.  It was very weak.  Maybe I used too much water but not more than I normally use with other coffee.

My friend didn't like it because it wasn't sweet, but I really love none sweet tea and don't like sweet tea. So this tea is absolutely amazing to me. I am thrilled to see it available in bulk!

review/summary: Sticky, strong, and sooo good
review/text: Our fine TSA in Minneapolis decided that the same two jars of Scottish heather honey that made it through Cardiff and Amsterdam gate checks (the tiny jars were apparently 4 ounces, I will remember to bring a magnifying glass next time) were too dangerous to fly from Minneapolis to Kansas City, so my father's gift (his family is from Scotland and the honey was bought in Scotland) was taken away... I hope whoever got it enjoyed it.  :)  Was glad to find this seller providing a nice big jar of Heather Hills Farm Scottish heather honey for a more reasonable price than I could find elsewhere online - the price is usually okay, it's the shipping that gets ya.  Heather honey is not the same as yer average clover honey... it's strong, very herbal I guess.  Smelled it before I saw it - the seal on the jar was not intact (although the paper sticker on the top was not broken) and a bit o' honey had leaked onto the bubble wrap.  I didn't mind, and nobody has gotten sick from eating the stuff.  Might be from pressure during transport?  Dunno.  Doesn't matter, Dad absolutely loves it and shared - it is *fabulous*!  Will be buying more.  :)

review/text: My Wife & I traveld to SCOTTLAND A FEW YEARS AGO & NEVER FOGOT THE GREAT<br />TASTE of their Heather Honey. I was delighted when I saw that I could<br />order it from Amazon .com. Problem was that when I received the Jar was<br />either broken or unsealed as Honey was all over the package. I sent it back & asked for a new Jar. The return was acknowledged, but they offered<br />to return the amount Paid plus shipping to be added  to my Debit account.<br />Still waiting for the refund which is fair, but, would like to taste the<br />Honey.Maybe I'll try ordering again after I get the refund.

review/text: If you want to make restaurant style sushi this might not be the best choice. However I make sushi at home and these are a great product for that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Cheap<br />-Large are (Sometimes I get a bit left over and can give the roll an extra 1/4 turn)<br />-Resealable plastic bag<br /><br />They are also good in the fact that they are slightly "firm", meaning that when I cut them I don't get the flattening out problem because they are too elastic.<br /><br />One star off because they are not extreme in flavor, however they more than make up for that with their price.

review/text: Good price for the 50 sheets of sushi nori seaweed in comparison to the prices in the main grocery stores. My husband & I recently moved from an area w/ access to great Asian markets to a more remote area without any Asian markets. The nori seaweed sheets arrived in a timely manner in good condition.  The shipping price was a bit steep for such a light item but still cheaper then driving over an hour to the nearest Asian market and much more convenient.

review/text: I tried several brands...and this is the only one that consistently did not break. You need to moisten the sheet with a damp cloth or light spray so that the roll stays in a single pice and clings to itself. Better tasting also. I use this with suchesi and other sushi forms.

review/summary: Price is good, product is okay.
review/text: They're not as big as the nori that I'm used to, and not as thick, either. I tore 3 out of 8 rolls the first time. I make my rolls without using a mat or anything, so if you roll by hand and like them snug, be careful with them- they suck up moisture MUCH quicker than other nori sheets, due to their thinness, and this makes them prone to tearing. The price is good for a pack of 50, though. I paid 6.89.

When it was done, I stirred in about 1 cup baby spinach leaves. This was delicious and made 4 very large servings for a great main dish.

review/text: Our 11 month old son had a bad, week-long stomach flu and had stopped taking the plain Pedialyte once he was able to start drinking formula again, but because he still had diarrhea he needed some Pedialyte. So I tried giving him this fruit flavor. He had a few sips via spoon and spewed projectile vomit twice. This is after having not vomited in over 24 hours. It put us back to square one. Smell and taste it yourself, it's awful. Maybe older kids prefer it, who knows, but I will never give this product to my child ever again.

review/summary: FROMM SURF&TURF
review/text: My dogs love this stuff. I was currently on Taste Of Wild until I found out they were Owned by DIAMOND, bad bad company and they hide it very well. Anyways, the kibble is real small and my dogs do real well on the this formula.<br />My dogs have only been on Surf & Turf for about 3 wks and they are doing awesome on it. This stuff must taste really really good becuase my dogs go right after it. This is one of the top grain free dry kibble's out on the market. When you read this comment you must slowly introduce this kibble to them if not your going to have problems with there waste & they might vomit. It took me 3wks to totally switch them over. Anyways this stuff rock and yes I would recommend this to highly active dogs only. Here are the ingredients for the GRAIN FREE SURF&TURF. I would rate Surf&Turf & Orijen the top two dog food companies on the market. The only difference is FROMM is a US comapny & ORIJEN is FROM CANADA/<br /><br />Salmon, Duck Meal, Potatoes, Pea Flour, Sweet Potatoes, Duck, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), Dried Tomato Pomace, Salmon Meal, Whole Dried Egg, Pea Protein, Chicken, Flaxseed, Cheese, Salmon Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Chicken Broth, Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Apples, Green Beans, Lecithin, Chicken Cartilage, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Blueberries, Salt, Chicory Root Extract, Alfalfa Sprouts, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Folic Acid, Parsley, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Enterococcous Faecium, Vitamin A, D3, E, B12 Supplements, Choline Bitartrate, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Manganous Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Cobalt Carbonate, Calcium Iodate, Sorbic Acid, Iron Proteinate, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Sodium Selenite.

review/summary: no more stomach problems
review/text: My golden retriever puppy had weeks of stomach problems and lots of expensive and unsuccessful testing to try to determine the problem. My puppy trainer suggested I try this grain free food. I did and his problems cleared right up. It is expensive but has all natural and healthy ingredients and should actually reduce vet bills in the long run since he is such a healthy dog now. I plan to start feeding my cat Fromm food now too. She likes the smell of the salmon in the dog's food so I'll try the salmon cat food soon. This company makes quality food for pets and produces it here in the United States.

review/summary: GREAT!
review/text: Our dog loves this food! It has good quality ingredients and it's reasonably priced for the most part. Our dog's coat shines, she barely scratches, no more watery eyes, and her poop is firm and less smelly. All in all, it's great quality food.<br /><br />Plus it's made in the USA which gives me a little more peace of mind about the quality of the food. The only downside is that it smells fishy and the fishy smell tends to linger on my dogs face.

review/summary: My dog loves this food!
review/text: My dog really loves this food. He's a picky eater and I find he really likes this one. It's very natural and rated high on dogfoodanalysis.com. He's tried some other flavours in the Fromm line, but so far he seems like like this one the best. His coat got much more soft and shiny since he's started eating it and he gets compliments at the dog park all the time. He's a cocker spaniel so the small/average size kibble is great. Would highly recommend. I believe this flavour is also grain free, which is a bonus.

review/summary: Godsend
review/text: My four year old chihuahua has had epilepsy since she was about a year old. After having serious seizures about every two weeks I took her to the vet and he prescribed her phonobarbital. After researching the horrendous side effects that dogs experience while on this medicine I decided to look for a natural method. After hours apon hours of researching I found this food and I am SOOOOO thankful I did. Almost immediatly after feeding her this food her seizures stopped and she has not had a seizure in a year and a half. Thank you lord for this dog food. My dog is my world and her seizures are gone. Another effect from this dog food is her coat, she use to have dry brittle hair and my husband constantly joked around about her being "mangy" she now has a full coat of beautiful hair. On top of all the wonderful benifits, my dog LOVES this food. Fromm four start surf and turf is highly recommended, your dog will thank you!

review/summary: My pup gobbles this food up!
review/text: Fromm Surf & Turf is a great, healthy dog food. Small kibbles for any size dog (like the size of an eraser head on a pencil). Smell is not over pungent like some of the cheaper brands.<br /><br />My 5 month old pup was on Natural Balance from the rescue group that I got him from. I switched to Fromm when he had some while at a friends house and he gobbled it up, which he had never done before. He never fails to eat everything that is given to him. In fact, sometimes I wet the food a little so it will slow him down!<br /><br />I am switching him to Fromm Gold for Puppies until he gets a little older (per the vets request). He is steadily gaining about a pound a week, which is perfect.<br /><br />Lastly, I am happy that it is made locally here in Wisconsin.

review/summary: Fromm Four-Star Surf & Turf vs Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon
review/text: My 2 Minature Schnauzers are 3yrs old and picky eaters. They were occassionaly spoiled by me adding chicken breast or turkey to their dry food. They eventually got bored of the Fromm Surf & Turf but for the first month loved to eat it. Yes, it's more expensive than the other dry foods but the ingredients used helped my prevent break-outs that one of my dogs were experiencing from allergies. I switched them to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it has higher protein and Omega fatty acids. The dogs enjoyed the change in food but it gave them both gas and one of them had diarrhea. I like the ingredients of the Blue Buffalo but according to my vet some owners are complaining about the same effects on their dogs because it's very rich. I'm remaining with the Fromm simply because of the quality and it's grain less so it helps my dog with allergies.

review/text: I wanted a food for a a dog with skin problems. His skin greatly improved with the switch, though he still itches some.  He loves the food. No recalls, American made with American ingredients was a big plus (no Chinese poisoned food).  I took off a point for availability, which increases the price. Fortunately he is a small dog and the food lasts a while.  He has done well so now feeling safe to expand the diet to other flavones in this line for variety.

review/text: I've been using Fromm Surf N Turf in my rotation (which has come down to this and the beef frittata veg by Fromm) over the last several months.<br />First, I have an itchy/scratchy bichon.  Surpringly she does not have food allergies, but environmental allergies.  She gets better and worse, depending on the season.  Her coat is nice, skin, stool, all good.<br /><br />Next I have a sensitive tummy Portuguese Water dog who cannot have any grain AT ALL.  Surf N Turf is perfect and she digests it well.  I've tried several other foods and she just cannot handle foods with grain in it, not even the 'easy to digest' rice formulas.<br /><br />Even my little chihuahua, Cookie, does great on it.  Beautiful, soft and full coat, nice teeth, breath, stool and overall health.<br /><br />I do feed this as 70% of their overall diet, the other 30% being from The Honest Kitchen (Zeal and Love formulas).<br /><br />This is a food I've happily recommended!  And I don't see myself feeding anything else. Pleased with the customer service as well!

review/summary: FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL,ITS "NOT" SOLID,ITS "NOT" NATURAL,& THAT'S NOT RIGHT!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>All right,well before I get into the many reasons why I regret buying this product,I need to mention something very important first.AMAZON HAS DECIDED TO REMOVE ITSELF AS AN AVAILABLE MERCHANT FOR THIS PRODUCT,& LET OTHER MARKETPLACE MERCHANTS JACK UP THE PRICE!WHEN I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THIS ITEM ON JUNE 30TH,IT WAS AVAILABLE WITH FREE SUPER SAVING SHIPPING/AMAZON PRIME FOR $16.31.NOT EVEN A WEEK LATER (4 DAYS TO BE SPECIFIC) & AMAZON.COM ITSELF NO LONGER SELLS THIS PRODUCT,& LET SEVERAL MARKETPLACE MERCHANTS OFFER THIS ITEM,STARTING AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE OF $27.25 (NOW NO LONGER WITH FREE SUPER SAVER SHIPPING/AMAZON PRIME)!Well,that's enough for me to NEVER purchase this item from Amazon.com ever again,but there are several other reasons why.This coconut oil is not of a very high quality,as I could tell from the price that I paid for it,& it was not very highly recommended.Nowhere on the bottle or jug does it have the notation of extra virgin or virgin,which signifies that its high quality coconut oil.To be honest,I purchased this item so that I could use it as a hair oil to grow my hair back out since I've always had dry hair.A while back,I had a full head relaxer done & a large portion of my hair just fell out from lack of nutrition,bad hair care,& the strength of the relaxer.Now,here is the reason why you should NOT purchase this coconut oil,either from Amazon or at all.This coconut oil has been "fractionated" or chemically altered so that it will stay in a liquid form,regardless of the temperature.Anyone who has ever used coconut oil knows that its a SOLID at room temperature (between 70-75 degrees F).When it reaches a temperature of 76 degrees F or higher,then it will begin to melt into an odorless colorless liquid.I've wondered why someone would even bother to do something like this,& then I realized that it was all in the name of laziness.Some people don't want to take the time to melt coconut oil for each use,so if its ALWAYS in liquid form,then its easy & ready to go.Well,that's NOT what I'm interested in,I wanted to receive natural coconut oil as it was meant to be,not something that has been altered for the sake of convenience.Something else that you should know,even if this coconut oil has been fractionated,I do not suggest that anyone comsume this or use it in cooking.Its not of a decent quality,& I know that its been sitting around for a while,so I have no idea where this thing has been stored.Yes,coconut oil has an extremely long shelf life,but the fact that this isn't raw,natural coconut oil still bothers me.I'm not a very organic person,but I don't like it when I'm not sure what's in a product that I'm consuming or using on my body.Just so you know,coconut oil is very high in saturated fat,which is why it remains a SOLID at room temperature,like butter,margarine,shortening,lard & palm oil (NOT to be confused with palm kernel oil).Palm Kernel Oil is the ONLY saturated fat that is able to remain a liquid at room temperature.That's why you usually see it as one of the main ingredients in almost ALL store bought protein bars,sadly.Anyway,I was deceived into believing that I bought "real" natural coconut oil,& NOT something that has been altered to stay a liquid.Now,if that's what you're interested in,then there's nothing wrong with that.It would be nice if Amazon advertised in the product details that this coconut oil has been "fractionated".Without that information,noone that purchases this item would have any idea that they're being duped by the merchants selling this product.Its the merchants responsibility to give Amazon all of the information it needs in order to keep its customers informed.There is something else that might be going on,but I'm not sure that Amazon would actually do something like this.Amazon "might" already know that this coconut oil has been "fractionated" but chooses to not include that information in the product details.I don't like it when I don't have ALL the information when it comes to what's contained in my health & beauty products.Overall,I sort of knew what I was getting into when I bought this item,but I at least expected to receive "RAW" natural coconut oil,instead of something that has been chemically altered.If you are only using this as a beauty aid,then it might not matter to you that much.However,if you are looking for a natural coconut oil to cook with & consume,then I would recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product.Yes,I will admit that this is the first time that I've ever used coconut oil personally,but I KNOW what coconut oil is supposed to look like.Here's something else that you need to know,directly relating to this item when shopping on Amazon.Parachute Coconut Oil is available in a wide variety of sizes,since this is a "beauty" item to me,but Amazon has it listed in the "Grocery" catagory.There were 2 listings for basically the same amount of coconut oil,just in different packaging.The first one Parachute Coconut Oil, 67.6-Ounce had a large amount of coconut oil for a very decent price (NOT anymore) in one bottle.The second one Parachute Coconut Oil, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2) had the same amount of coconut oil,but split up into smaller jugs for a few dollars more.I bought 2 of the 67 ounce Parachute since it was $4 cheaper then the 33 ounce one,& I do love saving money.Well,as I mentioned before,Amazon JUST decided to remove itself as a Merchant for this product (UNLIKE "Fufilled by Amazon",where Amazon.com is just "holding" the product in a warehouse for a Marketplace merchant).The ONLY reason for this is that Amazon decided it wanted to "yet again" raise the price by either raising its own price of an item or remove itself completely (RARE) as a Merchant for a product.I'm very disappointed in this,but more so at the fact that I "thought" that I was buying "natural" coconut oil,& instead,I get this.One more thing,when I opened one of the 67 ounce jugs up,the jug was ONLY filled about HALFWAY so I can help it but to state that I genuinely feel CHEATED by Amazon.So,I don't think that I will be purchasing this item anymore from Amazon,especially since they like RAISING the price so often.Anyway,for those that don't really care & just want to save a buck,too late,as Amazon KEEPS jacking up the price.Everyone else who preferres to use a coconut oil that is actually natural & not "chemically altered" then look elsewhere.<br /><br />Here is why I bought this coconut oil,& also why I personally have decided to use coconut oil on my hair.This is how I felt about this coconut oil BEFORE I realized that it had been fractionated for convenience of beauty.<br /><br />I've decided to try & use coconut oil to grow my hair back out,after a relaxer basically ruined it.There's nothing wrong with relaxers,& I will continue to use them on my hair,while at the same time keeping it moisturized with coconut oil.If anyone has used oils to moisturize their hair,you know that it takes a while for your hair to grow back.I've heard of something called Vatika oil which is basically just coconut oil with a little bit of henna & alma extract thrown in.The rave reviews on that product convinced me that I needed to get some coconut oil to save my hair.Its not overpriced,but I wanted to see if I could get the same benefits & same some cash by just using coconut oil alone on my hair.Regardless,I believe that anyone buying this is using it on their hair,most likely,& not as an oil in their cooking,but I had to mention it.When you use coconut oil on your hair,it will start to feel more moisturized,especially if you leave it in overnight as a deep conditioner.I use henna combined with indigo (the 2 step process) in order to dye my hair black without the use of chemicals,since I've experienced irritation before using regular hair dyes.Coconut oil is an amazing deep conditioner after a henna treatment,as it tends to dry your hair out very much.The price of Parachute coconut oil is usually very reasonable,but it would always be nice if they lowered it anyway,since I love saving money.As long as you live in a semi-humid region,then the coconut oil should be soft enough so that you can melt it easily.Just scoop or shake some out into a small melt-proof squeeze bottle,& leave it out in a sunny area for a few minutes.Also,I would try leaving it in a sink with warm water,but that might melt the bottle,though,if too hot.Coconut oil will definitely help me to grow my hair back stronger then before,so that I can again use relaxers,within reason,to keep it nice & straight.

They stand up well to carry a few in a plastic baggie and keep in my purse.<br />Before going gluten-free stick pretzels were a favorite and now the delicious Glutino GF Pretzel Sticks are.

review/summary: Excellent Product. As good if not better than "normal" pretzels!
review/text: I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own "special" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember "normal" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic.

review/text: Let's face it. If you have Celiac disease and have to be Gulten free you are very limited in what you can eat. Before I was diagnosed I loved pretzels and while nothing Gulten free tastes as good as the real thing this products comes very close. I now eat them every day and buy the product by the case. I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver!

review/text: All the other GF pretzels I've tried have an "off" flavor. These ones don't! They have a great texture and flavor. I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house.

I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need.

It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the "regular" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part.
