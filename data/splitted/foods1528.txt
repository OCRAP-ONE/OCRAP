review/text: I first tried turron , when we had a foreign exchange student give us some as gift. He told us it was a rear treat in Spain. He was right in my opinion. I have had other brands that were not as good as this.If you like turron you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Jijona is the best of turrons
review/text: Jijona Turron is a delicious candy from Spain, usually enjoyed at Christmas, but a treat any time.<br />My late husband, who was from Spain, used to buy several boxes of Yema Tostada Turron, Alicante, and Jijona Turron.  But Jijona was always the favorite.  It's finely ground Marcona almonds and honey bar, and can be sliced to serve, with the other turrons.  A glass of Spanish sherry goes well with them.

review/summary: Every nursing mother should know about this!!!
review/text: WOW!! I was doing just fine until my little one started hitting mini-growth spurts. I had been giving her a bottle of pumped milk twice a day when I had to take medicine that I didn't want in my system when I nursed. So, when I got off the medicine, I noticed that those times of day, I was not producing AT ALL. If you don't use it, you lose it, so they say. I was desperately nursing every hour just for my girl to get SOMETHING and stimulate production, but it didn't work and we were both frustrated and tired.<br /><br />I read about Fenugreek seed and couldn't find it, but stumbled upon this tea. Within 24 hours I was so engorged that I had to pump!! I now still use it just to be able to store up frozen milk for when my husband and I go out or I run an errand and don't want to have to find somewhere to nurse. My milk supply now doesn't even begin to run out when I use the pumped milk and skip nursing.<br /><br />I wish that I could tell every mom about this. I think less women would give up on nursing due to lack of milk, if they knew about this tea! And it's so inexpensive. I drink at least 2 cups a day. I love the taste. It's sweet and minty. I just add a little sugar.

review/text: I was having trouble building up my milk supply so I could both nurse my son and pump milk to store in preparation for my return to work.  A friend recommended this tea to me.  I only had to drink 3 cups of this tea before I saw an increase in my milk supply, and I only need to drink 1 cup a day to maintain that supply.  I wasn't sure I would like the taste, but it is surprisingly pleasant, not too sweet or artificial. Try it for yourself.

review/summary: Thank God for this tea!
review/text: I don't even know where to begin to express my relief in finding this tea! I've been determined to exclusively breastfeed my daughter since she was born and was doing so with no problem until I got mastitis. 2 weeks of antibiotics and pumping & dumping took a toll on my supply, especially when my daughter got used to the bottle. At three months my supply went down to about 14oz total all day. I had to start supplementing which I hated and was almost in tears for a week as I watched my supply get lower and lower. i was told about this tea by a nutritionist and it's been a Godsend! My milk is up to almost twice as much from just having one or two cups a day. I'll admit that i'm not crazy about the flavor. Tastes like black licorice which I hate, but it's definitely drinkable. I just drink it cold with lemon and sugar and hold my breath. I'm a believer now and would recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: didn't work by itself
review/text: After several issues including cracked nipples, poor latch, problems pumping, and a fussy baby I decided to start to ween at 3 weeks. By the time she was 4 weeks old I was down to two nursing sessions a day and supplementing with formula for the rest. Then, as I healed and felt less stress about nursing the whole process got easier so I decided to try to increase my nursing/pumping sessions and decrease her formula intake. Unfortunately, by that point I could only pump 1/4 ounce per breast and she was easily taking in 3 ounces per session with the bottle. I ordered a case of this tea and took the recommended dosage for 2 weeks without success. Then I tried increasing the dose to two bags at a time, 4 times a day. You do have to take the time to steep it corectly (10 minutes, covered). I saw minimal results after increasing the dosage which could have also been attributed to increasing the number of pumping sessions or additional water intake per day rather than the tea. If you're used to herbal teas you probably won't mind the taste too much. It's rather nice with a bit of milk and honey added in. It does smell faintly of black licorice, but I never noticed it in the flavor. After I finished off the case of tea I tried fenugreek capsules and saw a bit better improvement in supply (an additional 2-3 ounces per day). I can now pump about 4-6 ounces a day (up from a total of 2 ounces a day when I first started) while I'm at work and I nurse her at the start of every feeding at home. I still need to supplement with formula since she'll now take in between 4-6 ounces at a time at 3 months old. I wish I was one of the lucky ones to see an increase of 6-8 ounces per feeding/pumping session, but I'm happy that I was able to bring my supply back as much as I have. Now I'm combining Blessed Thistle with Fenugreek to see if I can get any additional output. 15 pills a day has been challenging for me, particularly since I'm not the best at swallowing them. I'm trying to hang on to my supply, as low as it may be, as long as I can though. So, for me it's worth it. Definitely give the tea a try if you're having trouble with supply, but just know that it has such low doses of the herbs that it isn't effective for everyone. If you don't have success with the tea it's worth trying out fenugreek and blessed thistle too.

review/summary: It really works
review/text: I've always had problems pumping enough milk from the very beginning.  I went from pumping around 3 ounces at work to 4 or even (sometimes) 5 ounces.  I've always aimed to get 3 pumps of 4 ounces each and I was always coming up way short.  Now, I have enough to give my son extra milk each day.<br /><br />I can tell that I get more milk after I've had some tea verses when I've had very little tea.  I have more milk at noon with the tea, than in the morning after hardly any tea.  I have more milk later in the week after 3 days of tea, than on Monday morning after a weekend of no tea.<br /><br />I usually have to have 3 to 5 cups of tea a day.  You do get used to the taste.  The only side effects I have noticed is that it makes me thirsty (more than likely from producing more milk), it gives me hot flashes, and it makes my son's toots really smelly.  :)

review/summary: Great tea helps nursing mothers.
review/text: I like the Organic Mother's Milk tea very much.  It has helped increase my milk supply which is typically low.  The flavor is just fine if you like herbs.  I add a little splenda to mine to sweeten it up.  If you drink the recommended maximum of five cups per day it also has the added benefit of increasing your intake of liquids which is important when nursing.  I have also noticed that the smell of the tea does not come out through my pores much like the fenugreek supplement did which I have taken in the past.The only problem I have with it is that is quite expensive if you decide to drink it during your entire nursing experience.  Thus, that is the reason for 4 stars.  However, I would highly recommend it.

review/text: I'm a skeptic about most things but needed to try something to increase my breast milk production.  I've been drinking 3 cups of the Organic Mother's Milk Tea for the past 3 days.  Now on day 3 my milk production has increased by over 50% & if I don't pump my breasts become so full that they leak and feel so full.  I'd recommend at least trying this tea if you are looking for that much needed boost in production.  As far as the taste; yes I'd prefer a cup of my favorite Chai Team but as an avid tea drinker I quickly acquired a taste for this tea. My suggestion would be to go ahead & purchase the 6 pack of the Organic Mother's Milk Tea as it's more economical.

I have tried this and Fenugreek capsules to help improve my milk supply ( I am NOT a big producer).  The Fenugreek just made me smell like maple syrup and I don't think it increased my supply at all.  The tea is pleasant tasting with a little sugar added.  I actually look forward to drinking it now. I drink four cups a day and have a decent supply.  It does make me urinate frequently after I have had a cup but it's not bothersome.

The taste is not very good at all, actually I would say the smell is worse than the taste. However increasing my milk supply is far more important to me than the taste or smell of the tea! I plan on trying to get atleast 3 cups down a day from now on and hope for a little more milk to come in so I can have some stored up.

review/text: I had to add lots of honey and some milk to help dilute the strong licorice taste, but after doctoring it, it tasted pretty good. I'm still not sure if it helped increase my milk supply.

I'll keep it around just in case, but it won't be an absolute necessity. (I've been breastfeeding for 2 1/2 months when my supply began to run low.)<br /><br />Bottom line, it's fixed now. *shrugs*

review/text: Ever since birth, my now 2-month old son is a very aggressive eater, and there are times of the day I could not breastfeed him exclusively without this tea. I've been drinking 1-2 cups per day for the past 6 weeks, and it helps to keep my supply up. I did make the "mistake" of drinking my first 1/2 cup just before bed the first time I tried it. I had been having supply issues during the evening, and after that 1/2 cup of tea I was so engorged all night I had more than enough to feed him and had to pump in between feedings to relieve pressure. The taste really isn't bad, it's good with honey or even with sugar if you must have your tea super-sweet. I'm usually really skeptical about natural remedies, it was a pleasant surprise to see it work as advertised.

review/summary: It works. Second time user...
review/text: I used this for my first child. After going back to work only two weeks later, I noticed I was not producing what he was consuming at day care a few months later. I started drinking two bags, making 4 cups (I use the bag twice). It helped to increase the milk within two or so weeks. That was 4 years ago.<br />I noticed the same thing happening with my second child. She was drinking 4 to 5 3oz bottles at day care and I was only pumping 3 3oz bottles. Maybe 4 if I was lucky. I need a frozen supply (which I had), but it was slowly decreasing.<br />I asked my DH to pick some more up at the grocery store the next time he went (I work A LOT)... and I only drink two tea bags a day (using each bag twice in a new hot water cup). This makes 4 cups easy if not 5 as I did the first time around. I started this again last Monday and don't need it on the weekend as she is usually content with what she is nursing off of. Today I have pumped 11oz (since noon), when I normally only get 7 oz. BIG difference and much needed. Hopefully this will increase a little bit more so I can give her what she needs at day care and put an occasional bottle in freezer for the weekends or emergency use.<br />I would highly recommend this product.

By the way, the taste is not bad at all, it didn't even need sugar. I've had to drink worse-tasting teas.

review/summary: What a good find!
review/text: Just wanted to say that I found this tea when my milk supply had started to decrease (about 4m post baby) I didnt want to stop nursing but my little one was getting VERY frustrated with the amount that was available. I found this tea at Stop n Shop in the health food section and gave it a try. After a week I noticed that my baby girl wasnt so frustrated and I was able to get back on schedule of pumping a little extra each day. Directions say to drink one cup of prepared tea 3-5 times daily. I drank it about 2-3 times daily but found the tea chilled was much better!<br />It has a bitter taste, but is definatly drinkable.<br />Definatly worth a try!!

review/summary: not impressed
review/text: The amount of fenugreek recommended to promote milk production by far exceeds the amount in this tea. The tea has to seep for 10 minutes before drinking. The box suggests drinking 5 cups of tea a day as well- who has that kind of time? . There are 16 tea bags in a box so it will only last 2 and a half days, which makes it overpriced and insufficient for the needs of a mom trying to build up her milk supply. Fenugreek capsules work- this doesn't.

It works ok for me, nothing spectacular, but I think I have a little more breast milk than when I don't drink it. I probably would've given it 4/5 stars however the shipping cost made this product over $11.  I recently found it at target and paid like $3.99.  That's where I'll be getting it from now on.

review/summary: Great for all nursing moms!!!
review/text: After a few weeks of latching problems, soreness, bleeding, and constant discomfort, breast feeding seemed like an impossible feat. I went out and bought a dual electric pump, as i had decided to pump exclusively and bottle feed breast milk. I was not producing enough milk. Had to go out and buy formula. That hurt. Baby did not take well to it, and it is so expensive! A friend brought me this tea, and I drink 3-5 servings per day. My milk supply has doubled! I can now feed baby breast milk exclusively! This tea is wonderful. I am not a tea or herbs person, so i don't like how it tastes; I bring milk to light boil, steep and cover for 10 min, and add chocolate syrup. I didn't like it with honey or sugar. I will be purchasing fenugreek and blessed thistle, in hope that I can pump enough to store for when I return to work. But I definitely recommend this tea to ALL nursing mothers. Its inexpensive, and really helps! It is truly a godsend.

review/text: This product did seem to work. One week when I was drinking this often I ended up with a plugged milk duct because I had extra milk (not complaining!). However, I found the taste pretty awful. Just a note I hate fennel, so that may be why. I choked it down for my baby's benefit, but just imagining the taste makes me want to gag. I love tea and drink all kinds but this was just..ugh. Putting extra honey does help, but I'm not buying a second box. If you look on Etsy.com there are tons of different varieties of teas to help with milk supply. That's what I'm trying next and I'm hoping they taste better!!

review/summary: I wish I could say it worked
review/text: Of course when I buy anything, I want it to be useful. When I first started drinking this tea, I did notice an increase of maybe an oz or two per day; I was happy with that. So I started drinking 2-3 cups a day. I think the taste is fine - I didn't add sugar, honey, or anything, and I didn't find it nasty at all.<br /><br />But then my production started to slow down a bit, which I figured was a normal side effect of pumping 3x a day rather than nursing. Then I forgot to drink the tea and I actually got more milk than when I WAS drinking it! When drinking the tea, my average was about 13oz per day, and for the past 4 days I haven't been drinking it, I've gotten 18, 15, 14, and 16oz.<br /><br />(On a side note, I love the Bai drinks, and I swear they increase my pumping output http://www.amazon.com/Bai-5-Calorie-Fruit-Variety-12-Count/dp/B0088MXS6U/ref=sr_1_10?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1339675640&sr=1-10)<br /><br />I do have some teabags left, so maybe I'll take a break from it and then start drinking it again in a few weeks in hopes that it works for a short-term boost.

I ate oatmeal and noticed an increase in my milk supply to 6-7oz a day. I decided to also try Mother's Milk tea in hopes to get another increase in my milk supply but did not see a difference. I am glad I only bought 2 boxes of the tea instead of buying it in bulk even though it was cheaper.

review/summary: It Works!!!
review/text: The first time I used this stuff, it didn't work, or I just didn't produce that much milk. I stopped using it for like a week or 2, then tried it again. The second time I tried it, I felt my breast filling up within 2 hours....they even leaked. THEY NEVER LEAK, unless I go a whole day without pumping or feeding. I had fed my daughter around 6, before I came to work. I drank the tea around 830, and I was leaking around 10.<br /><br />The downside to using this (for me) is that my daughter is allergic to fenugreek. Whenever I used the pills(which didn't work), she got bumps on her neck, arms, legs, and a little bit on her eyelids. Then after I started using the tea, the same thing happened. Then I stopped using the tea, they went away. Then came back after I used it again.<br /><br />I really wish my daughter didn't get bumps from fenugreek, because this would be the perfect product for me to make more milk. I hope it works for you and your baby. But I don't like her with bumps this way.  ='-(

review/summary: great aid for nursing moms
review/text: I bought a box of this tea after I had to go back to work and my baby was refusing the few bottles of formula he had to take while I was away. I was pumping but was not getting enough milk, with my first child I had tried the fenugreek and it worked but this time around I didn't want to be having to take pills all day.  I saw this at the Walmart while I was out one day I picked up a box and I want to say that within two days of drinking it three times a day I had more than enough milk.  The taste does not bother me and I enjoy drinking tea if this is a hassle for you maybe the fenugreek is a better option.  I plan to keep drinking it as long as I nurse that way I can keep baby exclusively on breast milk for a few more months. I do think that other things along with the tea help like nursing and pumping more often so its not a miracle worker on its own but I do recommend it for anyone who is looking for something to give their supply a little bump.

review/text: This product did not work for me. However, I am not certain that I was using it as intended so this may be why (but I doubt it). I started using it when my baby was about 7 weeks old to try and increase the amount of milk I was producing in a day. I was only getting about 15oz so I was trying to see if this would help my production. I am unclear as to whether this tea is intended to help the milk come in the days after delivering exclusively, or whether it is also supposed to help increase supply in the weeks after. Either way I know a couple of people who said it worked for them but it did not work for me.

I have been sweetening it with some sugar currently but intend to try honey as recommended on the box.

review/text: I was recommended this product from my midwife.  I don't really like the taste but I have to say it does have a calming effect on me whilst I'm drinking it.  As far as helping with the production of breastmilk, I'm not really too sure.  I always have enough for my son (he's 9 weeks) and the Dr. says he's growing fine.  Maybe it has something to do with making me less stressful when I'm drinking it which in turn makes my milk come in more?  Either way it's a good product to have around when you are breastfeeding.

The black licorice flavor was so overpowering  that I wasn't really able to distinguish or really even taste any of the other herbs/ingredients.  Have to give this 1 star (my first bad rating here on amazon) there has got to be a way to get the ingredients needed for "healthy milk production" without such a horrid taste.  Also, I BELIEVE the box said to let it sit for 10 minutes (rather lengthy time period) and to have at least 3 cups per day.  That's torture with the way this stuff tastes!

review/text: The product helps increase the milk supply. I only take two cups daily. A friend said it would work more effectively if I also pump every few hours but I cannot put the baby down or she will cry so I have to just rely on the tea.

review/summary: Works but Nasty Taste
review/text: I believe it works as recommended by my midwife. Fenugreek and Fennel seeds are known to aid lactation.<br /><br />Also try the leaves of the HORSERADISH TREE. For poor countries in Asia, this is one of the fave ingredients. I got my tree from an online website from Florida. If you live in a warm region, I highly recommend this. You can get it frozen in some Asian groceries.<br /><br />Fenugreek and Fennel seeds are alright, but it taste weird. I bought the tea but I decided to make my own. You can go and buy the seeds online or to your local Indian grocery store.<br /><br />But I think I'll stick with the the horseradish tree leaves. I highly highly recommend this plant. Do your research on books and on the internet. I add it to my soup and dishes or salad.

review/summary: helps but not enough for me
review/text: Mother's milk tea works exceptionally well for some women (friends of mine).  For me, it doubled my milk supply which went from 1.5 oz a day (yes, you read that right) to 3 oz a day at its best.  I could tell the difference when I didn't drink the tea but the tea alone is not sufficient to boosting milk supply to what is required and typical of a nursing mother.  So, I had to supplement with formula for sure!  the tea tastes good though and I kind of miss it as I discontinued breast feeding (due to lack of milk supply even with the tea at this point).

The Fenugreek worked awesome within about 48 hours but you have to take 3 pills 3 times a day.  Blessed Thistle goes will with Fenugreek too but I felt like I smelled like a vegetable.  WEIRD???

It's nasty. Maybe this will work since I don't like drinking it. I'll try it until the box is gone, 3x a day. Ahhhhh, the misery, but I'll get through it.

review/summary: My Baby Didn't Take to It
review/text: I picked this up from my local left-wing health food store thinking I was saving a bundle over my baby's usual brand of formula. Upon following directions, I thought the yellowy-brown liquid looked more like a sick mother than healthy breastmilk! This stuff doesn't resemble anything close to milk for a baby. I give it two stars because my kid quit crying when the teapot whistled. A few moments of respite from colicky screechings is priceless, but I wouldn't recommend Mother's Milk as a substitute for breast milk, which as we know, is best.

review/text: I have a De Longhi machine that is "ESE" capable so I thought I would see if the pods were any good. The cleanup/setup part is great - run a little water through, place pod inside, go. Cleanup is even better - just throw the pod out. However the taste is bitter and tastes like filter coffee not espresso (no crema, etc). At which point, I'd just make a cup of regular filter coffee. So if you want to turn your espresso maker into the occasional K-cup machine great, but if you want "easy" espresso tasting coffee this is not it.

review/text: I use these with my Handpresso portable espresso pump, which requires pods.  They work quite well for my needs.  I would go as far as recommending for people with convetional espresso makers who don't like dealing with the mess of coffee grounds all over the counter.<br /><br />I've been drinking these for years at various restaurants, museums, and delis where they only sporadically make coffee (no coffee specialist).  While properly ground fresh coffee and a good espresso pump are the way to go, the Illy pods are far better than what a lot of folks, and most restaurants are able to do on their own, with poorly tamped, watery espressos.

I tried soaking them in water and then soaking them in some Jack Daniels and drying them out in the oven.  Now they taste ok and have way less MSG but I still miss the old formula!

review/summary: High Qulaity Seeds, Sweet Bourbon flavor
review/text: My work mates and I have been snacking on these seeds for three months now. We're happy to see they finally made it onto Amazon. There are two things going for these seeds: the quality of the seeds themselves and the interesting Bourbon flavor.<br /><br />As opposed to an other non-premium brand sunflower seed, these seeds are far larger and thus "meatier". The seed inside is a satisfying size and the shells seem more moist and thus do not split into an unmanageable number of shards when split. The quality is on par with the "Spitz" brand from Canada for seed connoisseurs.<br /><br />The flavor of these seeds is also interesting. Rather than deriving most of their flavor from salt, soaking the seeds in bourbon gives them a slight, pleasant sugary flavor which is then complimented by your traditional salty or spicy flavors. The sweet taste is unnoticeable at first but can be perceived with prompting. The main benefit is that the seeds are less salty than competitors and thus more can be consumed without getting a case of "dry tongue".<br /><br />All in all, a great product and a great addition to the Amazon grocery catalog. The price is right as well.<br /><br />Out of the three Jim Beam flavors, I think this oneis the best. Hence the 5 star rating for this flavor and 4 star rating for the others.

review/text: I started buying these BBQ seeds about 5 years ago.  I normally eat about a bag a day during the work week, so I love these seeds, actually loved these seeds.  Within the past 6 months Jim Beam teamed up Bigs to roast these seeds and these have certainly taken a turn for the worse.  The taste is just not the same and the seeds are twice as salty as they used to be.  Unfortunately this change has made this long time buyer seek another product.

review/text: I could be wrong but it seems like these used to be better. After reading reviews I think something went down in quality once BIGS took over production but with that said, these are still good sunflower seeds and addicting. There was an abundance of seeds that looked like they were smashed together or had gotten a ton of whatever the seasoning was glued onto them in a glob but at least 90% of each package was the normal single seed, non-misformed kind. All in all these are worth buying if you like sunflower seeds but if you have had them before BIGS was outsourced to produce them you may be a little disappointed as I was as they went from great to good.

review/text: Even after reading several reviews about this product being terrible after Bigs took over, I took a change and ordered a 12 pack. I opened up a bag as soon and I got it and was satisfied.<br /><br />The first time I had these was a while ago and I didn't like them, they tasted funny compared to other brands. But, the next time I tried them I was hooked and these are the familiar taste I enjoy. It could be that I didn't start eating seeds until a few years ago, and never experienced the "extra" flavor, but these seeds have plenty of flavor to me. I will say though, the flavor last just as long as other seeds, or maybe a little longer. Also, these are the only seeds where the flavor gets better, rather than old, the more you eat!<br /><br />I would recommend this, to people who love BBQ sunflower seeds.<br /><br />I went through a bag in 3 days, so if I keep this up I'll need another case in a month :)
