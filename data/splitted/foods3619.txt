review/summary: great for every thing
review/text: I've purchased several different seasoning salts over the years and this one is a keeper.I've purchased Lawry's, season all, different store brands and nothing could replace my Lawry's until I tried this.To me the difference between this seasoning salt and Lawry's is Sylvia's is a little warmer on the tongue, not hot.Like that warm cumin or chili flavor.It's not too salty either. I mean some seasoning salts are so salty you can't taste the other flavors.If you can also try her lemon pepper seasoning it is terrific on fish and grilled chicken.

review/summary: Good if you need gluten-free
review/text: While on a wheat-free trial diet for a month, I needed wheat pasta substitutes, and one kind of pasta I tried was this one from De Boles.<br /><br />This is my favorite shape of pasta.  This variety cooks up pretty fast, 5-7 minutes and it's great.  Because of the starch in the rice, it will boil over fast if you don't watch it!  You also need to rinse it with cold water after draining.  When this is done, it does not stick or clump up together.  It also doesn't turn hard or gummy.<br /><br />It does taste different than standard wheat pasta.  It has a brown rice flavor, and while it's not my favorite flavor in the world, it's tolerable.  I don't plan to buy this now that I'm back on wheat, but if you cannot have wheat or gluten, then it's a decent pasta.<br /><br />We had this brown rice pasta for mac -n cheese and for tuna noodle casserole.  In both you could taste the noodles' brown rice flavor, but the other flavors overpowered enough to compensate and the pasta didn't ruin the meal.<br /><br />Kids may find it disgusting, depending on how picky they are.<br /><br />I did not try this pasta with cold pasta salad, but it may not be half bad.

review/summary: A very good rub for ribs
review/text: Sylvia's Restaurant in NYC is considered by many transplants to be the best place to grab real Southern-style chow in the city. I used to eat there when I lived in New York and I can tell you the meals she serves are pretty darned good. That's why I ordered this rub, mainly to use on the spare ribs and pork shoulders I smoke in my backyard.<br /><br />This is a very good base rub. It has more of a kick than other rubs I've tried, which I like. It isn't blazing hot or anything, but the paprika and the mustard add a nice tang. The flavor is balanced but bold. It isn't a delicately-flavored spice mix, which, again, I think of as a good thing; BBQ should provide a little kick, and this rub does. You can control that zing by 1) how much rub you use (I add a lot), 2) how long you let the meat marinate with the rub (I go overnight with it) and 3) how many additional ingredients you add to the mix (I add a few).<br /><br />I call this a base rub because I think adding a few things to your spice mix is a good thing. Me, I usually add to this rub some additional brown sugar and some Italian spice mix before applying to the meat. If I want something a little different, I'll add a bit of nutmeg or maybe some ground celery seed, which is something you'll find in BBQ rubs and sauces at places like Kansas City's Gates' Restaurants or the many Famous Dave's scattered throughout the Midwest. With BBQ, personalization is always a good thing. But don't feel you have to go crazy if you want to keep things simple; this rub is satisfying as is, straight out of the shaker.<br /><br />I bought the pack of 12 because 1) the price is excellent (most competing rubs with this kind of flavor usually sell for at least twice the price) and 2) you'll likely use up the rub more quickly than you think. For every two racks of ribs I cook, for instance, I end up using at least two-thirds of a 5.5-ounce container. Since I cook ribs and pork shoulder pretty often, I run through this stuff fairly quickly, especially during the summer.<br /><br />If you like to use rub on steak or chicken, you'll tear through your supply more quickly. If you don't use it as frequently as I do, you won't have much of a problem: Just store your rub someplace cool and dark and it'll keep a long time.<br /><br />I've used a number of store-bought rubs over the years, including those from Arthur Bryant's and the aforementioned Famous Dave's (which are also very good, by the way). I can honestly say Sylvia's is one of my favorites -- not just because of the taste, but because of the bang you get for your buck.<br /><br />By the way, here's a little trivia. Years ago, before I moved to NYC, I read an interview with Sylvia in Molly O'Neill's "New York Cookbook" where Sylvia said she doesn't smoke her pork ribs but just slow cooks them in an oven, using rub to add the BBQ-ey flavor. Not using smoke gets a lot of 'cue stalwarts riled up, but that's just the way her family had always fixed ribs and that's how she still fixes them today. And they're excellent. So if you catch grief from some food snob for cooking your ribs indoors without smoke, don't fret: Sylvia has your back.

review/text: I prefer shelled pistachios, & these actually taste like pistachios (unlike the over-salted Sunkist brand shelled pistachios I'd been getting at the local Wal Mart). When Wal Mart ran out of them, I decided to try ordering them online & am glad I did. These pistachios are lightly salted & not quite as crunchy as Sunkist brand (which is fine with me; they taste great & are easier on my teeth). I plan to continue purchasing shelled pistachios from Keenan Farms (through Amazon.com).

review/summary: Calorie packed, which is exactly what I wanted.
review/text: Pistachios taste great, you probably agree if you're reading this.  The other good thing about them, for me at least, is that they are full of calories.  While a lot of these calories come from fat, they are good fats (poly/mono-unsaturated. They are also good source of protein.  I, personally, am trying to gain weight. I take many protein shake type supplements, and these are a great snack to augment in for extra calories throughout the day.  They taste fine, and boy is it nice not to have to crack the shells.  I want the convenience and taste, I'd rather not work for it if I don't have to!  4 stars because the price can be steep.  Going through at least half a bag a day will really put a dent in the wallet.  Overall, worth it if you're the casual snacker and you like pistachios and dislike the pesky shells!

review/text: These are probably the worst pistachios that I have ever eaten. They were roasted to the point of burnt, there were many that were dried up beyond recognition, and tasted bad in general. Being brown, crunchy, and nearly tasteless, you would barely know you were eating pistachios. One was so bad I actually spit it out. I ordered this because it had all five star reviews. I have to wonder how genuine they are now. I have six bags of these things. What a waste.

review/text: Well, I had one can in the 6-can box arrive with the lid off, too, but if you tap the paprika out of the grooves of the plastic cap, a few sneezes later and all is made right. Hungarian hot paprika has fantastic flavor, bearing little relationship to regular (sweet) paprika. It is perfect with chicken and all of the other uses of paprika. Good in chili, especially for those who perfer to replace cumin. Goulash! Good for grilling, with these small cans. This is very rarely available in our grocery stores, and I am glad Amazon carries it. Combined with summer savory and garlic powder, you can ease your transition to a low salt diet, when your age or blood pressure leads you down that path. Worth a try, even if you have a lid event. Besides, the small box, which you can use to store the spare cans, is packed within another far larger box. Great product.

review/summary: One of the few oils that will penetrate the hair shaft
review/text: After I started using Shakakai and Amla powder on my hair with fantastic results (you can see my reviews for them as well) I did some research on Avurvedic hair care and decided to try using oil on my hair as well.  I found studies showing that coconut and olive oil are two of the few oils that will penetrate the hair shaft so I started mixing them (50/50) to use in my hair after washing as a leave in treatment.  The result was unbelievably soft hair!!!  But even better than the way it's worked on my hair is the way it's worked on my daughters hair.  One of my girls has very curly, baby fine hair which does NOT make for a good combination when it comes to tangles.  The first time I used these oils I was able to brush through her hair with virtually no tangles!  But the best thing was the way it made my hair feel.  I have a sensory touch sensitivity... I can't tolerate feeling oil or sticky substances on my hands.  I can't even stand to pet dogs who have short, coarse fur.  So it goes without saying that I was a little concerned about putting oil in my hair!!!  But not only did it turn out super soft, it is absolutely non greasy once it absorbs into the hair and it also feels cleaner somehow.  My hair looks super shiny and healthy... I'm so amazed at the difference.  It's really done wonders!

When I first used it I wasn't sure if I was using it correctly so I youtubed a couple of girls and they had some of the same problems I did. Maybe this product isn't meant for every hair type. I am 4a/4b(?) if that helps. Anyways, I was told to get this by my stylist because he said it would help my dry coarse hair. Once he saw the adverse effects he told me to stop using it, which I had anyways. I dont' have any coconut allergies so I am just confused. I couldn't rate it very low however because the product does seem to help alot of other people, it was shipped on time, and seems to be very authentic. I can only say give it a try and see if it helps you. By the way,I switched to jojoba oil and jamician black castor oil the last few months and have seen amazing results from them. Hope this review helps someone.

review/summary: The new coconut oil
review/text: Coconut oil used to be considered "bad" for us.  Now we find out it is really good for us!  I use this oil to fry with and I use it in my chocolate delites.  I love that this brand is organic and I love that I can now safely saute again.  Thanks Amazon for providing such great products!

review/summary: Organic Coconut Oil - GREAT!!!
review/text: This coconut oil is awesome. I was worried about it being too heavy on my skin and hair, but I was wrong. When it arrived (since I purchased two 14 oz jars) one of the jars leaked from the humid Florida temperatures, but I knew it would happen. It has no smell which I love since coconut's scent can bother you after a while. I apply this oil to my body, and hair, and sometimes just a tiny amount to my face. I use a plastic spoon to take some oil out to put it on the lid to use on myself. I also recently poured some oil in a bottle with Jojoba oil, and Lavender oil which makes it great for body oil, and for the hair.<br /><br />Just after using it on my hair for one day, I felt like I didn't need to put conditioner on my hair because it's not healthy for your hair. So, I'm just using shampoo and applying the oil. My hair feels so much soft, alive, and less frizzy without knots. Even when I wake up, my hair is STILL soft. I wouldn't bother with hair care products that keep your hair soft or shiny because all you need is this or a natural/organic oil. Using this oil on my skin has lead me to stop using store-purchased lotions since it has too many chemicals and the results are only temporarily soft skin. Not only that, but I used this oil on my feet and my feet have been baby smooth soft and much less irritated since I have dry skin. Even the heels on my feet are more soft.<br /><br />Buy this oil, and you won't even think about buying baby oil, or lotions!

review/summary: Great for eczema!
review/text: I bought this after coming to my wit's end trying to find something to help my daughter's eczema.  Lotions, no matter what we tried, only soothed the itching at the most & never hydrated her skin enough to begin to heal it.  We've had to rely on Cortisone 10 for months now just to keep the inflammation manageable & her pediatrician was talking about having to prescribe something stronger.<br /><br />We've been using the coconut oil for just a few days now -- a tiny amount rubbed into the eczema affected area 4 times per day.  Finally we found something that is actually working to heal her!  The redness is now nearly completely gone, there's only one tiny spot left & it's nowhere near as red as it was before.  The inflammation is gone.  Her skin is no longer dry & chapped, even the color of her skin is beginning to come back where the Cortisone had bleached it out!

review/text: I just bought this a couple weeks back as a gift for mydad whose a health nut, I bought myself a jar too. I use a small spoonfull in a pan every morning for my scramble eggs, also to fry potatoes. No taste at all of coconut, although I'm going to try some someday that might have a hint of it as I love coconut :) I also rub a tad on my hands too while I have it out for cooking and it's lovely. I've dne a lot of research on the net of the benefits of coconut oil and they surpass most all other oils...but beware because there are a LOT of opinions out there. I love it, check it out.

review/text: I am so happy with this product.  My son can't have dairy, soy or gluten, so a margarine was always a big challenge.  This has satisfied that need perfectly.  There's no coconut taste, so he readily eats it.  (I don't know any kids who like coconut!).  That's the only use so far for us, but it seems like an ideal oil for cooking as well.

review/summary: prefer the unrefined version
review/text: I buy this at my local Kroger store in the organic section.  The refined is not a 'soft' as the unrefined product that Spectrum sales.  This version does not have a coconut taste or smell and does not rub into your skin as well as the unrefined version does.  I think I will use this small jar as hair conditioner and weekly 'grease' for my african american scalp as well as cooking.  The refined versions around will not have the coconut flavor so it's better for all purpose cooking.

review/summary: My hair looks and feels great!
review/text: I applied this coconut oil to my hair and scalp and covered with shower cap overnight. I washed my hair in the morning with 1:4 ratio baking soda and water and followed with 1:4 ratio organic apple cider vinegar and water. My hair still felt a little oily so I washed with shampoo followed by conditioner only on the bottom portion of my hair. My hair looks and feels wonderful! My primary reason for using this product was to get rid of dandruff. My hair is very oily, so I get the oily dandruff. I could wash my hair and see dandruff after my hair dries.<br />After researching I decided on this regimen of which I plan to do weekly. My scalp also feels very clean, not oily and no signs of dandruff. I read about the anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties in coconut oil for dandruff as well as the conditioning and hydrating effects. The baking soda solution cleans all the build up commercial shampoos and conditioners add to your hair. And the apple cider vinegar also helps dandruff and conditions the hair. My hair is long, coarse and thick. After this treatment, my hair feels light and soft, it's less frizzy and looks shiny black! I am so happy with the results, I have been running my fingers through my hair all day. However, I will try the virgin coconut oil next time as I am curious if it is more effective than the refined.

review/text: I love this coconut oil! I primarily use it on my hair to moisturize, but sometimes I like to take a taste and it is addicting! Don't be afraid if it gets clumpy because coconut oil tends to harden if kept in an air conditioned room (my house in about 70 degrees Fahrenheit). It moisturizes skin and hair very well and is very light...I might be moving on to Shea butter for even more moisture!

review/summary: Healthy cream not lotion...
review/text: There is few dollar of difference between refined and unrefined. I only cook with extra virgin olive oil since the mono to poly unsaturated oil is 7 compare to almond 4.1 and coconut 3.2. Applying heat to poly-unsaturated fat creates unhealthy factors compared to mono-unsaturated fats. Now, once in a while it is fine for me if the oil is becoming rancid to use as cooking oil and consume before the 6 months window before the nut oil going rancid but on regular basis it is not a good idea. There is two type of nut oil, and unlike one reviewer who puts PHD next to her name and misinforms, refined is an oil that is missing some characteristics of the nut like smell and taste and for that reason you can apply more heat to refined since it is missing certain ingredients which can burn during cooking and create unpleasant conditions. Not having smell has nothing to do with organic or conventional seed. I use coconut for my hands and feet since it is heavy like a cream and has done my hands well. Any nut oil should be Expeller-Pressed with no added additives of any sort. Any nut oil should be good enough that you can consume it raw or use it in cooking and Spectrum is the better one since it really is sold all over right next to all other cooking oils instead of health section. I like Spectrum because of the glass container.

review/summary: Truly A Terrific Product!!!
review/text: I used to purchase this at my local supermarket and loved it, but they are no longer selling it and have substituted it with the unrefined version, for external hair and skin use only. I was devastated because IMHO, it is the best product for internal use as well as external. The oil is unscented, unlike unrefined oils which do smell like coconut. There is absolutely no greasy/oily feeling or taste  when using this internally.I cannot stand the taste or feel of oil/grease in my mouth - I actually gag - but I have no reaction to this product. The oil blends instantly w/any drink, hot or cold. However, I would microwave it for @ 30secs to soften it if you do use it in cold drinks, as it can become a bit lumpy if you don't.<br />I also use exclusively this as my moisturizer for face and body. I am 54 years old and have been told that my skin looks like that of a thirty year old! I'll take that ant day!<br />The price is also incredible, because at the supermarket I was paying $10.49 for each jar. I highly recommend this product and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

review/summary: WOW!!
review/text: OK so I actually bought this at Kroger for $13.00 the cashier kind of looked at me funny and commented on how expensive it was for just one jar. Well I heard all kinds of wonderful things and being a Pinterest junkie I had seen quite a few articles for it and thought it was worth the risk, if it didn't work at least I had a nice new cooking oil for some sauteed chicken. I took home my gold in a jar and immediately tasted it....mine felt a little grainy when you touch it but melts with warmth so it tasted silky. Slight coconut scent and taste but not overpowering. I warmed it up by placing the closed jar in warm water (how it states to on the jar) and poured some into a bowl, I worked a good amount into my hair and massaged my scalp ( I have extremely dry and over processed blonde curly hair as well as very flaky scalp)I dropped some in a warm bath, slathered it on after and used around my eye area and on my lips. Basically I tried almost all body uses in one night. I slept with it in my hair and washed in the morning. This stuff is Amazing!! My hair is super shiny it even calmed the frizz!! Didn't "fix" my split and fried ends but, I didn't expect it to I gotta chop those off, it did smooth them down so they are not as noticeable. My skin is ridiculously soft although I may have used a little to much (a little goes a LONG way)and my lips even look smoother. I also put about a tablespoon into my oatmeal this morning instead of butter and it was nice a very mild hint of coconut and supposed to be better for me than butter. I can't wait to use it in cookies and when I saute my chicken and veggies. I think I may even put small amounts into old (cleaned) lip gloss pots for my 3 daughters to use this summer since they get awful chapped lips. Definitely take a chance you will be pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Too highly processed?
review/text: I have a problem with oils. I'm fine with butter or meat fats (read lard or duck fat) as long as they are not hydrogenated, but vegetable oils (including virgin olive oil) seem to really disagree with me. I'm not sure what it is about them that makes my body react the way it dose, I suspect its the chemicals and/or high heat that they use. Or it could be the rancidity as vegetable oils have a very short shelf life. I've read lots about oil and fat and I was hoping that coconut oil might be safe for me because its very stable naturally. This is one of the few brands my co-op carried that the books I read said was okay. I had as little of a taste as possible. It has no coconut flavor at all which I liked but I got very sick after trying it. So either coconut oil is a problem or this brand is too highly processed. Either way I'm a little disappointed. Perhaps I should have gone with a higher grade or a more virgin oil.

review/summary: Love this candy Bar. High in K+ too.
review/text: The nuts and raisens make this a high Potassium candy bar actually good for you. Really no kidding. I discovered this in 94 when I was diagnosed with low K+...to the extremes. I was in this super crave anything with K+ from Bananas which everyone knows and avacodo's to these little morsels. At the time they had come out in a trick or treat snack size or about 1/4 the size of this candy bar today. I was scarfing them. I hadn't been diagnosed yet. Once that happened my own instincts and natural cravings made more sense...I was looking at the ingredients to this candy bar at the time because I'd had sucn intense cravings for the Chunky and back then they actually listed the K+ levels....per full size bar at over 300 mg. That certainly explained it. Since I've never denied my cravings for it though my K levels are back to normal. Today they no longer list K levels.....but why not Chunky? You should reconsider....nothing wrong with promotion of some good stuff along with this product. K+ is good for people after excercise and hard work. Of course it's the raisens and peanuts that are the big contributors. This isn't over the top but who wouldn't rather take a nibble of a yummy candy bar that's good for you instead of a vitamen pill that's questionable and lacks the raisens and nuts. I wish they would bring back the orginal flavors they had in the early 70's too. I think one was cashew.....oh yeah! Good stuff. Amazon's distributors come to our rescue as no longer carried up here in super small town USA...thanks everyone for that. Watch the prices go up and down on all of these bars through out the year. I've bought the BIG sized bars too as it all depends on the price per ounce. I buy before the heat of the summer and have not had any problems with melted bars so far. All have been fresh too. A good candy bar that's actually got some good for you properties.

review/summary: The secret to bread machine bread
review/text: I am new to making bread.  I inherited a 10-year old, hardly used bread machine and have worked to find a good whole wheat bread recipe.  I usually don't like bread maker bread, but I put forth the effort because I like to know what goes in my food. Using the gluten really made the bread much more like the sandwich bread that my kids are used to. This gluten is the only kind I've tried so far and had no problems with it --but I did buy this at my local grocery store.  I use one tablespoon or so per cup of whole wheat flour

review/summary: My own seitan ranch
review/text: This product is an essential part of the vegetarian culinary repertoire.  Homemade seitan costs a fraction of the packaged variety, and a scoop of vital gluten makes for a well-risen loaf of bread.  Unfortunately, vital gluten has become difficult to find, thanks to the no-gluten craze.  Amazon has saved the day here.

review/summary: Great for making bread!
review/text: An excellent product that does exactly what it's supposed to do: it makes light, fluffy, chewy bread. I'm very happy with the product.<br /><br />A note, however, if you have any questions about Arrowhead Mills' products, don't bother emailing. I went back and forth with their customer service department trying to get some info on this (regarding allergens and labeling) before I bought it. It was like pulling teeth. And the info I received ended up being wrong. It was inconsistent with the labeling I saw on the Arrowhead Mills flours I saw at the grocery store. So I ended up calling.<br /><br />The woman who worked the customer service phones was very helpful, friendly and gave  me accurate information. I'm glad I called. This vital wheat gluten is great.<br /><br />Just don't waste your time emailing them.<br /><br />(And the gluten is labeled as having wheat as the only allergen, with no cross contamination issues, for those who need to know that.)

review/summary: fresh and flavorful
review/text: I use a lot of this stuff for making seitan, since my husband and I are vegan.  I wasn't happy with the Hodgson Mills version when I tried it a few years ago because it went rancid in the UNOPENED box so quickly (perhaps other people use it up faster than I do, or they don't buy it in such a large amount at a time).  This stuff keeps well in its unopened box, as long as I refrigerate or freeze it.  It also has a good flavor, and makes a nice tender chewy seitan if you use a pressure cooker.

review/summary: Great company, not so good tasting bar.
review/text: Although I purchased the mixed nut flavor of these bars, there was no detectible mixed nuts anywhere. In one bar, I got maybe a quarter of an almond or cashew. That was it! I was quite disappointed by this. The entire bar was just sesame seeds and flax seeds. That is fine if I ordered the original flavor, but I didn't. I am impressed by the company in general, and the fact that these bars are gluten free, soy free, and dairy free, but also have decent amount of protein. The flavor is a little odd, somewhat sweet, but basically like raw sesame seeds with some syrup on them. No nut flavors because the "mixed nuts" were missing. I will finish the box I purchased but I will not re-order unless the company decides to actually put some nuts in these bars. Good effort though, so therefore they did get 3 stars.

review/summary: Rice Krispy treats!
review/text: I use the Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme to make Rice Krispy treats.  I used to buy actual marshmallows, but I wouldn't get around to making the treats, and the marshmallows would go stale (blegh).  No such problem with the Marshmallow Creme, as it is in a jar and more shelf stable than marshmallows, I feel.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any difference between using the Creme and marshmallows for the rice treats, although, the same evening I made the treats, the treats didn't hold together so well when I cut a square out of the pan to try them.  The treats fell apart when I picked them up.  The next day, the treats had "set", and held together perfectly.  So, the Marshmallow Creme treats were better the next day, and tasted awesome, like I remember Mom making when I was a kid.  Also, the Creme melts more easily than marshmallows do in the pan on the stove when melting & mixing with the butter.<br /><br />I like that amazon carries the 7 ounce size jar that I need for making Rice Krispy treats.... my local grocery only carries the larger jar, and I have to eyeball it to try and use half the large jar for the treats.  7oz jar is handy!

Much more convenient to have bulk items delivered to my home than having to carry many bags home from the store.

review/text: What can I say? I'm a sucker for anything marshmallow & this is included in that love. Maybe it came from an early appreciation for toasted marshmallows, but in any case I'm always looking for something tasty & marshmallow-ly for a dessert item.<br /><br />This marshmallow creme is pretty smooth. It comes out of the jar fairly easily and is easy to spread. (Some brands can be a little... difficult to get out of the jar & spread.) It's not as thick as other brands go, so I'm assuming that's what makes it so easy to spread. My only complaint is that it is a little sweeter than what I usually like, but not so overly sweet that I'd avoid it.<br /><br />This stuff is great on just about anything dessert related, but I'd use it sparingly unless you have either a huge sweet tooth or a stomach that isn't prone to upsets.

review/summary: Truly a super snack
review/text: These little things are shaped like balls -- of which there are six in the package -- and, with their light coconut coating and goji pieces, are reminiscent of a chewy macaroon. The cocoa chocolate-ness is good but doesn't smack you over the head (meaning it's not a candy bar), and the tiny hint of spice offers just the right little zing to make these satisfying. The ORAC (antioxidant activity) in this item, in total, is sky-high -- much higher than blueberries, etc. -- so I'm delighted to eat them and give them to my family. The order from Amazon arrived as three of these yellow bags in one plastic shrink-wrap-like bag. They are much less expensive on Amazon than in a specialty health store, where I have seen them for $11 a bag. Organic, raw, vegan, gluten-, wheat-, dairy-, corn-, rice-, and soy-free, a charitable company, AND biodegradable yet plastic-like packaging? This is a super environmental/health investment disguised as a treat.

review/text: Superfood Snacks are addictive. Handcrafted in Hawaii with a mandala on the bag, they're delicious. They're like those no-bake peanut butter cookies you make at summer camp as a kid. They're an intriguing blend of raw cacao, agave syrup, maca, goji berries and Himalayan salt. It's kind of hypocritical for the locavore "think global, act local" types to have raw vegan foods made from Caribbean cacao, Tibetan goji berries, salt from the Himalayas, and maca from Latin America. Enjoy these candies for what they are--a diverse blend of delicious goodness. It's multiculturalism in a bag.<br /><br />It's too bad that there are only 6 balls per bag. It would be great if one could have a pound's worth--like See's. Delicious, nutritious, and exotic! Enjoy dessert in the raw!

review/summary: good stuff!
review/text: This is my favorite sauce when I'm in the mood for heat and flavor.  Its heat is on par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a> and similar sauces, but I like the flavor more.  It is very economical since it only takes a couple of drops to make something hotter than it would be if you emptied a whole bottle of grocery store hot sauce on it.  If you want something really hot but still flavorful, this is it.  I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG55M">Blairs After Death</a> (not as hot but has nice flavor) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033P2RN2">Satan's Blood</a> (great if you want a ridiculous amount of heat without affecting a dish's flavor).  This sauce lies somewhere inbetween, ... a seriously respectable amount of heat accompanied by flavor I really like.

review/summary: Versatile Rub
review/text: If you have not had the pleasure of trying this rub I highly encourage you to take the leap!<br /><br />Initially I was hesitant to try a 'Pecan' Rub because I had no idea of the flavor it would add to the meat.  I tried ribs first and the subtle flavor really enhances any sauce or plain ribs.  It goes well with chicken, but is outstanding on burgers where even a generous helping does not cause overseasoning.  Great rub!

review/text: Kind of disappointing.  LOVE huckleberries, and it was hard to find the huckleberries in this, the chocolate prevailed, and the chocolate wasnt very good
