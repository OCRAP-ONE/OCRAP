review/summary: Newman's Own Bold Organic K-Cup
review/text: This is makes a great cup of coffee.  I buy both Newman's and Emirl's Bold coffees (caffinated).  What I have found is that Emirl's is more like Starbucks having both a bold coffee taste and a distinctive somewhat burnt aftertaste.  Newman's doesn't have the burnt aftertaste so evident in Emirl's so I like that quite a bit.  What I have tended to do is alternate between the two coffees.  When I really want both the boldness and the aftertaste I choose Emirl's and when I want to tone it down a bit I use the Newman's.  Both are excellent coffees and get me started in the morning. I don't think I would choose one over the other at this point because they each give me what I am looking for on different days.  I also use a 16 oz mug and blend 13 oz of coffee using one K-cup which I use twice; once with the 8 oz setting and then again with theh 5 oz setting.

review/summary: 5 stars for flavor, brand, & organics
review/text: I bought the coffee maker for my mother for Xmas and it came with many different K cups.  By far, she prefers Newman's Own coffees.  Now, my Mom used to live and breathe coffee and to me, her coffee resembled mud - it was so strong.  She has mellowed in the ensuing years but still prefers a bold (strong) flavor and after trying numerous other brands (Timothy's, Green Mountain, etc) the standout is Newman's.  Recommend for coffee drinkers who like strong/bold flavor.

Don't eat chinese chicken and don't feed it to your loved ones.<br /><br />So in the end its a good price for what it is and dogs love it... But its not safe. Two stars.

review/summary: Best zero calorie zero carb sweetener!!!
review/text: I live in Northern Florida and work at a BBQ joint, so if you know anything about the south, you know that nine out of ten times people will choose sweet tea as drink of choice any time of day. Since I try to avoid conventional sugar at all costs, I was really missing my sweet tea. Now, I can brew plain, organic tea, add my squeeze of lemon and several drops of stevia and it tastes just like the real thing...but better since I know I'm not adding any toxins into my body! It DID take me a while to get used to the "artificial" taste of stevia, but now I can't do without it. It is the only sweetener in my house, besides raw honey. I keep several different flavors on hand, but the plain is definitely the most versatile. Wonderful product and I will definitely keep buying it.<br /> Also, this company presses straight from the stevia leaves. It isn't reconstituted!!! MAJOR plus!!!

review/summary: Stevita Stevia is great!
review/text: Stevita Stevia is the least expensive brand I have found. As a vegetarian it suits my needs and seems to be the healthiest alternative.<br />Splenda and Nutrasweet have caused me skin itchiness (allergic response from years of usage) and white sugar is ground with animal bones to produce it's white color (not good for vegetarians).<br />The liquid form of Stevita is a stronger concentration than the powder and therefore lasts longer.

I would certainly recommend to those who want a healthy alternative to sugar and other sweetening products.

review/text: I love the convenience of the little bottle. It's easy to take in your purse if needed. I've used this instead of Splenda/sugar in foods. It was good in homemade spaghetti sauce, and I mix it in the plain yogurt with strawberries that I run through the food processor for breakfast. No aftertaste in those things. I haven't tried it in anything else yet.<br /><br />It loses a star because it doesn't work in coffee. I have to add much more than I do in my yogurt, and it's bitter. I was hoping a couple more drops would make it sweeter, but it only got more bitter. I guess the search is still on for a stevia product that tastes good with coffee!

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: So far, I have not been real happy with this Stevia.  I have been using NuNaturals NuStevia powder for a couple of years, but thought I would try a liquid.  So far, I find that I have to use a LOT more of this liquid than expected.  I find that if I use 2 packets of powder, I have to use 1 tsp of this liquid, and it doesn't really sweeten as well.  Not only that, but I can definitely taste something other than sweetness.  I am wondering if it is the grapefruit seed extract that is used for a preservative.  I find this to be much more bitter than the powder, and I haven't really figured out the dosage I need to use yet, though I have been trying to get it right.  I didn't have so much trouble with the powder, so I am disappointed.<br /><br />I purchased three bottles, so when I have used this up, I am going to try another brand, I just don't know which one will give me the sweetness with the recommended dose.  There is no way that 1 tsp equals 1 cup of sugar, as stated in several conversion charts!  I seem to have to add some Agave syrup to counteract the bitterness and non-sweetness of this product, and I am trying to get away from doing this.<br /><br />One thing I have discovered is that items made with this liquid stevia seem to get sweeter after setting for a while.  I guess it is a matter of making everything a couple of hours ahead of when it will be consumed, but that is a pain in itself.

Drop the Toffee flavored on apples and bake.  Go to town. Have all the sweet you want and it's good for you.  The key is moderation. A little drop goes a long way.

review/text: Although I have used and enjoyed several stevia products, this one was a complete failure on my taste buds. It didn't just not sweeten my drinks, it left an active bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />When reading any stevia product review, remember that people "taste" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. In addition, I noticed that some stevia products were both flavorful and sweet, while others tasted (to me) like there was no sweetener in it.

review/summary: It's the truth!
review/text: "The World's Best" is usually just an empty marketing slogan, but it this case it's the truth. I've seasoned chicken in countless ways in about 25 years of cooking. Chicken has long been my favorite food and this is my favorite way of seasoning it. My favorite ways to use it are 1) rinse and pat dry a roaster and coat lightly but thoroughly with Szeged rub then cook as you usually would, and 2) Use a coffee grinder (one that's used only for grinding spices!) or a mortar and pestle to powder a tablespoon of Szeged rub. Then mix the powder with 2-3 tablespoons of flour and coat a pound or so of white meat chicken strips with the seasoned flour. Dip them in egg wash and then coat with crumbs (panko are my favorite crumbs). Pan fry them on medium heat in enough oil to brown the breading on both sides.<br /><br />My mouth is watering just sitting at the keyboard.

review/summary: a little advance prep goes a long way
review/text: This rub is absolutely fantastic. Follow the directions on the tin, using olive oil and lemon juice, but make the mixture a day in advance, and let it sit in the refrigerator in a sealed container overnight. This allows the spices, particularly the garlic, to rehydrate. Instead of a thin liquid, which tends to run off the chicken, you'll have a thick paste which will stay put, filled with big savory chunks of garlic. It's not even necessary to rub it under the skin. I don't know of any easier way to prepare great roast chicken. Believe me, people will want your recipe.

review/summary: Savory sure-fire chicken spice mix!
review/text: I'm an avid cook and enjoy trying commercial and homemade spice mixes.  Like most people, I'm familiar with the 'Pride of Szeged' brand from their bright red tins of zingy-tasting Hungarian Paprika.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I found out that Szeged also makes lines of Chicken, Fish, Beef, Rib et al spices!  For some reason they are rather hard to find but they are worth the search.<br /><br />The predominant notes in the spice are garlic and basil, with a pepper finish.  (Salt is only the third ingredient here, a rarity in many spice mixes.) This gives your bird a wonderfully herbal scent and taste that is heavenly when roasted or baked.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers here in that:<br /><br />a) Due to the large size of the basil flakes, it's best to spoon out some of the spice and crush it a little (you can use a dish and the back of a spoon, though a mortar and pestel are best).<br /><br />b) While excellent shaken on, it's best mixed with lemon juice, a little butter or olive oil, and then left to sit on the meat for a couple hours.  However, even straight-on, it's very good.<br /><br />This spice is in my top three chicken spice mixes, and probably at the top if you're roasting a whole bird.  The other two excellent choices are:<br /><br />1) Prudhomme's Chicken Spice from: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDBPL">Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Magic 4-Pack, Qty. 4 2-Ounce Bottles</a><br /><br />2) The Chicken Spice from Seattle's Rub with Love: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Rub with Love Chicken Rub</a>

review/summary: Amazing rotisserie chciken!!!
review/text: I first purchased this at Big Lots, skeptical that it would be any good but it was cheap so I thought why not. I used the easy recipe printed on the container (lemon juice, seasoning and butter) and cooked the chicken on our rotisserie. It was AWESOME! I quickly used up the rub and was saddened that I couldn't buy more of it anywhwere. So happy that I can get it on-line. You've got to try it - you will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Love this chicken rub!
review/text: My husband picked this up one year when we were away for Thanksgiving and I needed poultry rub for the turkey and had left it at home.  I have no clue where he bought it, but it is the BEST chicken rub I have ever used.  I have used it on my turkeys and in my stuffing and it adds a great flavor!  I am thrilled that it is carried on Amazon.com even though as of now I don't see it as a "prime" item.  If you are trying to decide on the perfect chicken rub, this one is definitely worth it and one tin lasts a long time.  I think I will try the steak rub next.

review/summary: A Tasty Snack That Leaves You Satisfied...
review/text: Combos come in a variety of flavors, cheddar, pizza, Jalapeno, etc.  They also can come as a cracker or as a pretzel.  The Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL blend is a tasty snack that leaves you satisfied.  I am no stranger to combos, my favorite happens to be the Nacho flavor.<br /><br />When it comes to flavor the Cheddar Cheese Pretzel combos are flavorful, and don't have an over salted-aftertaste you sometimes find with salty snack foods.  They do come off rather plain however, and the pretzel is a little overpowering.  Compared to the Cheddar Cheese CRACKER version, the Pretzel combination is the weaker of the two.  The cheddar cheese blend also lacks that a slight sharpness and has more of a Cheese-Wiz taste.  Nothing terribly wrong with that but it just feels like the weaker of the bunch.  The pretzel portion was crispy and fresh, having that pretzel-nugget taste to it.  Just the right amount of thickness and saltiness.<br /><br />OVERALL I'd say the Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL combo is  4 stars.  The product makes for a very tasty snack, and will satisfy your cravings for both pretzels and cheese, but falls short of some of their other combinations.  I personally feel the Cheddar/Cracker version is the better of the two when it comes to "Cheddar Cheese" flavor(The pretzel portion overpowers the cheddar).  Still, if you got a craving for pretzels and cheese this snack will certainly hit the spot.

review/summary: Cheddar Cheese Pretzels Are Good !
review/text: I find this snack to be delicious and filling. It has the right amount of salt I am looking for. I bring a bag to work and it lasts two+ weeks to fill the gap between a small breakfast sandwich and lunch. If you like pretzels and cheese this is a no brainer. I found the cheddar cheese/cracker to be blah. Of all the Combo combinations I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. Other flavors like pizza overpowered the snack in my opinion. Stick with this one unless you love the other flavors. In any case, try them all in small portions and I'll bet you come back to this cc/pretzel combo. It's good!

review/text: My first ever negative review:<br />I was excited to get this Jerky expecting it to be like the Jerky I used to buy at the corner store when I was a kid. I gave two bags to each of my sons and took the rest to work with me that night.<br />When The first thing I noticed when I opened a bag was a greasy smell and when I reached inside it felt like the jerky and bag were covered in a layer of Crisco.  I could have guessed the taste; it was like jerky covered in a thin coating of Crisco. On the other hand the texture was not bad chewy but not tough.<br /> After scrubbing the layer of grease off my hands I decided to make the best of the situation and used the rest as Dog treats. I have to say the Dogs just loved this stuff!

review/summary: Simply the best pretzel
review/text: These are without a doubt the best pretzel out there.  They have a unique crunchy fresh flavor that no other pretzel has, without the artificial aftertaste and stale texture found in the golden pretzels.  People I share them with ask me why they are so dark in color.  I don't know, maybe double malted or baked, but they always want to know where they can get them.  When I lived in Cincinnati, they were pretty easy to find.  Now that I live in Southern Alabama, Amazon is my supplier.  Low in fat and sugars, these are a perfect example of a pure pretzel.

review/summary: Different
review/text: These pretzels are different than any I have had before.  They are very thick and hard and have a taste that reminds me of a "whole wheat" product.  They also are light on the salt.  I realize they are "Homestyle" but I wasn't expecting what I got.  they aren't bad, just different.  They don't taste like the thin pretzels you see most often in bags.  They aren't like the big pretzels you get at the Pretzel shops or carts.  They have a unique taste, not like any I have tasted on a pretzel before.  My family has mixed opinions about whether they like them or not, but they went quickly at the football game watching party they were bought for - so they seem to go good with beer.  My suggestion would be that you definitely try a bag before buying a case.

review/summary: Best Yeast - Bar None - That I've Ever Used.
review/text: I discovered Hodgson Mill's yeast several years ago. Finding this great yeast transformed me from a perplexed wanna-be-bread-baker with lousy results - to having total confidence to trying almost any bread recipe and getting very good to great results.<br /><br />I don't know if these packets contain a larger quantity of yeast than other yeast packets - I've never measured to compare. However, I do know my breads raise better, for longer periods of time without the yeast quitting on me, and my breads have excellent oven spring (the extra burst of height your bread gets in the first five minutes in a hot oven) with this yeast.<br /><br />My specialty has been my recipe for oatmeal bread - each loaf has a full cup of oatmeal, plus 2-1/3 cups of bread flour. With the oatmeal portion being so large, it needs the extra oomph of a good strong yeast like this. It says on the packet that it is good for whole grain breads - and they're right.<br /><br />When I try Redstar or Fleischmann's (sp) yeasts, my bread never reaches the same height, nor has as good of flavor, as when I use Hodgson' Mills yeast.<br /><br />Not only for whole grain type breads! I use it for white sandwich loafs, and english muffin breads, too - and they raise beautifully and bake out perfectly.<br /><br />I've used it for hand made breads that I knead myself; for no knead batter breads; and for breads made in my friend's automatic bread machine.<br /><br />If you struggle with yeast baking, try this yeast. It made a huge difference for me. (If you still have trouble, then do some research on bread making techniques and consider whether the flour you're using is up to the task - or if your tap water has additives that hinder the yeast development - every piece in the puzzle makes a difference.)<br /><br />Happy Baking!

review/text: I love this yeast.  It raises the loaf so much higher than any of the other brands I've tried.  Wasn't prepared for it so when the dough rose it lifted the plastic wrap off of the bread pan AND ran down the sides... lololol... what a mess!  But now I know to use the next size up for the pan next time.  The texture and crust of the bread came out great.... nice light,moist texture and the crust was perfect. And this is a gluten free recipe so it is particularly amazing. Definitely a keeper!

review/summary: The best tea for your teapot
review/text: On the Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold tea box it reads, "The Best Tea for Your Teapot."  It is.  And furthermore, since 1990 Taylors have planted over two million trees around the world, winning the Queen's coveted Award for Enterprise for Sustainable Development."  But most of all, their tea, blended for three generations for their family Bettys Tea Rooms in Yorkshire, England, does ensure that you can "always be sure of getting the best cup of tea no matter where you live."  It's all on the package, and it's all true.  Be careful to note that Yorkshire Gold and Yokshire are two different blends.

review/summary: Excellent Black Tea - Best I've Found!
review/text: Yorkshire Gold Tea is flavorful and rich - never, ever bitter, no matter how long you steep the tea.  It's great with milk and sweetener if you drink it English style.  Each tea bag is large and makes 16 ounces of tea with no reduction in flavor.  I was very grateful that Amazon carries this product - especially in a pack of 5 - because sometimes it's hard to find in the grocery stores.

review/summary: Not "just a cup of tea"
review/text: As a life long tea drinker at the age of 65 I think I have tried teas from every corner of the world with every conceivable kind of water, in every conceivable type of container from which to drink.  I can honestly say after discovering Yorkshire Gold two decades ago, I have no other tea in mind when I drink tea.  Lovely amber color, great aroma, luscious flavor.  I adore the bags without staples and strings, and because of the size of the bag (much bigger than any other tea I've encountered), I can put one bag in the pot and it does the job. I do not use the loose because I am the only tea drinker in the house, it would be a waste. Not bitter at all no matter how long you steep the tea, and I have even used what is left from the morning tea to make "iced York" for lunch, and it is still amazing.  I can't suggest a better tea to try. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />After all the American sources dried up, I found Amazon to be the best buy on the net.  I order in the 5 box quantity to save on shipping charges, and it is always on time and packaged well.

It is very well-priced, and there is the added bonus that the bags have no strings or staples so they can easily be recycled.

My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.
