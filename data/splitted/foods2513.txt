review/summary: Great Dorm Food
review/text: The Hormel Beef Tamales, In Chili Sauce make some of the best college dorm snacks and dinners.  I buy these for my son who attends college.  He looks so forward to receiving his care packages that contain these tamales.  They are fast to warm up and just eat or add your own favorite toppings to have a complete meal.  I will continue orderings these tamales for both my son and for all of us here at home.

review/summary: Satisfies my cravings
review/text: I live outside the US where it is almost impossible to find a good Mexican restaurant. I love Mexican and Tex-Mex foods. I was overcome by a craving so I ordered these, a holdover from my childhood when my tastes were less culinary. They are bland but they can be doctored up with cheese, salsa, onions, peppers and whatever else one would like. They are good to have around as filling comfort food.

review/summary: Lunch Time Special
review/text: I have been purchasing things from Amazon for a very long time.  I have never felt the need to review anything, let alone when I buy it from somewhere else.  However, I stopped in to my local Walmart today, looking for something to accompany my 6 pack of wing-dings.  After coming off of Memorial Day weekend and going to a couple of barbecues I needed a break from chili.  My coworker who accompanied me to grab lunch looked at me like I was an insane, but that did not sway me from grabbing the Tamale's and heading back to the office.  Upon first bite, it was as though a small village in Mexico had occupied my mouth during the Cinco de Mayo festival.  I was expecting very little, but the gelatinous corn meal shell and suspect "beef" stayed true to the Taco Bell taste I have grown accustomed to.  I gave this 5 stars, because in the can I got 5 Tamales and only paid $1.50.

review/summary: Canned beef tamales
review/text: I love these Hormel beef tamales. They make a quick lunch and the recipes are wonderful.  All my grandchildren and great grandchildren love them too.  My youngest great grandchild is 4 and every morning he wants a scrambled egg and a tamale, every morning like clockwork.  They are easy to send with him to the baby-sitters house and there are enough in the can for others if necessary.  Good flavor, good protein; serve with a small salad and there you have it. I could not find it in the store so ordered a case and I am very happy I did.

review/text: These canned tamales are really good in the cheese dip made with velveeta and ro-tel tomatoes. Make the cheese dip per the instructions on the package of velveeta or ro-tel, add in the tamales, a couple of shakes of Lea & Perrin's, chopped onion, chopped jalapeno (if you like it hot), chopped bell pepper, in a large slow cooker on low heat. Looks like hell but man is it tasty. :)  Serve with tortilla chips or corn chips, or even various veggies. Enjoy!

review/summary: nostalgic nosh
review/text: Let's face it: if you're looking into ordering this item, chances are that you remember eating it (or in my case, the Gebhardt clone) in your childhood. If that's the case, as far as I can tell, it's unchanged from those (again, in my case) far-off olden days, down to the alarmingly orange grease globs. How many other things from youthful memory are as you remember them? I haven't found this anywhere locally and the price of nostalgia seems reasonable to me. If you want to know about nutritional value, calories or the like, this is likely not for you, so KEEP LOOKING.

review/text: Having been raised in the Salinas valley in California, we were accustomed to Mexican food and loved it. When I moved to the NYC are in the 60's good Mexican food was hard to find, but I was able to purchase Hormel Tamales in some stores. Then moving to Ct., the tamales from Hormel were hard to find, but there on the internet they were...........I ordered 2 cases and just love them for lunch.  My Italian husband is not crazy about them. (good, more for me).....they remind me of my California days..........they have not changed in all these years !!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Knowing what to expect
review/text: When you purchase canned tomatoes, you do not expect to find a plump, juicy intact tomato like you would purchase in the produce aisle. So, expecting these tamales to equate to fresh or home-made tamales is just not realistic. The texture of these tamales is soft, perhaps "mushy", and more add a hint of tamale flavor rather than being what you may be thinking in terms of a traditional tamale.<br /><br />If you are like me and crave a tamale from time to time, these may provide a bit of instant gratification. But, I think it is better to be realistic in your expectations, than to be disappointed because of them.

review/summary: Hot Tamales
review/text: Hormel's Tamales are a canned, shelf-stable interpretation of Mexican cooking. They make a good, quick lunch. Convenient, delicious, but not that spicy. These canned tamales got me hooked on tamales in general- from the raw vegan ones at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556436475">I Am Grateful: Recipes and Lifestyle of Cafe Gratitude</a> to Sonoma Valley's Primavera brand fresh tamales, filled with zucchini, cheese, and butternut squash, and the Panamanian tamales at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609806440">The Whole Foods Market Cookbook: A Guide ot Natural Foods with 350 Recipes</a>. Tamales are one of the most ancient Mexican recipes; Aztecs feasted on them. They were the food of celebration. Hormel's Tamales aren't authentic, but they are delicious and filling!

review/text: I am confused by all of the positive reviews. I like tamales but am way too lazy to make them, so I tried these from a can. Maybe I like spicy food too much because I found these rather bland and didn't enjoy the sauce. I cooked them in the microwave, maybe that was my mistake. I actually ate one and threw the rest in the garbage. I am giving 2 stars because they are edible but I wouldn't call them "good" by a long shot.

I hate chunky style sauces.  In Italy, all sauces a puree style and they are great!! They are horrified when Americans have chunky sauces. They say it is not done because it has to be puree style sauce.

I had tried the other gluten free pretzels and while I did not think they were bad, they did not have the same texture as regular pretzels.  You would never know Snyders gluten free pretzels were gluten free because they taste just like regular pretzels and they have 98% the same texture as normal pretzels.  I have not been able to find them in stores so I order the 12 8oz packs off of amazon.  I highly recommend these!  My daughter has trouble eating other glten free pretzels but she will eat these!

My boyfriend ate some without knowing in advance that they were gluten-free, and when I asked him if he liked the new GF pretzels, he said he was going to eat the whole bag. The other nice thing about them is that the ingredients list what's in the baking powder too. Some baking powder contains aluminum because it's cheap, but this doesn't. So you can feel healthy about that also.

review/summary: better than "regular"!!!
review/text: I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I've tried and like Snyder's non-GF pretzels in many of the different varieties like Butter Snaps, Pumpernickle, and regular Sticks and Twists.<br /><br />Of ALL the pretzels I've tied , these are the BEST.<br /><br />They are crispy and a little harder than the regular sticks; they are a little less salty than the regular kinds as well with just a bare hint of sweetness. They taste what I'd call very homemade in a way I can't exactly put my finger on, but definitely not a run of the mill taste.<br /><br />For comparison, I've tried the Glutino GF Pretzels which are also VERY good but at generally a much higher price per bag. They are pretty much on par with quality of flavor even though the tastes are very different. The Synder's brand is definitely something special.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this brand tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a bracing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

review/text: ...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this brand once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

review/text: I don't usually chew gum, but I found out it has xylitol in it, which is good for your teeth, because it kills the hamful bacteria. I bought it for when I go on vacation for those times I cannot brush my teeth. I expected it to taste minty, but even though it has a fresh taste, it has a flavor I cannot describe, I really like it, but only occasionally, so it will last a long time. I was really busy recently, painting the outside of the house. I didn't have time for breaks, so I put three of the small pieces in my mouth and enjoyed chewing them most of the day, the fresh taste lasted a long time.

review/text: While not exceptionally strong this gum does give you a refreshing peppermint taste.  The flavor does last longer than other gums that I have tried, and is relatively consistent throughout the time you are chewing it.  It does stay fresh in the package for several months, with the foil-type wrapper keeping it fresh.  It is currently my favorite flavor of gum.<br /><br />The only complaints I have: the pieces are slightly smaller than what I find to be ideal, but they are too large to use two at a time, and the package doesn't stay closed very well in my purse.

My husband says it would be an excellent drink for summer but I drink it anytime because it's so hydrating ( no salty aftertaste either) and it's not as boring as plain water.  I'm going to order some more of this flavor and try another one too.<br />The only con I can think of is that the cans are smaller/slimmer than a typical soda pop can- so you don't get as much.  Even so, I think it's worth the price.

However, I grabbed a second can a couple days later and must say I've now grown fond of the taste, it is just SO refreshing and light.<br /><br />Too bad these are so expensive because they're a great alternative to soda's or fake sugar based soft drinks.

review/text: I ordered this cucumber sparkling water expecting it to be OK, and I was happily surprised when it exceeded those expectations. The bubbles are tinier and more delicate than some canned seltzers we buy from the grocery store, and the cucumber flavor tasted more natural and was not overpowering. I was also glad the cucumber comes from organic flavoring. Seems like a lovely spa drink. Knudsen brand has been around a long time and the quality is as good as I remembered it from 20 years ago. I bought this drink during the winter but could really picture this as a great summer drink. The can holds slightly less than some sodas, which is just the right amount for me. The slim can fits inside the fridge door conveniently without taking up shelf room. I plan to try the other flavors as well. Very nice product that I would recommend to anyone wanting to try a different style of seltzer water.

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/text: I love Muir Glen. Their fire roasted crushed tomatoes even won a taste test on America's Test Kitchen. I will say this, however. The current product description states "carbohydrates free." A 28 ounce can has about twelve 65-gram servings at 4 grams of carbs per serving (with 1 gram of fiber for 3 net carbs if you count that way). Since 65 grams of all-purpose flour will have around 48 grams of carbs and 1 gram of fiber, you can consider them low-carb, but they're not carb free.

review/summary: Online Buyer Beware!
review/text: This product is amazing...the tomatoes taste so fresh, and the fire roasted flavor adds so much!  It's a nice mild mild sauce; definitely not hot. The online price is much better than the grocery story, especially with free shipping.  That said, I have now TWICE ordered the item and TWICE received DICED, not crushed tomatoes.  Further, most of the cans were severely dented despite the Amazon box arriving in pristine condition and with inside insulation from damage.  This suggests they were packaged that way.<br /><br />I wouldn't typically put this in the product review (and my rating reflects the advertised product, not my experience), but there seems to be something with this vendor not sending the correct item.  It's not a deal if you never receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />Also for the record, Amazon customer service has been wonderful.  I just reported the second arrival of non-ordered goods, so we'll see what happens!<br />************<br /><br />Update: Within a week following the incident described above, Amazon posted a notice on this site that Amazon was looking into complaints regarding this product when shipped from Amazon.com. I just noticed that amazon.com currently no longer offers the product.  So to be perfectly clear, my purchase (wrong order and dented cans, twice) was with Prime-eligible, free shipping, amazon.com, and NOT the private vendor currently noted.  Couldn't be happier with customer service and, again, this product is amazing!

review/summary: I believe it's BPA free can now.
review/text: I purchased these during the month of June, and called the customer service line of the company to see if these are BPA free. They said the new BPA free can has copper color inside instead of the familiar white lining. I opened my first can today, and it was copper colored inside. I uploaded a picture of it on the product page. I'm so happy that they started to use BPA free cans as I love their organic canned tomatoes!

review/summary: My secret ingredient!
review/text: Muir Glen Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes are very rich and full of flavor.  Some crushed tomatoes are thin, more like a puree.  These are more chunky, but still have enough crushed tomato sauce to make them perfect.  I actually prefer these over imported Italian tomatoes.  I recently made a tomato and cheese lasagna for a dinner party and used the Muir Glen Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes just as they came from the can, without adding any seasoning.  The only other ingredients were 4 cheeses and the pasta.  It was phenomenal! Everyone raved and were very surprised when I told them how I made it. Everything I use them in turns out well.  Get them by the case :)

review/summary: Amazing flavor
review/text: Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Tomato products are exceptional. The depth of flavor makes these roasted tomatoes delicious. I use them to make my pasta sauce and just about everything else.<br />I found these (I use crushed, diced, diced w/jalapenos) over a year ago. I had to do some traveling as the store that I found them in is no longer on my usual travel route. I have since found them in a couple of other places. The pricing varied but no store had all the varities I liked.<br />The prices here good, I can stock up, and I don't have to travel. With the price of gas now that's an important factor.<br />Bottom line: Because of the great flavor (am a foodie)I would buy these Fire Roasted Tomatoes. The price and convenience are a bonus.

review/summary: Great Tomatoes
review/text: Just spoke to Muir Glen customer service (12-21-2011) and they advised that if the "Exp Date" on a can of their tomatoes is dated March 2013 or later, the inside can liner is probably going to be copper-colored, which means the liner is BPA free.  If the Exp Date is earlier than March 2013, and/or the liner is white/clear, that liner is not BPA free.  But there could be cans out there "Exp Dated" earlier than March 2013, which are also copper-colored/BPA free.  If you're buying from a retail store that does not turn over products quickly, note that Exp Date.  If it's somewhere in 2012, you may have a white-lined/BPA leaching can.  I think it must be understood that Amazon may not receive these directly from the processing plant, thus Amazon may not control which product they receive.  However, I received 12 28 oz cans MG Fire Roasted Crushed from an Amazon MidWest Dist Ctr 2-3 months ago, and all of my 12 cans had the good/copper liner.  Regarding damaged/dented cans; I suspect that if you get any cans from Amazon that are dented, they were not dented from Amazon to you.  I suspect the cans were dented from the distributor to Amazon.  Also, MG customer service told me that Muir Glen will NOT label their cans BPA Free until they are sure there are NO white-lined cans out there - could be another year or so.  When they are sure all the cans of MG products are BPA free, then they will label their products "BPA Free", as this will obviously be a very positive selling point.<br /><br />Regarding rating these tomatoes, they are surely a 5 star if anything ever was.  How could you beat organic in a safe container and great tasting?  Muir Glen is to be commended for their approach to serving their customers with intelligence, honesty, and in a manner which encourages and promotes good health.

review/text: My only previous experience with Honeybush tea was the Stash brand so I'm far from an expert on how it should taste but I didn't like the taste of this one nearly as much.  It has a really strong spiciness that I found a little overbearing when compared to the lighter, sweeter taste of the other brand.  The packaging is just a box containing a ziplock bag with small tea bags/no strings.  Won't be re-ordering this brand.

All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

Put it this way, our 3 month old drinks a whole bottle (quart size) of this formula per day, so the six bottles being sold here for $102 means you'd be paying over $400 a month for baby formula.  Outrageous.

review/text: I adore watermelon, but things flavored with it tend to be artificial and icky, nothing like the perfect juicy fruit I love. However, I trust Red Leaf to deliver on authentic, juicy flavor, and boy did they ever! Though it smells kind of like a Jolly Rancher in the bag, the tea itself tastes nothing like "watermelon" flavored candy. This watermelon matcha is perfectly fresh and it seriously tastes like matcha made with watermelon juice! The grassy, almost creamy matcha is a perfect base for the lip-smackingly tasty watermelon flavor. It's great straight, as a latte, iced, even as a smoothie with real watermelon and a splash of milk!

review/summary: Seriously delicious matcha
review/text: Sometimes I think mangos are my favourite fruit. Then I remember watermelon! Sweet, juicy watermelon - oh yes! Both of these fruits can share the spotlight - but only when they are ripe, juicy and flavourful! Why did I pick some of the messiest fruits to be my favourite?<br /><br />Luckily, the only thing that gets messy when I whip up a cup of this matcha is my cup and whisk! (...and my white shirt. That's a story for another time) But hey! Virtually mess free! At least it's not all over my face... although this matcha is delicious enough that I wouldn't mind sticking my face into a huge bowl of it. Oh yes, can you tell that I am happy with this matcha? So happy! The flavour is sweet and true watermelon flavour! I like watermelon candies, but I hate watermelon jolly ranchers (too chemically), so I was very happy that this flavour lies between a watermelon flavouring and a real watermelon. That doesn't really make sense, but I guess you'll have to take my word for it lol.<br /><br />Making this hot with a sprinkle of sugar takes it into treat territory! Seriously delicious matcha that has me drooling just thinking about it! Another great summer treat. Chopping up some watermelon to make a watermelon puree to go with this matcha (and a splash of vodka) is definitely on my to-do list.<br /><br />I prefer my watermelon fruit straight from the fridge and icy cold, so it goes without saying that my favourite way to prepare this drink is ICED. I still haven't gotten into the habit of just mixing matcha with cold water - so I mix it up double strong with 170 F water, add ice cubes and top with more water. This gives me a perfect result every time - no clumps (if I drink it right away!) and smooth as the rind of an in season watermelon. Oh yes, I went there.<br /><br />For an extra treat, I experimented with cream and tried a "watermelon and cream" dessert tea. It was delicious! Let it be known - any fruit + cream = wonder! Too bad most flavours stick to strawberries&cream or peaches&cream, because I think I'm on to something here ;)<br />This also went well with vanilla soy milk and plain almond milk! I'm not picky - I always buy almond milk when it's on sale because it's so delish, creamy, and doesn't affect my acid reflux! That's the joy of these flavoured matchas - delicious flavour minus the calories! They don't need milk and sugar to tantalize my tastebuds - even the basic matcha is smooth, grassy and even creamy!

The watermelon does not overwhelm the Matcha, which is vegetative, creamy and sweet.  It feels so rich and smooth on the palate.<br /><br />I've tried a lot of tea - a lot of Matcha, for that matter - and even quite a few flavored Matcha... this is one of the very best I've tried.

review/text: I love watermelon, and I love tea. Needless to say, I've tried just about every watermelon tea I've seen. This one blows them all out of the water. It's best made with a lower water temperature, though you'll probably be drinking it cold so it doesn't matter. A touch of cream brings out the fruit flavor even more.<br />This matcha is also amazing added to a puree of watermelon and mint. It keeps the mint from overpowering the fruit, while adding a nice green tea flavor. And if you want something unique and different, give it a try rubbed onto a slice of watermelon. There are no words to even describe how good it is!

review/summary: What a melon! (tea)
review/text: There are few things in this world that scream "summer" to me like watermelon. Unfortunately, they're one of those rare treats as my father is allergic to it, so I only had it at other people's parties when growing up. Now, my wife doesn't like it, so it's rare I can convince myself to lug a watermelon home and slice it up, just for myself. But the local grocery store now has mini seedless watermelons for a good price, so I've already had two so far this summer and plan on going back for another on Friday. So much love for watermelon in my heart. It's just juicy and delicious and amazing. I'm just curious, did anyone out there grow up salting their watermelon? Until I was 10, we lived in Michigan and I'd never even heard of it, but when we moved to Tennessee, everyone did it. It does bring out the juiciness of it, but it's also, you know, terrible for you.<br /><br />Now, I know watermelon can be a tough flavor for tea. Many people have tried (two come to mind in 52teas' watermelon iced tea and DavidsTea's Luscious Watermelon), but I have to say I wasn't horribly impressed with those I've tried. So while I had to try it, I just had to, I wasn't holding out a lot of high hopes for this watermelon matcha. When I opened the package, I got juicy watermelon...but a hint of metallic or whatever it was that made the lemon, peach, and mango teas so bitter. But since warm weather has moved in, I've gotten into the habit of mixing my tea with room temperature or cold water, and it definitely paid off this time. I get juicy, creamy watermelon and absolutely no bitterness. Mmmm, this is good. This is really good. It's light and refreshing and utterly perfect for these coming summer months...it's gonna be a scorcher. This is the watermelon I've been searching for and I can't wait to try it blended up with some fresh melon. This kind of tastes like a watermelon bubble tea, but without the overwhelming sweetness. Maybe I need to find some tapioca pearls. It reminds me of the Ten Ren watermelon oolong blended with fresh melon, not Freshly Squeezed's idea of a bubble tea. I'm only a little bitter, I promise. But this is a definite restock for me, and one I will definitely be sharing with friends and family.

review/text: This is a wonderful example of how a responsible company can put out a very good product while practicing a thoughtful fair trade policy at the same time. I would implore everyone to support the Endangered Species brand. While the Tiger is exceptional, even better is the Panther, the darkest of the chocolates the company offers. It is 88% cocoa, and simply a delight for anyone who enjoys a more daring taste in a candy bar.<br /><br />On top of all that, the sale of each bar results in a donation to wildlife conservation.
