review/text: I've always been a big fan of Zatarain's products, and the Chicken & Rice Dinner is no exception!  The combination of spices (and veggies) in the rice add a great flavor to the chicken (prepared via the box's suggested one-pan option or adding cubed chicken in).  Even my picky eaters enjoyed it!  I recommend this for anyone looking for a nice Cajun kick to their chicken and rice dinners!<br /><br />My only qualm is the quantity.  A pack of 12 boxes ended up being split up and given to friends, because it was taking up too much room in my pantry.  If only [...] could break it down to 6 boxes/pack.

review/summary: Versatile and delicious
review/text: I use canned tomatoes in, well, nearly most things I cook.  I tend to stock up on the 32oz cans of whole plum tomatoes but sometimes you just need a little less, and the fire-roasted flavor can be a nice touch.  I prefer to buy organic wherever possible and reasonable, and I like most Muir Glen products.  These tomatoes are good, though they are packed in more of a water than sauce, so I always drain them before use.  Some other canned tomato products I will dump straight into the pot, but I don't think these are great for that.  They also aren't ideal for making tomato sauces but I use them for lots of other things: adding some tomato to bean chilis, throwing together a quick salsa, making spanish rice, adding to soups or stews, and (this is seriously delicious) stirring into a prepared batch of Annie's mac and cheese, along with a can of chickpeas.  If you haven't tried this, it is SO good for a quick meal.<br />Great pantry staple, at a MUCH better price with subscribe and save than you'd pay at the grocery store.

review/summary: absolutely the best canned tomatoes AND organic
review/text: This is a ditto of my other Muir Glen tomato reviews, but I feel the same way about all of them, so here goes...I've generally avoided red sauces and anything with canned tomatoes, but Cook's Illustrated's recipe for almost-fresh pasta sauce made with these (or any Muir Glen tomatoes) has changed me for life. I'm also buying organic whenever I can, so now I've started experimenting with other tomato recipes using these and am loving them. My friends and family laugh at me when I do "subscribe and save" and buy a case at a time, but it's a great bargain and there's always a can (or more) on the basement shelf.

review/summary: quality control snafu
review/text: Received a 12 can case of these tomatoes yesterday. Several cans were dented. One can, though sealed and undented, was unfilled. Amazon's packaging was intact; obviously, there had been problems at the canning facility. I have purchased these tomatoes many times before, from local markets as well as Amazon, and have never before encountered defects of this or any other kind. However, given recent well-publicized problems with food-borne illnesses arising from sloppy practices at other food packers and canners, I am leaning toward avoiding this brand in the future.

review/summary: Not healthy with BPA!
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

Walgrens has had these on sale at two bags for $6 (that is 6 bags for $18).  There are 12 individually wrapped truffles to a bag.  They are VERY heat sensitive and should not be shipped in hot weather unless in a special cold pack, and then by express shipment (provided by some candy sources if you buy online).

review/text: I first tasted these pancakes at a friend's house. His niece lives in Hawaii and sends him a few packages at a time. At first I was hesitant to try the pancakes because I'm not a fan of macadamia nuts, but the company must grind them down to a fine powder. Some people may be disappointed to learn that, but it gave the "flavor" of macadamias without the actual chunks. The only thing I would warn you about is the fact that the packages are small and it's one pack per use. I don't understand how you get six pancakes per package unless they're sand dollars and you're making them for children. I only get about four normal-sized pancakes per package.

review/summary: Good, if you can acquire the taste
review/text: I've gone back and forth on this cereal, which I had not tried before ordering it through Amazon. On paper, it sounded great--walnuts, cinnamon, wheat-rice clusters. What's not to like?<br /><br />I had to get over the taste hurdle, and that took two boxes. This cereal does not taste like an oat-based granola. It has a strong wheat-y taste that can be a surprise initially. I found that I liked it after awhile, but it took some getting used to. This cereal occupies its own niche in the market and cannot be compared to things like Honey Bunches of Oats.<br /><br />A couple of other observations:<br /><br />1. A serving has 20 percent of the RDA for fiber. That's great. It has 10 percent of the RDA for fat. That's not so great.<br /><br />2. The cereal is a bit more crunchy than granolas like Honey Bunches. It is much less crunchy than the Kashi cereals I have tried. I found chewing it to be very pleasant and easy.<br /><br />3. The texture is nice--interesting. Some cereals are just bland in this respect.<br /><br />4. The cereal is appropriately sweetened for me. I like some taste of sweetness, but not a lot. This cereal was in no way cloying.<br /><br />It should be possible to serve this just as is (with milk), if you wish. Many other cereals really require the addition of blueberries, bananas and what-not to make them interesting.

review/summary: Healthy cereal -- eat it everyday
review/text: Walnut spice is my daily cereal. I prefer it with vanilla soy milk rather than cow's milk as I find the taste a bit too strong otherwise. The texture is fantastic, being a bit crunchy but not too sugary. Another reviewer said it had too much sugar, and while it's true that it has 17g per bowl, it also has 5g of dietary fibre and 5g of protein, so that sugar isn't as bad as it sounds. Also, the suggested 2/3 cup serving size is huge. I find 1/2 cup or less is enough to fill me up for a couple of hours. With other cereals, I need 2/3 cup or more to feel full. I've been eating Walnut Spice every day for over a year and I'm amazed that I haven't gotten tired of it. I actually look forward to a bowl of cereal each morning. :) Having Amazon drop-ship it to my door is pretty nice too because the only store that carries it in my area is 20 miles away. I was worried that ordering it online might result in getting a box of crumbs, but the Amazon shipment is actually in better condition than what I get in the store (i.e. whole flakes, less crumbs).

The box does not list any meat or dairy ingredients, although as far as "natural flavors" go, your guess is as good as mine.  If you like a bit more of a tomatoey flavor, a bit of crushed tomato or diced fresh tomato is a nice addition, too, as is a BIT of finely diced green peper and onion, although those who prefer being true to cajun convention would likely consider that to be sacrilege.<br /><br />Lipton's is very bland in comparison to Zatarain's, although it does cook more quickly.  Given the choice between the two, there's no comparison -- Zatarain's is the more flavorful, hearty meal.

review/summary: The only thing better is in Nawwlins...!!!!
review/text: I am a huge Cajun food fan. Unfortunately, western Washington is the Sahara with respect to Cajun anything. Just TRY to get real Andouille (grrrrr)!!!!<br /><br />However, Zatarains' is a good way to get a fix without having to spend hours hitting some snooty restaurant or flying to NO.<br /><br />Perhaps not the quickest but it is convenient enough as it is and is sooooooooo yummie!!!<br /><br />If I'm in a hurry I just toss it together and eat it as is. If I have the time, I cook up some spicey sausage or meat substitute and perhaps throw in some extra spices (chiplotle hot sauce and cayanne) to make it snortin hot.<br /><br />You can also stretch it by tossing in some extra beans (canned or prepared at home) and minute rice and adjusting the fluid accordingly.<br /><br />My point is that this stuff is GOOD and that it can serve as a nice side straight outta the box, and only gets better when you dress it up.

review/text: I have used this product for several years and it never fails when I am looking around in the kitchen for "what can I make tonight!!??".  I have added sliced smoked sausage, and also boneless chicken breast sliced into strips.  The chicken was a tad bit less spicy, but really good overall.  I have also tossed in a can of green beans drained so I am getting some added vegies.  I think corn would work too.  We probably eat this at least once every two weeks and on Amazon, the bulk price is very good.  It makes enough so my hungry hubby and I have leftovers for someone to take to work the next day.

review/summary: I dislike this rice/bean blend
review/text: I've been a vegan for six years, so I know a thing or two about rice and beans, and definitely have some strong preferences. I don't like Zatarain's rice and beans (red or black). There are a few different reasons for this, but the primary one is that on two separate occasions I've found "stuff" in the mix. Both times it was the same thing: a sort of fibrous, bone-like object, about the size of a marble. The first time it happened I was rather grossed out, but the second time I quit this stuff for good. I've found that both Wegmanns and Giant offer store brands of rice that taste better and are often more cost efficient, and I have not eaten Zatarain's since that.

review/summary: GREAT TEA
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for over a week now. I am not sure if it actually help with the losing weight stuff but I got to say this tea is one of the best tea out there. By the way, I got it from the Asian Supermarket. I love to buy stuffs from Amazon but some stuffs are just cheaper if you can find it in stores.<br /><br />I have tried so many teas out there but nothing like this tea. It is smell soooooooooo good and plus it's not bitter like other tea. One of the reason I got into drinking the tea is because I did lots of research online and lots of people claims that by drinking Oolong tea will eventually help you loss weight. I am not sure is because of the tea or not but I did lost 1-2 lbs per week (1-2 lbs is alot for my body type). I also work out 3-4 days a week and plus I watch what I eat. So I really not sure if this tea work for weight loss. I will still continue to drink the tea whether it work for weight loss or not. I like the smell of the tea. This is the same type of tea (at least for the smell of it) they serve in the Chinese restaurant.I hope my review will be hopeful for some of you.

It is an Earl Grey tasting tea, tea of the dark variety. Minimal weight loss but the tea is still good and worth the try; no two bodies react the same, under the same circumstances I would buy/try it again.

Last year I lost approximately 7-10 lbs.. You should not count on any products to help lose weight;cutting back on: fast foods,fried products, late night eating and over indulging are some of the keys along with drinking plenty of water,physical activities (walking through local museums)get off your BUM!!! these are key factors. Just because the economy is'nt doing well does'nt mean we have to. Depression is a key factor to weight gain. Thank Jesus every day any how. Don't let the devil take you out with diabetes,lung disease and other health problems associated with weight gain. Take back your life. Hey, it does'nt hurt to chill out over a nice chess game(not TV)with a cup of Wuyi Oolong Tea.

review/summary: The Best Oolong Brand
review/text: I have tried various brands of Oolong and find this one the best flavor of all, and at the price it costs compared to many other Oolong types I have seen online, I find it a bargain. I constantly keep stocked up on this tea and seldom drink anything else.<br /><br />Yes, the bags do sometimes break and some tea leaves come out, but this does not happen all the time. I find that by putting the water in the cup first and then easing in the tea bag most of the time this is avoided. The final brew is perfect - not too strong and not weak like most other green teas.<br /><br />As for the weight loss aspect, ignore that. It does nothing to help reduce weight - just an awesome tasting tea.

I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being being the strongest. None of the tea bags were broken open being individually wrapped and so I'm not drinking tea leaves.

review/summary: Quality ? ? ?
review/text: This is a tea with a nice flavor and color, but nothing really special. It has a different flavor than green tea and is not strong like black tea. It is not bitter, but pleasant. It comes in 3 separately sealed, airtight bags. I have used about 1/2 half of the box so far.<br /><br />I have noticed that a rather high percentage of the tea bags are missing the staple that holds the string on, or the string is cut in the middle. Without the staple, the teabag opens up in the hot water and lets out the leaves. Another defect that I have found in several of the bags is that the envelope was inaccurately folded and stamped. It causes the envelope to be crooked and in some cases it cuts part of the corner of the teabag so that leaves leak out while steeping.<br /><br />Although I have continued the use the tea I have on hand and I do enjoy it, I now doubt the quality of the tea judging by the quality of the bags. I would think that if the company made high quality tea, they would work a little harder on the quality control of the bagging equipment. I will most likely not order it again.

If you wait long enough, the leaves do sink to the bottom, along with some other gritty particulate.  The tea itself is just okay, very weak.  You will not get a good second or third cup of tea from one bag like you would get from Prince of Peace Organic Oolong tea.  Spend a few cents more and get the Prince of Peace Organic Oolong tea.

review/summary: Not Happy
review/text: I was very unhappy with this tea.  So far about 60% of the teabags had holes in them or didn't stand up to the hot water, making most of them to leak the tea into the bottom of the cup. The flavor is good, however.  Have not had any noticable weightloss from drinking this tea, as advertized.  For the price, you are probably better off buying tea from your local grocery store.

review/summary: Wonderful mild tea
review/text: I really enjoy this tea.  I find when the weather starts to get cooler I prefer warm drinks and to much coffee is not a good thing.  I bought this tea so that I would have something other than coffee at work.  I have read about all of the wonder health benefits that are supposed to come from tea but green tea tends to make me nauseated for some reason.  This tea has a wonderful mild flavor and with a few drops of lemon drop stevia is a great treat.  I have one complaint though, my box had several broken bags and I would have to roll it up and staple it closed before I could use it.

review/text: I usually only like herbal teas but when I read about all the wonderful health benefits of this 'oolong' tea, I had to try it! I've never been a fan of green tea or black tea and since oolong tea is similar to both, I don't know why I'd thought I'd like it. It's good for you, I won't deny that but I just don't care for the taste. I felt like I was forcing down medicine when I would drink it and not even honey could save this tea for me! If you don't like black or green tea, I would not suggest buying this tea, however if you love them, go for it!

They didn't give me the recipe but said that there's cheddar cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise and this Garlic Vinaigrette mix.  The girl mentioned 5lbs of cheddar to two packages of this mix.  If you do the math, you can figure 1 lb. cheese to not quite half a package.  It can be eaten cold but it's better warm.  Serve with a pita chip or another sturdy chip.

review/text: I would have to say Numi blooming teas are nowhere near the quality of Primula blooming teas, in craftsmanship or flavor. These had a tendency to fall apart once the water was added, which really diminishes it's presentation. Also, the tea seemed too dark in color for it to be green tea and the flavor was more that of black tea. I was definitly disappointed. I will stick with Primula!

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: After reading the positive reviews I decided to try this cereal. I'm not impressed. It's too sweet with lots of sugar. There are 14g of sugars per 2/3 cup serving. Some ingredients like the dried fruit and oats are hard while others like the cereal flakes are soft and absorb milk. If you let the hard parts soften up with milk the flakes turn into mush.<br /><br />Familia makes a lot of great cereals and I'm surprised they let this one out the door. They must think Americans are sugar-crazed Coca Cola addicts. I really like the Familia Low-Fat Musli and suggest you buy that instead.<br /><br />On the plus side this cereal has a lot of dried fruit. It tastes good if you eat it quickly before it gets to soggy.

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of six this comes at a good value. The fact that this cereal is low-fat makes a good product even better if you are trying to lose some weight or wanting to keep in shape.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 6-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.<br /><br />Get this 6-pack of Low-fat Muesli to help your 6-pack ABS.

I am glad I got both as well because I contemplated if they would be too similar and not worth the cost of both however as much as I love both flavors, I had to do it and I have no regrets!<br /><br />This Almond matcha is sweet and nutty. The aroma is captivating!! My daughter was in the process of making macrons and decided she will add some almond matcha to them. Unfortunately we had to stop because we were out of parchment paper - can't use waxed .... so anyway off to the store we shall run and I am going to pick up more sparkling water because I want to make an Italian Creme Soda with this almond matcha which will be AMAZING! Frothed up lovely even in milk.<br /><br />I love that Red Leaf uses natural flavors!

review/summary: Like Liquid Marzipan
review/text: The prepared matcha is probably one of the best-smelling prepared matchas I've come across. The almond-extract aroma is mitigated and it now smells actually nuttier, sweeter, more like marzipan or an almond paste cookie. First sip... wow, yum. This is so almondy and sweet on its own (I haven't added any sugar), it's like eating an almond cookie, or a big hunk of marzipan. You can still taste the matcha, though, and it's a flavor that goes well with the almond. I do think. Ok, I couldn't resist adding just a touch of sugar (half teaspoon), and holy crap, is this like almondy matcha candy. It makes me think that this would be a good addition to a sugar cookie as opposed to almond extract to make a matcha almond cookie. This has been my favorite matcha so far, and I will definitely be back for more when I run out.

My husband scoffed at me when I told him I ordered a jar. But he loves to spread it between Biscoff cookies. When he went looking for the spread and discovered it was gone he told me to order more.  I jokingly told him about the 8 pack and he demanded I order that one!  Well we have 6 packages of Biscoff cookies to use.<br /><br />I love to eat by the spoonful or on my toast. Haven't tried much else. Can't wait to get my 8 jars!

review/summary: A different and tasty treat!
review/text: I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a "European alternative to peanut butter."  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.
