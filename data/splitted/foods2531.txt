review/summary: Excellent Organic Dog Treat
review/text: I have the pickiest dog when it comes to treats and non-human food and he absolutely loves these treats. They are great for a reward system or just having something to snack on in-between meals.<br />These treats are the best that I have found and they are worth every penny. I no longer waste my money on treats that have tons of chemicals or non-food parts.... These are Organic and honestly, I feel better as a parent when I give the treats to my fur kid.<br />These are a must buy if you want a healthy treat for your pet.

review/text: Good, natural, USA made product. My Golden Retrievers love them. Price is right if you take advantage of the free supersaver shipping. A little high in fat content, 30%, but they are not big pieces, so it shouldn't be a problem if you give only once or twice a day. If you have a small dog, they are easily breakable into smaller bitesize pieces. I recommend this product.

review/text: At first, my dog (a 10lb Maltese-ish mutt) didn't seem to interested in these.  I've since decided it was because before these I was essentially handing him fully artificial crap.  I think it just took him a week or two to get used to the good stuff.<br /><br />Now, he sprints to his kennel whenever he hears me opening the bag!!<br /><br />Just ordered my second bag.  I do wish the other flavors came in individual packages, though.  It feels terrible to me to pay $50 on dog treats even if it is a bulk buy.  But that's certainly not a knock on the product!

These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be "organic" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money.

review/summary: cookies, not jerky -- and the dogs are not pleased
review/text: I was searching for USA-made chicken jerky for my two chows and the Plato line came up. My goof not to realize these 'strips' are baked cookies, not dried chicken meat strips, and the dogs have made it very clear -- they definitely prefer real jerky. They don't seem to like the (sort of dry-fudgy) texture of these treats, but will 'accept' the chicken and the salmon, while simply rejecting the duck version. Broken up as training bits for the puppy these will probably be usable, which is good since they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Later I found Bellyrubs brand chicken jerky (at about half the price of Plato) at a feed store, and I am back in the dogs' good graces.

review/summary: Not chicken jerky
review/text: I bought these two months ago in a relentless search of made in the USA chicken jerky treats.  They are not jerky, but two inch formed pieces.  Also in the two months since I purchased them the price has increased 30%.  I feel that consumers looking for jerky that is made in the USA are being taken advantage of.  Also, my dogs agree, this is not jerky.  I love organic, but I will keep looking.

review/text: My dog loves dried chicken jerky treats, but almost all are from China which concerns me.  Trying to find a safer alternative, I stumbled on these.  If you're looking for whole chicken breasts which have been dehydrated, these aren't the same.  They are pieces & parts molded together and almost look like cardboard.  My dog likes them, but they don't seem like anything special to me.  They do say organic, so hopefully are safer, but I'm not really impressed.

review/text: Firstly, these are a really great price compared to the Milo's Kitchen treats we normally buy. The only problem is our Pomeranian is pretty underwhelmed by them. When he gets his regular treats he is really excited and does his little "doggy dance". When I first gave him one the Plato treats he ignored it and our cat tried to eat it, I broke it up into pieces so kitty did get to eat it. The next day I left two on the floor and withheld his usual Milo's Kitchen Chicken Grillers. After awhile he finally ate both of them! So he will eat them but isn't too excited about them.

review/text: I have two fussy dogs (Yorkshire Terrier/Poodle mixes), who reject any kind of hard biscuit after trying them for a few times. I've lost count of the number of bags and boxes of biscuits I've tried and then sent to my sister's dog, who'll eat anything.<br /><br />The Plato Organic Chicken biscuits are the only exception for my girls. When I offer them, they grab them and run to their favorite spot to crunch them right up. A little pricey, but worth it. I've finally given up trying anything else.

review/summary: Great Deal
review/text: My everlasting quest to find cheap and healthy dog treats has eventually lead me to this brand.  I have yet to find any healthy treats cheaper than this when looking at a cost/ounce comparison.  It's made in the USA, which is a necessity.  I refuse to buy any dog treats from China, and so should you.  I used to buy the Waggin Train brand until I researched it.  Please research your dog treats!<br /><br />I would say these fall somewhere between a hard and soft treat.  They are not chewy, but will not crumble when you break them.  I usually break them in half so the bag lasts longer.  My Lab likes them, but I wouldn't say they are his favorite.  He will sometimes turn these down if he has a more desirable toy in his mouth.  This is the only reason I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5.  I do plan to try the other flavors to see if he likes them better.

review/summary: My Dog Boo Loves This Treat
review/text: I liked the price of the product and my dog Boo surley loves it! I think that the cost of the shipping and handling were way too high, quite a lot more than I paid for the product, which did not make it as good a value as I was hopping. According to the alert I recieved tellling me of the price!I would diffinetly order it again if the price and shipping cost were fair. As I said earlier my dog Boo really loves his chicken treats especially Jerky, but he was real keen on the Plato treats as well!

review/summary: Dodgs did not like these at all....
review/text: A very strange treat.. dogs did not like any of the varieties we tried and I ordered three different varieties.<br />Not a 'strip' but a baked 'cookie' that was really very hard and more of a chunk of something backed, not meat looking or smelling.<br />Just really weird and I would never buy them again! save your money and buy the Chicken Jerky treats at WalGreens that are a bone fide strip of chicken and dogs love them! these are chunks of mystery material and not at all appetizing.

review/summary: The Name Says It All
review/text: I buy a lot of generic, store brands.  The quality is usually just as good, or at least so close it's an easy decision with the price difference.  There are a few exceptions.  A-1 is a big one.  No generic steak sauce, or any steak sauce, compares.  My only quibble is the garlic level.  It makes it hard to combine A-1 with other steak accentuators with garlic in them or on meats other than beef.

review/summary: very refreshing citrus taste
review/text: I am a soda conniseur and I like to try new sodas all the time. This is a favorite, a delicious grapefruit soda from Mexico that is commonly sold in mexican groceries and bakeries in the U.S. It is my favorite flavor from the 10 or so different varieties from the Jarritos company. It tastes kind of like Squirt or other citrus sodas, but lighter with no afterbite. The sugar tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap frutose sweetener most soda companies use on us now. The carbonation is a bit lighter as well and not overpowering.<br /><br />Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S. The single servings are still sold in glass bottles,  also available here at at Amazon. This offer is for a 2 liter plastic bottle. Try some!

review/text: Lord help me Jesus this could be my undoing! I can't make a jar last more than 3 days. I like it cold, straight up, on a spoon, no bread. I make myself put it back on the shelf at the grocery store, I try to avoid that isle, I win the battle 2 maybe 3 times and then I relapse. I console myself by noting that it has less sugar and fat than regular peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils. And doesn't dark chocolate have antioxidants in it? Everybody does it once in a while, right?

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I have to admit to thinking this was going to be better than I find it to be now that I've tried it. Yet I still give it 4 stars. What's the quibble? I actually wanted a bit more overt chocolate flavor. I expect dark choc to really stand up for itself and in this, it sort of resides behind the peanut butter flavor.<br />My expectations aside, I'd gladly recommend this to anyone. The texture is excellent - silky really. The flavor profile is actually very good (note that I called my missing the choc flavor a *quibble,* not a criticism). The package says, "try with bananas" (or something like that) which I haven't done yet but I'm absolutely going to do so as I bet that would be an incredible combination. A sandwich of this with banana might just be my favorite over a traditional PB&J.<br /><br />If you're considering trying this PB blend, definitely do. I'm willing to bet you'll like it.

review/summary: WAAAAYYYY healthier than Nutella!
review/text: This stuff is great! And since Nutella is claiming to be such a "healthy" breakfast choice  I'll compare nutritional info between the two products.<br /><br />DCD (Dark Chocolate Dreams) first ingredient is PEANUTS, Nutella's first ingredient is SUGAR!<br /><br />DCD Total fat 13g, only 2.5 is saturated (remember that peanut is a healthy fat - the lower the saturated ratio the better). Nutella has 11g fat, but 3.5g of that is saturated fat.<br /><br />DCD has 6g of protein per serving, and Nutella only has 3g.<br /><br />DCD has 12g of carbohydrates per serving, and Nutella has 22g (carbs = FAT ON OUR BODIES!, these are the sugars at work)<br /><br />Now to talk about the taste differences.<br /><br />I've had Nutella and right away you can tell that it is actually BAD for you, like if you think spreading chocolate frosting on your toast in the morning is going to be healthy you are sorely mistaken.  A good use for Nutella? Spread it on top of cake to make it more nutritious, use it instead of frosting. Now there is a good idea.<br /><br />The DCD is still peanut butter, but it is CHOCOLATY peanut butter and it is amazing on toast and bread.  Good good stuff!<br /><br />For these reasons I will be using this product from now on instead of Nutella.

review/text: I heard of this chocolate pb through a friend who raved about it. So I decided to give it a go. I wasn't exactly crazy about it at first, and wasn't too sure what to make of it. This PB is a grower.  The more you eat it, the more delicious it is. It has a wonderful balance of chocolate and PB and the plus is it's all natural. No hydrogenated oils like most commercial PB brands. My husband can't get enough of it. Amazon has the best price around. It goes for almost $6 a jar in NYC. It's a must have for us now.

review/text: While this product is labeled as dark chocolate, the OU (Orthodox Union) has designated this product as Kosher, Parve, meaning there is no meat or dairy in this product.  Those looking for a chocolate taste will experience instead a cocoa taste, thus lacking the flavor of dairy.  It should have been labeled as Dark Cocoa Dreams but in any case it's delicious.

review/text: Yes, my family, despite not being as numerous as the Duggers nor as prone to indulgence as some, still managed to finish off a jar of this stuff within 24 hours.<br /><br />To think, I was worried about ordering 6 at once (the expiry was set 21 months in the future, though the individual jars are best before 6 months after they are opened).<br /><br />The taste is heavy on the (good quality and nutty) peanut flavor, with the dark chocolate playing a present-but-secondary role.<br /><br />Things heard around my house in the 24 hours since first taste(s):<br />"Mmmmm, okay, I'll have a second spoonful!"<br />"I know I have a toothache and it's made worse with sugar, but I'll live with the pain later. GIVE ME THE JAR!"<br />"Mama, I remembered to use the potty. May I have some chocolatepeanutbutter pweeeeeeeeeease?!"<br />"Mmmm, okay, I'll stop after spoonful number 5 I promise..."<br />"Mama! IWANTMOREPEANUTBUTTER!" [followed by a single tear and a sorrowful "pweeeeeeease?"]<br />"Hmm, I think I'll have a chocolate pb sandwich for lunch..."<br />"Do we have bananas anywhere? I need to try this with bananas and whipped cream!"<br />"OMG TRY THIS WITH BANANAS AND WHIPPED CREAM!!"<br />"So how long until Subscribe & Save sends us more? It's easy to make that sooner, right?"<br /><br />I'm going to be getting a few other kinds from this company and giving out 3-packs for birthdays/Christmas. This will also be ever-present in our house from this point forward, though we are going to need to learn moderation in the face of temptation like we've never known. Yum!

It tastes similar to Nutella, but has 1/2 the sugar and more flavor.  I put it on waffles, eat in sandwiches and melt it over ice-cream. I am an addict!!<br />I have been picking it up when it happens to go on sale at my local grocery store.  $6.00 a jar is a bit steep, so when I found this product on Amazon and saw it could be shipped in bulk I was thrilled!

Love it on crackers or as a yummy topping on otherwise more "dry" peanut butter cookies. Also great for baking, for homemade peanut butter cookies or for a chocolate peanut butter variation of any layered bars. 170 calories per 2 Tbsp [32g]. Highly caloric, like all nuts and nut butters. Consume in moderation, as an occasional extra bonus treat. Great energy for kids.

We tried all kinds of peanut butter from this company and so far their flavors, texture and recipes are to die for.<br /><br />It is great by itself, on bread or in a variety of reciples.It has become a new staple in our house.

review/text: I am in awe of this peanut butter. It is seriously delicious. And I could seriously sit down with a spoon and consume an entire jar of the stuff. In fact, all products from PB&Co I have enjoyed immensely. They simply know their way to a pb-lover's heart with all these amazing flavors. My advice: go out and buy this peanut butter right now! I take pleasure in using it as a dip for apples and bananas, spread on a whole wheat tortilla with strawberries, or eaten straight. You'll never look at peanut butter the same.

review/summary: One of the most delicious things ever
review/text: This is seriously one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  I don't really know what the other reviewers are talking about when they say it doesn't taste like chocolate--maybe it's just because I eat some type of peanut butter at every single meal or something but you can very obviously tell that this is not normal peanut butter and is definitely very chocolate-y and dessert-y.  It tastes really good plain and with fruit; the concept of eating it on bread like a sandwich seems a little strange but whatever to each their own.<br />If you are taking the time to read the comments, you should definitely buy this.  It's amazing.

review/text: I have this chocolate peanut butter on auto-ship in order to receive the price break. This is my little guilty pleasure product which I keep on hand. To my taste buds, this product is more flavorable, darker, and smoother than the better-known, highly advertised chocolate hazelnut product. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed....

review/text: I love this peanut butter. It lets me indulge without actually eating anything worse than normal peanut butter. Since I'm a calorie counter, I need things that taste like an indulgence but are actually nutritious enough to keep me from eating a leg and this is my favorite indulgence. I eat it on bread, fruit, pretzels, (broil marshmallows on bread and put this on the other side for an indoor smores!), and use it to make my own "granola" bars that are healthier and yummier than store bought!

review/text: This Dark Chocolate Dreams peanut butter is amazingly good.  Initially, I was anticipating it to taste like Reeses'-in-a-jar, and I was disappointed that it wasn't.<br /><br />Then I tried it again, on a spoon, and it knocked me over.  It is not as salty as Reeses', and actually tastes more natural.  The texture is sensuously smooth, and the taste is sublime.

review/summary: Love Dark Chocolate Dreams!
review/text: Based on reviews, I decided to try Dark Chocolate Dreams, mainly because I love dark chocolate.  Generally, I eat regular peanut butter a few times a month, certainly not every week.  However, I eat this almost every day, usually on toast in the morning, but it's great for a snack also.  I signed up for the regular shipments which give a price break.  If you like dark chocolate, I definitely recommend this!

review/summary: An absolute pleasure to eat!
review/text: Dang it, I bought the six pack.  For just me.  It's so much cheaper here than at the grocery store that I thought, (shrug) better go for it since I pick up a jar every time I'm at Sunflower anyway.  Silky, high quality peanut butter with a rich chocolate undertone, this thing is the best treat I've had in years.  As others have said, don't buy it expecting dessert or candy or frosting as it is, in fact, a jar of peanut butter.  But WHAT a peanut butter!  I keep it in the fridge to make it nice and thick, then just eat it straight with a spoon.  I haven't been able to bring myself to clutter it up with toast or banana or anything else, it is too incredible in its pure form.  I have tried one other gourmet brand of chocolate peanut butter and thought it was good, but it just didn't live up to Dark Chocolate Dreams.  I will never stray again.

Only downside, if any, is that my dog can not lick the spreading knife when I'm done making the sandwich.

review/text: I had to try this product just in case it was heaven in a jar. I mean...I LOVE chocolate!  Plus I eat PB all the time.  However....this just taste kind of weird to me.  It's a mouth of strange with every bite. Maybe I was expecting to much. I like plain old PB better.  Maybe this would be good in PB cookies or something. So, it is edible.  I'm not going to throw it out but it's going to take a while to use this up. I guess I can use this as an emergency food item that maybe I can resist eating until an actual emergency.

review/text: When my friends recommended me to try some peanut butter & chocolate, I didn't know it would be this tasty. I ordered a pack (6 bottles), I thought I could eat for a long time. However, I find I really love them and in one week only, I eat the whole bottle. I always eat them with bread. Hope you like them. The only disadvantage of this product is that I don't think it is healthy because, you know, butter, chocolate...those kind of things.

review/summary: Good and healthy but not my idea of dessert.
review/text: As several other reviewers have mentioned, the "chocolate" aspect of this peanut butter is seriously more mild than expected. I couldn't even taste the cocoa at all until I had a scoop of this stuff immediately after a scoop of regular peanut butter. I was hoping for a sort of Reeses Peanut Butter Cup flavor, but I was disappointed in that regard. However, this is the PERFECT peanut butter for those who perhaps don't like the overtly nutty taste of regular ones. Just don't go buying a case of this stuff expecting it to taste like frosting. Nutella is much more of a treat in my opinion.

I first tried my DCD on a slice of toasted pound cake.  I called my husband over.  He loved it, too.  We quickly hid the jar, so the kids wouldn't find it.  The next night, we put some on vanilla wafers and, oh wow.  After hiding the jar again, I went to my computer and found DCD on Amazon.  I ordered a case to give out as Christmas gifts.  I've yet to find someone who doesn't just love it.  I can't wait to try the other flavors!

review/text: I am so glad that I have found and tasted this product in the grocery store. The mixture of dark chocolate and peanut butter is amazing for me. It's just a perfect blend! It's rich and delicious! Sometimes I can't take my hands away from this thing. Anyway, the product can be an equivalent replacement for Nutella. This has more of a peanut butter taste with a taste of dark chocolate, while Nutella is more of a chocolate spread. I feel that this is more nutritious compared to Nutella since it's an actual peanut butter spread. I have this item on continuous order every two months. I can't get enough of it.
