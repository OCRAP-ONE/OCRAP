review/summary: Taste of comfort
review/text: High sodium content notwithstanding, Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup remains my perennial favorite when it comes to canned soup. On its own or in certain dishes, it delivers reliable comfort in every mouthful. I love its creamy texture and full taste (thank you, high sodium!). My pantry is always stocked with this soup. Being able to purchase this in a family size at a great price on Amazon is an added bonus.

review/summary: Creamy and Delicious!
review/text: This has been my favorite soup since I was a child many, many years ago, and I still heat up and eat the smaller, 10 oz. can at least once a week.  It's my comfort food!<br /><br />My husband also likes this soup, but one of the smaller 10 oz. cans aren't enough for two people, so I was thrilled when Campbell's came out with a 26 oz. can.  Now, I can just open one large can and fix enough yummy, creamy, delicious soup for BOTH of us, and we are very satisfied with the large bowls of soup we both get.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She loved the box and the candy was tasty but if you look at the picture in their advertisement it must be a close up because what I saw come out of the box looked like about half of what they show.  Truthfully, unless you're into home made candy, save your money and buy some English Toffee at Walmart.  It's probably just about as good and a lot less expensive.

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: I bought this product and it arrived in a crushed case as Amazon does not re-box the shipment. I like reduced packaging, but in this case, the product suffers as a result, and several (10+) of the packages were open and perhaps not safe for use.  The other issue is the packages are more than a few months old at the time of shipment.  Several months ago Kellogs started adding fiber to certain cereals, including Special K, and these do not have any fiber- they are probably working off old stock. In spite of all this, I would purchase again- these are great for portion control, which is difficult for cereal, and these would be perfect for food service, day cares, day camps, churches and other groups. I plan on throwing some in my suitcase for travel- most processed prepackaged foods are approved for entry into other countries and these will be good on the go. Hopefully in the near future Amazon will get newer stock with the added fiber.  Make no mistake, Special K is not something most people would consider healthy- high fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients and with the lack of fiber, this is little better than a kids cereal, but I do like it for a treat when I am craving something sweet.  Plus they are only 70 calories per portion, and you can add your skim milk right to the container. These portions do not cost any more ounce per ounce than the regular boxes I purchase at the grocery store.

review/text: I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

review/text: OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!

review/summary: Future of Food
review/text: Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?

review/summary: GOOD STUFF!
review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

review/summary: Nice flavor, and better for you too!
review/text: I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

review/text: These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/summary: Great source of fiber and protein--but TASTES great, too!
review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/summary: Its burned
review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

review/text: These taste great, and when I got them very few were broken... on average one pretzel per bag was broken.  They are shorter than most pretzel rods, about 4 inches each.  I was making chocolate-dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8-Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did--buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)

review/summary: Mine Also BURNT flavor!
review/text: I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/summary: Review for the Hi-Protein variety
review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

review/summary: How can a pretzel taste this good?
review/text: A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.

review/summary: Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up
review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.

review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

review/summary: Strange chemical peach flavor - is this natural?
review/text: I'm almost on the fence with this one, but more body weight is leaning toward the "no" side.  The tea-leaf flavor itself is quite nice - the subtle flavor of South Carolina's black tea is interestingly different from what I drink on a daily basis, and I like that change every once in a while. Also, the tea leaves seem very fresh.  I like the Governor Grey and Breakfast teas for a simple, linear-tasting black tea, but there are still other brands I gravitate toward for more complexity (Mighty Leaf has a wonderful Earl Grey with stronger bergamot flavor).  The problem with this particular tea is that the peach flavoring is strange and sometimes reminds me of chemically scented plastic (a warning sign of artificial flavoring).  I did double-check to make sure the "peach flavor" mentioned in the ingredient list is natural, and the website for the Charleston Tea Plantation affirms that a natural essential oil is used in all of their teas, but the peach tastes so chemical compared to other, more natural teas I've had - you know, the teas that have visible bits of fruit in it.  When I checked the reviews on the Charleston Tea Plantation website, I noticed that someone else had left a review mentioning the same chemical taste.  This tea is refreshing and easy to drink, but I just can't get over the weird peach aftertaste that lingers just a bit too long and too strongly.  Maybe it's just a personal preference (many other people seem to love this tea), but I'm going to stick with Green Hill Tea's peach apricot loose tea because it is much better, and the ingredients seem better (taken from their website: black tea, natural dried papaya, freeze dried peach + apricot, blackberry leaves, sunflower + calendula petals, natural flavours).

review/summary: Magic Potion from South America.
review/text: Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word "mati" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits -- among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals -- the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.

review/summary: This is such a bargain!
review/text: I have been using Equal sweetener for a very long time.  The amount I paid for the pack of 8 jars was so much cheaper than the amount at the store.  I am thrilled to have gotten my favorite sweetner for such a deal.  In my opinion, Equal is the best artificial sweetener of all the ones offered.  It has no after taste and it can be used in cooking the same way you use sugar.  Love it!

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: Not the sweet clam taste I was expecting. The product is sort of grayish and dirty looking, not fleshy pink as I expected. The average very small clam size is about 3/8" inch with many in pieces or crushed like mush. Occasional pieces of hard elements such as shell bits or something else that is hard. Somewhat of an off flavor, sort of fishy or sea weedy. A product of China which I was suspect of at the start as I think their quality control often suffers with many products and I was right. I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Light scent and very pleasant
review/text: Another great Roland product!  I cannot say I've been let down by this brand.  Like the mussels, these, too, are packed in water and are already pre-cooked.  A little rinsing may be necessary, but there's no pungent or fishy odor; the water will run clear after light agitation in a strainer... or you can just pour into and dump out water from the can before using.  There's hardly any grit to be found in the clams themselves (as sometimes happens with the shelled critters like these, mussels, scallops, etc.).  Add them to whatever you want (I've stirred them in with a homemade marinara sauce and a few spices) or eat them separately.  My one concern was that they'd end up being rubbery, as clam bits tend to be, but these are very small, pretty much yanked whole out of the shell, and quite tender yet firm.  I'm thinking that perhaps they get rubbery if overcooked, but I haven't had that experience yet.  Highly recommended.

I especially LOVE the crystals that are made out of a stevia/cane sugar mix--and they're only 5 calories per packet and I only put one packet in my coffee....I guess I need to find that product and review it-ha!<br /><br />But this is definitely worth a try.  It's cheap and lasts a LONG time.  I think it tastes much better in tea, than coffee though.

review/summary: After taste
review/text: These were a great price that's why I gobbled some up [lemon, toffee, chocolate & strawberry].  I've tried the lemon in some of the WuLong tea [ick..guess I should try a better tasting tea?] noticed the after taste, as usual.  I've also tried the strawberry in some carbonated water [suggestion from the 101 Recipes for the HCG protocol] and that's not too bad.  Definitely something you gotta get use to...because of the after taste. [I know this product and other Stevia products are natural so this taste doesn't mentally affect me as does the Aspartame, Splenda and other man-made sweeteners - those are just plain bad for us but the after taste of these Stevita products remind me of those man-made sweeteners - ICK].  I've actually had a little better luck with the Nu-Stevia powder, as long as I am careful on the amount [for example I use it in my smoothies, i.e. 1 packet for a 16-20oz smoothie].  So the '3' rating is for the taste...and after-taste.  :-(

review/summary: I love the Stevita brand!
review/text: I have found the Stevita brand to be the best with the least after taste because they use a natural process of amino acids to strip the Stevia leaves.  I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood brain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as "organic". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way, aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren't used in chemotherapy.  I reckon these chemicals aren't expensive enough to use in "medicine."

It has a distinct and unpleasant aftertaste--which is not unusual for artificial sweeteners.  This, however, is much stronger than other sweeteners.  I'm sticking with my Sweet 'n Low and shoving this in the back of the cupboard.<br /><br />For the seller, though, I have nothing but good things to say.  Prompt shipping and no problems.

review/summary: Not Quite As Good As The Vanilla, But Still Fine!
review/text: I've been using stevia products for ten (?) years, and I like Stevita Toffee.  Of the two brands of the *naturally* flavored stevia liquids (the other manufacturer's stevia liquids come in glass bottles and are super-pricey, and then there's this Stevita liquid), the Stevita Vanilla and Stevita Toffee are the best for coffee, bar none.  I use the Strawberry (and other flavors) for milk, protein shales, etc.  Anyway, I think the Toffee's taste is about 2/3's as good as the Vanilla, but it's also stronger . . . stronger smell and taste.  I can see why others didn't like it, but I'm very used to stevia's taste--plus I don't use stevia on its own.  I recommend 15 drops of Stevita Vanilla or Toffee, plus two teaspoons of the (naturally flavored) Hazelnut Agave (available on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVKX9C">Madhava Pure Organic Agave Nectar, Hazelnut Flavor, 11.75-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>), and one-half a packet of Equal or Splenda, plus cream.  It makes a (mostly) healthy version of any "special" coffee drink at Starbucks, and tastes as good or better.  Believe me, that combo I just listed is *fantastic*.  (BTW, I give five stars to the Vanilla-flavored version of Stevita, and four stars to this Toffee version).
