review/summary: Disappointed and feeling a little deceived
review/text: I have purchased this product previously. This time, there are<br />two many onions in the mix, I didn't want minced onions, they<br />are easy to get. Also, the picture shows that the jar is almost as<br />big as a milk carton, which is true, however, the jars I got are<br />about 75% full, this is very disappointing. I will keep and use<br />but will not buy this particular brand again.  When I buy dried<br />vegetables I expect a lot more green, red and orange.  The packaging<br />and delivery were as usual for Amazon, great.

review/summary: TOTALLY GROSS!!!
review/text: I bought this October 25, 2011 and I kept it in a cool, dark, and dry place.<br /><br />I went to use it about 3 months later in a soup I was making.  And I looked at the still vacuumed sealed container with the wrapper still in place and unbroken and OMG,I notice what looked like to be a ca coon and greenish color maggot ( probably from eating the green vegetables)!!!<br /><br />IMOP, this had to have had happen during the processing because the jar is still sealed.  YUCK!!!<br /><br />I called AMAZON C/S and they did credit me.  But what if I would have used before the maggots showed in the container?!!!  I HATE TO THINK ABOUT IT!!!<br /><br />NEEDLESS TO SAY I WON'T BE BUYING THIS ANY MORE!!! And I'll look for another company to buy dried vegetables for soups.<br /><br />If I could rate this a negative 5, that's is exactly what I would score this!!!<br /><br />TOTALLY GROSS!!!

When our original supplies ran out, we went to the store in our new neighbourhood and could not find any Goya Adobo.

review/summary: Boy, should you read the disclaimer!
review/text: There's a very good reason for the disclaimer on this website.  These pumpkin seeds are imported from China (!) by a company called Yankee Traders.  Ignore the fact they're called "pepitas" which made me think they might be from Mexico, if imported (which wasn't mentioned, either).  Then there's the label which mentions that these seeds are processed in a facility that "also processes products containing peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, milk, egg, crustacean shellfish and wheat ingredients."  I'm not allergic to any of those, but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime, I woke up with a headache, upset digestive system and other unpleasantness. Considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for-human products that are Chinese-grown, made or processed, which have been in the news over the last few years, I can't help but worry about these seeds.  I guess that's what I get for not wearing my glasses to examine the label carefully before consuming a new product.  So much for healthy snacking -- you shouldn't buy these if you do have allergies, or if you have concerns about Chinese food-related imports.

review/summary: Best flour of all, hands down!
review/text: As an avid baker, I've tried just about every kind, brand and blend of flour out there.  Whole wheat pastry flour tops the list.<br /><br />Even for people who think they won't like "whole wheat" because it sounds too health-food-y, think again.  Every time I use this flour I get superior results and I've used it for everything: piecrust (the best!), muffins, cakes, as a thickener in sauces and soups and any other use for which a cook needs flour.<br /><br />One mixed flour product I've tried is labelled "white/whole wheat flour" and it cannot compare to real whole wheat pastry flour.  True whole wheat pastry flour is more finely milled than traditional whole-wheat flour and has a light texture that always blends perfectly in recipes.<br /><br />Any serious cook needs to try using this flour, if you haven't done so yet.  Prior to finding it on amazon, I had to make trips to specialty health food stores and once bought a 50-pound sack just to avoid running out during our New England winters.  Storage was a challenge, so finding smaller packages online is a wish come true!

review/summary: try it in a cookie
review/text: If you've never cooked with whole wheat pastry flour, you're in for a treat.  We are all familar with the heaviness and "wheaty-ness" that regular whole wheat flour imparts to baked goods.  But whole wheat pastry flour has been milled finer and amazingly, works wonderfully in baked goods like chocolate chip cookies.  Most recipes out there will call for half whole wheat flour and half regular flour; I've found I can do that and no one can detect any "wheaty-ness".  Allrecipes.com has a whole wheat chocolate chip cookie recipe that is one of my favorites.  This product is not always easy to find on your supermarket shelves (look in specialty flour section, not regular flour section) so might be worth ordering online.

review/summary: Very nice
review/text: I find that this product works best when mixed with other flavors like syrup, honey, or chocolate. I made waffles with it this morning, and by itself, it wasn't that great. However, as soon as I put strawberry jam on top of them, the Graham flour taste blended well with the other tastes.<br /><br />Whole wheat pastry flour is very fluffy, inbetween cake flour and all-purpose. Also, Hodgson Mill uses Graham flour for wheat flour, so your stuff will taste more like Graham Crackers instead of wheat bread. This is actually one thing I like about Hodgson Mill wheat flours.<br /><br />Also, Hodgson Mill has one of the best shipping rates for premium flours. If you order this flour, I would recommend you order around $15 worth of Hodgson Mill flour (rates may change) to get the most out of a small order. Play with the quantities a little so you can figure out a good bang-for-the-buck price. The only better deal on shipping for flour was for Honeyville Farms 50 lb bag.<br /><br />I recently have been playing with a flour mix. Instead of doing 50/50 with all-purpose and whole or white whole wheat, I would do 50/50 with something like cake or pastry flour with the whole wheat or white whole wheat. You get a far better approximation of all purpose this way.<br /><br />Usually, I don't care who makes the flour as long as they are reputable. However, when I tasted the difference between Hodgson Mill wheat flour over the standard wheat flour, I can honestly recommend Hodgson Mill because of using Graham flour.

It is thick spaghetti, traditionally called vermicelli in Italy, that cooks aldente and also healthier with more fiber and less triglycerides. FDA guidelines in America require pasta be fortified with vitamins and minerals, especially ferrous sulfate, ferrous lactate and folic acid to pretend to help the inner city indigent. This ruins the natural wheat product and has made it almost impossible to find good pasta in America. This pasta is expensive, but you need to take into consideration the quality as well as special costs of obtaining this upper out of sight product. Respectfully submitted.

review/summary: excellent rice
review/text: This is a great, fast cooking whole grain rice. Lotus Foods sells a variety of these specialty rices. This "pink" rice is tied with Bhutanese Red Rice from Lotus as my favorite. The pink rice is not as nutty or dark and so it might be better for people who do not link the deeper flavor of the red rice. Overall the only negative about this item is the need to purchase 11 pounds at a time.

review/summary: Mild on the palate and a feast for the eyes.
review/text: The bulk section of the organic food cooperative I purchase from began stocking this rice.  We tried it this week and I just love it.  When cooked, the white interior bursts out of the pink a bit, creating a pink, white and slightly brownish/red side dish for your plate.  I found the flavor to be mild and pleasant.  I also enjoy Lotus Foods' Bhutanese Red but prefer this milder, less pungent rice for the hot days of summer.  The leftover cold rice made a wonderful salad when tossed with some greens and sliced strawberries.  Another bonus was that it cooked up very nicely in 20 minutes with slightly dry, fluffy grains.

review/summary: Very little flavor, I was disappointed
review/text: You'd think you can't go wrong with a basic staple like rice, right?  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this rice.  Lotus Foods Madagascar Pink Rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove.  I didn't pick up on that in the slightest.  In fact, this rice had very little flavor at all.  I normally buy brown basmati rice, or Lotus Foods Forbidden Rice which are fantastic all by themselves.  Those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added.  The Madagascar Pink can't begin to compare.<br /><br />I wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack.  I read the full description on the Lotus Foods website and I liked the idea of this rice.  The Amazon subscription price was a great deal, so I went for it.  I'll still eat the rice, of course, but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide.

review/summary: Contaminated
review/text: Package arrived in the mail a few days ago in what appeared to be good condition.  The bag was properly sealed and didn't appear to have any holes in it.<br /><br />I decided to try this out today, but upon scooping some of the rice out, I noticed quite a few bugs.  In fact, I've never seen any rice with so many bugs in it!  I'm not sure how common this is in this variety of rice, but I can say that I've never had a problem with Lotus Foods' products in the past.  Unfortunately, I have to give this product 1 star because of the extent of the contamination.  I'd caution any buyers to stay away from this variety of rice given my experience and the fact that it can't be returned.

review/summary: Be wary of duck treats from China.
review/text: My dog absolutely loved these and a year ago I would have given 5 stars.... but my dog got very sick and passed a few months ago at the young age of 8 1/2.  We are suspect now that these treats may have played a part as the American Vet association has tied dried jerky treats from China to acquired Fanconi Syndrome of which it looks like my dog developed. He ate a lot of these.  They are not sure if it's ingredients, but perhaps how they are being processed.  I hate to post something that is still being investigated, yet I feel it important to pass on just in case.  Do your research.

review/summary: This "treat" almost killed my dog.
review/text: I have a Shih Tzu/Poodle who loves these duck treats so we've been giving them to her for a few years.  About 6 weeks ago she developed a urinary problem.  She would lie down for a nap and suddenly stand up in a puddle of water. She also began wetting the bed and seemed to have no control over it.  We took her to the vet who immediately said no more food or treats from China and sent us to a specialist who tested her for just about everything (very uncomfortable for her, upsetting for us and very expensive).  We just got the final test results back and she has been diagnosed with Fanconi's Syndrome.  There's not too much we can do except pray that the kidney damage reverses itself.  We're cautiously optimistic because since she hasn't had one of these deadly duck strips she's regained some control over her urination and hasn't wet the bed in 6 nights.<br />Please, please, please DO NOT give your precious pet anything made in China but most especially these horrible, deadly treats.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZNCFA">PCI Quackers Duck Tenders, 2- 1lb.

review/text: We have a yearly cookie exchange, this year's theme was the 50's. I needed coloring for pink poodle cookies. I got out my oils and discovered they were rancid. Gross!  The powder fit the bill with vivid color didn't water down the frosting like a liquid would. The cookies looked fantastic and next year I will not be faced with rancid food coloring. I also bought the black to make records, it did not impart a nasty flavor like the oils can sometimes do. I will buy only the powder from now on.

I ended up adding almost a tablespoon to my french macaron batter and it was such a pale color, that it wasn't worth adding a whole canister at the price. This isn't the way to go if you want bright vibrant colors.

I do not follow the cooking directions but I will use 1/2 c of the oats, 1/2 tsp organic whipped butter in the bowl and add boiling water until it gets to a soupy consistency then add cinnamon and sugar to taste. I end up leaving it to sit for about 1 minute (while I fix everyone elses, lol) and when I sit down with my bowl I am in indigestible fiber haven. This is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten. Add raisins or 1 teaspoon of ground flax seeds or even a chopped banana for variety and ENJOY!!

review/text: Even though the temperature was just under 90 degrees and humid on the day these were delivered, they made it through pretty much intact.  The shipment came in a Styrofoam "cooler" that, for the most part, did its job.  Of course I couldn't wait to try one of these and the one I opened immediately was a little soft with just a bit of the chocolate starting to melt on the top center of the cup.  (Still delicious by the way.)  After letting the remaining candies reach room temperature, they were perfect.  Mmmm.  Think I'll have another now.

review/summary: Good buy
review/text: I live in San Diego, and this is a good buy. The cheapest I can find this box is at Walmart for about .25 cents more plus 7.75% sales tax. Since I am a member of Prime shipping (I buy a large quantity of books), shipping is free. So for me, this works out to be a good deal, and I always have a case of tea on hand.<br /><br />I'd like to pass on my method of making iced tea, which I can drink all day with no stomach upset whatsoever. Seems very few know that an excellent, smooth brew is made by simply placing two tea bags in 2 quarts of water. Leave this alone for a couple of hours and you will find the best iced tea ever. No sun needed, ever. I learned this from a boating friend who swore by it. No fuel, no heat, and it is nothing short of the most refreshing drink ever. Converts are all over San Diego.<br /><br />It has now been demonstrated that black tea (fermented green tea) also has the antioxident properties of green tea...so to your health!

If there were a "state drink" in Georgia, it would be tea (sweet tea for the masses, unsweet for me).<br />I use this tea and Lipton's regular tea as the "base" for many flavored ice teas that I drink year-round.<br />I use two family bags of Lipton's tea and 4-6 flavored fruit tea bags to make one 2-quart pot of tea.  I find that using the fruit teas makes the tea sweet enough for me that I don't need to add any sweetners to get a "sweet tea" fix without adding to my waist or risk of diabetes.

review/summary: Zoe and Harley, Murdered by Waggin Train. Nestle Purina gives Hush Money to hide murder.
review/text: My sisters is in end stage renal failure. She had a companion dog to ease her soul as she waits for a kidney. The holidays came and the house got crowded and her dog Harley may have been fed a few extra of these treats. He died of kidney failure. We didn't know about these treats causing kidney failure in dogs. Two days ago my roommate had to lie on the floor of the animal hospital and cradle her Dalmatian Zoe as she felt Zoe's heart stop in her arms. She was in kidney failure from these treats I ordered for her on Amazon. Dont buy this. It's not an urban legend. It's very real and we can't get these companions back now. If you want to treat your dogs you can trust Blue Buffalo brand products. If they have even suspect a tiny problem with their products they will do a voluntary recall to keep your pet from harms way. Nestl&eacute; Purina Pet foods will continue to use every legal trick in the book to keep this poison on the shelves. They pay victims an average of 100 to 3000 dollars to cover their vet bills and sign non disclosure forms. Hush money for families that can't afford the costs these treats caused.

I didn't see the small print on the bag saying these were made in China. Her early death was a huge shock to us.

If the companies aren't going to own up and voluntarily recall their products, it's up to dog parents not to buy them and give them to our pets.  Why wait until my dog is dying to decide not to give them to her?

Also on the bag were the words, "American Product", was not until I got home did I discover, "Made in China" on the lower corner of the bag.  Waggin Train needs to let their customers know if the contents of the bag are made in U.S. and only the bag is made in China.  If indeed the treats are made in China, then distributed from the warehouse in South Carolina, the company should be upfront with their customers.  It is hard to have confidence in the company when they claim it IS an American product, yet made in China!

These they can gnaw and chew on til they get to the center prize. Of course the wrap goes first before the chewing begins;-)The empty, what I call husks, the actual rawhide wraps, 2 layers, I just pick up and toss after Maggy doesn`t chew on them for a couple days.

review/text: I love this brand of oats, and the shipping was fast, the grain was fresh, and the packaging was perfect. Made my 1st batch of oat casserole with it and it turned out superb:<br />ORGANIC OAT CASSEROLE:<br />2 cups steel cut oats<br />1 cup nuts (I used sunflower seeds)<br />salt<br />kefir<br /><br />Soak the grain and nits overnight in water, salt, a tablespoon of kefir (or yogurt), it will make them nutritionally more available.<br /><br />Drain and rinse the mix and put in bowl.<br /><br />Put in a blender:<br />6 eggs<br />2 cups milk or 1/2 and 1/2<br />2 tablespoons cinnamon (I also add pumpkin spice, ground vanilla beans to taste)<br />Blend till smooth and add to grains.<br /><br />Add a cup or 2 of dried fruits (I used fresh dates, raisins -- use what you like)<br />Add 1/4 cup of coconut oil<br /><br />Stir it up till mixed and pour into greased glass pan<br />bake for 45 minutes<br />let sit for 10 minutes<br />cut in squares, add extra cinnamon and sweetener if you like (I use Vanilla Stevia on top)and serve with milk or coconut milk or nut milk.<br /><br />It's like a very special cereal for breakfast, or a nutritious snack any time.<br />It is very filling and satisfying, and inexpensive to make.<br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Real Breakfast food, serious food budget savings
review/text: Compare the per serving price of this oatmeal to any "superfoods" touting breakfast cereal concoction, I dare you.  You'll be able to have the oatmeal and few fistfuls of multivitamins for the 1-serving price of the multiV. drenched food-like product.<br /><br />Our household is trying hard to correct breakfast - and breakfast skipping - habits these days, and we face down the common issue of just not having the time or inclination to fuss with anything not pre-prepared in the morning. However, you can do an internet search and find a zillion good ways to start the oatmeal the night before.  This idiot-proof method works for us:<br /><br />1 cup oatmeal, 5 cups water.  Put in pan on stove, bring to a boil, turn off heat and cover pan.  In the morning, add any fruit, nuts, cinnamon or sweeteners (we use Splenda), however you like it.  Bring to simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (You may need to add a bit of water - these oats are VERY absorbant.)  Serve topped with yogurt, fruit or milk, and with extreme satisfaction that you aren't feeding the family sugary junk or mass-produced enriched cardboard.<br /><br />Between this and McCann's, I don't perceive a difference, although I guess some reviewers favor one or the other.  Going on price, as of Feb 2012, this is a definite "best buy".

review/summary: Yum... I could get into these...
review/text: I'm not a very good breakfast guy, or oats guy... but I've been trying to work out and my trainer loves him some oats.<br /><br />I always love Bob's Red Mill for my flax and flour, and this got good reviews, has a good price, so it's what I went with.<br /><br />I ended up just following the instructions on the package although there are lots of good prep techniques in the various steel-cut-oat reviews here and elsewhere. They came out just fine.... and the reviewer who suggested refrigerating the leftovers for an even better oat experience is correct I think... these things are yummy with each subsequent round.... this makes a batch-prepping your breakfast for a week really easy.<br /><br />So far I've enjoyed this with greek yoghurt, flax-meal, chunky peanut butter, organic honey.... but I'm sure you could do any combination that works for you obviously... I'm trying to get the flavor ratio down for ultimate addiction but haven't gotten there yet.... there's just so much food to eat (yum!), not enough meals (*tear*). It's a good lucky problem to have I guess ;)<br /><br />I've got freezer space for the uncooked oats so that's where I keep them.<br /><br />Very pleased with this round and hope to be better about breakfast going forward!

review/text: Having used Red Mill non-organic oats for years, thought I would try organic--big mistake.  Got about a dozen bags from Subscribe and Save and a few days later had small moths all over the place.  Finally tracked them to a couple of unopened bags plus the one bag I had opened.  Took over a month to finally get rid of them.  Will go back to regular as I like the company and their products.

review/text: I am addicted to steel cut oats!  Bob's Red Mill Organic Oats are very tasty and quite the deal here on Amazon, price-wise.  I just made them this morning for breakfast.  With the cooler temps our Upper Midwest September brings, they are a perfect beginning to the day!<br /><br />My method is to cook them over night on low in my little crock pot.  You wake up in the morning to a yummy, hearty breakfast that carries you through until lunch time.  Recommend!!

review/summary: Great product, AMAZING PRICE!!
review/text: My husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol and as most of us know whole grain, oatmeal and in particular steel cut oats are really a super food for helping to lower cholesterol. When I started purchasing steel cut oats at the grocery I was shocked to see how expensive they are until I remembered someone mentioning that they ordered their dry pantry goods from Amazon. Well, I wish I remembered who that person was because I want to thank them for helping me find this great deal! Four packages are just a little over what I would have paid for one, and with subscribe and save I not only maximize our savings, get free shipping but the convenience of regular deliveries. The product itself is great- I make them in our slow cooker so its super easy- put it on before bed, have breakfast ready when we wake up! There are lots of ways to make them and I have to admit I thought they would be kind of gross but I love them! Bob's Red Mill is a great brand that I trust.

review/summary: Works great in my rice cooker
review/text: Although not a huge rolled oats fan, I recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X8VBWU">Sanyo ECJ-HC55S 5-1/2-Cup Micro-Computerized Rice Cooker and Slow Cooker, White</a> and had been reading people raving about using fuzzy logic rice cookers to cook steel cut oats. So I bought this, gave it a try, and it worked really well.<br /><br />Any fuzzy logic rice cooker that has a porridge setting can be used. On the night before put the steel cut oats and water (and any dried fruit mix-ins) in the rice cooker and set the timer for whenever you are waking up. Then start the rice cooker on the porridge setting. The rice cooker will just soak the oats in water all night until it is ready to start cooking in the morning. The rice cooker allows for enough time to cook your oats just right so that when you wake up, you have a nice pot of steel cut oats ready to eat. This also works with other hot cereals.<br /><br />As for steel cut oats themselves, they are good, but I can't say that I've fallen in love with it as a breakfast food. But that I guess is more of a personal preference. I may need to keep experimenting with mix-ins. I think in general I am more of a cold cereal person. But these do have a nice nutty taste and texture, very different than rolled oats. It also is nice to knowing you are eating a healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Also, the price for quantity was great. Hopefully this review was helpful, and if you love steel cut oats you take a look at some fuzzy logic rice cookers (I personally love the Sanyo I got. Let me know if there is anything I can clarify or answer in the comments. Or if you have any killer ways of serving steel cut oats that can help me make this a 5 star review, do share.

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  My husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too.

review/summary: Great Texture and Flavor, Crave Them Now
review/text: While other brands call for 4 cups of water to 1 cup of steel cut oats, BRM calls for only 3 cups of water and less cooking time. I split the difference: 3.5 cups of water, low boil for 20 minutes, remove from heat and cover for 30 minutes or so. If you enjoy the texture of steel cut vs. old fashioned, I do not recommend cooking in a slow cooker overnight, as it turns out mushy and stuck to the pot, even if you've used spray or shortening to coat the pan. Just plan on hanging around the kitchen for 20 minutes so you can stir frequently, and you will be happy. I save leftovers covered in the refrigerator and eat 1 serving per day with milk, butter, and brown sugar. Sometimes I add all of that except milk after cooking and before putting the lid on to sit. Then I just have to nuke until hot and add milk for a quick meal.<br /><br />Added: Much, MUCH cheaper than buying in the grocery store.

review/summary: My new favorite Crock Pot Oatmeal
review/text: I have been eating and enjoying McCann's steel cut oats for a while now and loved them though I was never happy with the dented cans and damaged cardboard containers.<br /><br />Since I had seen Bob's Red Mill products touted so often on Amazon best selling lists, I decided to give<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLVO7W">Bob's Red Mill Organic Steel Cut Oats, 4 - 24-Ounce bags</a> a try.<br /><br />Although my rating is based on the taste and not the packaging, I must say that I was delighted to find that the four tightly sealed bags were nicely packaged in a Bob's Red Mill cover box for added protection.  Since I am a lazy cook, I dump an entire bag in a Crock Pot, add 10 cups of water and cook on low for 2.5 hours.  I love the consistency which is somewhat creamy but allows each oat to retain a nice firm chewy texture.<br /><br />I put the cooked oatmeal into eight individual sealed dishes after adding my favorite ingredients like spiced pumpkin puree.  In the morning, a dish can be nicely warmed in the microwave for a couple of minutes to provide a delicious and nutritious breakfast.

review/summary: So much better than rolled oats
review/text: I consume oatmeal on a daily basis so I was absolutely delighted when I tried the Steel cut flavor. I loved it! Steel cut oats are 1000% better than rolled oats -no need for me to detail the benefits (Google it). I particularly like the chewiness of the thing.<br /><br />I made my first batch of Bob's Red Mill Organic Steel Cut Oats this morning. I looked online for a good recipe but in the end I did the most basic thing and I think I will stick with it:<br /><br />How I made it:<br /><br />1. 1 cup oats<br />2. 6 cups water<br />3. little salt<br /><br />Bring water to a boil, add oats, and set timer to 40 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally.<br /><br />Many recipes called for 3-4 cups of water so I started with 4 cups. However I had to continuously add hot water because the oats were not cooked to my liking. I also found that 4 cups of water was just not sufficient because the oats were starting to burn in the pot. So in the end, 6 cups of water and 40 minutes was best for me.<br /><br />I have to say, even without any flavoring (honey, nuts, cinnamon, etc), the oats taste really good.<br /><br />For consumption, I added some skim milk, drop of honey, and walnuts. This made of a healthy and filling breakfast.

review/summary: Amazing! Who knew oatmeal could be this good?
review/text: I wasn't expecting much, but since I've had positive experiences with other Bob's Red Mill products I thought it would be worth trying. WOW. Amazing flavor and beautiful texture, distinctly better than what I'd been purchasing at the local health food store. I use a Crock Pot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CA3C6">Proctor Silex 33015 1-1/2-Quart Round Slow Cooker</a> and a cup of steel cut (AKA pinhead) oats and four cups of water. I had some dried sweetened cranberries on hand and threw some of those in as well. Find a timer and before you go to bed set the timer to cook from midnight until breakfast and set the Crock Pot on low and you've got a delicious hot breakfast waiting for you. A little maple syrup and breakfast is done! Easy!! This oatmeal is 100% worth buying, it's easily the best I've ever tasted. Who knew oatmeal could be this good?

review/text: This is a staple in our house - we have it every weekday for breakfast. I make the oatmeal in a rice cooker, on a porridge cycle that's programmed to finish at 6 am, when we get up. I use 1:5 oats to water ration in my rice cooker and it comes out perfectly creamy every time. A few raisins, a little butter and a drizzle of maple syrup and you have a delicious breakfast with zero effort and very little cleanup!

review/summary: most delicious breakfast ever
review/text: I discovered these on sale at Big Lots last fall and have since become a real fan.  (Big lots no longer carries them and Amazon's is a very good price so is now my supplier.)  I have always found regular oatmeal a bit boring, but these are a whole different food - better texture, better taste, and more nutritious to boot.  And the way I prepare it makes it something positively delicious and supercharged with nutrition.  I call it Black Forest Oats.  For a single serving:<br /><br />Stir together 1/3 cup steel cut oats, 1 tsp dark cocoa powder<br />Mix in 1 cup of whatever milk you are into.  I use cow's or almond, and like them a bit less chewy so I add a splash more liquid.<br />Bring to gentle boil, stirring a bit, then reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 22-25 minutes, stirring halfway through.<br />Add about 1/2 to 1 cup partially thawed frozen cherries, sweetener to taste, a little vanilla if desired, and eat up.  The cold cherries cool it down so it's just right.<br /><br />To shorten cooking time, let the oats, cocoa and milk sit overnight in the sauce pan.  This reduces cooking time by about half.  Don't worry about the milk spoiling - it won't.

I was not a huge fan of the rolled oats cereal which I always thought of when "oatmeal" was mentioned, but steel cut oats are a firmer texture and this makes this cereal more to my liking. We generally add a little brown sugar to the bottom of the bowl and change up the other ingedients for variety. Golden raisens or fresh strawberries, blueberries or bananas and a sprinkle of cinnamon add the final touch. A splash of milk or cream also makes a nice addition. This cereal makes a good breakfast which is very economical and tasty and relatively healthy.  It takes about 20 minutes to cook so for those in a hurry this can be a problem. Friends of ours make a big batch at the start of the week and simply heat up a bowl each morning and claim it tastes the same. I prefer to make it fresh.

review/summary: the best oats I have tried
review/text: I like that kind of oatmeal because it taste very natural. I usually soak it for about an hour so I dont have to boil as much. it saves my time and the nutrients of the oatmeal. I make it with bananas and raisins with no sugar but add some salt . I eat this oatmeal every day and it became very important breakfast for me. Oatmeal is very good for you, it keeps me regular and I read that it prevents diabetes and good for the cholesterol. I also feel more energy now, maybe because I eat this oatmeal on the regular bases.

review/summary: A bit chalky
review/text: These oats are edible but a bit chalky.  Maybe I would have liked them better if I hadn't tried the McCann oats first.  I switched to the Bob's oats because they are a lot cheaper than the McCann's.  However, the McCann's are simply the best organic steel cut oats that I can find.  I'm switching back.

review/summary: Delicious oatmeal.
review/text: I have used McCann's in the past and decided to try this one.  This product was rated highest by America's Test Kitchen.  They were right. It cooks and tastes great. Remember to slow cook this in a crock pot.

review/summary: Good oatmeal but.....
review/text: The oatmeal is very good but I did not receive an email on whether I wanted another shipment sent or not. We do not eat that much in a month. Hoefully that will change if not I'll have to go back to buying in store.

review/summary: Does Have A Kick - Recommended!
review/text: Red Bull does indeed get me going when I need it! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I can't have the regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFUN04">Red Bull Energy Drink, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> so I get the sugar free type. The taste is not the easiest thing to get used to since it is sort of sour, but it isn't really unpleasant either. These are good in the late morning or very early afternoon for that extra kick when the morning coffee has worn off.<br /><br />I also like the taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ74OK">Celsius - Celsius Cola, 4 cans</a>, but they are not usually sold at the stores in my area.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
