review/summary: Just not that great
review/text: I don't really understand what the buzz is about for these cookies.  They aren't really minty or sweet which is what I was hoping for.  They are kind of bland with a weird initial taste and really aren't that impressive.  I thought dipping them in hot chocolate could improve them but even that didn't really help.<br /><br />They aren't horrible but certainly am not ordering them again.

review/summary: Classic ". . .book by it's cover."
review/text: I was craving my absolute favorite GS cookie in October and went on a desperate search for a possible equivalent. What I have discovered in these delicious thin wafers is amazing. Defying all appearances, OMG these are soooooo good. I won't mourn for GS cookie season any more. These are wonderful "consolation," and now I'll buy the GS simply to support GS. I have no trouble believing that these were originally created for a King, as the box says. Don't be alarmed; they look dry and thin in the classic European manner of visual understatement. They taste MARVELLOUS, but no one steals them because they LOOK -- eh -- blah. But in the mouth -- AAAAAAH -- they melt into a perfectly balanced, luxurious mint chocolate that I now crave on an ongoing basis. Not just good, they're OMG good!

review/summary: Crisp Cookies
review/text: I first found these crisp ginger cookies being sold next to the coffee at my local grocery store. They are really perfect with coffee or tea. Each cookie is delicate and deliciously crunchy. The ginger flavor is mild and there is a hint of cinnamon and cloves. They remind me of cookies I once found in Holland. Although these are made in Canada from a Swedish recipe. These may contain peanuts, milk powder, whey and lactose. So if you have allergies - beware! I will definintely buy these again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Best ginger thins next to homemade~
review/text: As a kid, I had neighbors from Sweden, and the wife would always make ginger thins for me and her kids every Friday after school. After her husband died and she moved back to Sweden, I never really ate any cookies as good as hers. The ginger snaps that come in the big brown bag taste alright, but just too hard. I found this brand at a Walgreens about a week ago and I'M IN LOVE. I just wish they came in a bigger box~ I haven't ordered them from this seller yet. The cookies are very fragile. I could almost bet that I would have a box of powder by the time they arrived. For anyone looking to buy this brand, try looking around locally. If not in a typical store (like for example Walgreens, Winn Dixie, any other grocery store), try looking for the nearest European market. There's one near me where I buy my Lion Bars from, so there may be a different brand of ginger thins there.<br /><br />&lt;...><br /><br />Good luck~!

review/text: One of our local stores carried these for Christmas, then stopped carrying them. We fell in love with the crispy cookie with the ginger bite and so ordered a case. Usually that would mean about half way through we (family of four) would be terribly tired of these, but not so with anna's ginger thins. They are just so delicious with a wonderful crunch. They are also really good with some nutella spread on them and sandwiched together.

review/summary: *** I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!! ***
review/text: Ever since I got my first box of these cookies at a local store, I have been hooked! I have these Cappuccino cookies daily w/my coffee. I think they are delicious and so does my husband. I've tried some other flavors but the Cappuccino flavor is my favorite by far. Since our local store often runs out of this flavor, I was thrilled to find them available here through Amazon. (Also, I rarely buy "store-bought" cookies, "snob that I am", since my mother spoiled me w/her delicious homemade, (truly homemade, never anything from a mix), baking of cookies, pies, cakes, breads,etc. I, literally, never walked through the door without the aroma of freshly baked bread, cookies, etc. I admit it---I was the envy of the neighborhood for having a mother like that. Of course, I took it for granted & couldn't have imagined anything else!) Anyway, I hope you enjoy these yummy cookies too!

Because I was so delighted with the first box of cookies I tried, I wrote to the email address on the box requesting the name of markets in this area.  The reply I recieved from the staff at Anna's in B.C. told me about Amazon.  Many Thanks for this amazing treat.  I would highly recommend it to anyone. I especially love these cookies with Marzcapone (Italian cream cheese).

review/summary: Description + Review
review/text: Description:<br /><br />The manufacture website describes Batch 37 Spicy Trail Mix as the following:<br />"Now there's a snack mix for the true "hot head". Just one bite and you'll see this isn't an ordinary nibble. So hang on to your buds and try Mo's mouthwatering, eye-tearing trail mix."<br /><br />However, this barely counts as a description, for starters, its based off the Batch 37 hot sauce, see:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG5AO">Pain Is Good, Batch #37 Hot Sauce, 6.7 fl oz</a>. It contains a mix of Peanuts,  Cajun Sesame Sticks, BBQ Corn Sticks, Almonds and Cashews, dusted in a nice smokey/salty Habanero BBQ seasoning. It contains Peanuts, Wheat, Soy, Milk, Cashews and Almonds so suffers of food allergies/intolerance be wary.  About 1/4 a cup equates to 160 calories, 110 from fat (Remember, this is mostly nuts, fatty but nearly as bad as it sounds on paper), and 115 mg of salt, 8g of carbs (only 1g from sugar), and 5g of protein... made in Kansas. The "trail mix" is a snack mix as there's an inherent lack of more standard trail mix ingredients like raisins/craisins/dried fruit/M&M/Chocolate that tend to comprise trail mix.<br /><br />Review:<br />There's not point to explaining hot food, either you like it or don't.<br /><br />Now that I got the boring stuff out the way, is it any good? Simply yes. I've eaten both Dave's Burning Nuts (known best for Dave's Insanity Sauce, a must try for hot heads) and Da Bomb Ghost Chili Nuts. Both are simply peanuts dusted in heat, which makes for nice but bland munching. I more or less bought these blind, and figured I might end up with 6 containers of unlikable nuts. However, its hardly the case. Comparing these to the other two aforementioned hot foods, these are easily the most desirable. Dave's Burning Nuts are neither hot enough nor special enough to warrant ordering online (in my opinion). Da Bomb Ghost Chili Nuts are pretty good, with a long lingering heat but sadly the seasoning can only be found on peanuts.  Pain is Good gets oodles more points for offering variety. While comprised primarily of peanuts, there's crunchy Sesame Sticks and Corn Sticks, the lone almond and the occasional cashew which keeps things more interesting. They also pack more flavor, the bits of cajun and competing flavors help keep this more complex and tasty.<br /><br /> As far a heat goes? I wish more companies used the Pain is Good metric. I was a bit disappointed to see these were only "medium" hot, but they're considerably hotter than Dave's Burning Nuts which Dave's rates as an underwhelming 7 out of 10. Fellow hot heads probably won't break a sweat even, although the zing probably is more than average person would care for. They're not quite as hot as the Da bomb nuts, but they're surprisingly hot... and tastier. It took a lot of restraint not to eat the entire 8 oz container in a single sitting. I'd like to see these kick up the heat a notch higher, but the heat is enough to make me happy, and excellent companion to your favorite beer.<br /><br />Will I buy these again? Most likely. I haven't bought a lot of food on Amazon.com but this is easily the best food stuff I purchased.

review/summary: I'd buy this again and that says alot
review/text: We eat a lot of rice, usually brown rice or red rice or the darker grains and most times use an electric rice cooker unless I'm preparing risotto.  There are instances, however, when I simply don't have the time to prepare rice and until now, I didn't consider options other than freezing leftover rice in small packages for emergencies.  I never cared for Uncle Ben's Minute Rice and assumed that any prepared and packaged rice would be similar to that rice which one of my sisters adores.  Annie Chun's Rice Express Multi-Grain Sticky Rice has proven my aversion was unwarranted because this product has turned out to be a lifesaver when having only a minute's time.  Now if you don't have a microwave or pot with water and source of heat, I don't think this would be very good, but if prepared as directed, it's quite delicious and I'll buy it again.  The texture is like sticky rice, the flavor is like multi-grains, the color is speckled and appealing, and it's great to have at work with leftovers.  Sprouted brown rice is a definite winner.  Since no refrigeration is needed, it's safe in a drawer and is a relief even when you have forgotten to bring in something else.  In my opinion, since it's rice, you can add practically anything and have an enjoyable meal full of good carbs.  With no oil or salt added, you cannot go wrong with this rice!  Finalize those details according to your own tastes and dietary restrictions.  Because of the cost, I'll continue preparing rice in the electric rice cooker, but for appropriate times, this will be a household staple.

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy! Add a little water after heating.
review/text: Delicious and extremely healthy!<br /><br />The secret is to heat it in microwave for 90 seconds, open it, put it in a bowl and add some water (or any liquid, such as soy milk or whatever you like). That separates the sticky grains and the volume increases.<br /><br />Fantastic!

review/summary: A fast and healthy Asian side dish
review/text: It has no added salt, is whole grain, and is made from rice varieties impossible to find in supermarkets. I use it with whatever stir fry I make in my wok.  It heats in the microwave(do not overcook) and provides enough for two portions. Be careful if you reheat the left over portion a second time.  It dries out and gets hard unless you add a little broth or coconut milk before putting it back in the microwave.  This product is sold in some health food stores and gourmet food markets,but it is difficult to find. Amazon makes it easy.

review/summary: Rice is good, too much packaging
review/text: I didn't look closely enough at the description of the rice packaging.  I thought from the photo it would be in a pouch... but instead it's in a bowl with a cardboard sleeve around the bowl.  Granted, most of it  is recyclable, but it's WAY too much packaging to be environmentally  friendly, especially when buying a multi-pack.  So even though we enjoyed the rice, and found it convenient, I won't be purchasing it again.

review/summary: My daughter loves this stuff!
review/text: With other formulas, my daughter had really bad gas pains and far more spit-up incidents.  After switching to Gentlease, she has really thrived, gaining weight appropriately and seeming tremendously happy with it (and not so happy when we're 30 seconds slow in providing it to her :D).<br /><br />As for the corn syrup solids, this is simply there as a replacement for lactose, which is removed from gentle formulas.  It has to be replaced by something, so they use corn syrup solids.  I don't think there really is any major concern here, as sugar generally is sugar once it is broken down in the body, but I can see the reason for others to be concerned.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see, however, is Amazon include this on a subscription plan like Amazon Mom.  Enfamil is not inexpensive, and it is a regular consumable for my family.

review/summary: Saved our sanity
review/text: I almost feel bad that I'm not giving this product a five star rating.  Our baby is breastfed but also requires supplementation with formula.  At a time when every night at 8pm sharp colic was driving our infant into a 4 hour inconsolable torrent, and after trying many different formulas and remedies, switching the formula we used to Enfamil Gentlease drastically improved just about every part of our lives.  Finally, with more sleep, we were able to enjoy and build our relationship with our little girl.  And, most importantly, we didn't have to watch her suffer every night.<br /><br />I only worry that the first ingredient is sugar.  All of the other organic formulas bring back her colic, but I would have preferred  a product in which corn syrup was not used, or at least not the first ingredient.<br /><br />But the outcome is what counts, I guess.  On this formula, I must say that our baby has thrived.  She is healthy and happy, so for that reason I would highly recommend this formula.

review/summary: Works well but read the ingredients!
review/text: I used this with my daughter as a supplement during her growth spurts when I wasn't producing enough breast milk for her. She tolerated it better than Similac or Similac Sensitive. I was however, disappointed to see that the first ingredient is Corn Syrup Solids. Since it was used only supplementally, it didn't bother me too much but it is something to consider. I researched this and found that since this is designed to be easier to digest, it contains less lactose which is the main "sugar" in other formulas. My pediatrician recommended trying to switch to a lactose based formula at six months when her digestive system was more mature. I did that and she was able to switch pretty easily particularly when the formula was mixed with some expressed breast milk.

As soon as we were given the okay by our doctor to change her formula, we went straight to gentlease after friend recommendations.<br /><br />What I haven't told you is our poor baby struggled with very bad constipation, so bad she would vomit from straining so hard but because she was early we could not change her formula at free will.<br /><br />As soon as she started gentlease the constipation stopped. Now she poops like a champs :) As for keeping her full, yup did the job.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Corn syrup solids is the first ingredient
review/text: Enfamil advertised this product as having the same trust ingredients so I assumed that milk (or equivalent) would be the first ingredient. I bought this giant box and realized after feeding this stuff to my son for a few days that the first ingredient is CORN SYRUP SOLIDS! The box says that there are easily digestible carbohydrates but technically corn syrup (fructose) is sugar and not a complex carbohydrate. The equivalent with Similac also has corn syrup as the first ingredient. I have stopped using Enfamil and I am now using Gerber Good Start Gentle (first ingredient whey protein). It doesn't really work that well and it takes forever to dissolve but at least I am not feeding my kid corn syrup.

review/text: This formula works better for my son who had horrible spit up with the regular Enfamil. He is a breast fed baby who is supplemented with formula. This one seems to be doing better for him, even though he still is a spit up baby- he is over active.<br /><br />The package comes with two refill packs. So as long as you have a tub, you are good to go. The only gripe that I have is that I wish the price would match WalMart (who doesnt seem to have enough supply).

One issue i do have is that he now has smelly green loose poop, which apparently is pretty common with being on this formula and my doctor advised me its nothing to worry about.

review/summary: Good for my "Happy Spitter"
review/text: We switched to Enfamil Gentlease when our son was 3 months old. He throws up excessively and several doctors have told us that he is a "happy spitter". He does not have reflux and is in the 95th percentile for height and weight. We were using Enfamil "Infant" (yellow label) from early on, then switched to AR (which made him so constipated that he had a bloody stool). We also tried Similac Sensitive before settling on this brand/product. We have found that he throws up/spits up much less when using Gentlease.

review/summary: May baby couldn't tolerate any other milk
review/text: I am so glad that Enfamil made this product. While my daughter was not lactose intolerant, she had a major sensitivity to it. This product has reduced lactose (about 80% less) than regular formulas. The refill box is a better value than purchasing a container each time. Amazon finally had the price lower than my local commissary, and now I will be ordering from here. My daughter tried Similac, Similac Sensitive and Enfamil Newborn, all of which produce watery green stools every 3-6 days. As soon as she got on this formula, she started having bowels every 1-2 days and at the perfect consistiency. This is a great formula for those who need it, and you can't beat the value or price from Amazon.

We were using regular enfamill and were happy with it but thought we would give this a try. It seemed to make a difference within about a week!  He seemed to be less irritable (from the gas pains) .  This is all best on observation alone but I did notice when we switched him back to regular formula for a few days while we awaited our next shipment, he was gassy again. As with most things baby, There is no way to really tell if the formula was the cause/aid but we are going to stick with this type because it seemed to help him out!

review/summary: Absurd purchase quantity limit from Amazon
review/text: My son is a big eater: he's already 20 pounds at 4 months old. Initially we used Enfamil Premium from Costco but the baby spits a lot until we switched to Enfamil Gentlease two months later. What a relief! The amount he spit is greatly reduced. I would recommend this product to anyone has similar problem.<br /><br />But Amzon has an absurd policy that limit the maximal purchase quantity to be ... 3! I can not help thinking what would happen to the baby if every store adopts the same policy as Amazon does. So for "as many customers as possible to be able to enjoy the items we sell" (which is the official reason given by Amazon) each baby is only allowed 3 boxes of infant formula for the whole life time?<br /><br />My advice for Amazon: show some common sense when you make your rules. My advice for people who find this product really helpful: Target sell the same item at the same final price if you google for the $5 coupon.

When the vet examined her, her weight was low as she had not been eating well with all the stress and sickness.  After doing some research online for a good quality food to give her a boost, I tried the Innova Evo cat & kitten food.  I have both the dry and canned and she begs and can't wait for me to put the bowl down with the canned food in it.  After a week of new food and medicine she had gained almost a pound and is doing much better.  Her coat is soft and she is very active.  I would recommend this food to anyone with cats or kittens at home.  I have never seen a cat eat (or beg) like she does with this food.

They inhaled the duck sample EVO I gave them when I came across the new flavor.  It's much more expensive than the original formula.<br />They have super shiny coats and each are at their healthy weight.  We have a 10 yr old, 7 yr old and three 3 yr olds (brothers).

review/summary: Monin Peach Syrup
review/text: I had an "Arnold Palmer" to drink.  This drink is tea and lemonade combined.  The server asked if I would like to add peach flavor.  I agreed and was really taken with the peach flavor "kick."  It tasted like a fresh peach had been added.  The server told me about Monin products so I ordered it for my home use.  Friends are interested in the addition to Arnold Palmer.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Suprisingly Yummy!!!!!
review/text: My hubby just made these tonight.  Wow, they are so yummy and chocolaty.  He used plain Greek yogurt instead of the suggested sour cream to save on fat and to increase the protein amount.  I am really picky about my chocolate.  I was afraid that these would be chalky tasting, but they are far from it.  They are not too sweet, which is a good thing at times.  I don't like super sweet stuff in the mornings, so these are perfect for running out the door breakfasts.  I'm going to be purchasing the other flavors to try them out.

review/summary: Quality Flavorful, Versatile Tea without the Caffeine.
review/text: My search for a good all-purpose decaffeinated tea ended with Twinings English Breakfast Decaf. Twinings English Breakfast is a blend of Ceylon, Kenyan, and Indian teas with a crisp, full-bodied flavor that isn't heavy or bitter. It's a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called "decaffeinated", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. It will keep a few days in the refrigerator.<br /><br />*Lemongrass Tea*<br />This has a smooth, mellow lemon flavor without the acidity of lemon tea: Bring about 3 quarts water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/3 cup powdered sugar cane juice (Sucanat, Florida Crystals, or substitute sugar), and half a stalk of lemongrass, thickly sliced, to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. Serve chilled or over ice.

From high tea at the Savoy to a long summer afternoon of Cricket on the village green.<br /><br /> It's an indulgence and for me it HAS to accompany scones and jam or Victoria sandwich cake.<br /><br /> I'm a loopy excentric Brit, I have to do it this way, but if you are not British and want to try it the traditional way then please do, I urge you! Remember to scorch out your teapot with hot water first and please, please, please, drink only from china cups! This stuff was blended first during the days of the Rhaj so it's an authentic experience. More Tea Vicar???

review/summary: Does no one make a good decaf iced tea?
review/text: I really enjoy Twining caffeinated English breakfast tea. However, I was very disappointed by the decaf version. Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character, leaving only the bitterness behind. The same thing is true for the Lipton Decaffeinated Tea. Since I only drink iced tea, I can't say how this tea is when prepared hot. Buy this tea only as a last resort.

review/text: What was once a great tea has fallen  prey to a worldwide packaged food malady: smaller portions, weaker portions, or artificial ingredient substitutes -- all in the name of cutting costs. In the case of Twining's decaf English Breakfst tea, the amount of tea per bag seems to be shrinking at at alarming rate each year. My latest purchase has turned out to be the weakest tea I've ever had.<br /><br />It's back to loose tea filling a tea`caddy and, hopefully, more flavor.

review/text: Well, I am an american so there's not much to say about many of our teas here. I was recommended PG Tips by my English friend, but I also wanted some decaf tea since I am very sensitive to caffeine and can't drink much if any after about 4:00pm. So I bought my PGTips caffeinated and Twinings decaf since I've heard many people claim they are the best as well. Well, I am no tea expert, but in my opinion the Twinings has a better taste than the PGTips. It's bolder and strangely seems creamier after milk is added. I love both teas, but overall I would choose twinings as far as these two batches I have tested are concerned. Enjoy!

review/summary: Finally, a 5-Star Decaf Tea
review/text: My husband and I use only decaf tea bags.  I had been ordering the<br />Bigelow Decaf English Breakfast Tea from Amazon for a long time, but<br />recently it seems as though they've discontinued it.  I reviewed it<br />a good while ago and gave it 4-stars as we were still searching for<br />a 5-star decaf tea.  So, needing to order tea, I checked out the<br />reviews for some other brands of decaf and I liked what I read about<br />Twinings English Breakfast Decaf Tea.  I decided to try it and am so<br />glad I did.  We really like it much better than Bigelow.  It's much<br />smoother and has more tea flavor; even if you steep it for ten minutes<br />it doesn't get a bitter or off-taste.  Also, it's excellent with lemon<br />which is a must for me.  My husband and I agree that this is as close<br />to a 5-star decaf tea that you can get.  Most of the decaf teas are<br />awful, but this is delicious.  I would highly recommend this to anyone<br />who is looking for a good decaf tea.  I just hope Amazon keeps selling<br />it.  It's well worth the price, and I'm signing up for Subscribe &<br />Save to save even more.

review/summary: Nothing
review/text: Now you may ask why pay to have H20 packed and shipped half way around the world just to be guzzled in a mater of seconds, minutes at the most?<br /><br />Well "nothing" is the reason. Everyday you hear about the odd stuff that is in local water supplies. My favorite statement is "it may look nasty and taste awful but it is perfectly safe." So we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out. Included in this category is a concoction called drinking water; they take everything out and put back what they guess makes water drinkable. The worst sort of stuff is items packed in colorful plastic bottles that taste like colorful plastic.<br /><br />Evian on the other hand is water the way that nature intended. It goes down smooth and has no after taste. It is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature.  Gourmet coffee locations use this as the base water because it does not distract from the taste. The water is even used externally for applying and removing makeup. I keep a case in the car incase of any emergency that may come up.<br /><br />There is "nothing" more satisfying.

review/text: I bought this water because it was cheap.  But let me tell you something, never buy cheap water.  This was literally the worst tasting water I have ever drunk.  It tastes similar to the garbage juice from my grand parent's trailer park waste runoff.  I worked in the septic tank cleaning business for most of my professional life, and a significant part of my job is to clean home septic tanks.  One of the most loathsome parts of my job is the scrubbing of the septic residue that accumulates on the bottom of the tank.  In our business, we call this "poop cheese".  Now I've been retired for many years, but upon opening the bottle of this rank liquid and bringing it to my lips, I remembered ever so vividly the horrors of poop cheese. I almost went into shock and passed out.  I soon regained consciousness, but it was an ordeal I would never wish upon anyone else.  Please avoid this foul-smelling concoction they call water, because it tastes like poop cheese.

review/summary: Best gluten-free pasta, bar none!
review/text: In the 6 years that I've been gluten-free, I have tried EVERY pasta on the market.  Notta Pasta is most like the "real" thing, by far.  I recommend cooking it a little longer than the recommended time, then rinsing with cold water.  Left overs keep well for 2 to 3 days in the fridge.

review/summary: Can't Go Wrong.
review/text: You really can't go wrong with blackeye peas.  They cook up nice and tender but not mooshy, and tasted of real blackeye peas not like the commercial brands that have sugar and other flavors added in....pure natural beans. Excellent.

review/summary: love roasted peas, just not these...
review/text: I have tried many different brands of 'roasted peas' and I have loved them all until now.<br />I did not care for this brand.<br />There is a mildew smell when you get them close to eat them.<br />My family also did not care for this brand, so we will feed them to the birds.<br />They are packaged nicely and came packed well, so that's where the one star came from.

review/summary: Surprised there are no reviews for this excellently addictive snack
review/text: I was looking for roasted green peas that were not Wasabi for my wife.  I know ... crazy ... but she actually doesn't care for wasabi.  Anyway - she was looking for a healthy snack and I recently noticed a nutrition expert on television recommend roasted green peas so I looked to track some down for a good price.  Most of those offered via Amazon Prime were wasabi or had inconsistent reviews.  Decided to take a chance on this item ... so far not reviewed.  Well - I need not look any further.  This one is a winner.  Peas are the perfect crunchy but not too crunchy texture.  Seasoning is very light but just right.  And one can eat 55 of them as one serving - I weighed them.  Not only is my wife fond of them - my kids are as well.  And, although I had picked up another brand of wasabi peas, I had a hard time staying out of this can when one was open.  This one is a keeper.
