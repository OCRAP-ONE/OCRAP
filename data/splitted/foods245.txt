review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

review/summary: Great Crunch. OK Flavor. 100 Calories.
review/text: Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.<br /><br />The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.<br /><br />Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws).

review/summary: Holy Cow!! These Are Scrumptious
review/text: I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

No need to add eggs,milk etc which I am unable to eat.  I read the reviews, so I figured sounds good give it a try.  I really should have tried 1pkg but because I ordered through amazon I had to get 6pkg.  Which really stinks. The taste to me was only so so.  I did add only cinnamon, since my food allergies. Perhaps thats the reason the taste was only so so.  I did not think it was sweet like another reviewer said.  But I was not going to eat them with syrup.  My complaint is that no matter how long I cooked them they always seemed raw inside.  I would not order this kind again.

Its like they put in too much vanilla or something.  To me the whole point of a waffle or pancake is that they be more of a plain base that compliments whatever toppings you choose to put on them.  They shouldn't compete with the flavor of the toppings.  With these being so sweet already it was just way too much.  Seriously, you could just butter and eat them with no additional topping.  Will continue to look for something more akin to original waffles and pancakes.

To enhance the flavor, I will add flavor extracts (vanilla, almond, etc.), and other amendments. These adapt well to chocolate chip pancakes, blueberry pancakes, etc.<br /><br />There is a bit of an art to getting the consistency right, and getting a good consistency is key to getting them cooked all the way through. I find it helps if the pan isn't over-hot, but hot enough.<br /><br />We've been known to take this mix along with us on family outings to restaurants. Because they're so simple to make, most restaurants are understanding about using our mix, since they often don't have egg-free, dairy-free, wheat-free options.

review/text: My son (age 7) has several food allergies.  This is by far the best pancake mix! To one full bag, I add two scoops of sugar, cinnamon and pure vanilla extract.  When adding water, I make sure the batter is a little thick.  The pancakes, when cooked on a medium heat griddle are the perfect consistency and delicious.  I have tried every mix on the market for those with wheat, nut, dairy, egg, sesame and peanut/legume allergies.  This mix has the best flavor and consistency.  it is definitely worth the money!

review/summary: Looking for gluten and soy free
review/text: I recently found out through testing that my son has gluten and soy allergy among many others.  My son is also extremely sensitive to texture and flavor.<br />This mix was the only one that had a mild flavor, none of that bean flour that is so over powering and the texture was very close to wheat pancakes.  It was almost<br />a seamless switch for my son.  The biscuit recipe that can be made with this mix is also very good, just have to get used to flatter shape biscuits.  This mix is also easy to<br />customize like adding egg or flax seed (egg substitute) for more protein and Omega-3's.<br />I also recommend trying the other mixes from this company.<br /><br />Healthy in Colorado

review/summary: Delicious waffles!
review/text: I have eaten waffles made from this mix for over a year now and I still love them.  I am a gluten-intolerant, dairy-intolerant type II diabetic so my options for waffle mixes are limited.  I was so glad to find Craving Place pancake and waffle mix although I was skeptical at first about anything tasting good that was "gluten free, wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free and bean free."  My thought was, "What's left to give it flavor?"  I was won over by my first bite of crispy/fluffy goodness. I've experimented with added ingredients over the course of the year.  My favorites are adding about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon along with 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to a batch of waffle mix (since cinnamon is good for diabetics).  I just top the waffle with margarine and thus avoid having to use sugary toppings like syrup.  I can only eat 1/2 a waffle at a time bcause it does affect my blood sugar level too much if I have a full one.  I find the extra waffles last all week without refrigeration.

The only thing you add is water, which makes it perfect for kids to make or to cart off on a backpacking trip.

Cravings place TASTES sooo good that my boys have no idea that I am using "healthy" ingredients when serving baked goods or pancakes and waffles. Thank you so much for such an EASY and delicious product. Our family times at the breakfast table actually happen more often now because they all know they will enjoy the food and the company.

review/summary: disgusting taste...do not be fooled it is NOT low carb
review/text: This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I threw away the entire order (since I could not return I opened one package and made pancakes...they were so bad I tried to feed them to my dog but she would not eat them either). Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a much better product by ordering the REAL Atkins pancake and baking mix, which I will do next time! Do not be fooled by this company.

review/summary: Thank you all from the producer of the honey!
review/text: Dear honey lovers!<br /><br />My name is Jan, from Attiki-Pittas, the producer of Attiki. Thank you all very much for sharing your opinion on our honey. As you'll understand, this is always great for us to learn about! I hadn't seen these reviews before, that's why this is a bit of a late reply. Sorry for that.<br /><br />Honey Attiki is a multi flower honey, a blend of Greek honeys from the wild: flowers, thyme and coniferous.<br /><br />@ Tudor: I just wanted to assure you that our honey is as pure as it comes from the beehive. There are no processes involved that diminish the unique health and quality beneficial values of the honey, nor do we use any additives. It is a 100% natural, 100% pure and 100% Greek honey, with all the related benefits.<br /><br />Thanks to great periods of sunshine combined with unique landscape characteristics, Greek honey is highly concentrated. The honey is gathered from a variety of around 6000 different types of natural flowers, herbs and trees, 600 of which are only found in Greece.<br /><br />In Greece we have about 80% of the year sunshine. Besides the fact that this is obviously pretty great to live in, you also know that sunshine means health and healing. All this is what Greek honey represents. It is great for your health and it has so many benefits for your body and even mind (stress relief, against insomnia, to name some) that you really treat yourself on something exceptional when you eat Greek honey and Attiki, as the most popular honey from Greece, is celebrated for its great taste.<br /><br />If it interests you, Greek honey is one of the most studied honeys in the world and if you Google it, you will find quite some information about all the specific qualities and uses of it. If you like to know more about Attiki, you can always contact me: info (AT> attiki-pittas &lt;DOT) gr, to the attention of Jan.<br /><br />Sweet greetings from Greece!

review/summary: Fantastic health product that tastes great!  Now THIS is real honey!
review/text: We all know and have heard of the benefits of pure, organic honey that is not adulterated or pasteurized.  There are countless articles on the internet that describe the health and even curative benefits of pure honey.  Greek mountain honey is no exception.  It is truly one of the last great tasting honeys of the world, with health benefits if imbibed in reasonable amounts.  This honey tastes very different than the typical, commercial and pasteurized junk you find on your mass supermarket shelves, so at first, you may be unsure about the taste.  Rest assured that not only is this honey delicious, with amazing flavor and notes- it is also one of the healthiest and purest honeys made by unique bees that differ from the ones in North America.  I even used a Greek honey and organic cinnamon/lemon juice regimen to rid myself of a cough and sore throat due to a flu! It worked like a charm.

Pricier than your standard supermarket honey, but well worth it. Recommended.

review/summary: Shockingly good!
review/text: I don't usually like domestic lagers especially from large brewing companies.  This however is a wonderful example of the fuller European style, something akin to a full bodied Belgian Lager.  So easy to make. I recommend getting the full kit which has appropriate malts and sugars and the carbonation drops!  I live in New Hampshire and I brewed this in January when it was very cold.  After the initial fermentation it's been sitting in the bottle at around 50 degrees for a couple of months. The larger yeasts can survive at these cold temps where an ale yeast couldn't.<br /><br />This is so good I think I'm going to have to brew another batch so it will be ready for summer!

review/text: I love this Kcup for summer. The product is not too sweet and I load it up with extra fresh lemon juice and its so delicious and light tasting. I don't taste any kind of aftertaste or artifical flavor.  I admit, I water it down quite a bit though (just a preference along with the lemon juice).  When I brew this Kcup, I use the maximum water amount (I have the mini brewer) which I believe is 12 oz...for me, this gives two large glasses of tea once I've added ice and lemon. I also cool the tea off before drinking...I realized that actually brewing it over a cup of ice significanly waters down the product (I believe it is intended to be that way) but if I cool it off, then I can water it down at my discretion, not add as much ice, and I end up with more tea from the Kcup.  Enjoy it~!

review/text: I used my 24 oz Tervis Tumbler with mine (I had to go in at an angle). My husband used a 16 oz glass. His was pretty much filled to the brim (we used the large option on our brewer, which is a 3-setting one). To get the perfect amount of sweetness, I put in one packet of sugar (I use stevia in the raw) and then ran the brew system, then added another packet on top. What is nice is you get a lot more of a beverage because it melts the majority of the ice when it brews. In the larger size, you have a bit more ice remaining to cool off the tea. I'm so glad we got these.

They are a delicious, thin, biscuit, but I would describe it more like the perfect shortbread cracker- but it's not chalky or crumbly like most shortbread sometimes tastes. It's lightly sweet and crisp, easy munching makes it perfect on the go. They would go great on a biscuit tray with champagne, wine, or cheese, and you can top almost anything on it. (Peanut Butter, Icing, Marmalade, etc.) I like mine just the way they are though. :)<br /><br />I was really excited when I found these on Amazon, since I hadn't seen these in the US.

review/summary: GREAT food, my dog Loves it!
review/text: I adopted a dog in Oct. 2007, and started trying different foods... grocery brands, Mighty dog, Iams, Eukanuba, and so forth, in various formulations. She will eat almost anything, whether or not it agrees with her intestinal system, but I wanted something healthy for her that would not have us running for the outdoor potty all day (or night) long.  She liked Iams, but ended up being constipated half the time, also unpleasant! I saw some trial-sized bags in a pet store, and bought a couple. OMG, can I say my dog loves this food AND it agrees with her system? In addition to it being a great food (check out the ingredients), I can literally give her pieces of this as treats and rewards, she likes it that much.  So many people who saw her when I first got her, and see her now, are extremely impressed at how much better she looks too. Since no one food is perfect for every dog, I highly recommend trying a small bag first, and then see if your dog likes it as much as mine does.  As much as she likes it, I think she actually eats a bit less of it, because it's denser in calories, proteins and vitamins than most other foods, so it works out pricewise to be reasonable. I've also given it to my foster dogs, and their coats also improved on this food.

I highly recommend and am thankful in the days of $4.00 plus gasoline to have such a heavy purchase delivered to my door for a total price, including shipping that is fair and reasonable.  The quality has been so high I will be trying other Honeyville bulk staples.

review/summary: Tasty Chocolate Treat
review/text: I saw these in the supermarket at the checkout line and picked up the clusters. I figured they would taste bland and not be satisfying for the chocolate craving. While there aren't many in the package, I think five or six clusters, they are tasty and definitely fix your urge for something sweet.<br /><br />I love the clusters and the peanut butter bar. The regular chocolate bar is tasty but I prefer it mixed with caramel or peanut butter. They are between 110-120 calories which is a great little snack, equivalent to some of the other snack bars like Special K.<br /><br />The bars are heavenly crisps (think nutty bar but thinner). So they are wafers with chocolate or peanut butter between each layer.<br /><br />I love this variety back and thought it was a good value. I paid $1.25 for the clusters at the grocery store so under a dollar a snack works for me.<br /><br />Highly suggest to those watching their calories but unable to kick their sweet tooth. Quick shipping too.

review/text: Of course it's not like Hidden Valley regular ranch but you can use it as a dip for veggies. I tried using it as a spread on a ham wrap and it was too much for one wrap. Too salty for me but then I use Mrs Dash a lot so I guess I'm kind of sensitive with salt. It's nice though that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so you can take it with you. I thought the taste was okay and the texture thin, not watery, but just thin.<br /><br />Take care all

review/summary: Great Gluten Free option, portable and tasty
review/text: One of the difficult parts of dealing with Celiac disease is finding foods to safely eat while on the road.  In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully.  By bringing our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick.  While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is!  If it really is GF and also free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick.  This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.<br /><br />This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is about the right size to put on a Subway or Wendy's salad if you prefer your own dressing.  My wife takes this in her lunches too.  If you don't need the packets, you can save some money by buying a larger bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you.  You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.<br /><br />In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:<br />Italian Salad Dressing<br />Ranch Salad Dressing<br />Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing<br /><br />As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is the best ranch dressing we have found.  It's not as thick as Hidden Valley Farms and a little less sweet.  Hidden Valley isn't an option in our home due to our need to be GF.  If you don't mind some calories, a great GF Ranch Dressing is from Kens Steak House.  My kids prefer Kens Ranch to Walden Farms Ranch but they are not worried about calories or sugar at their age yet.<br /><br />It's amazing that these Walden Farms dressings can taste as good as they do with no calories, no sugar, no gluten, and even no fat!  Not all of the dressings taste great, but this flavor is really good.<br /><br />4 stars as one of my wife's favorite dressings.

review/text: I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker-type product that I can find, i.e., it's a reasonably healthy food.  Of course, the downside is that it doesn't taste  good.  I couldn't possibly eat it plain.  Instead, I spread on some healthy (i.e., no salt, no sugar, etc.) peanut butter, homemade hummus, or homemade guacamole.  That makes for a decent (but certainly not delicious) snack.  I often wonder if all this healthy eating is worth it.

review/summary: The perfect crunch and good for you too
review/text: It would be hard to beat this variety of Ryvita for flavor and crunch.  Two make a satisfying snack and three make breakfast!  They go well with sweet or savory foods or fruit.  Try them with a good soup for lunch or crumbled into salad instead of croutons.  Personally I much prefer Ryvita to the thicker heavier crispbreads like Wasa which are sometimes just too robust (though do stand up very well to spreading with nut butters)or the very thin type (like Primula -which is hard to find in North America). The box protects the crispbread from breakage and the whole package of 10 boxes was well packed and arrived with no signs of damage.

review/text: The robust flavor of black pepper is a favorite at our house so when I received this Black Pepper Western Cut beef jerky as part of a gift, I couldn't wait to open it. I like the thinness of the Western Cut jerky because it lets you really taste the flavor of the seasonings. The taste of fresh black pepper comes through loud and clear in each piece of this jerky. The brown sugar flavor is more subtle and keeps the black pepper under control.  Very tasty! The resealable package makes it easy to keep a healthy snack in my desk drawer. I can't wait to get more of the black pepper jerky, very glad that Choo Choo R Snacks is quick with their shipping.

review/summary: While definitely not gourmet fare, more than adequate for a light lunch.
review/text: I am not now nor have I ever been a gourmet. Which probably explains why I like most of the items I've tried in the Hormel Compleats line, including this Beef Steak & Peppers with Savory Sauce and Noodles.<br /><br /> I work at home and don't really want to spend a lot of time on food preparation. Not every meal has to be a grand feast for me.<br /><br />In short, I guess I have a high tolerance for mediocre food.<br /><br />There's no question that Hormel Compleats are processed food. They have to be compared with other comparable quick meals, frozen or canned. In terms of convenience, the Compleats score high in some regards and very poorly on others. Preparation is 90 seconds in the microwave. That's it. Then the hard part - getting the thing opened. I've finally just stopped trying to peel back the plastic-like cover and instead just cut around it.<br /><br />The Beef Steak & Peppers is free of any chemical smell and taste. The beef Is cut and probably pressed into uniform strips. The gravy is almost gelatin like in term of density. The noodles are tender. But aesthetically, much is left to be desired.<br /><br />In all, while far from the equivalent of a five-star meal, the Compleats Beef & Peppers is reasonably tasty and, as a quick lunch, filling. I very much doubt a fancier of fine food would eat a Compleats even if their survival were at stake. But for a convenient lunch at home, they fill the bill quite nicely.<br /><br />Jerry

review/text: I accidentally left my lunch in my car when I went to work one day and it went bad.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to go out to pick up lunch, so I turned to the vending machine.  Luckily, a Hormel Beef Steak and Peppers was available!  It did its job, it filled me.  However, it was disgusting.  It was a globby, mushy, brown mess.  I did not taste like beef and peppers.  It was more like a beef gravy that was put over way overcooked noodles.  But, like an earlier poster said, it's GREAT for dieters!  I often eat Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers.  Usually they're pretty tasty, but they're very tiny.  The Hormel meal was only 210 calorie and significantly more filling than the Healthy Choice one.

review/text: The flavor of this chai tea is hardly authentic- it's more dessert like than anything, and perhaps thats what is so great about it. If you are looking for an ultra spicy, complex chai this ain't it. If you are looking for rich, soothing decadence, look no further. It literally tastes like a liquid snickerdoodle cookie (those sugar cookies with cinnamon baked in). My only criticism is that you need quite a bit of powder to make a flavorful cup, and it takes a moderate about of effort to make sure the powder has fully dissolved.

review/summary: Izze Sparkling Blueberry Soda
review/text: I love izze sparkling soda, they are so tasty and refreashing.  This one does not really have a blueberry taste but that is a hard flavor to mimic so for the flavor that this soda did taste like it was very nice.  It taste alot like the blackberry only more tart, I like it but pomegranate is my favorite so far from the flavores that I have tried.

review/text: Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good.  This one, unfortunately, is not.  All I can taste in it is apple juice.

review/summary: Brilliant bulk buy
review/text: I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.

review/summary: Excellent tasting tea.
review/text: I have tried many OOlong teas and this is by far the best.  It has a wonderfully light coconut, mango flavor.  The two flavors blend well together, neither one overpowering the other.  I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: an excellent cuppa
review/text: really nice tea, and smells wonderful. I enjoy it with a teaspoon of "sugar in the raw."  Stores well as is wrapped in foil. I usually buy the box of 100 teabags since it is an excellent value

review/summary: A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/text: Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. Not recommended.

review/summary: Somewhat Bland, But A Superior Nutrient Mix.
review/text: Tonight I had a light lettuce-based salad for dinner and, to go with it, I opened up an 18.6-ounce can of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup (Healthy Request Variety). I thought it to be a rather bland-tasting chicken noodle  soup, but that's because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content. This one is relatively low and, in fact, the potassium content is higher than the sodium content, which is almost unheard of in Campbell's soups. It's fairly low in calories also so a whole can (two servings) only amounted to 220 calories. Also, the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high. I'm surprised they don't label this a "diet soup." Both the spiral noodles and the vegetables (carrots and celery) are fairly large and "chunky" and all seem bland and overcooked. I would not regard this soup as a particularly good one, but if you want to open a can of soup for a meal, the mix of nutrients is superior to most.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for the Office
review/text: This size bag is great for filling up the office candy dishes that some offices keep around for public grazing (I'm my own best customer). Mix of candy is good, no complaints from anyone. Large enough bag that it lasts for more than a few days.  Candy was fresh (I sampled several just to make sure). Price is about what I'd pay for the equivalent amount of candy if I went to the local grocery store.
