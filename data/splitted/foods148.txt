review/summary: Beyond basic...
review/text: A lot of the other reviewers describe this as basic, sort of low-end but decent tea--I think it goes beyond that.  It is strong and it will get bitter if the brewing temperature is too high--so don't let the water boil!  My husband and I have been drinking this tea for years now, and while we've tried much more expensive teas such as Teavana, we keep coming back to this over and over.  It's our favorite and if it's brewed just right it has a tangy, smoky complexity that's just unbeatable.  I always get sick of drinking other teas after awhile, but I never, ever get tired of this one.  I drink it throughout the day--it's good hot or iced.  How nice to find it on Amazon in bulk.

review/summary: The Crowning Green Tea
review/text: Green Tea is amazing! I was first exposed to it while stationed in Okinawa many years ago. At first I did not like the taste because I was used to that cheap orange pekoe Lipton junk I grew up with. But after a day or two, I was hooked. Twinnings has captured that classic Green Tea energy. This tea is both relaxing and energizing, which makes it difficult to both describe and explain. However, when you try a tin, you will know what I mean. We now buy all our teas on Amazon because they have made it most affordable and very, very easy. Kudos to both Amazon and Twinnings...a winning combination!

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: This has been my favorite tea for more than a decade but I can't find it locally. I had been ordering directly from Twining but placed this order with Amazon because of the free shipping for orders over $25.00 which saves me at least $1.00 per tin. Saving a buck is always exciting to one of Scots descent and since I drink a pot every day, it can add up over time.

review/summary: good tea. reusable canisters.
review/text: A very good quality gundpowder tea. The canisters are very nice, though rather wasteful if you don't reuse them. Fortunately they are very useful. I keep some in a hardware drawer for nails, tacks, etc. I keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk. The containers keep a good seal for freshness, yet are easy to open. I label the tops and keep a "disposable" plastic spoon inside each for measuring. If you can't use them, give them away ( Freecycle, Craigslist).

review/summary: Best value Gunpowder Green Tea
review/text: The price on this product was just right.  After searching (and failing) to find ANY loose Gunpowder Green Tea at any of my local grocery stores, I resorted to Amazon, and Twinings came through.  The tea is very fresh and comes separately packaged in 6 tins.  Although I personally would prefer a larger single tin (I'm already through tin 1 of the set), this does ensure freshness for the rest of the tea.

review/summary: Very Good Green Tea
review/text: Where I'm located, my choices for loose green tea are practically non-existent.  I had found and tried this Twinings Gunpowder Green (loose) tea at a local Fresh Market.  I enjoyed it, but getting to that store (and their having it in stock) was troublesome.  I was very happy to see the same tea on Amazon for a bit over a dollar LESS (per tin) than my local cost (not including my travel time or tolls paid).  The tea has a very nice flavor (FAR better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QPU">Stash Premium Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> which was the other green tea I'd found locally).  It also has a good color and aroma.  One of the things I like about gunpowder tea is that it's easy to portion out.  I scoop out 1 level teaspoon of tea and use it for two full serving in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a>.  The tea leaves are of sufficient quality that there are almost no fragments, so nothing gets through the infuser but the flavor.  If I were a tea purist, I'd probably have some issue with the fact that the gunpowder rolls of leaves are not as tight as they should be and the spent leaves look like they're somewhat irregular.  But, considering that this tea is many times less expensive than the high quality stuff from the specialty shops, I'm very happy with it.  The one thing I'm just a touch worried about is storage.  The six tins in this package will last me many months.  Since each tin is opaque and is sealed with an aluminum film, I figured the best location for storing the tea until I moved it to my "in-use" spot would be the refrigerator.  The tin and the film should keep light and moisture out and the temperature fluctuations should be minimal.  But, I still worry a bit.  Still, I'm very pleased with the tea and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.

review/summary: Wow this stuff is strong..
review/text: Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product.

review/summary: A bit waxy, but has all the health benefits
review/text: This is not your typical honey. Granted its organic and cream colored although it is not creamed honey. It is "pure" honey in the truest definition. The texture is solid, dense, somewhat waxy and velvety smooth with a pleasant floral taste. It describes itself as a gel, but I think it is much denser and although one gets a 1# jar, it is a small weighty jar. It softens easily on a piece of warm toast which is heavenly (no butter needed) or simply enjoy eating a spoonful by letting it melt in your mouth for a sensual treat. Due to its cost, which I think it is worth every cent, I won't be using it in tea. I'll continue using Rain Forest organic honey also sold on Amazon for that purpose. I think of this American/Canadian made honey as a true health food as it has numerous benefits. If you ever purchased the creamed South of France honey in the pail that Amazon used to carry, this honey's flavor and texture(when softened)will remind you of that incredible French honey. This is now my favorite honey. I encourage you to visit YS Organic Bee Farms website for additional information as they are a remarkable company. Also to comment on Swanson, the company that sold it, they were quick to fulfill and ship the order, both jars were well packed, they thanked me for my order a couple of times and sent a coupon for $5 off a future order which can be used in a direct order w/ them or on Amazon. So you know I'll be reordering this delightful honey and a few lucky friends may also receive a jar.

review/summary: Best Honey on the Planet!!! And I have tried a LOT...
review/text: I have been buying this Honey for 5 years, since I first was lucky enough to find it in an Organic Grocery Store. I have tried every kind of organic/raw honey brand out there, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and this is by far the best flavor and the best price. Like the other review, I also think of this more as a "cream" consistency than as a "gel", and it is just heavenly that way. It melts down easy on warm bread or in warm tea, and it is just jam packed with all the flavor and health benefits that have been stripped from all of the runny honey that are filtered inferiors (that are clear in color because of it)that are found at big grocery store chains. If you are lucky enough to find a raw unfiltered honey at a place like that, expect to pay a small forture for it. Go to your local Organic Grocery and you will find a great selection of good honey for a good price, but be prepared, only Y.S Organic Raw Honey is the best and unfortunately it is not commonly found locally, as I have moved several times and have discovered for myself. Amazon has the best prices and the biggest jar sizes I have ever found of this amazing honey, so this is the ONLY place I buy!!! They also have a 22oz size, but sadly it comes in a plastic jar instead of glass, which is just sad since anything stored long term in plastic can "leech" chemicals from the plastic into your foods...so I only buy the largest they offer in glass (16oz). If you are debating about trying an Organic/Raw honey, or switching to a new brand, LOOK NO FURTHER. This is one purchase you will NOT regret and you will be a customer for life!!!!

review/summary: it tastes good but it's hard to notice any difference
review/text: Years ago, when living on the east coast I suffered from asthma despite the fact that I was on four different medications.  After moving here to Arizona, I've been able to completely take myself off of all medications.  More recently however, my father passed away and apparently my emotional reaction triggered one of the worst asthma attacks I've had in years.  For the past two weeks, I've been gasping for air even after walking a short distance and could not even say a few words to people without gasping for air and panting.  My asthma became so bad this time that I contemplated going to the emergency room because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Instead what I did was do breathing exercises, bio-feedback, meditation and prayer.  While in the health food store I came across this tea, purchased it and staggered home to prepare it.  After drinking some, I noticed a little difference in breathing after about 30 minutes.  But I was thinking that it may not be the tea but simply because I sat down and relaxed for a while.  After drinking 3 or 4 cups of this tea a day using two tea bags, I honestly did not notice any significant difference in breathing.  The only thing significantly different was the fact that I started coughing up more flim, but that just could be that the asthma attack was running its course or the fact that I was drinking more fluids.<br /><br />The tea definately tastes good.  It has slight mint flavor which cools your mouth when the air is drawn in.  There is also a slight sweet and pleasant bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I quickly finished up two boxes of this tea.  I may buy some more later because I really like the taste.  As far as it treating asthma and other respiratory problems, it was simply hard to tell.  IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, THIS TEA WILL NOT RESTORE FREE BREATHING.<br /><br />Only a few days ago, my asthma has been dramatically clearing up.  I worked out yesterday and am able to do strenuous exercise without panting and wheezing like I was doing last week.  I very seriously doubt that the tea had a delayed effect.  Last week, I didn't want to do it but I staggered into a drug store and purchased an inhaler (I hate using those things because they contain epinephrine).  I had two choices, either I keep suffering and kill myself or restore my breathing.

I eat them in circumstances when I would drink gatorade.

review/summary: More about electrolyte balance than energy
review/text: I drink plenty of water when I'm active but I don't like any type of sports drinks due to them causing me heartburn. I picked up a couple packs of these at REI ($2 ea.) the other day since I was already considering a case purchase from Amazon. I enjoyed them on my last bike ride and I feel like they helped replace valuable electrolytes that plain water just won't deliver.<br /><br />The beans themselves: Delicious. I doubt I could tell the difference in taste OR texture between these and regular candy jelly beans. I recommend drinking water while consuming these beans. If you eat two or three without water you may notice (like I did) the beans settle a bit heavy. The water really facilitates the electrolyte/carbo distribution throughout the bloodstream.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you have an aversion to sports drinks for any reason, these sport beans offer an excellent source of electrolytes and some carbs. I feel like they help make the most of my water and my water helps make the most of them. Like another reviewer, I did NOT find any measurable or significant gain in energy but feel like they help balance valuable electrolytes. The Jelly Belly Sport Beans will be with me from now on when I'm working out but if you are looking for an energy boost along the lines of "5 hour energy" you may want to try something else. Jelly Belly does have a caffeinated version of this product but I have not tried it yet. Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: I have used  various sports supplements over the years in biking, skiing and hockey. None created any problems. I decided to try the Sports Beans and use them when I do my 4 hour road bike rides. They would have been more convient and bulky then food or other products. I comsumed three bags. I noticed no energy benefit and in fact road only three hours instead of four. The worst was yet to come. At 2 am in the morning I awoke with severe teeth acres. This product had caused my teeth to become infected and I ended up going an Urgent Care for pain meds and amoxicillin. Looking closely at the ingredients the top two are EVAPORATED CANE JUICE and TAPIOCA SYRUP. Jelly Belly is a candy company not into sports nutrition and that's what this product is. Candy misrepresented as a sports supplement. BEWARE. Avoid unless you have bullet proof teeth. Many better and safer products on the market.

review/summary: Much better than what I've been using.
review/text: I've been using another type of ant gel for a couple of years now.<br /><br />It worked OK, but it has some less than desirable qualities that are improved on by this product.<br /><br />First the Hot Shot really attracts the ants much better.  Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.<br /><br />This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.<br /><br />The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started, that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.<br /><br />Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch, an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.  This product is less noticeable.<br /><br />The tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevices.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/summary: Poor Delivery System
review/text: I need a repellent to keep the ants from climbing the pole outside on my deck where my hummingbird feeder hangs full of sugar water.  I bought the HOT SHOT because it had a similar delivery system to COMBAT that I liked and previously used.  The opening on the HOT SHOT syringe is 1/4", on the COMBAT about 1/8".  The HOT SHOT syringe didn't work smoothly consequently I got big globs and blobs of gel, frequently in places I didn't want it, because the syringe kept sticking. I would  have to replace the HOT SHOT two more times to get through the summer ant problem  whereas with the COMBAT I was better able to target a specific area with a smooth delivery  without excess in unwanted places.  One purchase of the COMBAT lasted the whole summer.  The COMBAT has a tight fitting cap for the end of the syringe so there is no oozing or drying of the product.  I found the COMBAT and will continue using it.

review/summary: Works well!
review/text: Every spring we get little black ants in the home.  It's like a mini invasion in a couple of locations around the house.  Our first invasion this year came to my bathroom, and it wasn't a huge problem.  I'd squish 30-50 ants per day, and really, my main complaint is that I don't like little insects crawling on my stuff.  They're small, but they aren't clean, and there are lots of 'em!<br /><br />This product stopped the current invasion completely within three days.  When Hot Shot arrived on Wednesday, I placed a two-inch bead of gel along the crack they seemed to be using, wiped up a little residue, and found that the following day I only squished three ants, the next day squished one or two, and today I haven't seen any.<br /><br />The product may not work as well for all types of ant and insect problems, but for my situation, it's been perfect.  I hope the active ingredients are stable, because for my use, the amount of bait provided will last a lifetime.

review/summary: It works...kind of...
review/text: Not impressed with this stuff at all.  Even though it's a tad expensive, I figured I would be getting my money's worth.  Nope!  You get a lot of clear gel bait in one tube and that's about the only good thing I can say.  The gel comes out insanely fast and sloppy and I could never manage to moderate it to a slow and steady release.  Once set, the ants barely even noticed it was there.  If I had to guess, I'd say that maybe 5-10% of the ants coming in and out of my house ever fell for the trap.  Some would just go near it and then walk away.  It managed to kill off a few, but not the colony.  Not even close.  The guy who gave it a 5-star review must not have heard of Combat.  MUCH better bait.  On the plus side, Hot Shot still makes great killing sprays.  But their bait is very disappointing.

The only negative is that the syringe is a little tough to push at first and I shot out too much.  But just be aware of that and you should be good.

review/text: My experience with this was a disaster. The first push on the applicator sent gobs of the bait all over the place.  Because of the size of the tube's opening, you cannot control the amount of bait you apply. With a slight pressure on the applicator nothing comes out; anything stronger and you have a mess.  I have no idea how the bait itself works- I had to clean it all up.

review/text: This is a lighter version of Earl Grey tea and has a pleasant citrus undertone and bouquet. When you open the tin (which is well designed, pleasing to the eye and also worth keeping as a container for all sorts of small objects) and look inside, you are pleasantly surprised with a colourful mixture of full leaf black tea, leaves of dried blue cornflowers and small bits of citrus peel. We first tried the tea bags, which were handy, however, we prefer the loose tea.  If you like Earl Grey tea try this one you will like it!

That being the bonus of this tea, you can add half of what you'd normally add to Earl grey [cream, lemon, honey] and save yourself a few calories.<br /><br />This is not a watered down version of Earl Grey, just a delicate tea.

review/summary: A Tea for Beautiful Woman and Their Equally Handsome Men
review/text: If you try to buy tea in one of our major cities and are approached by some limp-wristed purveyor trying to sell you one of his "artisanal" blends packaged in a paper bag with an attractive or colorful label, do not scoff but leave the premises in as diplomatic, and polite manner you can muster.  Tea has been and always will be an expensive commodity, and with good reason; its irresistible flavor depends on volatile compounds either inherent in the tea or added to enhance its finished flavor. The operative word here is "volatile" which is synonymous with "fleeting" and in the world of tea quality, packaging is everything. With Twinings tea you are getting a tea with the maximum protection; a foil-sealed metal can, for goodness sake.  Twinings delivers it to you with the understanding that you will enjoy the flavor that they meant for you to have so that you may return to them as a source of quality teas again and again.  Of course, once you've opened the can it's up to you to keep the can closed after use until the tea is all gone. I prefer loose tea and Twinings is my supplier of choice.  Twinings has so many varieties for you to choose from, there really is no reason to go elsewhere. We may have sent those Redcoats back to England with their tails between their legs but we still have a lot to learn from them when it comes to tea. Lady Grey is an especially tasty blend, you'll enjoy it.

review/text: With English parents, I grew up drinking many many pots of tea. I used to hold Earl Grey as may favourite until I stumbled across Lady Grey.  If you enjoy Earl Grey you will love this tea.  The aroma is magnificent and the flavour excellent.  It is smoother that Earl Grey and even when over brewed lacks the acidity and overpowering tannins that darker blacks can produce.  The nose of the tea greatly enhances the drinking experience.  Don't miss out on a possible favourite!

The order was shipped same day I placed it, and was received by UPS straight to my door in 2 days.  Because I live in an out of the way place, regular mail is delivered more than 1/2 mile away from my home, so all packages shipped regular mail have to be picked up at the post office, which is very inconvienent. Also, Lady Grey is almost unheard of in my area and totaly nonexistant in the loose tea form.  I will order this way again. Thanks for the wonderful service.

review/text: The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called "Pouchkine" or "Afternoon Earl Grey" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers).

review/summary: Excellent Tea, excellent service
review/text: If you havn't tried Lady Grey, try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best everyday teas I've found, with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors, it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day.  Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time.

review/summary: Wierd odor
review/text: I love Twinings Lady Grey but the most recent batch was pretty bad. Regardless of how I brew it I get an odd odor that masks the characteristic Lady Grey aroma. I used some older tea under exactly the same conditions and got a perfect cup. I've got 6 tins of this stuff and it is a lost cause.

review/summary: misslabeled, terrible customer support
review/text: I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.

review/text: The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy.  Despite  the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers, this is a regrettable purchase.  I was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than Twinings' Earl Grey but instead I got something that seems very herbal.  Blech.  I disagree with the positive reviews.

review/summary: wonderful for cats with UTI's
review/text: My young neutered male cat suffered a sudden and complete urinary blockage two years ago from struvite crystal formation, and spent almost a week in the hospital with a catheter inserted and frequent bladder flushing. Painful and life-threatening for the cat, and expensive and heart-breaking for me. He survived, and the vet put him on a prescription diet, but it was costly, hard to get, and worst of all the cat hated it. I tried the Pro Plan (with my vet's approval) and it's great! The cat loves it, and we have had no reoccurences of trouble (knock wood)! I also use the Pro Plan canned food for urinary tract health in conjunction with the dry food. Cat is healthy and happy. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Everyday essential!
review/text: I drink a LOT of water.  I have my Thermos Intak bottle with me 24/7, even on my bedstand at night.  I've began referring to it as my security blanket.  But as people do, I wanted something a little different, natural, and portable.  ENTER CRYSTAL LIGHT PURE!<br /><br />This stuff is delicious!  A better alternative to sports drinks, better for the environment (cutting back on waste), and I'm assuming more cost effective.  The Tropical Blend is my favorite.  It's complex, sweet, but not too sweet, with a little tartness.  There's also the flexibility with these packets to make it as strong or as weak as you want it.<br /><br />I've even started mixing it with iced tea at restaurants!  Arnie Palmers, eat your heart out!<br /><br />All in all, great bang for your buck, go ahead and try it.  You know you're getting sick of all that high fructose stuff you put in your body anyway!

Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: I'd started a long time ago purchasing this product from a local organic/natural food store.  I don't allow regular cheetos in the house because of what's in them and this one is allowed because of what's not. When you find artificial preservatives/flavor enhancers in food that's not good for anyone, and if someone has a learning disability those preservatives can make those kind of symptoms worse.  If you can pronounce it, you probably shouldn't be eating it.  This a  very tasty and much healthier crunchy snack that can be enjoyed by anyone.

This product tastes "seaweedy" so if you're not a fan, I'd go else where or use very small amounts to get your iodine fix... but I happen to love the taste so it works well!

review/summary: Rainbow jimmies
review/text: I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.  The package didn't look like the picture, but I was not disappointed in the product.  I would buy from this company again.

review/summary: Perfect for our cupcakes!
review/text: We chose a Thing 1/Thing 2 theme for our twins' first birthday party, and these sprinkles were the perfect color. They lean more towards turquoise than a true blue, but with our red baking cups, and white frosting, they were the perfect finishing touch!
