review/summary: Best pearl barley on the market
review/text: This is the best quality Barley I have found on line.  Strong good flavor.  The brand<br />from Denmark taste bland and washed out of flavor.  Arrowhead mills organic is high quality.<br />I will stay with this brand.  Using Barley water has gotten me off all sodas.  It keeps from hunger between meals, it prevents UTI and acid reflux as well as being a high quality health<br />tonic.  It is also the sports drink of England.

review/text: Purchased an 8 pack of Adolph's Marinade in Minutes (Original) because I can no longer find it in local markets.  Have tried researching it and much of what I have read seems to indicate it has been discontinued.  I am so saddened by this.  I have used it for many years and it does such a wonderful job of tenderizing and flavoring meats ( I use it mostly on sirloin tip steaks before cutting up into kebabs for the grill.  Everyone always raved about how good my kebabs were!  I hope Adolph's will reconsider if they are indeed discontinuing this product.

review/text: I have used Adolph's Meat Marinade since the early 80's.  I have not been able to get it in the stores for 10 years.  In that time I've tried so many different marinades and seasonings I can't even count them.  I was totally frustrated.  Then I found AMM on Amazon and ordered it right away.  I marinade the steaks over night.  AMM gives the steaks a perfect amount of flavor and makes them tender.  I love it!

review/summary: Try it
review/text: First lets say that this is not the healthyist product that you will ever eat. So don't use it every day.<br />  BUT, what it does is take a very TOUGH cut of meat, and tenderize it, and add flavor. I buy CHEAP round roasts, slice them into steaks, and let them soak in this solution for an hour or two. Then grill as I normally would.<br /> The ingredient in question is BROMELAIN. It's from pineapples, but it is known to raise blood pressure, (just temporary). But so does eating pineapples.<br />  It is very hard to find this product in Toledo, OH area stores, so I purchase it through Amazon, it's a lot cheaper also.<br />  I would have given it 5 stars, except for the Bromelain, but it is the ingredient that takes the toughness out of the meat. It breaks down the fiberous parts of the meat. I use it once or twice a week, and my blood pressure is fine.

review/text: We go to a local mom and pops Italian restaurant in our neighborhood and always loved their ice tea. One day we asked the owner what they use to brew it with and he told us Calypso by Mighty Leaf. He even gave us a sample bag to take home with us. Anyways, we have been ordering it ever since and love it. If you are an ice tea lover, this is the best you can use. It has this subtle kind of passion fruit like after taste.. which compliments every time you take a sip and exhale.

review/summary: What bacon is supposed to be
review/text: I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.

review/summary: New formula ruined this gum
review/text: This used to be a delicious and healthy product until Peelu changed the formula.  Now the gum starts disintegrating when first chewed, all the flavor disappears almost immediately, and then it turns into a tasteless hard lump.  In addition, the healthy ingredient Xylitol (which used to be 100%) has been partially replaced with rebiana (a possibly unhealthy sugar substitute).  I can only hope that Peelu will one day go back to the original formula. I would never again purchase it otherwise, and would certainly not recommend it.

This is coming from a former Red Bull junkie as well!<br /><br />Actually I also used to be addicted to coffee as well so this gives me both the energy boost I crave along with the flavor of a good coffee! It does have a good coffee flavor too! Its not too strong of a coffee flavor either although I used to adore strong coffee.<br /><br />This one is excellent for my morning "fix".

review/summary: Tastes just like an expensive coffee house drink!
review/text: This is my latest taste adventure from Red Leaf Tea! Now, I consider myself a bit of a coffee expert. I don't drink much coffee now but I used to live on the stuff and have had more than my fair share of traditional hot and iced mocha coffees. I wasn't super convinced that the mocha flavor would translate well to matcha, but I gave it a shot. I'm really glad that I did! This is pretty awesome. You can find more information and order some of this Mocha Matcha for yourself here: [...].<br /><br />I knew once I opened the pouch that I was in for a treat! This smells like a rich, dark chocolate with just a tiny bit of a coffee aroma coming through. Out of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this one had the most powerful aroma. Once again, I was impressed that the matcha was a beautiful, bright green despite being flavored. I immediately wanted to have this cold since that is how I prefer my coffee based mochas. So I added a really hefty scoop of this matcha into a blender bottle along with milk and a tiny drizzle of honey. After shaking it all up, it smells just like sitting in a coffee house!  The taste of this is completely awesome.  If I was blindfolded, I would be certain that this was a coffee based drink. The chocolate is dark and rich with the coffee flavors just backing everything up. The coffee flavoring isn't bitter or overpowering. I think I can taste just a hint of the matcha towards the end of the sip, but the flavoring is really in control of this  blend.<br /><br />Even though I almost always drink tea rather than coffee, it is nice to have something that will suit my occasional coffee cravings without having to brew an entire pot (and have the entire house smell) or go to an overpriced coffee shop. Like all of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this is really great and I think it would make a good addition to any baked good. I'm thinking that adding it to buttercream to top a chocolate cake would really set things off.  This is a great gateway matcha for those who enjoy coffee. There is no bitterness that matcha can sometimes have and the flavors are bold with a good kick of caffeine.

But all my doubts were blown away by the amazing flavor of this tea. When I opened the package, I knew I hadn't made a mistake. It smells like mocha. I made it into a cold almond milk latte and was just blown away by how well the flavor resembles a coffe-chocolate drink. I didn't feel like I was drinking matcha. I felt like I was drinking one of those high-calorie overpriced coffee shop drinks. It tastes awesome and it's good for my body. What more could a girl want?

review/summary: Mochamochamochamocha!
review/text: Now, when I was in college, I worked in the campus library. Said campus library also contained a coffee shop where I got an employee discount, so I lived on sugary coffee drinks. I loved them, especially anything mixed with caramel. I learned how to brew coffee at home (yes, it took me until college to learn this), but it was never quite the same, so day after day I bought coffee after expensive coffee. It turns out, my body takes issue with both caffeine and dairy, so eventually I had to give up coffee. Have you ever seen a librarian strung out on coffee? Scary stuff. But considering I only liked it with extra sugar and way too much cream, it was probably for the best. Now, every once in a while my father in law will brew up a two cup pot when we're at his house and offer me a cup, but I just don't touch coffee anymore. Haven't since I started drinking looseleaf tea about two years ago. But occasionally, I miss it. Occasionally I just want a big cup of creamy coffee goodness and I have to tell myself no.<br /><br />So when I spotted this matcha, I had to have it. The caffeine in matcha doesn't affect me the way the caffeine in coffee does, and so I am very, very eager to try this. Maybe I'll even sprinkle in a bit of caramel....next time.<br /><br />When the package is opened, the smell of coffee hits you square in the nose. Mmm, I miss that smell. That smell only grows stronger as the matcha is brewed...mmm, it smells yummy. Okay, so, it's love at first sip. It tastes like strong, sweet coffee. It is lovely...there's even a hint of chocolate! I can't wait to try this in latte form with some Caramel Matcha...maybe even the English Toffee to bring out the chocolate in both. Definitely begging to be mixed with vanilla soy milk.  If you're a coffee fan, or an ex-coffee fan like myself, this is a matcha to try. It's so, so good. It's like an expensive coffee from Starbucks without the too high price tag and the horrible side effects of coffee! The aftertaste is almost one of roasted barley, which I like. Coffee always tasted burnt to me. But this is lovely. I see a happy future for me with this matcha at my side.

review/text: Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blending of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are, as the box states, "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend.<br /><br />The fragrance of Tazo Earl Grey is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is refreshing and perfumed. The addition of cream creates a lush sensual brew. A topnotch tea blend!<br /><br />Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

review/text: Wasn't sure what these pears would be like. I eat pears with cottage cheese a lot. Tried many brands of pears. Too many are hard, almost too unripe. These pears are medium firm. Not too hard and not too soft. Could be used in any pear recipe. The light syrup is almost not syrup at all. Not overly sweet and not thick. Very thin so it doesn't ruin the taste of the pears. This is the second case I have purchased. I usually eat one jar a week and they have been consistently high quality. If you like pears, you will love these I'm sure.

review/text: I have been drinking this for years mixed in when I make instant coffee to ameliorate the "instant" taste and drink it stand alone lots of times also.  There ARE richer, creamier, better tasting cocoas out there but I like this stuff and you can't beat the price and the convenience of just adding hot water instead of milk. Its outstanding to carry when camping- light weight and pretty secure in its little bags.

So I was very excited to realize this particular size and brand is carried by Amazon.

review/summary: Sugar, corn syrup,  AND artificial sweetener?  No thanks!
review/text: I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside.

The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.

review/summary: Like it in coffee
review/text: I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of "Double Chocolate Meltdown".<br /><br />But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee. It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee, and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation. Love it for that!

review/text: The cocoa mix in a CAN is hard to find in a grocery store.  I finally found it on Amazon.  It is FAT FREE, LOW CARBS, ONLY 25 CALORIES AND THE BEST THING OF ALL IS THAT IT IS 99.9% CAFFEINE FREE!!!  I cannot have caffeine due to a heart condidion and it is a wonderful find. I have shared this information with my Weight Watchers Group and everyone is elated to find a treat such as this. MANY, MANY THANKS TO NESTLE!!!!!!<br />If you want to risk a few more calories, use 1/2 water and 1/2 skim milK.  DELICIOUS!!

review/summary: Nestle's Fat Free for Me
review/text: I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.  But happily it became available again and I ordered enough to last a while.  I like the way it tastes and love the fact that it is like 30 calories per serving.  The low calorie count gives me more reasons to keep using it.

review/text: I've bought this product from Amazon for almost two years for $20.19 shipped by Amazon as an Amazon Prime product.  Amazon no longer carries it directly and the reseller is charging $44 for the same package plus shipping(down this week from $49 last week).  The cocoa is not twice as good at these prices and I wish Amazon would find a reseller whose price is somewhat closer to the old amazon price. This is a very disappointing message from Amazon to its loyal customers.  W. Grace

review/text: This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.

review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.
