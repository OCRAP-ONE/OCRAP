review/summary: Great dog treats
review/text: My dog has many food allergies so it is hard finding a treat that she is able to eat.  Wet Noses Apples and Carrots has quality and limited ingredients that are not only healthy for her, but also highly appealing. She loves eating these treats! And I can feel good about feeding them knowing they won't contribute to her allergies.

review/text: My dog likes these treats.  He is old (15 yo), with renal failure, so I like that these treats are lower in protein than other treats.  The reason I didn't give these a five is because they are rather hard and I either need to break them up or soften them for my medium size dog.

review/summary: if you must mix mint & chocolate... the perfect bar
review/text: i am not ordinarily a fan of mint/chocolate combos, which usually are toothpasty hideously-refreshing mint in cheap-&-common somehow-simultaneously-waxy-&-gooey milk chocolate.  i also dislike rosemary in many of the places it crops up - woodenly weeding up an otherwise lovely savory, for example.<br /><br />here we have the marvelous exception with rosemary being the ingredient that pleasantly sneaks up on you.  the chocolate is rich & on the dry side; the mint is more like the mellow mint that volunteers around outdoor faucets; the rosemary is pitch perfect.

review/summary: Best chocolate I've ever tasted
review/text: This -- and the Dagoba Lavender bars -- are the perfect balance between dark and super dark chocolates.  The rosemary and lavender tastes are not immediately evident - they just linger as a faint fragrance in your mouth after you've eaten the chocolate.  The balance between the sugar and chocolate in the bars is perfect -- sweet enough to not be bitter but not so sweet that the chocolate is overwhelmed.  I can't recommend this chocolate enough.  Even a small piece is satisfying.

review/summary: Additonal Info on this product
review/text: Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat.

review/summary: Sub-par chocolate at an absolutely silly price
review/text: Everything this company touches turns to flavorless, waxy chalk. This company seems to be running on a pure-profit scheme of hyper-inflated prices and, while all their products are aesthetically appealing, this actually counts against the final product as the taste and texture is so far beyond disappointing for the price that I actually came here to write negative reviews on their products to warn customers that their money is better spent on better-tasting chocolate. If you just must have chocolate from Vermont, take a trip to Stowe and look for Laughing Moon--same price range...and THEIR chocolate is heavenly. If you want seriously delicious chocolate for a pretty good price, look for green mountain chocolates--recipes in Swiss Chocolate from a White House Pastry Chef of 20 years...also founded in Vermont, though now they're in Mass. Shame :/ When Lake Champlain purchased the retail outlet from Green Mountain Chocolates, they switched all the fantastic chocolate out, dumped their terrifyingly high-priced brown wax-chalk into the same glass displays.  Walking in without knowing what had happened was like being a character in a Twilight Zone episode, or a contestant on a malevolent Japanese game show. I once accidentally paid 28 dollars for half a pound of what they assured me were truffles but was actually a box of sadness and regret.

review/text: This taco sauce is bought by the military and I grab some whenever I eat on base to add flavor to food. It's like a hot sauce with more flavor then just mild heat. The description says hot but it's comparable to a taco bell hot taco sauce for heat so really at best a medium. Many in today's America would call it a mild. I really enjoy putting it in canned tomato based soups for added flavor it turns blah into decent. At 15 cents a serving here I would shop around though as that's too much money for a business to hand out. I think you can get these at half the price and I'm sure Amazon will adjust as time goes on.

review/summary: The only coarse salt for me!
review/text: I found this salt one day in an Italian deli in Half Moon Bay, CA.  I got really hooked on the coarse variety.  After I ran out I tried other coarse salts, but they were not the same!  These crystals are smaller...just the right size, and NOT TOO SALTY.  Its hard to describe, but it makes all foods better.  You get that little crunchy taste which adds so much to fresh tomatoes, pasta, any food which needs a little salt.  I only use this right before eating....not in cooking. (I use the regular iodized salt to get my iodine when cooking!)<br /> The whole idea is that you want that texture and flavor.  I send for this online , and pay shipping (!) because I like it so much!  Highly recommended.

review/text: If you like mixed drinks but not the calories, this is the ticket.  For dieting, booze itself isn't the killer -- it's the mixers (except club soda).  Not only is this zero calories/carbs, the taste is faithful to the original simple-syrup based calorie bomb.  And Sweet & Sour is the basis for so many mixed drinks.  My favorite here is whiskey sour.  A double shot stays at 130 calories.  BB's even gives a foamy head when shaken, which makes a maraschino and an orange slice irresistible.  Of course, by itself it also makes a wonderful alcohol-free drink, but a rather expensive one.  I get it at BevMo, but if you can't find it locally, definitely order here.  The price is about the same.

review/summary: Smaller bars, New nutritional info, & Other information
review/text: Great tasting bars - we eat them when we crave something a bit sweet. I don't believe these bars are necessarily "good for you" or suitable as a meal replacement. However, they are a healthy alternative to packaged bakery items, cookies or candy.<br /><br />The bars now are smaller in weight - from 61g to 54g. As a result, the nutritional information has changed but Amazon's website has not - I have posted the new nutritional information as a customer image & hope it helps someone. This change occurred a couple years ago.<br /><br />We've recently noticed a change in volume as well. Our latest shipment of bars is smaller - the box & package is the same, but the bar itself is smaller but with no change in weight (still 54g). I did not notice a change in taste but the texture seemed smoother. I'm not sure why these bars are smaller than previous batches. Is it a change in recipe? A quality control issue? A new ingredient? Don't know. What I do know is that I just ate a bar with yogurt, which is typical for me, and unfortunately I have to report that this snack is not as filling as before. My DH also noticed that the bar was less filling. I think something is different about the bars once again, but exactly what it is I don't know quite yet.<br /><br />I'm a Weight Watcher with life-time status. I look for high-volume, filling foods to maintain my weight. At one time, the Earnest bar once one of them. It's quickly falling off my list of favorite, go-to food items.

review/summary: Tasty, wheat free, simple ingredients and pleasing texture
review/text: These bars really are very pleasing taste and texture-wise. They are chewy but not really sticky, and they are more dense than one might expect from this type of snack. They are pricey, but less so when you consider that each one is about the weight of two normal chewy granola-type bars. You are getting almost the same amount in one 12 pack as you would get from something like 4 boxes of Quaker chewy bars. These just happen to be much tastier and better for you. I especially like that the second ingredient is Almond butter, because it means they have some protein in them (as opposed to typical granola bars). The Cran Lemon Zest flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, and the lemoniness isn't overpowering. In fact, during the first trimester of my pregnancy these were one of the only things I could eat in the morning without getting overwhelmingly nauseous!

review/summary: Pretty good, not great, but pretty good
review/text: I'm always trying to eat healthier and much to the detriment of my wallet I am consistently ordering these expensive products online to sample. Because healthy food cost more than junk food (and wonder why the nation's obese) it is difficult pulling the when something looks good but cost so much. Well, I took the plunge and pulled the trigger on these Earnest Eats as they were well reviewed and had healthy ingredients. The conclusion was a good one. Not a great one. But a good one. The bars themselves are generous in size, very flavorful, and most importantly, not hard as a brick. My only qualm is that I don't really care for the Cran Lemon Zest flavor; however, that's no knock on Earnest Eats, as I am just not big on cranberry and lemon products in general. With this flavor I had a coupon and the cost decreased so much that I couldn't pass it up. I am sure I will enjoy there other flavors which I am more partial too. But lovers of cran/lemon flavor would love these bars. My only other issue is price. I mean, $1.25 per bar? Really? I guess you get what you pay for, but dang if it isn't a kick in the gut.

The 1 year old constantly wants some but I try to be careful not to give her sections with chunks of nuts since she doesn't have molars yet.  I was SO happy to find out amazon carries these bars and I get them delivered to my door quickly with amazon prime.

review/text: It was on one of my many busiest days, that I, having just received the package, mostly unwittingly, grabbed a couple and put them in my pocket.  Hours later, I felt so much hunger I was ready to abandon the remaining activities to go for food.  I put my hands in my pocket to check for money, when, "Yes!" I realized, I had a "bird in the bush", if you will.  Having forgotten I'd put it there, I was so relieved.  And even more so after eating it.  I really only needed one.  Because of the whole food ingredients, the nourishment was more substantial and lasting.<br />Most convenient products are filled with processed sugar, and don't sit well with me.  This, I must say, was a nice change.

review/summary: When in doubt, drink the original!
review/text: It's summer. It's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement. Yep, you're in the semi-tropics now. It's New Orleans and the living is easy. And it is 8 o'clock in the morning. Time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar. It's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust, mellowed down flavor.<br /><br />Chicory? What is chicory? Thought you would never ask. I just happen to have that answer right here:<br />From Wikipedia: "Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native), although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India, parts of Southeast Asia and the American South, particularly in New Orleans. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "coffee crisis" of 1976-9." Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.<br /><br />Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired. There is nothing like it, especially when drunk in the atmosphere of New Orleans.

review/summary: Great taste, less buzz
review/text: Chicory gives this coffee its rich taste, dark color and syrupy body -- I guess, although no other chicory-cut coffee I've ever tasted was this good. Although this coffee tastes very strong and robust, I suspect it has less caffeine than the straight stuff; at least, I've been able to drink a lot of it without getting the jitters.<br /><br />I usually buy mine for some ridiculously low price at an Asian market, but lately they've been out of stock. Anyone know why Asian markets carry this product? I wonder if there's an interesting story behind that...

review/summary: Tried Many - This is not the best
review/text: Prior to visiting New Orleans I drank the usual national-brand, plastic-jug coffee sold in supermarkets across the country.  After visiting New Orleans and developing a liking for C&C (coffee and chicory) I've tried numerous brands of both medium-dark roast and dark roast C&C.<br /><br />Of the two roasts I found I like the dark roast more (which Cafe du Monde C&C is).  I was excited to try the brew from the coffee stand we visited several times near Jackson Square but was disappointed when I made my first pot of Cafe du Monde C&C.  It has kind of a burnt taste to it (while the French Market City Roast I tried - which is also a dark roast - has kind of a chocolate taste to it).<br /><br />Cafe du Monde may be the preferred brand if you're going to serve your coffee 'au lait' style with 1/2 hot milk (as they do at the actual cafe near Jackson Square) but it's not the best if you're going to have your coffee with just a touch of cream and/or sugar.

review/summary: Prefer over Cafe Bustelo
review/text: There is a reason that this is the preferred (maybe exclusive?) brand for the famous Vietnamese ice coffee. In black, I do not quite enjoy the taste. The bitterness overwhelms other flavors. But with cream and sugar, the taste transforms. It becomes rich yet smooth. It is so easy and addictive to drink that you can get caffeine overdosed without knowing it until bedtime.  I happens to have a can of Cafe Bustelo for comparison. Although Cafe Bustelo also receives rave reviews, Cafe Du Monde gets my vote for cream coffee.<br /><br />This coffee comes in drip grind. But I would not recommend using drip coffee maker as the brew would be too diluted. If you do not have the time of coffee press, I recommend using Senseo (http://www.amazon.com/Senseo-Single-Serve-Gourmet-Coffee-Machine/dp/B001QTVS5K). It takes me 10 seconds to make a Senseo coffee pod with a regular 4-cup basket coffee filters. The brew from Senseo is stronger than drip coffee maker with crema on top similar to the result from an espresso machine. You will love the result without the mess from a coffee press.<br /><br />Since this is the coffee of choice for Vietnamese ice coffee, you can find this coffee sold in most large Asian supermarkets. You will also find that the price in the local markets significantly lower than online.

review/summary: Flavorful Coffee
review/text: I grew up with this can around my house -my parents, like me, are coffee drinkers. Somehow it got phased out by my teens but I picked up a can at my local asian supermarket around three months ago.<br /><br />The first couple of cups of this was wonderful, dark, and flavorful. I loved the taste but got bored. Then I went back to my Columbian Coffee. Something still wasn't right. Now I use a 1:2 ratio of Cafe Du Monde to Columbian and haven't looked back. I cannot have my coffee any other way now. My local coffee shops rarely see my face these days because of this small orange can.<br /><br />Cafe Du Monde is coarsely grounded and has a darker brown color than most other coffees. It's not hard to see the difference if you mixed the two in a single can (which I did). Coffee Addicts need to get a can at least once in their life.

It is sooo strong that you can actually use 1/2 the amount, so long as it is like 8 cups - 4 scoops, any amount of water less than that and the flavor can get lost. I have been hooked on it ever since my college days in New orleans, and now I buy it by the case from the site. It is the best coffee and it is priced very well for the taste. I have had other coffees that are $18 per 1/2  pund and they do not compare... trust me, go to Cafe DuMonde's site and try it out.

review/text: It's sooo good, even if you don't usually like coffee you'll love Cafe Du Monde's coffee and chicory. Roasted chicory gives the coffee a rich chocolaty flavor, somewhat like what a mocha cappuccino tastes like. I use filtered water and brew with a regular coffee maker, it turns out fine. I just picked up my can at an Asian grocery, which is the last place I would have thought to look for it. Seriously, what is up with the Asian grocery connection? It's so weird. Anyway, this was selling for a few dollars more at the regular grocery store, so even buying it online is an decent deal.

review/summary: Coffee and Famously Fabulous Fritters
review/text: On a sultry July morning, a few years before Katrina blew into town, a friend and I wandered into the frenetic, powder-sugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the famously fabulous fritters we had heard so much about. We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.<br /><br />The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.<br /><br />What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.<br /><br />Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).<br /><br />Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.  Forget Starbucks!

But the past few years I have been drinking French Market brand coffee (with chicory) and it is much smoother, chocolaty, with no bitter aftertaste like the Cafe du Monde brand has. I make them in a French Press and the French Market is much better. Otherwise I use Lavazza or Illi brand coffee's in a single cup filter cone or espresso machine. I know coffee's and CdM just doesn't cut it for me.

review/text: I don't drink just one brand of coffee.  I keep several different coffee brands around so I drink coffee by mood. Since I quit smoking, I can taste the differences in coffee.  As a kid growing up in the Smokey Mountains, my folks drank coffee with chicory and if you were still sleepy, after one taste of their coffee, you were wide awake.  The Cafe Du Monde is much more user friendly and has a very mellow taste.  It only takes about a third of the coffee grounds to make a decent cup of coffee. I guess you could use more and get that 'eye opening' experience but I drink coffee for the pure pleasure of it not as an endurance test.

If you don't have a Viet/Chinese grocer then by all means buy it here or from Cafe du Monde themselves. Another reviewer pondered why a "Chinese" grocer would have it---it's highly possible it's a Viet grocer. And if you know any history of Indochina then you'll know why they carry it. ;) ENJOY!

This is my first time having chicory with coffee.  I have read stories mentioning chicory and heard about its popularity in New Orleans.  Honestly, and it may be my taste buds, it takes like regular coffee to me.  I drink it black sweetened with agave nectar.  I plan on trying the half (soy) milk with it to make it Au Lait.  My next venture will be in trying the Biegnets!

I like chicory though, and once read that Henry Miller enjoyed coffee and chicory together.<br /><br />This was an impulse buy. I saw this in the Asian food isle of the Food4Less store here in Portland, Or. for only 5 or 6 dollars. So if you have that store or an Asian market in your area, check there first. It'll be way cheaper, and plus, no shipping cost!<br /><br />It's delicious just black, not bitter at all, but great as well as with milk or cream.

review/text: the reason this is at asian markets is because it is used in making Thai iced coffee.  find an authentic asian resturant (the SE asians learned french cookery) and order it but ask first if they use cafe dumonde.  they put about 1/2 inch of eagle brand milk in a 8 oz. glass, fill it with ice and cover it with a little stainless drip gizmo full of the coffee and pour boiling water ove the grounds,INCREDIBLE

review/text: I have recently tried to give up soda, and am making the effort to Tea.  Both lightly sweetened and unsweetened.  I have recently tried Honest Tea in there smaller sizes 10oz bottle for $1.25 (the 64 oz is a good deal price wise).<br /><br />I found that the tea is best served very cold but has a little more bitter after taste than other premium teas.  I have continued to buy it as it is my second favorite tea in the Unsweetened flavor, but I much prefer the mint flavor.

review/summary: VERY GOOD BUY AND PRODUCT
review/text: I really wanted a good source of anti-oxidants in a green tea without having to constantly brew my own.  Honest Tea is the answer.  One of our local stores carries this product in the small bottles, but it is no value, very expensive.  I did a lot of research to find this product and it is nearly perfect.  I actually add a small amount of sugarless bottled lemonade which makes it even better tasting.  This is a best buy, especially, if you can find it locally.  I have not been able to find the 64 ounce bottles locally which would be the best value.

review/summary: 5 Stars for the Green Tea itself, 1 star for the price
review/text: First off, before my review, I get this Green Tea in my local health food store, the same exact 64 oz. bottle, for $5.99 normally, and it's often on sale for $4.99.  This price of $7.99 plus shipping is completely outrageous.<br /><br />With that said, this Green Tea is without question the best bottled Green Tea I've ever had.  I don't know if it contains more caffeine than normal tea or what, but I get SUCH a rush from drinking this tea.  I almost feel sort of drunk, actually.  In a good way though.  Not stumbling around with slow reflexes, but from a mental aspect, I feel happier and more energetic.  I've never had this happen with ANY other Green Tea I've ever drank.<br /><br />If you've never tried this Green Tea, but you like to drink it, you're doing yourself a great disservice.  This Honest Unsweetened Green Tea is absolutely incredible.  I'm not such a big fan of the flavored ones -- they don't work as well for some reason.  It's only the Unsweetened one that I rave about.

review/summary: Five stars for the tea itself
review/text: Words cannot even begin to describe my love for this tea. I was looking for an authentic unsweetened tea that contained a substantial amount of antioxidants. This tea was it. It's organic. It has no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. It's Fair Trade Certified. It has a ton of antioxidants. Oh, and did I mention how energized I feel after drinking it? Just Green Tea is the real deal. I lucked out because I live close to a Wegmans, who carries the 64 fluid ounce bottle at a good price. This tea is wonderful for health-conscious folks, those seeking to lose weight, college students who have an 8 A.M. class, and tea connoisseurs. Five stars for the product, one star for the Amazon price.

review/text: I'm doing the "Eat right for your type" diet and the one beverage that benefits me is Green Tea.  We all know that you can go to any store and find a slew of different products in this category, but after reading in a major men's publication that this was the healthiest green tea sold, I had to try it.  I'm not real big on the taste of green tea, but this actually taste like strong tea, so I can drink this stuff all day and be happy.  Also, I've found that buying it on Amazon is much cheaper that going to your local Kroger/Scott's store.

review/summary: Versatile beef flavoring
review/text: I discovered this product when I was shopping in a supermarket in a Spanish neighborhood. Since I'm always looking for something new in the way of ingredients I bought some. This is the greatest beef flavoring product on the market. I use it in a lot of different recipes. One reviewer said it's as healthy as eating salt, but I disagree. If you use it in a recipe and cut back on the salt called for in the rest of the recipe, I think you'll be Okay.<br />For example, one thing I use it in is sauce bolognese. A teaspoonful or so in the sauce gives it an all day cooked flavor without cooking all day. In cocktails, a drink called a Bullshot is made with bullion, lemon juice and vodka. Serve it to your friends and they will wonder about the great flavor.<br />Everyone has a secret ingredient in their recipes that when someone asks you for the recipe you sort of forget to write down. This is mine. If the recipe calls for bullion, I don't tell them I use Maggi and they still wonder why mine tastes better.

review/summary: A kitchen secret
review/text: This is the absolute best beef flavoring product out there! Seriously, you should give this a try if you ever use any other kind of beef boullion. I add it to burgers, braises, rub it on meats going on the grill, use it in soups and gravies and just generally use it anywhere that I am using beef. It ups the beefy flavor and makes your sauces and gravies sing with taste. For a long time I couldn't find it, I had originally picked up a few boxes of the cube form when I was on a road trip and haven't found it anywhere else since, when I finally used up the supply I had I was having withdrawals and tried every other product out there but they all fell short on the flavor that this has. I mentioned it on a group I belong to and one of the other members sent me the Amazon link to it in the canisters, I ordered it immediatly and couldn't wait until it arrived, it is exactly the same taste as the cube form and I am once again a happy cook, I even went back and ordered another six pack of the canisters and signed up for auto delivery of it for the future. What usually happens is when I find something we really like, it then stops being sold and I can't find it again for a long time. This time I will have a stockpile of a dozen canisters so I am set for quite a while. You also can't beat the Amazon price of the six canisters, consider that I paid almost two bucks for the pack of 8 cubes that I had originally bought and the price at Amazon is like getting it almost free compared to what I paid for 8 little cubes and each of these canisters is almost eight ounces of the product. Try this stuff, you'll love what it does for anything beef.

review/summary: Price gougers!
review/text: Once upon a time this was available in local grocery stores, but no longer. So I bought a dozen at a time from eurofoodmart and ate them sparingly. When I tried to re-order in December 2009, I discovered that overnight, greed struck and  eurofoodmart bumped up the holiday price by 50%. Not only that, they now offer only the 4 oz package, not the standard 6 oz with the larger wedges. So much of the time you will need to use two wedges to do what one did before.<br /><br />There are better places to get this cheese than eurofoodmart, and fairer internet merchants to do business with. Pass up these price gougers and keep looking.  Support the good people, not the others.<br />----------------<br /><br />Now it's November, 2010, and there seems to be deception with this product. Amazon is selling the 4 oz cheese wedges, but the supplier gave them a graphic of the 6 oz.

review/summary: My Shiloh loves it!
review/text: My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.

review/summary: Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise with a horrible stomach for keeping any food down. This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: My picky dog enjoys eating it
review/text: My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Alternate meat source = less itchy dog
review/text: My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year - nothing overt - just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too "fishy" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually.

Both my dog and me would be completely stressed out because he couldn't find a food he enjoyed and I was buying tons of food that he would just stare at for hours and refuse to eat.  One day I went into a local pet food shop and they had sample packages of all the different types of foods they had and they gave me several to try out. I took them home and set them all out for my dog... he went around and sniffed at all of them but this was the one he finally went for.  A couple years of using this food later and he never seems to protest.  Thanks for making my life easier.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: This food is an exceptional product.  I take care of a number of dogs and am very selective about the formulation of their food.  In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.<br />The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1/2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?

review/text: Recommended by our vet, and our dogs love this food. Usually mix it with some canned food / sardines / veggies / yogurt.<br /><br />So happy this is available via Amazon Prime. At a reasonable price point as well. Please, Amazon - keep this in stock! Not available in my area otherwise. THANKS!!!!

review/summary: Dog doesn't seem to be bothered by it....
review/text: Tried this food for my adult mix that has been on a fish based diet since puppydom. I thought trout and sweet potato would be an interesting change from salmon, but nope, not really. It gets eaten, though not with any particular excitement. I think it is safe to say while my dog is indifferent to it, the ingredients and price are a plus. Spruce it up a drizzle of olive or canola oil and it gets eaten.

review/summary: WORST DOG GAS EVER.
review/text: If you have a dog, you probably know the distinctive "dog fart" odor.  This food, for some reason, multiplied that for one of my two dogs.  It really turned our house into a constant dog gas zone.  Wow.  It's supposed to be a pretty good dry dog food, but beware of the possibility of DOG GAS.

review/summary: The lone dissenter
review/text: I was looking forward to giving this made-in-the-USA treat to the little person who shares her home with me.  There are few ingredients in the formula, which, I believe, as with human food, make for a better product.  They even smell good.  I have heard great things about how kitties love this treat, and I looked it up on Amazon to find rave reviews.  As she loves all things chicken, I tried this flavor for her.  Unfortunately, she turned her nose up at it.<br /><br />I thought, maybe it's just not what she's used to and she needs to acquire a taste, so I added one to her dry food.  Less than one hour later, she threw up her entire breakfast.  This is the first time ever, since she has owned me, that she has thrown up anything, and I don't think it's a coincidence.  There are unusual ingredients in this formula, such as green tea and rosemary oil.  I believe she was trying to tell me she had some sort of a sensitivity or allergy to something in the formula.  I just wasn't listening.<br /><br />I hate to give a bad review to something so many other kitties are crazy for, but just be aware that there is a (probably small) percentage of kitties out there with whom these ingredients just don't agree.

review/summary: Stay away from it!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: WOW, the same experience as the previous review. I gave a few of those treats to both of my cats and both of them threw up after 30 min or so. Older one can't stop for over a day now. I needed to take him to a vet. Hope he is going to be OK. I think there is something wrong with those treats...

review/summary: The cat just loves them!
review/text: We have a very difficult cat, we have tried many types of cat treats, and he does not want any of them. Just the pink boxes of Pitr'Pat he liked.<br /><br />So now we tried the green ones for a change.<br /><br />Apparently our cat adores them both.
