review/summary: Best of the Wellness Bars, too bad only comes in 20 oz box!
review/text: These are the best ones of the Wellness bars because they're completely grain free. My dogs love these. They also contain no artificial preservatives. Highly recommended. However, I wish these came in a 50 oz box like the other flavors. The 20 oz box at 8.99 is the same cost at the pet store (and it is 45 cents per ounce) versus a 50 oz box which is just 30 cents an ounce. The product is fantastic, though. A++++

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly "sit ups" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...<br /><br />Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup.

review/summary: Buster Loves Yogurt and Apples
review/text: We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!

For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!<br />We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year.

review/text: The product is fine, but the price is ridiculous.  The description did not list how many are in a pack, but there are only 3, which  means you are paying more than $3 per twist.  That is insanely expensive. I can get a 6-pack of the 5 inch twists are Walgreens for $2.  These are gigantic, and my dogs spent a couple hours entranced with them (the older dog actually gave up and left his for the younger dog).

review/summary: Excellent, Nutritious Soup
review/text: I love both the 14 Garden Vegetable Soup and the plain Vegetable Soups (no salt and low salt varieties) that Health Valley produces because they are truly vegetarian, without pasta or rice or any other non-leafy product.  Best of all, they don't contain MSG or any other chemicals.  They don't require any doctoring, but you might like a pinch of salt or Tobasco sauce. I sometimes add hamburger meat to them or crush Inka plantain chips to give them a crunchy cracker texture without the gluten.  I have taken Health Valley soups and a can opener with me when I do road trips in order to avoid the awful roadside garbage that franchise restaurants call food.  You can heat them in a glass or plastic bowl in a motel room's microwave oven or eat them right out of the can.  Either way, they're not overly delicious, but good.

review/text: This tea is so delicious - light, sweet, and slightly nutty.  Both tins I've opened so far have had beautiful light green whole needles.  These leaves are so good I sometimes eat just one leaf plain - it tastes great, and the silver hairs give me a little zetz and make my mouth and head feel tingly for a second.  I brew two cups from each batch of leaves - sometimes I squeeze a third in, but by then it's getting a little weak for my taste.  I love this as an evening tea - it makes me feel so calm at the end of the day, and has less caffeine than black tea.

There is definitely better stuff out there.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's not worth the price (I paid $28.64 for 3 tins).  Overall, the packaging is nice, but the product is so-so.  I wish they spent more money on getting good-quality tea and less money on the fancy tins.  On the other hand, the tins are a convenient size, an have a good airtight seal, so if I buy some good tea in bulk packaging, I can store it in these tins.

review/text: I would say this is mid to poor grade silver needle tea.  There is lots of small particles and pieces, I would say only about 2/3 to 1/2 are full whole leaves, the rest broken bits.<br /><br />The quality and taste (and smell) of the tea is inferior to any silver needle tea I have ever had, by far.  As a comparison I would give Teavana's silver needle tea about 4 to 4.5 stars while this only deserves 2, maybe 2.5 at the most.

review/summary: Light Flavor
review/text: I've ordered Rishi's white tea a couple times now, sometimes through Amazon and sometimes from Rishi's site. Most times, the tea is perfect. It's delicate and refreshing, the way premium white tea is supposed to be. The leaves are long and slender, furry, and light enough in flavor to add whatever additions you might like, like jasmine or chrysanthemum; the tea doesn't overpower it like other fermented heavy tasting teas do, like black, oolong, green, etc. But the other times, some batches of this tea is totally off in flavor. It doesn't taste like silver needle at all, and it makes me question if they sometimes dump in regular white tea leaves in with the silver needle, or if they didn't package it properly, allowing it to develop off flavors during storage.<br /><br />Either way, I think it's worth a shot to try this for convenience (organic, packaged well in the tin, good taste). But, for the high price Rishi charges for the small quantity and supposed superior quality of silver needle white tea, it should hit a home run 100% of the time. Otherwise, you'd be safer buying a (more expensive up front) silver needle white tea or some really good dragon well green tea from a Chinese source (which usually runs around $40 for 8 or 10 oz).

review/text: I am a green->white tea convert because of this stuff! Compared to green, white tea has a sweeter, milder flavor and its minimal processing--which boosts the catechin polyphenol levels and lowers caffeine and fluoride levels--makes every sip that much more satisfying. I can steep a tablespoon of tea 3-4 times in a 1.5-cup cup (last cup i heat higher and longer). IMO the best value for good, healthy tea there is. The tins are useful for storage afterward as well. A great product all around!

review/summary: OOoh the best tea leaves out there yet
review/text: I was very excited to try this tea as I am a bit of a tea freak from green tea to the steeper oolong tea. I loved the fresh fragrant of the tea and it did not have a bitter taste if the leaves are steeped too long. Generous heap of tea and immediate off the boil water are a must to get the best out of the tea experience. Also, i would confirm that you do need to allow the tea to brew for 5 minutes before drinking. I normally like to steep the tea leaves several times, and in this case, I would suggest putting a few new leaves in.<br /><br />the tea leaves are neither diced nor sliced; and that I believe helps to keep the integrity of the flavor whole. This is a genuinely good quality product.<br /><br />I am keen to buy this for family to try as some tea smells better than it taste; not the case of this rishi jasmine tea. This is going to great after a good meal to help with the digestion.

review/summary: This stuff kicks ass
review/text: This is really awesome chili. Preperation time is kinda long. But, of course, anything that turns out this great is worth waiting for. It's very important that you soak the beans overnight, occasionaly changing the water and removing any foreign materials (floaties). I alter the recipe slightly by adding some fresh sarrano peppers, sliced and sauted along with the onion and garlic. Also, I substitute two of the four cans of stewed tomatoes, using instead two cans of diced tomatoes, one w/green chilis, the other w/habeneros. And, I like my chili HOT so I shake-in a generous amount of "ASS KICKIN' Hot Sauce". Once all ingredients are mixed together, I find it best to allow the chili to simmer over low heat for at least 3 hours, usually 4 or 5. The longer the better. I've got family and friends that beg for me to make this chili. Somehow, after eating this stuff, you get this  feeling of elation and calm, peace. It really makes you feel good. However, those who don't LOVE hot spicy chili should not even try one bite as they WILL suffer.

I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters my favorite ice tea is the half and half lemonade, and I find that these deliver the right amount of flavor, sweetness and that freshely brewed flavor I would expect from a Keurig brewer.  I find myself hiding my k cups from the rest of my family and complaining when the ice tray hasn't been refilled.  Keep in mind everyone's tastes are different and I tend to like my drinks sweet, I find the smaller tea cup setting on my brewer to work the best for this, without having to add additional sweetner or sugar.

review/summary: Close enough to my favorite coffee shop drink to make me happy
review/text: I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough. My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.

review/text: Love this, great hot or cold.  I use lemon in my tea.  Here is a hint, slice lemons in 1/4 inch slices.  Place on a cookie sheet and freeze, allow them time to freeze solid. Then place in a plastic bag and place them back in freezer, just grab what you need.  Maintain their color and look so good in the tea.

review/summary: Celestial Half and Half lemonade tea for Keurig brewers.
review/text: I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the "Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea," and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.)<br /><br />That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People "Donut Shop" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup.

review/summary: Mmmmmm....so good....
review/text: I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of "teaness" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer.

review/summary: Pretty good for quick iced tea but the Southern Sweet Tea is better.
review/text: First, what I love about this flavor is that it's iced tea that is ready in under a minute. Whenever I want iced tea, it's there and doesn't require a lot of work. That being said, I wish it was a little more lemonade flavored than just lemon-ey. Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I also stumbled across a sample pack of the Southern Sweet Tea flavor since ordering this product and I've enjoyed it much more. This flavor is a good try by Celestial Seasonings but it still needs a little work.

You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste.  You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to  how much the ice cubes melt during production.  Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand.<br /><br />Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation.<br /><br />*SAMPLE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER*

review/summary: Daily ritual now!
review/text: After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about this iced tea.  Being an "Arnold Palmer" fan, I used to make my own at home.  A pot of brewed tea and store bought lemonade.  It was great, but it took some too time to make, and the store lemonade had a lot of sugar.  So, needless to say, when I got this, I immediately made a cup.  I found that the 6oz. setting was the best.  Everyone that has tried it, has really liked it, even the pickiest of my friends and family members.  I don't know what the "chemical" taste that some reviews are talking about, nor the fake sugar taste.  I like the fact that it's real tea, and that the lemonade side isn't too overpowering.<br /><br />I drink this probably at least twice a day now, and will keep it stocked in my Keurig pod holder!

I intended to buy the Southern Sweet Tea flavor, but clicked on the wrong product (I was shopping by image, saw the little ice symbol, and didn't even notice I ordered the wrong thing until it arrived). I decided to give it a try anyway, and I was surprisingly pleased with it. I will say that I think it needs to be sweeter (so I add some stevia or splenda), but otherwise I think it is pretty good. If you like Snapple or Arizona tea with lemon flavor, you will like the Celestial Seasonings Half & Half K-Cup.

review/text: If you are used to buying the Piggy Twists that are about the size of fat cigars, these are not them.  These come 20 to a pack, but the individual twist is about as wide as a regular drinking straw, and 2/3 as long.  If you have a very small (as in toy breed) dog, they are probably great.  I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.  I still think they are made for tiny dogs, but they will keep a 50-60 lb dog occupied for a while, too.  Just realize what size you are getting with this purchase, because the product picture does not make it clear.

review/summary: Bran Bud Muffins
review/text: I have a bran muffin recipe that I make every Sunday evening and then it lives in my fridge for the week.  Each morning I put a scoop of batter into a couple of muffin cups, put them in my convection oven and by the time I'm out of the shower and dressed, the fresh baked muffins are ready to put in my tote bag and I head out the door to work . . . I get to enjoy fresh baked muffins every morning with a fresh cup of tea.  Last night I was out of the usual All Bran, but found a box of the Bran Buds in the back of the cupboard.  Wasn't sure how it would work, but I liked these muffins even better than made with the All Bran! I did need to use more milk, and I'm guessing I'll have more than enough batter for the entire week (I'll bring some to share with co workers ;-)  This is a great way to get fiber in the morning and gives me a good start to the day.<br /><br />Update on the above.  I discovered that I can make these muffins, sccop them into my silicone muffin cups and then freeze the entire batch (usually 18 muffins).  Taking them out one or two at a time to bake in my convection oven each morning.  I start each day with fresh baked muffin(s).

review/summary: Not so good for you ???
review/text: I bought this product because I wanted to eat a healthy cereal and at the same time add more fiber to my diet.  I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame.  I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup.  Who do they think they are kidding?  An average American eats more than that for breakfast.  Do they think consumers are stupid?<br /><br />A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup.  Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries.  Wow!  You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar?  Yes and it is good.  In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar.  No thanks!<br /><br />If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits.  We are not the "Kindergarten Crowd" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it.  If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat.  If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar.<br /><br />Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner?  It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia.

review/summary: Bran Buds is GREAT
review/text: Kellogg's All-Bran Bran Buds, 17.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)  I had a colon resection about 2 years ago after struggling with Diverticulitis and all of the symptoms for years.  After the surgery, I still found that I had to take Metamucil every morning and also eat the Bran Buds too.  I sweeten the Buds with Sugar Free Coffee Mate Hazelnut creamer and it is really good.  I just love it even though I have to eat it every day.  Along with the Metamucil, they have solved my life long problem of constipation.  I am so happy there is a product such as Bran Buds and I will never do without.  They are GREAT!  I order by the case from Amazon.

review/summary: tastier than All Bran originals, and more fiber, but where are they?
review/text: I like this high-fiber cereal better than the original All Bran cereals, who are too dry and stringy for my taste.  Even though, I usually mix in some other kind of cereal with these, to make them more interesting.<br /><br />But the main reason for adding this review is that I was happy to find out a month ago that I could buy these at Amazon at a substantially lower price than the grocery store ($3.50 instead of $5.00).  Except I just tried to order more and Amazon no longer seems to carry them.  They are still available through third-party stores for ridiculous prices, such as $10/box (I don't see why they even bother).  I am hoping they will come back!

review/summary: Best bran cereal on the market
review/text: When my local supermarket stopped carrying Bran Buds a few years ago,I wrote to Kellogg's and ordered directly from them.  My supermarket then "reinstated" this cereal and until Amazon offered it, I went to the local market.  What a pleasure to get it on a regular basis through the Shop and Save program through Amazon.  This cereal is so cruncy that I sometimes include some in meatballs to add extra fiber to my diet.  Highly recommended.

Read a comprehensive article about the dangers of HFCS here:  [...]<br /><br />I prefer to steer clear of HFCS as I believe it's unhealthy.  Therefore, I purchase Nature's Path Organic Smart Bran as my breakfast cereal.  It doesn't contain any High Fructose Corn Syrup ~ just organic evaporated cane juice as the sweetener.  The taste is GREAT and each serving contains 51% of the RDA of fiber!

I have been searching for a good sugar substitute for over a year now that didn't "taste funny" either while your eating it or after.  It gets depressing after a while let me tell you.  A lady pointed me to this particular brand saying it doesnt have an after taste.  .. Hmm.. i thought... its stevia, all stevia stuff has an aftertaste.  I tried another kind (still stevia) on a higher shelf because it was hazelnut flavored.  I was disapointed and threw it away.  I came back the next day.  The lady smiled at me, and i said i was going to try what she suggested.  I took it home and tried it - and i was amazed! The aftertaste was hardly even noticable in comparison to all my other stevia products i've purchased. I knew i had found what i was looking for.  I threw all my white sugars and sweeteners away in the whole house! FINALLY!!  I have used this in drinks, pancakes, cereals, and it has all been wonderful! My kids use it - well, it is the only sugar left in the house - lol  ... and no complaints.  :)  Super happy.  TRY THIS!!! You wont be wasting your money! I promise!

review/text: I was excited to find these on Amazon after trying them on a recent flight.  When we had them on the airplane, they were creamy and delicious, just like the name!  So I ordered them from Amazon and was sorely disappointed.  When I opened the crackers, they tasted dry and stale, but were still edible so I thought perhaps they were just a different cracker than what I had originally had.  I looked all over the packages for an expiration date and couldn't find anything printed.  Finally, when I examined the cardboard shipping box they came in, I realized that the crackers had expired TWO YEARS AGO!  Amazon was good about refunding my money immediately, but the seller should be ashamed!

review/summary: Cream Cracker? NOT!  Not even close!
review/text: I have eaten cream crackers for 20 years in Mexico and Brazil. Since coming to the US I have been forced to eat these horrible little dry crackers they sell here.  So when I saw these "Cream Crackers" on Amazon, I was overjoyed.  To my utter disappointment these crackers are not anything like the cream crackers I have eaten in central and south america.  These crackers are extremely dry and bland.  They taste like you took an unsalted three day old dry biscuit and compressed it into a cracker.  There not light and flaky like the cream crackers I have eaten for 20 years.  What a disappointment!  I also tried the Lyons brand sold here on Amazon.com and they are just as bad.  Both are made in the UK, so that might explain it.  You will find Mexican food restaurants and Brazilian food restaurants, because they know what taste good. But you will never find a England food restaurant. Maybe it is because they don't know how to cook.  They certainly do not know how to make a cream cracker!<br /><br />If you want real cream crackers, go to a Brazilian import store and buy some there.  Then you will know what a cream cracker is supposed to taste like.  Amigofoods(dot)com sell some REAL Cream Crackers for 5for$16.

review/summary: Terrific Treats
review/text: I've been more concerned about my dog's health these days as he starts to gain double digits.  My little dachshund of nearly 11 years isn't as spry as he used to be.  Additionally, he's been getting fatty lumps on his body that are apparently common with some varieties of dogs, but unwanted nonetheless.  I've read the lumps in particular can be caused by feeding dogs a diet too high in carbohydrates and low in protein, so when I saw these beef sticks were grain-free, I jumped on it.<br /><br />I feel very safe knowing these things are made in the USA.  Buying electronics, dishwashers, and clothes made in China or other parts of Asia doesn't make me that uncomfortable, but feeding my dog food from those areas really frightens me, given what's been covered in the news lately.<br />And of course my dog loves these things!  They're decently hard to chew through, so it's almost like a small rawhide chew toy, but made out of real beef, not whatever the heck those things are made from.<br /><br />Overall, I feel pretty satisfied with my purchase, and have signed up for the subscribe and save shipment option.  The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is the price, but I guess for my peace of mind the price is right.

For small to medium or very old dogs, the thinner strips in a package are by far the best.  The bigger strips are great for big dogs with strong jaws and teeth.  The manufacturer must have learned this equation because now the manufacturer puts mostly thin strips in the package.<br /><br />I especially like that this treat is made in the U.S.A and that it doesn't have any filler ingredients.<br /><br />I give my dogs one of these in the evening and it is a joy to see how much they enjoy them.<br /><br />The only reason for 4 stars and not five is that they are rather expensive.  Figure on a dollar a treat average.<br /><br />I'm glad they're available from Amazon's subscription program.
