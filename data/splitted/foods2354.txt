review/summary: not outdated but not quite right
review/text: I cannot get these Jocalat bars in my local store and I have ordered them from Amazon several times previously. In my last two orders the product, while not outdated, tasted stale.  It tasted as if the box had not been stored properly and perhaps had been inadvertently frozen.

review/summary: AMAZING!!!
review/text: These uber-healthy bars do the trick whenever I have a chocolate craving. I try my best to eat "whole food" and this becomes difficult when I am craving something sweet. I used to buy "Clif Bar Nectar" bars, which was essentially the same product. However, since those bars are no longer sold I am so happy that I've found these. Also, the savings are amazing...they cost almost $2 at my "Whole Foods" market. The Hazelnut flavor is my favorite so far but these are almost as amazing. If you care about the quality of the food you eat and love sweets buy them, you won't regret it!

review/summary: Deep, rich chocolate and mint
review/text: I think no tastes go better together than chocolate and mint. If you agree, you'll love these wonderfully flavorful bars.<br />The fact that two bars have all the protein you need for a meal (and much of the fruit) makes them a treat for air travel, hiking, and other quick meals on the go.<br />They stay fresh and delicious for months without refrigeration.

review/summary: Cherry Pie ok, Choco Cherry not so much.
review/text: I have food allergies, and while I am looking for a Chocolate fix, I think this will take a bit to get used to. The Cherry Pie is quite good, and tastes like the center of a fig newton. The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor. Next time I will try the plain chocolate as I hear they get good reviews.<br />Over all, The Cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10, but the Choco-cherry gets a resounding 2.

review/text: I used to buy these bars regularly at Trader Joe's, but several months ago they stopped selling my favorite flavor, so I've resorted to ordering them online. I don't like to leave home without one in my backpack. Very healthy, raw ingredients, filling, flavorful...I really love this product.

review/summary: Delicious for a snack or treat
review/text: I should start off by saying I was not instantly a convert to Larabars. I tried a few of the flavors in the regular line (Larabars) and did not prefer them over other snack/meal bars. The Jocalat bars, however, changed my mind. I love how they are the perfect balance of fruits, nuts, and cocoa. You can taste all of the flavors and they all work really well together. The chocolate mint is my favorite because the mint has a really clean natural favor and compliments the chocolate well. It easily takes away my cravings for a chocolate bar. I also really enjoy the chocolate orange and chocolate cherry flavors that are in this line. Now if they just come out with a chocolate banana version I will be in heaven.<br /><br />Despite all my raving it's still important to keep in mind that these DO NOT taste like a candy bar or a baked brownie. They definitely have more of a raw taste to them and you can still taste the dates so if you do not like the flavor of dates you may not like these. I also recommend that you try the flavors before committing to a whole case. I've found the Larabar flavors to be hit or miss with my personal tastes. There are some that I love and enthusiastically buy again and others that don't seem worth the calories.<br /><br />Overall these are great and I like them so much better than Larabar flavors and have recommended them to many friends.

review/summary: Satisfying Treat!
review/text: The LaraBar Jocalat is becoming one of my favorite treats.  The rich chocolate flavor and the other nutrient-dense ingredients satisfies the sweet-tooth as well as hunger.  I am a teacher, and I keep these tasty bars in my desk for when I am hungry.  These bars are far healthier than donuts or candy, which are often found in my school office or teacher's lounge.  Furthermore, everyone who I've shared my secret stash with has enjoyed them as much as I do!  One day I took one to the principal, who is a health-conscious individual, and he now loves them, too!  So, this past Christmas I gave him a gift bag filled with LaraBar Jocolat's.  It never hurts to win your boss over!

review/summary: Great & Gluten Free!
review/text: I really like another chocolate flavored bar that's also gluten free, and have been a repeat customer of the other bar.  But I was very surprised at how much more I like the LaraBar Jocalat, Chocolate bar.  These area great!  I rated the other product 5 stars, because I simply couldn't find anything wrong with them and thought they were that good - these are even better.  And they're gluten free!<br /><br />One slight caution: I knew I wouldn't be able to eat a regular meal one day, so I took three of these along and made the mistake of enjoying all three at once in place of the meal.  I hadn't thought about what the "consequences" might be.  Two of these bars at a time are plenty for an active lower digestive system!  If you intend to spend an hour or more in a meeting a few hours after eating three of these, you may find it more than a little uncomfortable.  Have some Imodium handy in that instance.  ;~}<br /><br />GRITS

Overwhelming orange oil/ zest flavor (it tasted just the way the orange essence smells) and zero chocolate flavor. If you haven't had these yet,  buy an individual bar before buying the box. I now have 15.9 of these bars and will *not* eat them.

It was very delicious to me then but six months later I guess my taste buds had changed.  The flavors I do really like are cherry, apple, lemon, and chocolate coconut.

review/summary: If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you
review/text: I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.

It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust.  I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product.  However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us.  I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend trying this product.  (Ugh.  I need to go rinse my mouth with mouthwash just from thinking about this product long enough to write this review.)

review/text: I'm a snack fiend, and finding something I can snack on that's also healthy is a godsend. I suppose some people want dried fruit to be the consistency of beef jerky, but I think the fruit tastes better if it's not dried to the consistency of shoe leather. Apricots and prunes are my favorites. Prunes are just what you would expect them to be, sticky, so have a handkerchief or wet wipe for use afterwards. The description above says pears are included, but I think it must be a misprint. The packages say peaches, and dried peaches are really good. They have a tartness I don't normally associate with peaches. I'm not as crazy about the apples, which are limp when dried. But they still taste good, even if they feel a bit strange.<br /><br />I'm surprised more parents haven't tried these as after-school snacks for their kids. These are sweet enough for the sweet-tooth in your family.

But are they plums or prunes? And overall, they are just stickey. My wife<br />loves dried fruit, so she got them in the work lunch first. She returned the bag and requested "no more of those". Accordingly, I threw out both packs. I called Sunmaid to comment 559 896 8000. And got a recording. Called back in the pm to ask if the consumer relations dept was working. The secretary said they are overwhelmed<br />with complaints and it may take one to two days to get call. This is the end of the second day without a call. Now, I don't care.<br />And, since i am thinking about Sunmaid, why did they make the raisen boxes smaller but keep the price the same...hmmmmm$$<br />MarshallGulch

That being said, all it contains is dried fruit, so there isn't any added sugar, just the natural fruit sugar. I prefer the raisins over the mixed fruit. The fruit selection was varied, and some fruits tasted better than others. They do have a long shelf life, so if you want fruit that lasts a long time (what I was looking for), this is the product to get.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: Our sweet dog (Brenda Lee) loves this food and it is great for her too.  Smells and looks good enough to serve to house guests on crackers.  However we would never do that as it would make (Brenda Lee) mad.  Kidding aside this is very nutritious dog food and our girl thrives on it.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Food - Good Savings on Large Cans
review/text: Like another reviewer, I also feed this food to my cats.  I recently contacted Nature's Variety by email and they confirmed that the cat and dog Instinct canned formulas are exactly the same.  By buying the large "dog" cans here combined with the subscribe and save discount, the price per ounce is about 50% less than the small "cat" cans - awesome savings on a food I would otherwise have trouble affording.<br /><br />Nature's Variety canned is a high quality food with 95% real meat.  No by-products or grain. It's a healthy food that both of my cats seem to really enjoy (the only other canned foods my picky adult cat will eat are EVO Cat & Kitten and Tiki Cat).  I regularly buy the chicken and rabbit flavors, and periodically get duck and venison as well.  I also believe the montmorillonite clay in these formulas help to keep my kitten's stools well formed (he tends to have loose stools on canned foods without this ingredient).<br /><br />I originally started buying Nature's Variety Instinct because it is one of only a small handful of canned pet foods that DOES NOT contain carrageenan. Carrageenan is derived from seaweed and used as a thickening agent, but many studies link carrageenan to digestive inflamation, ulcerations, and even cancer. I'd rather not feed such a sketchy ingredient to my beloved pets.  Kudos to Nature's Variety for not including this potentially dangerous ingredient in their food!<br /><br />A note on packaging: Amazon's packaging of Nature's Variety cases is sometimes inadequate.  I've received cases so dented that I didn't feel safe feeding it to my pets.  Returns are easy, however, and it's been my experience that Amazon processes refunds/replacements quickly.  My most recent shipment was much better protected than previous orders, but about half of the cans still had minor dents.  Nature's Variety is a five star food, so I won't lower my rating because of Amazon's handling/packaging, but I feel people should be aware that Amazon shipments of this food may be damaged.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: My wife and I spent months trying to find an ideal dog food for our pack of vicious toy poodles and Chinese Cresteds.  We wanted a brand that was all natural and as close to home prepared as possible.  We have had our pack on this brand for many years now and they are extremely healthy.  While I am not sure if this food has anything to do with it or not, one of our pack has Addison's disease.  We discovered it when she arrived from the person we adopted her from.  She is a Toy Poodle that should have weighed 7 pounds, but when she arrived she weighed only 4.5 pounds.  We would put her food down and she would act like she wanted to eat but she couldn't.  She would hover over her bowl but would not take a bite.  Our vet, probably the best in Louisville, KY, diagnosed her within 2 days.  After we started treatment and got her electrolytes stable, we took her in the following year for her annual exam.  The vet could not believe it was the same dog and he said it was the first time that he had ever seen a dog with Addison's look so good.  That he could not even tell that she had the condition.  My wife and I, unscientifically attribute it to our diligence with her medication and a healthy serving of Nature's Variety dog food twice a day.<br /><br />In our opinion and experience, there is no substitute for a good diet for healthy and happy dogs.  I would recommend this food, and have recommended this brand to every dog owner that I come across.

With this vinegar, you smell the tarragon and I recommend on a fresh lettuce or mï¿½che or arugula salads, use just few drops, add a spoon of Basil Olive Oil, a dash of salt and try it! Too bad this vinegar is hard to find on the US stores shelves.

review/text: Our Golden has skin allergy issues. We've been doing the antihistamine/predisone(?) thing for awhile. I decided to try<br />a few different dog foods. This is the first to have any impact<br />whatsoever. I was told Chicken and grains may be an issue so went<br />away from both. The red areas and sores have dried up. At first it looked<br />like it was worse due to 'dandruff'. But we realized it was actually drying<br />up the bad areas. I can't say it's the ONLY dog food that would fix this as<br />I've only tried about 6 or 7..but it's working. Wish I could find something cheaper though..he eats quite a bit!

We decided to try this because it is designed to address those particular issues. I have never seen her coat as shiny and her skin as healthy as it is now. She loves the taste as well and she is a fairly picky eater. White boxers are known for their skin sensitivity and this stuff has helped her incredibly!!!

review/text: Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

review/summary: Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor
review/text: If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can.

I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness...the main ingredient in ALL of them (Larabar & Jocalat) is dates, this one also has almonds and cocoa powder, do note that just because it has cocoa powder it does not mean it's sweet, this is unsweetened cocoa powder, the sweetness comes from the dates.  It's a snack you can feel good about eating.  Just make sure you are not expecting a sugary chocolate taste, or you will be disappointed! If you want a real, raw, good for your body, mind and soul snack then I highly recommend.  I also love the Apple Pie Larabar!

They are dry and not the least bit sweet.  You do have to realize that you are not eating a candy bar, and that there is only 3-4 ingredients in most Larabars.  This works for the fruit flavors but not for this particular Larabar. I would not order them again.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into this chocolate coffee jocalat bar! It is very tasty! To me, it is very much like having a brownie without all the sugar, wheat, dairy, etc. This is by far my new favorite flavor of Larabar! It doesn't really have a coffee taste to it. It just tastes like a dark chocolate treat. So, if you don't care for coffee, it is still worth a try.

review/summary: Quick and Yummy
review/text: I'm addicted to these! They're basically like a raw candy bar. I like them because the ingredients are healthy and they don't contain agave syrup. I used to make something similar, but these are so much easier and convenient to have on hand. I suggest you try the various flavors before buying a whole box on Amazon. I decided to try every flavor and discovered (oddly enough) that I only like the original chocolate. It seemed like most of the other flavors were too dry or something. If you buys these expecting them to taste like a "real" candy bar, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a healthy treat though give them a try.

review/summary: LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!
review/text: I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as "food" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like "dessert".

review/summary: Different (Good!) Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I think that some of the comments that mention that it's not chocolate-y enough or just plain tastes bad might be used to a more milk-chocolate taste rather than a pure chocolate taste. Since, as far as I understand, the only sweetness in this bar comes from the dates, people might be missing the processed sugar and all the other stuff usually mixed in with chocolate.<br />I also thought at first that the bar tasted strange, but I think it was like a city person getting to the countryside and thinking that the fresh air is unbreathable. I was intrigued enough to try a second bar, which I tasted so much better than I remembered. The third was a revelation. Now I crave this flavor all the time, and find that most other chocolate desserts that I used to love taste much too sweet.

review/summary: Jocolat Chocolate Orange bar
review/text: I like these bars but strangely, they don't really taste like chocolate or orange. They have a very strong orange-y smell (like concentrated orange oil, orange extract, or lots of orange zest) and a zest-like flavor but again, not quite orange or chocolate. But I like them. Weird I guess but they're moist and dense and you can't beat the unctuous quality of a snack that feels naughty, fills you up, and yet is healthy and natural and actually good for you. I'm starting to really like Larabars and hope to try more flavors.

review/text: I recently discovered LARABAR and am in full addiction mode.  I love most of the flavors.  Chocolate is one of my favorites.  I wish they had more mixed boxes as 16 of the same flavor will wear me down.  If you get a chance, try to Cashew flavor and the Chocolate Coconut Chew -- they're delicious.  So far the only flavor I'm not a fan of is the banana -- the consistency was weird.

At the end of my case, I thought the taste wasn't as good they tasted like they spoiled even though the exp. date was very good.  These bars make a good snack or meal on the go.  I like to keep them in my bag for times when I'm out past my usual lunch/dinner ect.  They help keep the hunger at bay for a bit & keep you going.  They also make a nice quick meal as long as you have them with something, yogurt/kefir or the like.  The flavor is a mild chocolate nut.  I will buy again, but not by the case I think that was a bit much for me.

review/text: I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not.

review/summary: Satisfy Without Being Overly Sweet
review/text: Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee was the first Larabar that I've ordered. Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end.

The hazelnuts are lost in that variety, too; had such high expectations and these just fell flat.

review/text: I LOVE Larabars.  I am a very healthy eater and I try to limit sugary desserts as much as possible.  With that said, I occasionally get a sweet tooth.  These are a GREAT alternative to a brownie or other dessert when you feel like indulging without the guilt.  All of these bars have very few ingredients and are made of mostly  fruit and nuts. I also find that just 1 bar is satisfying.<br /><br />These are a good pick if you like dark chocolate.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person you will probably still like them, however they are less sweet and creamy than milk chocolate is, more bittersweet.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these you need to.  With around 200 calories per bar or less, these bars are like having a brownie with less than half the calories.

review/text: I have food allergies, and while I am looking for a Chocolate fix, I think this will take a bit to get used to. The Cherry Pie is quite good, and tastes like the center of a fig newton. The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor. Next time I will try the plain chocolate as I hear they get good reviews.<br />Over all, The Cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10, but the Choco-cherry gets a resounding 2.

review/summary: Delicious for a snack or treat
review/text: I should start off by saying I was not instantly a convert to Larabars. I tried a few of the flavors in the regular line (Larabars) and did not prefer them over other snack/meal bars. The Jocalat bars, however, changed my mind. I love how they are the perfect balance of fruits, nuts, and cocoa. You can taste all of the flavors and they all work really well together. The chocolate mint is my favorite because the mint has a really clean natural favor and compliments the chocolate well. It easily takes away my cravings for a chocolate bar. I also really enjoy the chocolate orange and chocolate cherry flavors that are in this line. Now if they just come out with a chocolate banana version I will be in heaven.<br /><br />Despite all my raving it's still important to keep in mind that these DO NOT taste like a candy bar or a baked brownie. They definitely have more of a raw taste to them and you can still taste the dates so if you do not like the flavor of dates you may not like these. I also recommend that you try the flavors before committing to a whole case. I've found the Larabar flavors to be hit or miss with my personal tastes. There are some that I love and enthusiastically buy again and others that don't seem worth the calories.<br /><br />Overall these are great and I like them so much better than Larabar flavors and have recommended them to many friends.

review/summary: Great & Gluten Free!
review/text: I really like another chocolate flavored bar that's also gluten free, and have been a repeat customer of the other bar.  But I was very surprised at how much more I like the LaraBar Jocalat, Chocolate bar.  These area great!  I rated the other product 5 stars, because I simply couldn't find anything wrong with them and thought they were that good - these are even better.  And they're gluten free!<br /><br />One slight caution: I knew I wouldn't be able to eat a regular meal one day, so I took three of these along and made the mistake of enjoying all three at once in place of the meal.  I hadn't thought about what the "consequences" might be.  Two of these bars at a time are plenty for an active lower digestive system!  If you intend to spend an hour or more in a meeting a few hours after eating three of these, you may find it more than a little uncomfortable.  Have some Imodium handy in that instance.  ;~}<br /><br />GRITS

review/summary: Not good
review/text: These did not taste good to me.  They were almost chalky and did not have a good flavor.  The mint tasted strange.  I'm disappointed since I enjoy other flavors of Larabars.  I would pass on these and get the cashew cookie, or apple pie if you want something sweet and that tastes great.<br /><br />Edit : This review is for the chocolate mint flavor obviously

review/summary: Ick.
review/text: This is my very first review - I thought these were genuinely terrible. I like Larabars; I think the Cherry Pie variety tastes good. But these? Overwhelming orange oil/ zest flavor (it tasted just the way the orange essence smells) and zero chocolate flavor. If you haven't had these yet,  buy an individual bar before buying the box. I now have 15.9 of these bars and will *not* eat them.

review/text: These bars look and taste like they fell out of a monkey's butt.  Perhaps it's an acquired taste that I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate.  OR....the monkey thing.

review/summary: Very minty
review/text: I love Larabars and I bought a box of these when they were on sale and I didn't like these as much.  They are a little too minty for me.  The funny thing is that I bought a box of these because I had bought one from the health food store and I loved it.  It was very delicious to me then but six months later I guess my taste buds had changed.  The flavors I do really like are cherry, apple, lemon, and chocolate coconut.

review/summary: terrible
review/text: This bar tastes like fermented oranges.  I like alcohol,but this just tastes bad.  It has a chocolate/orange alcohol taste to it. The chocolate coconut is a little better, but not great.

review/summary: The Chocolate Coffee is not so good
review/text: I tried one of these since they were on sale and I am happy I only bought one (I've never tried the Larabars before).  It is pretty dry and gritty, reminded me of coffee grounds more than coffee.  They are organic which is cool, but they just don't do it for me.
