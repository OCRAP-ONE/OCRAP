review/summary: Need fiber? Try this tasty, crunchy cereal.
review/text: Kashi makes some great whole-grain cereals (U is the best!!) and the GOLEAN Crunch Honey Almond Flax is one of the better varieties. Very, very crunchy with and excellent blend of nutty goodness and sweet honey. It's great with Silk Light vanilla soy milk.

review/summary: Product can cause serious dental problems
review/text: I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast. Dismissing the problem, I then later broke a cap snacking on the cereal. Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.<br /><br />My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill.

review/summary: Have a toothbrush handy.
review/text: I had a very favorite granola style cereal which I can no longer purchase locally since a mega-chain bought out their only competition in my town and the chain store so far refuses to put my favorite on their shelf.  I've searched ever since for a replacement and this GOLEAN Crunch comes close.  The bag had lots of clusters of cereal in the top third of the bag, but as you got down further the pieces became smaller and smaller.  I would imagine this is simply a result of the trauma these cereal boxes go through in the shipping process.<br /><br />The cereal itself didn't actually have any taste for me at all.  I suppose if I were forced to ascribe a word to it I would use "nutty".  The almond slices are certainly full sized for the most part and I think that in combination with some of the grains is what gives me that nutty taste.  The cereal does not have any sweet taste at all, but you also realize there is no need to add any sugar.  I always add fresh fruit of some kind and yogurt with just a splash of milk for the consistency I prefer.  Eating a bowl of this combination is guaranteed to keep me from even thinking about wanting anything else for a good four hours, even longer if I'm really busy.<br /><br />If there is a drawback to the cereal it is in the fact that one (or more) of the grains has hulls and those stick to my teeth like glue.  Like one of those annoying popcorn husks you just can't quite reach without the dental floss.  I have to make sure I brush my teeth after eating this cereal or I will find a "treasure" later which will drive me crazy until I can floss.<br /><br />Because my mega-chain grocery now has no competition I had to pay one penny less than five dollars for this box of cereal last week.  If I want to drive miles and miles I can get to a big box store which may or may not have this cereal on it's shelf that day.  I would much rather order the four boxes from Amazon at a really good price and save myself all that trouble.

review/summary: My new favorite snack
review/text: When I used to see the TV ad for Kashi Golean cereal,I thought the name was strange & that I would never eat it 'cause maybe it would be filled with twigs & other birdseed-like ingredients. Boy,was I ever wrong. I love it! It's crunchy & flavorful, but not too sweet. I also like the little almond slivers included. The taste & texture of this cereal reminds me a little of grapenuts. I eat it as a snack mostly without milk. I've even got my Mom turned on to it as she likes crunchy stuff too. I think what I will do next is soak it in a little soymilk just to soften it some & then top plain vanilla ice cream with it (without the soymilk). That's one way I use grapenuts too. Anyway, try Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal,Honey Almond Flax, you will enjoy it!

review/summary: Delicious, when prepared right
review/text: Warning: this isn't your average hippy-dippy crunchy cereal. It's got CRUNCH that reminds me more of granola that's been in the back of the pantry a few months too long. It's really tasty, however! I suggest letting 1 cup of cereal soak for five minutes in whole milk to improve the texture, adding freeze-dried banana slices or blueberries for extra tasty nutrition (and besides, that makes the milk tastes good at the end, too).  I usually start prepping a bowl when I turn on my coffeemaker in the morning, it does take some time, but it is a very flavorful cereal and I am not famished at the end of the day, even when I don't find time to eat lunch. However the price at my local chain grocery store is about 2/3 that of Amazon, so if you can get it locally, it might be cheaper, thrifty folks!

review/summary: May Develop Rancid Flavor Due To Polyunsaturated Linolenic Acid?
review/text: If I store a box of this cereal for too long, I can detect a very slight rancid flavor in it.  I am extremely sensitive to this; my friends and family can't tell and think I'm crazy.  As long as you eat the cereal within two weeks or so of opening the box, this shouldn't be a problem!<br /><br />The rancidity may be due to the flaxseed which contains polyunsaturated linolenic oils; while they are healthy, they are also highly prone to oxidation.  While it is probably not a huge issue, research has suggested that oxidized oils may pose a cardiovascular health risk!<br />http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1745-4506.2001.tb00028.x<br />This may be a consideration for you if you are similarly sensitive and take a while to finish the six boxes in this multipack.<br /><br />I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E074">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E08S">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch!

Toasted Berry Crumble, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E060">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />We save quite a bit of money this way, and we always have a stock available.  I eat it for breakfast every morning and often for a snack as well - it really is tasty and filling, has lots of healthy protein and fiber, and doesn't leave you feeling sugar-shocked like kid's cereals overloaded with high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.  I rotate between the five cereals listed above to keep things interesting.<br /><br />I first encountered this stuff while on internship in the Bay Area.  At that point I didn't have much time or inclination to cook, so I came to rely on it for quite a bit of my total caloric intake, eating it with soymilk for as many as two meals a day.  To keep things interesting, I augmented it with more almonds, walnuts, pecans, fresh pomegranate, strawberries, or peaches, frozen blueberries, cocoa powder... pretty much anything I could think of!  I had a lengthy bicycle commute to work and I began exploring strength training and martial arts three or four days a week at the company gym, and this stuff kept me going.<br /><br />It's been four years now, but this is still my favorite cereal in the Kashi family.  Highly recommended!

review/text: To me, the taste is similar to Sugar Smacks or Sugar Crisp, though not so overwhelmingly sweet and a LOT more crunchy. This is not a cereal to just pour and eat. I usually let it set a bit to soften in milk or soy milk. It helps the flavor a little, too. I like this one slightly more than the regular crunch. I am a fan of most of the Kashi products I have tried.

review/text: If you're tired of the sugary cereals leaving you feeling empty an hour after eating, try this!  Especially if you like crunchy, nutty, and all around goodness!  At first, I looked at this cereal and thought the price to size ratio was totally out of whack.  But, one day, my brother and I gave them a try and we found that we don't have to eat such a huge proportion of cereal anymore!  We are no longer hungry an hour after we eat!  This cereal is all about fiber and will keep you feeling fuller longer than the sugary cereals out on the market.  Amazon's subscription just makes it so much easier and affordable.  Give it a try...go to the grocery store, pay the silly price and try this cereal!  It IS worth it!  Then, come back and subscribe to it.  I did!

review/text: I'm trying to increase the amount of protein I take in early in the day. If I don't, I end up hungry an hour or two after eating.<br /><br />Kashi Go Lean Crunch Almond Flax is a perfect granola substitute to add to yogurt. I can slowly mix in about 2/3 of a cup into my daily yogurt container. Since yogurt alone isn't my favorite, this is a perfect way to enjoy it. It taste so much better. I get 5 grams of protein from the yogurt and approximately 7 grams from the 2/3 cup of cereal.<br /><br />Cost wise.... the yogurt plus Kashi cereal is much better than some protein bars. I can get 12 grams of protein for less money.

review/text: I used to eat Honey Nut Cheerios all the time for breakfast, but after taking a Nutrition course decided to switch to something healthier. GoLean Crunch with honey is full of nutrients needed for your health every day. It is also very tasty. It has almonds, grains and flax seed mixed with honey. The product is sweet, but not too sweet like Frosted Flakes, for example. You can soak the cereal in milk for 5 minutes and make it soft, and you can eat it crunchy. It takes some time to chew the cereal, which is extremely good for your digestive system and is generally satisfying.

As far as the "healthy" cereals go, this is my favorite.  I've tried all the Kashi brands, store brands and the other major labels.  The one con of the cereal is that its pretty hard/crunchy until is soaks in milk for few minutes.  It's not a big deal for me though.  Kashi makes great, if somewhat pricey, cereal.

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious (And Good For You, Too!)
review/text: After struggling with pain due to gallstones, I did some research about diet changes, and among the suggestions were:<br /><br />1 - Find alternative means of protein where possible because of the fat & cholesterol in meat & poultry.<br />2 - Increase fiber intake.<br />3 - Replace refined and "enriched" carbohydrates with wheat or whole grain where possible.<br />4 - Incorporate flaxseed into diet.<br /><br />This cereal did all of those things for me, and on top of all that - it's delicious!  I've tried other Kashi brand cereals, but this is by far my favorite.  I agree with other reviewers who compared it to Smacks... (in my mind, it's like Smacks mixed with Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds).<br /><br />A recommendation for anyone who finds it too "dense", or thinks it's too expensive to buy regularly... I usually make myself a mixed bowl of this with Honey Nut Cheerios (half and half of each).  The combination works great, in my opinion!  :-)

review/text: This is good cereal.  It has crunchy texture and is just a little tiny bit sweet.  This will not get soggy in milk!  Not only does it taste good, it is quite good for you, with flaxseed, fiber and protein to start your day right.  I also love to add it to yogurt and fruit, or just eat it plain.  I'll make you a deal.  If you try it and don't like it, just send it my way and I'll be glad to take it off your hands.  ;)

review/summary: GoLean Crunch Lover
review/text: Truly a great choice for a nutritious and healthy cereal.  With the high fiber and protein, without the added 'bad stuff', you can't go wrong.  I was eating the original Crunch before they came out with this one.  I would recommend the original as well.  I just prefer the flavor of this one a little more.  It is a part of my daily diet, along with some of the other Kashi brand cereals.  They are also great mixed together. I do not think you can go wrong with Kashi, I have been eating it for years.  It is nice to have a 'good for you' cereal that is also affordable.  Let's just hope they do not read this and up their prices.  Buy a box and try it.  I do recommend breaking it up before you open the bag though, unless you like a lot of big chunks of cereal.

review/summary: Kashi golean crunch honey almond flax falls flat
review/text: Not impressed. Soaked one cup of cereal in warm no-fat organic milk for a minute or two. Two bites had a hint of soapy flavor and the last one was fishy. Quaker Oats used to make a 100% Natural cereal which was superior in flavor and around 4-5 grams of fiber and it may be the same or similar to their Natural Granola Low-Fat (sp.?). This Kashi was dull at best....they can do better on taste and still make a healthy cereal. I agree with one reviewer who said this cereal got the sweetening just right.

review/text: My family found Veggie Straws a few months ago and are hooked! Incredibly tasty and simple, and better for you than typical potato chips.  These are made with potato, tomato and spinach, along with sunflower oil and salt.  That's it. No crazy ingredients, no weird flavors. My children love them, and we frequently pack them for road trips.  They're middle of the road as far as fat/calorie content - 38 straws (good sized portion) is 130 calories and 7 gms fat (mostly from the sunflower oil).  If you have a Costco nearby, they are a better bargain there - each large bag is $4.99.

review/summary: Tastes OK. Not healthy though
review/text: Apparently the other reviewers think that anything containing the word veggie is healthy. These snacks have 130 calories per serving, Frito-Lay Funyuns have only 120 calories in the same size package (28g). Funyuns also have less sodium. Veggie straws might have 2% of the RDA of vitamin C but thats about as healthy as it gets. To put that in perspective, a medium tomato (an actual vegetable) has over 60% of the RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This is an empty calorie snack that is no more healthy than anything else in the snack isle. It's made almost exclusively from processed potatoes and corn, the same as any other salty junk food.

review/summary: Snack attack!
review/text: These little buggers are so addicting.  It's like a cross between a potato chip and a french-fry, yet not greasy.  These are light and airy and have the perfect crunch to accompany each bite, and at only 130 calories for 32 of them, you can literally go to town on these and not feel bad about it.  I don't taste the tomato or the spinach, which may be a good thing.  In all honesty, the color of these sticks has about as much impact on the taste as the color of an M&M...they all taste the same, and that taste is delicious.  A little on the pricy side, but for an indulgence that won't make you feel weighed down, it's worth it; right?  I've never felt this good about `snacking'.

They literally taste like potato chips, good ones at that!  The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because, like most potato chips, they are greasy and I found a few hard straws at the very bottom of the bag!

review/summary: A Light Cereal With A Balanced Taste
review/text: Strawberry Fields is a great cereal in Kashi's Organic Promise line.  It has a very balanced taste between the long grain rice and wheat flakes and the strawberries and raspberries.  The flakes are sweetened with a combination of evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup for a light, natural sweetness.  The flakes are crisp and maintain the crunch in milk without being overly hard.  This cereal is also not very dense with a full one cup serving clocking in at only 120 calories.  The trade off that you make is that this cereal is fairly low in fiber compared to other Kashi cereals such as Autumn Wheat or Go Lean Crunch - both of these are in the neighborhood of 200 calories for a one cup serving.  If you are satisfied with the nutrition decision, you will almost certainly like the taste.  I found it to be essentially what I had expected the first time that I had it, and I've been eating it periodically for years now.  I like to rotate among the various Kashi cereals from week to week in order to maintain some variety.  I highly recommend Strawberry Fields for anyone looking for a lighter cereal with a balanced taste.

review/text: I remember purchasing this cereal a few years back when I first saw it on the shelf.  Although the flakes are seriously hard to eat (rice grit?), I thought they were really generous w/the quantity of strawberries.  HOWEVER, I just purchased a box the other day and they've drastically reduced the strawberry count (but kept the overall box a smallish 10 oz.).  A quick inspection of the clear bag of cereal reveals around 6-7 dried strawberry slices total.  I won't be purchasing this one again.

review/text: Bought this on sale from amazon for about $12 ($3 a pop) which is too much for my standards of cereal, but I thought I'd try it due to amazing reviews + prior good experience with anything Kashi.  It was NOT That great.  If you're reading the reviews and thinking how on earth is flakes and dried berries that great? Well you're right.  No magic star dust in this box.  In fact it tasted a lot like regular kellogs flakes and strawberry cereal.  In fact, I thought the former tasted better.<br /><br />I loved the "wholewheaty" taste of this kashi cereal (the only thing that separated this cereal from other similar types) but I did think it was a little too sweet.  well...I donno...something was off.<br /><br />Also, the pricing is absurd.  That and this box's 'typical' taste makes me say: if you're craving the flavor, buy one box from your local store, satisfy your craving and go get something else.  This is just not worth it.<br /><br />(Taste= 3.5 stars.  Taking price into account = makes the package worth 2stars really. I just felt like being nice :)<br /><br />Summary:<br />-- like kellogs version<br />-- wholewheat tasting flakes<br />-- too expensive<br />-- not recommend

review/text: This is Kashi's answer to Kellogg's Special K...it's healthier, organic and higher in fiber, but I will point out that the berry content can vary greatly from box to box--some may need some external berry assistance.  America needs to eat more fiber.  Here's part of the solution!

review/summary: Disappointing cutback on strawberries and raspberries!
review/text: I used to really love this cereal, but I am now on the 2nd box of a 4 box pack that I bought from Amazon (May, 2012) and there is a ridiculously small amount of fruit in these boxes.  The first box, absolutely zero raspberries and about 6 slices of strawberries.  The 2nd box, about 8 slices of strawberries and 2 raspberries in the entire box. Kashi, what is up with this?  It wasn't that way earlier this year.  I just cancelled all future orders of this product, it was on my subscribe and save list; I was buying 4 boxes at a time.<br /><br />So unless you buy Strawberry Fields cereal just for the rice flakes, you might want to consider a lower cost alternative that will actually provide you with a reasonable amount of fruit in your cereal.  I'm going back to adding frozen strawberries to my Cheerios in the morning.  I can get a bag of frozen strawberries for a little over $2, it lasts me a week and I can get plenty of strawberries on every bowl of cereal at that price.  Adios, Kashi!

review/summary: Fantastic Cereal
review/text: This is indeed a fantastic cereal.  Kashi doesn't skimp on the strawberries or raspberries.  It has a great taste and the flakes hold their crunch, which to me is very important.  One reviewer states it's hard for them to eat.  I've experienced that only because I didn't have enough milk in the bowl.  The fruit is dried (not dehydrated like raisins but dry as a bone).  You want to (a) have enough milk to hydrate the fruit enough and soften the flakes if you need it and (b) stir it once or twice so the fruit on top hits the milk.  I've always kind of poked and stirred my cereal (drove my mom nuts) so I've never had a problem except for when I didn't have enough milk in my bowl as I've stated.<br /><br />I'd be remiss if I didn't state the obvious.  The current price they have on here of $34.95 for 4 bags weighing 10.4oz is outrageous.  You can buy 10 boxes of the same weight for about the same price. I've read the reviews thinking that I missed something, but I don't seem to have.  The price here is a ripoff.

review/text: Since I have decided to eat healthy buy eating natural and organic foods I wanted to try this cereal. I have tried many kashi cereals in the past and they are good I have to say this is for the best cereal kashi has made. I bought some boxes to work with me to eat for breakfast I offered some to my coworkers they love it; They were so good that my coworkers had wiped me out and I had to order more for myself and the staff. I will continue to buy Kashi Organic Promise Cereal, Strawberry Fields.

It's still available but at a price that makes driving 40 miles and buying locally affordable compared to Amazon's new and current price.<br /><br />The cereal?  We thought, and still do, excellent.  Taste, crunch, dehydrated strawberries that hydrate with milk. We would continue the Subscribe and Save orders if they were available.  Kashi has other cereals, some very good and of course, it all depends on what YOU like.  I can only tell you what we like!

This is probably one of the best cereals I've ever had. It is nice and crunchy, and the strawberries in it don't turn to mush like some other cereals would. I subscribe to this item to save the couple extra dollars. Great deal and tastes great as well.

review/text: This isn't a cereal I'd normally choose after having some bad run-ins with similar cereals with freeze-dried fruit. My mother bought me a box and I felt I should at least give it a try. The flakes tasted pretty good but they're rather hard and a bit gritty. It wasn't that hard to chew but the texture is odd. The strawberries, thank goodness, are way better than the strawberries in Kellogg's and some of the others. They soft up nicely instead of being chewy and gummy. Overall, it's a decent cereal for a light breakfast. I'm probably buy this again.

review/summary: Just the Best Cereal
review/text: Oh my god. I love this cereal. And funny enough when I first purchased it I bought the wrong one. My daughter was temporarily staying with me several weeks back and one morning I saw some cereal she had in a container with dried strawberries which I had with a bit of milk and thought - "Yum"!  I kept meaning to ask her what cereal it was but kept forgetting and when I found myself in the cereal aisle a few weeks back I picked up a box of the first cereal I saw with flakes and dried strawberries.<br /><br />As it turns out - my daughter happened to pop over a few days later and while we were standing in the kitchen - chatting - while I prepared food - the cereal box caught my eye and I remembered and said .. "Lauren - look .. I found your cereal and I just love it - so thank you for turning me onto it".  To which she responded - that's not the cereal I had when I was staying here. Ha! So I gave her a handful of my cereal and guess what - she likes it even more then the brand she bought.<br /><br />I was so happy when I found it here at Amazon and quickly added to it my subscriptioned items. Thanks Kashi. Great Cereal!

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy cereal.
review/text: This is really tasty delicious cereal.  The flakes have a slightly sweet flavor that is off-set by the slight tartness of the natural huge slices of dehydrated berries.  I would give a word of warning though, the flakes are VERY crunchy, which may be an issue if you have dental problems.  I think they are great because they don't get soggy quick in the milk.  My 6-year-old loves it too.  For those of you who automatically think that the word "Kashi" means sawdust (like a few of my friends who I have had to retrain), you can get that notion out of your head because there is no gritty, grainy texture to this, just nice crunchy flakes.

Each praline is sealed in plastic separately which means less exposure to air that keeps them fresh longer.  Save some $$ and get the larger box and save on the shipping.

If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!
