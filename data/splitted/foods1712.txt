review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

review/summary: Dogs love'em
review/text: Been getting these for years.  A favorite game is to take a handful or two... I have several dogs .. and toss them around the room.  All at once.  The gang then spends the next 10-15 minutes... looking (sniffing) for all the little pieces, scattered about.<br /><br />A fun way for them to spend time and have fun with a reward for their effort.

review/summary: Perfect treat for training!!
review/text: Best Buddy Bits are perfect for training.  I have 2 small dogs that I have trained in agility and as therapy dogs.....they won't even take another type of treat. Also, great because my hands don't get the smell on them from the other type of treats that are soft and chewy, so I can leave these in my pocket or hand without fear of the smell getting on me....so nice...people that train dogs understand this......  Will do all their tricks and listen perfectly for these treats......was so happy to find them on Amazon, my local pet store carried them for a long time then tried something new. I think they are going back to Best Buddy Bits after talking to the manager, if not I will continue to purchase them through Amazom.com.  THANKS!!!!!

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste.

However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

After waiting for a new pot for over a month the new pot never came. I called the seller and the person on the phone promised to send me one right away. Never happened. I emailed them again, but no response. Save your money and purchase from someone else.

The end of the feather can snap and it might still fly right, but after enough breaks, it doesn't flutter in the air and then your cat may lose interest.

review/summary: Very Tasty and Filling.
review/text: So I purchased these on a whim. They are very quick to prepare(under 2 minutes). This makes it a perfect quick, filling meal. These have a good amount of weight to them. The noodles are thick and flavorful. The sauce is very tasty as well. Little bit of a tang, slightly hot, but very flavorful. The crushed peanuts included is a nice touch and definitely make it more filling... Also worth noting is, you do not need a microwave to make these. It sure does make things easier, but you can prepare the noodles with just hot water as well by covering and letting sit for a few.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied, it tasted much better than the 2 minutes of preparation would have me expect. I see myself purchasing more of these and trying other Annie Chun foods. I recommend these.

review/summary: Horrific
review/text: I normally do not comment when I dislike a product. However, this is (I am currently attempting to eat one) so horrible I just had to.<br /><br />First of all, the directions to add a cup of water... that fills the bowls mostly up, and the microwave time as given doesn't properly cook the noodles (yes I started with very hot water to begin with). Even when cooked more, the texture of the noodles reminds me of rubbery spaghetti. The noodles are wheat, so this could be expected, but it is still very unappealing.<br />The included sauce is bland to the point of being tasteless (it does have a mildly spicy aftertaste though).<br /><br />Finally, and most horribly, I can taste the plastic leaching out of the container into the noodles and sauce. This is just unacceptable.<br /><br />I will give credit to this bowl for having a better selection of dried vegetables than others I've eaten; they are in fact quite good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.

review/summary: Very surprised by all the positive feedback...
review/text: I don't typically eat processed foods but I was sold on their mission statement of offering convenient, healthy, delicious meals made with only natural and organic ingredients (100% Natural, No MSG, No Preservatives).  I bought several to keep at my office, unfortunately, these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.<br /><br />The first one I tried was late last year.  They were the Teriyaki Noodles and after trying to convince myself that it wasn't 'that bad', I finally tossed it after just several bites.  I refused to touch the other bowls in my desk after that experience but also didn't throw them out because it seemed like such a waste.  Today, out of hunger and laziness, I finally tried the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl.  While I did find this one to be more palatable and finished all but just a few bites, it really isn't something I could recommend to anyone.<br /><br />The Teriyaki Sauce and Noodles were just gross.  The Kung Pao Sauce was at least tasty but the Noodles were still funky.  Basically, the noodles are pre-cooked and vacumed sealed for you.  Out of their packaging, they smell like playdoh and they look weird - like soft rubber - not like a food item.  You add boiling water (or microwave them with water) to basically re-heat them, drain and add the sauce.  I love the concept but that weird playdoh smell just never disapears and I find it hard to convince my brain that I'm actually eating noodles and not some weird inorganic product.  With the Kung Pao noodles, I chose to use boiling water (over the microwave method I used the first time) and after straining the noodles I repeated the process a second time with more boiling water to better 'rinse' the noodles.  This seemed to get rid of the weird smell a bit more and the sauce was flavorful enough that it covered up most of the remaining weird noodle smell taste.<br /><br />The last one I have in my drawer is the Pad Thai flavor.  I'm in no rush to try it but of course, won't throw it out (I hate being wasteful like that) but once it's gone, I will not be purchasing any more Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls.

review/text: Let me just say that I had a choice between this meal and saltines and I chose the saltines. At least they don't have that overpowering sweet soy sauce taste. It was an empty meal. The cover gives a false impression of a more hardy, diverse product than that which I discovered when I opened the bland noodle package. It tasted like I was doing myself harm in the consumption of the noodle bowl; like I was dangerously close to my maximum dosage of sodium and sugar. It is cheap and its GREAT that the bowl is biodegradable. But please, make it taste like food and charge more. If I wanted to eat sweetened flour for a low price then I'd eat fast food. I'd rather pay a bit more for a good product.

If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/summary: Good noodles but very complicated and spicy
review/text: These noodles are great and all, but they require you to drain the noodles, which can be a little hard. They smelled weird at first too, but anyway. It was insanely spicy for me for some reason, it was probably in the dry toppings but if you dont mind spiciness then this is great! I still kept on eating it, but eventually stopped because my lips were burning. I'll try another one later without the spicy powders and just with the sauce I guess.

review/summary: Seriously mouth-watering
review/text: It's best to allow this caramel to melt in your mouth, but I can't help chewing it and then in moments, it's gone.  That's why I can eat a whole package (12 or so) in a day.  So creamy, so sweet, so rich.  Morinaga's milk caramel is so much better than Brach's.  I used to eat this as a child when my mother would buy it for me from Asian supermarkets and now I have discovered it here at Amazon.com.  It usually retails for $1.99 at the supermarket, but I've seen it for as much as $2.89 as well.  Yum! Yum! Yum!

review/summary: Wow, This Is So Good!
review/text: I've been a fan of Morinaga's caramels for a long time, but I've always had the Katou (black sugar/Kuro Sato) variety and sesame type. I'm not a huge fan of milk, and I know that when the Japanese say it's a milk caramel they will have the taste of milk first and foremost. I bought these for a friend who loves Morinaga caramels I gave him, but would prefer a "regular" type, not the molasses flavor. Naturally I gave this a try, and WOW was I pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It DOES have a milky taste in the forefront, but... somehow I like it. The texture is soft, but firm, and melts in the mouth... in theory... I almost always end up chewing away! The package is absurdly convenient, with a little slide-out tray holding 12 cubes of caramel, each individually wrapped in a little bit of folded paper/foil. It's easy to unwrap, which is good, because you'll be tearing these things apart... they are that good. If you like caramel, I find it hard to imagine you not loving this, even if you're like me and are not a fan of milk. Maybe it's the quality, or type, or preparation, but this is just addictive as hell.<br /><br />Specific to this seller, the native box has NO English, but this has a sticker on the plastic wrap with full nutritional information and ingredients. It's a good thing too, because this is NOT a diet food... it's a rich and delicious treat. If you have issues with your teeth, this is not sticky or hard, and won't give you trouble. While the Katou caramel is still my favorite... nothing beats Okinawa's Kuro Sato... this now occupies a beloved and close second ahead of the black sesame variety.<br /><br />As a 20 pack, that is a lot, but since these are ideal gifts and... well to be honest you eat them quickly... it's a good number. The taste is fresh, the quality is there, and my only regret is that I didn't have this as a child; I would have loved the packaging even more than I do now.

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: Best spicy noodle on the market
review/text: Although this noodle is the "default" according to my Korean friend, I believe it is the best spicy noodle on the market. It is VERY spicy for those that are not accustomed to spicy food. If you have not tried this noodle before, I'd recommend using only half the chili powder packet. Then adjust as necessary for later meals. I've been eating this noodle for years and years. The recipe that I normally use is:<br /><br />1 egg<br />Chinese green onions (chopped)<br />lemon juice<br />sesame oil<br /><br />Bring water to a boil with the noodle in a pot. Then pour out the water and run cold water over the noodle. This cleans the noodles of the materials left over from the manufacturing process. Set noodle aside. Then bring filtered water to a boil with both ingredient packets. It takes several minutes for the dried vegetables to hydrate. Put noodles back in. Add 3-4 drops of lemon juice and 1-2 drops of sesame oil. Add the green onions. Stir. Break the egg over the top of the noodles. Make sure your hands are dry to avoid steam burns! Wait until the egg white turns from translucent to white. Serve over large bowl. Break the egg and allow the yolk to run over the noodles. YUM!

I hope Amazon continues to stock Shin Ramyun for spicy food lovers to enjoy.

review/summary: One of the best 'ramen' out there. Great as a base for a quick meal.
review/text: An Asian friend of mine introduced these Nong Shim Spicy noodles (beef flavor) to me and I was hooked from day 1.<br />I love spicy and these are SPICY.<br />You get 2 bags of condiments: one is the red Cayenne, beef flavor  and spice mix (contains MSG, fyi) and the other is dried chopped vegetables (including chinese mushroom flakes that sweel in the cooking cycle).<br /><br />Preparation: Boil water (determine how watery you want it), add condiments, and noodles (round shape, perfectly fits a small pan). Before the noodles get soft switch off the heat and let it sit for 2 minutes and enjoy.<br /><br />That is not how we eat it though: when not in the mood to cook a big meal or when we have left over meat or vegetables we will boil them into this (peas, cauliflower, chicken... hotdogs..) Sky is the limit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Famous Nong Shim noodles taste great (we always have a box in the house)<br />- You can turn it into a full meal with leftovers<br />- Plenty spicy<br />- Not the thin ramen but Korean style thicker ones. Great mouth feel if not cooked too soft.<br />- Nice chopped vegetables in the condiments<br />- Larger per meal than the regular icky ramen that people buy for 30c a piece (ewww)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Contains MSG<br />- Some people become gassy from these (Amazon has good deals on Beano)<br />- The Seafood and other versions of these are HORRIBLE tasting. Make sure you get the red box beef flavored spicy ones.

review/summary: Only Two Tastes - Salt and Red Pepper - yet I like it. Add an egg and it really improves. Unfortunately it is far from healthy
review/text: Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many "soup lovers" and reviewers. That includes me. I certainly like this soup - but I'm under no illusions - it is far from healthy and it only has two flavors.<br /><br />Candidly, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. If you add an egg --- it can taste even better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET, as I said, I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a "spice" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper.<br /><br />Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup "medium hot" but for many I'd imagine they would call it "very hot". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup.<br /><br />At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything "hot". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy.  It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy. Of course, adding an egg to the mix, just makes this soup less healthy.<br /><br />Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these "reviewers" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny "flavor packet" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a "food".<br /><br />My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value.

review/summary: Great base flavor
review/text: This is my favorite spicy ramen. What I enjoy about it is that it has a great base flavor that you can manipulate to create a variety of dishes. For example, I can add a raw egg, some strips of beef (maybe some beef base/dashida) and green onion and create a dish reminiscent of Korean Yukejang (fiery beef soup). Or I can go in another direction and use green onion and a handful of shrimp or seafood mix to create a fiery broth that mimics jang-pong (spicy seafood with noodles). I've even used the season packet (sans noodles) with silken tofu, onion, and oysters to make a quickie soon-dubu (tofu hotpot).<br /><br />Also, this stuff is fantastic during cold and flu season. Really clears up those sinuses.

This product is made in U.S.A which, I think, is safer to consume. It's a bit spicy. If you do not like spicy, then you need to be careful picking this product. By the way, each bay contains 240 calories (calories from fat is 70)

Once back at home, I prepared the noodles.  Delicious!  I love spicy food, although much of the food labeled as spicy simply isn't hot at all.  I started buying them from our distributor for sale in our store.  I buy them for myself at Amazon.  Our store sells these noodles for $1.49/each.  Since we are not offered an employee discount, I opt to pay less here.

review/summary: Authentic
review/text: I lived in Korea for a year, and I've tried ALL the different options available here for spicy ramen.  This is the same as what the street vendors in Korea serve!  However, they add egg to the soup AND put some cheese into the mix.  Add the egg to the soup when it's cooking and mix it in, sprinkle some cheese on the top once you've put in in the bowl.  I also only cook my noodles for 3 mins, they continue to cook in the hot water in the bowl, any longer than that and they are too soggy for me.  The only problem here on Amazon is the price.  I can get a case for literally half the price at any of our Asian food stores here in Denver.  Disappointing, I'd have used the subscribe and save option if it weren't cost prohibitive.  My whole family **loves** these noodles, they are a staple in our house!

review/summary: Tasty Noodles but Misleading Lable...
review/text: My father and I have been eating this noodle for a few years now. Though it is more expensive than some of the lesser noodles, it is definitely good value because of the texture and taste, also considering that it is 4.2 oz instead of 2~3 oz of some other packaged noodles.<br /><br />Adding vegetables, seafood, eggs, and meat makes the noodle a full meal for me, quite satisfying after a long cold day working in the field. For my taste, I only use 1/2 of the seasoning package. Full pack is definitely too spicy for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the label listed at Amazon website says 4.2 oz "bowl," a more convenient way to prepare my noodles when sometimes I only have a microwave oven available. When I got the delivery, these turn out just regular "packages" instead of bowls. A disappointment at least, and the term "fraud" came to mind when I looked at what I got versus what I thought I was getting.<br /><br />Well, Amazon probably did not know the difference and counting on what the manufacturer specified. It would be nice if Amazon would correct the label on the website so those who are looking for noodle bowls instead of the regular packages will not be misled like I was.

review/summary: Good, plenty but little bit too spicy
review/text: We love the ramen. It's especially good as serving hot. The noodle will be soft and more delicious  when you cook with pan for about 5 mins. The package is large, 30 bags, divided into 4-5 small bag/ pack , 2 persons can share 1 bag for a light breakfast.<br /><br />The reason I dont give it 5 stars because it might be not good for someone not familiar with this level of spicy ( Could be extremely spicy while serving hot) and especially those with stomachache.

review/summary: Pretty darn good.
review/text: I've eaten the cheap ramen noodles like any other college student, and having read the reviews I was really looking forward to trying these Nong Shim Shin noodles.  Upon receipt I cooked one up to see what it's all about and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />These are still just noodles, so I wasn't expecting it to change the way I look at food.  But they are as high quality as any product in this genre.<br /><br />If you add the entire flavor packet it's quite warm.  Hot even.  Having tried them with a pinch of the packet, half of the packet, and the full packet... I find that I'm a half-packet fellow.  I like a medium amount of heat, and using the full packet is tolerable but I don't want to have to tolerate the food that I eat.<br /><br />And yes, I agree with the general consensus that while it's acceptable on its own, it also makes a fantastic base to which to add additional veggies and meats to build a greater and more substantial dish.<br /><br />Edit: The juice of one whole lemon or even one lime accentuates the flavors quite nicely.  To the point that I wouldn't want a bowl without some!

I didn't because I do love spicy food and they were really too hot for me.  I poured off the broth and was able to enjoy them but next time I will reduce the amount of the spice packet.

I like the vanilla flavor best.<br /><br />And it's organic!<br /><br />I much prefer rice beverages to oat, almond, hazelnut, and soy beverages, for flavor. There are some reasons not to drink too much soy as well (look it up).<br /><br />You'll have to get your protein elsewhere, but otherwise this drink is delicious and healthy and easy to digest- the best of the lot.

I've tried a number of the other milk substitutes including almond and soy, but I either didn't like the flavor, consistency, or both. Rice Dream tastes ok, but seems too watery for my taste.  This one is just the right consistency.  I still prefer regular non-fat milk best, but this will due as a reasonable substitute.  If I can't get organic milk, I'll use this instead.  Head's up on the shipping:  Whatever you do, don't click on "Buy Now With One Click."  I accidentally did this and ended up paying $20 for shipping on a case.

review/summary: Best Sea Salt
review/text: I first heard about this sea salt in the book, "Real Food", by Nina Planck, who touted its health benefits and delicious taste.  Unlike most  salts available today -- including gourmet sea salts, kosher salts, and table salts -- Celtic Sea Salt is hand-harvested, unprocessed, and unrefined in Brittany using centuries-old techniques.  This means it retains its original natural minerals, the absence of which in today's diet can contribute to a range of health problems.<br /><br />So fine, it's good for you.  But how does it taste?  As a regular user of expensive sea salts (purchased in gourmet food stoes, Whole Foods, etc.) before finding this one, I can say it is by far the best tasting one on the market.  It actually has a delicious stand-alone flavor and tastes less metallic than other sea salts I've purchased and more like authentic salt should.  I purchased some at Whole Foods and kept it out in a salt cellar on our table.  It quickly became the only salt we use, both to season our food at the table as well as in a wide range of recipes.  Now I buy it in bulk via Amazon, which offers a better price per ounce than the small jars sold at Whole Foods.

review/text: This unprocessed sea salt has much more than just sodium chloride in it. There are dozens of trace minerals in it making it much healthier for you. It is coarse, so just a little pinch sprinkled into your cooking or table food will do it. The taste is strong and goes a long way, but is SSOOO much better than normal table salt. If you want it fine, you can grind it in peppercorn grinder or buy the fine ground for a little more money.

review/text: This sea salt is excellent for cooking but also for general use. It tastes superior to any salt that I've ever tried and since it's harvested from cold, northern seas it has a much richer mineral content. Magnesium is especially important for the body and many studies show that approximately 2/3 of people are deficient in this element, this salt has a higher magnesium content than any other that I know of thanks in large part to the minimal processing that it undergoes.<br /><br />  * Celtic Sea Salts are a prime condiment that stimulates salivation, helps to balance and replenishes all of the body's electrolytes<br />  * It provides renewed energy<br />  * It gives you a high resistance to infections and bacterial diseases<br />  * It supplies all 82 vital trace minerals to promote optimum biological function and cellular maintenance<br />  * It balances alkaline/acid levels<br />  * It restores good digestion<br />  * The natural iodine in these salts protects against radiation, atomic fallout and many other pollutants<br />  * It can aid in relieving allergies and skin diseases<br />  * And overall greatly reduces toxins and to help prevent ill-health<br />  * Properly stored, salt keeps virtually indefinitely

review/text: This salt is only $5.00 from the manufacturer's website, celticseasalt . c o m , further more this website and this manufacturer is highly deceptive, and it is obvious by the comments on this website. all modern sea salt has significantly less trace minerals than ancient himalayan sea salt. the manufacturer provides a graph that seems to indicate this salt has more than 3 times the trace minerals, when all they are really comparing is the moisture content. you are paying for about 12% water when you buy this product by weight, which is about 3 times the amount of water in himalayan salt.<br /><br />Himalayan salt forms an alkaline solution in water, due to its higher trace mineral content, while all modern sea salt forms acidic solutions. this salt does have a decent flavor, which i find goes well with fish, but for all other cooking, himalayan salt is both tastier and healthier. a lot of reviewers have been duped by the spurious and misleading information on the manufacturers website. this salt has a significantly lower ratio of trace minerals to sodium than himalayan salt.<br /><br />Finally, the mercury and other heavy metal content in modern sea salt is much higher than in himalayan salt. harvesting "deep water" which protects against many organic pollutants that float like gasoline in a street puddle, does nothing to prevent the increased levels of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and other heavy metals from getting into the salt.

review/summary: Good for cooking, seasoning, nasal irrigation
review/text: We love the taste of this salt. It is very course, I mainly use this to throw into soups and things that it will dissolve into, or dissolve with a bit of melted butter to put on vegetables and pastas and such, or onto items where you would traditionally use a course, kosher type salt. I put it in at the end of cooking so I won't "cook off" all the minerals it contains. It has a nice, kind of sweet taste, once you try it you will never want to go back to the heavily processed salt Americans generally use. I have not tried it in a grinder yet, but when I tried to process it in my spice mill it was difficult to grind down due to the fact that there is some moisture in it. So we generally just buy the finer grind for table use, although my kids do use small amounts of this at the table sometimes and enjoy it. We find it is also A LOT more pleasant to use for nasal irrigations than regular salt, a lot less harsh on your sinus passages. Delicious and healthy for you!

review/text: This is my preferred salt for my OXO Good Grips Salt Grinder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CDK0KO/ref=wms_ohs_product_img) that I also purchased from Amazon. However, the salt is not completely dry in the package. If you're going to use it in a grinder, you will need to dry out the salt before hand. It's actually easy - set your oven to about 225, spread the salt over a cookie sheet or 9x9 or equivalent baking dish and cook for about 1 hr. After 30 minutes or less the salt will develop a crust so just stir it with a wooden spoon and bake for the remaining 30 minutes. This is much cheaper than buying the sea salt grinders at your local grocery store.<br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Great product.  Yummy!  Tastiest sea salt out there as far as I am concerned.  Nice price for this much salt.  Grains are large (and very salty) so it's easy to over salt stuff, you'll get used to using it quickly.  I have bought other sea salts that were much more expensive, but I genuinely prefer this.  It's grey in color (that may bother some but not me) and too moist to put in salt grinders (I'm considering trying the fine grain version).  Great to use when marinating your finest bad-ass Fred Flintstone-type steaks!  Try this, I highly recommend!

I was a little worried about it not being finely ground, but I've found that I enjoy it more that way now. People who think that there's no difference between salts should try this salt. They'll be changing their tune!

review/text: I am satisfied with this product. It is flavorful and very salty with low sodium content. It is more expensive than other store brand sea salt but,the health benefits make the price worth it.

review/summary: Moist on the inside
review/text: This sea salt has a great taste however the salt comes moist because its that natural from the sea ... This moistness threw me off and im disappointed that its difficult to use in a salt grinder.

review/summary: Celtic Salt Good stuff
review/text: Everything was as promised.  Quick delivery, good product at an excellent price. Dissolves nicely in hot dishes and mixes up well.  Don't use too much, though.  It's easy to over do with this coarse salt.

review/summary: Very nice
review/text: I dont use salt that ofent but when I do, it is an important part of the enjoyment experience so I use this salt.  It has a very robust flavor.<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend using it in somthing where the flavor gets lost only because of the cost .

review/text: I love this salt.  You can add it to Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar, and it will taste great.  Plus the fact that it usually cures any sickness I have quickly.  What more can I ask for.

review/summary: Greasier than I expected
review/text: Sounded like an interesting product, but I don't like the consistency. It's hard to describe, but I'll say that it was a little "greasier" than I expected. It didn't work well with our salt grinder because granules got stuck and plugged it up. I don't really have a comment on the taste. The delivery and packaging, etc., was fine, but this is just not my favorite.

review/summary: OK, but a bit damp
review/text: There seems to be a fair amount of moisture in this sea salt.  This makes it less than ideal for a salt grinder.  I have the battery powered kind.  It works in the grinder but only slowly.  Be advised.

review/summary: Celtic sea
review/text: Nice Flavor if you do not want things boring.  I have purchased other sea salts that were much more expensive, but I genuinely prefer this. It's grey in color (that may bother some but not me) and too moist to put in salt grinders (Great to use when marinating your finest bad-ass Fred Flintstone-type steaks! Try this, I highly recommend! Great product. Yummy! Tastiest sea salt out there as far as I am concerned. Nice price for this much salt. Grains are large and it packs a burst of flavor,  so it's easy to over salt stuff, you'll get used to using it quickly.
