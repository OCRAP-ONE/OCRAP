But, I am back to my Illy instead of this.

Why this is not sold in major stores in the United States is way beyond me. I first experienced this coffee about 15 or more years ago on a business trip to Singapore and thought it was great. Since then I have found it in France and Hungary and the Chec Republic, but never in the US until this year through Amazon.com. I now have a way to enjoy this all the time. Thank you for allowing me to obtain this with out having to travel out of the country.

review/summary: All the Power You Need
review/text: Being a health nut living in Southern Indiana, it's hard to find really good lettuce juice powder. My neighbors don't eat anything aside from Dominoes buffalo wings, and most of the guys I work with go to Wendy's everyday for lunch, eat a few dozen bacon double cheeseburgers, and then sleep off the onset of premature diabetes in the caps of their pickup trucks, covered head-to-toe in dried ketchup and BBQ sauce.<br /><br />For me, Amazon is the only way to go for buying lettuce juice powder. I can get my lettuce juice powder, my carrot juice powder, my radish juice powder, my mixed vegetable juice powder, and mix them all together and snort some giant lines of vegetable powder while watching the Pacers beat up on the Pistons. Then I usually go out and hire some pros for a night of naked health powder parties, because nothing gets my testosterone going like a long day of snorting veggies.<br /><br />Highly recommended, the only downfall is the guilt that comes along with weighing under 200 lbs while everyone around you is shaped like Slimer from "Ghostbusters."

review/summary: Best EB Decaf Tea I've Found
review/text: I love English Breakfast tea (my favorite caff version is Mighty Leaf Breakfast Blend), but when I was trying to get pregnant, I knew I needed to find a decaffeinated alternative.  Sometimes I decaffeinate my Mighty Leaf myself, but that's not always practical.  I tried several different decaffeinated breakfast teas, and all of them were flavorless and boring.  Until this one!<br /><br />The key to getting good flavor out of this tea is to steep it for longer than you would steep a caffeinated black tea--at least 4 minutes works well for me, and then it tastes great.  I always drink mine with milk or cream, too, and even with the addition of dairy, the flavor doesn't get diluted.  Even steeping it for 4 or 5 minutes, it doesn't end up getting that bitterness that oversteeped regular black tea does.<br /><br />As a bonus, for those for whom regular black tea causes the need for overly frequent trips to the bathroom, this is a great alternative.  My mom has entirely switched to this tea and has reported that it does not cause her that particular problem, so she can drink it all she wants.<br /><br />The price that it's currently going for on Amazon, about $23 a case, makes it $1 cheaper per box than I can buy it locally in the store; definitely worth it.

review/text: I know we are used to salty olives, but if you haven't tried this unexpected taste treat you really ought to.  It is a slightly unfortunate shade of green but it is purely delightful, sweet and a bit spicy ...perhaps a hint allspice or clove ( my palate is not trained enough to tell exactly)  but  really delicate.  It is lovely with baked Brie or goat cheese and I had it coupled with some savory biscuits and could not stop nibbling.  I think it is definitely worth a taste adventure!

review/summary: 6 months and still good
review/text: We've had this item for almost 6 months now and it sits on my 8-year-old's desk (a small desk). It's been handled repeatedly, taken apart, etc..by my child and so far it's still working well and holding up nicely. My child does cheat by taking the gum directly from the top rather than using coins but I think the lesson was learned when the contents were emptied with no $$ to replace the sweet treats. So far we've only tried gum, but I think small candies or nuts will work fine too.

review/summary: Cool Toy
review/text: This is a good retro replica which works but after a while the twisting knob gets stuck a little and you need to turn it a few times to work. So I changed the mechanism to also operate without coins (so every time it gets stuck, you don't need to put another coin for it to work.). It still gets stuck from time to time and you need to turn it a few times to work. Over all it is a good toy and a fun occupier for kids. As a matter of fact, when it gets stuck, it urges them more to keep on turning the knob to make it work. It is well built and it is not a cheap junk but due to small mechanical parts, still it gets stuck and malfunctions from time to time. Over all I recommend it because it looks good, built well and for the price it is a good buy. My little princess likes it a lot. It gets on her nerve when skips a round or two but she always manages to get it to work.

review/summary: The idiots at Tassimo strikes out again
review/text: Ever since Kraft (makers of Tassimo) screwed up it's deal with Starbucks I (and apparently thousands of others like me) have been on a quest to find a decent replacement.  This is not it; not even close.  In fact, this is the worst t-disk coffee I've had so far.<br /><br />Here's the problem:<br />Some of the other disks out there make decent tasting coffee (Carte Noire Voluptuoso is pretty good)but they only produce a puny amount per disk. (the aforementioned brand takes 3! disks just to fill a regular sized coffee mug.)<br /><br />Being fed-up with that, and seeing that these variety is advertised to make a LARGE size DARK ROAST, I figured I would give these a try.  It fills the cup alright, but the "coffee" more closely resembles hot brown water. Thin feeling in your mouth and hardly any flavor at all.<br /><br />Noticing that the effluent from the Tassimo machine appears to be clear water for the last few seconds of the brewing process, I've even tried cutting it short.  That doesn't help either. The coffee just doesn't have any body to it.  It doesn't even have an aroma.<br /><br />That's it Kraft.  You lost me.  I thought you could pull it together and reverse engineer something like the Starbucks coffee (or team up with another strong brand, or fix the contract, or something!) but I am tired of wasting my money while I wait.  You've proven to be the Keystone Cops of the coffee world. I am getting a K-cup machine for Christmas and never looking back.

We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron. Despite its steep price, it is not pure saffron. We are seeing instant loss of color when dipped in water. The threads are breaking down almost instantly in water. Also, the taste and aroma are not very rich.

review/summary: By FAR the BEST Chai I've had
review/text: I was sooo happy when I found you could purchases this online.  I've tried a lot of Chai Tea Lattes and I ALWAYS come back to this one.  It has a wonderful FULL taste and I appreciate that this mix complete dissolves.  I usually use half milk and half water to make mine and oooooh HEAVEN.<br />When I was in Henderson, NV Saxby's carried this brand and I was addicted!  When I moved to WA State it took me a long time to find a Chai even close....but nothing compares.  COME on Starbuck's start serving David Rio Chai and I will be a customer for LIFE.  Until then thank goodness I can order online.

review/summary: Tres Bien!
review/text: We lived in Switzerland for 3 years and this was by far the best salt to garnish with. Sadly it is twice as expensive here in the States than in Europe but well worth the price. You would never want to add this to something that the flavor would be hidden. But instead use it on salads, top breads, and garnish dishes with it. When seasoning dishes we always use Kosher salt instead.

review/summary: All salts are not created equal
review/text: I thought all salts were the same, But they are not... I was lucky enough to receive a gift at Christmas of this wonderful salt cause it is well known among my friends that I love to cook and it has changed the way I look at cooking altogether. I have found that regular salt is harsh and sharp and Fleur de Sel-French sea salt has a softer taste and seems to blend or melt into what ever I'm cooking. Now I seem to look for better Ingredients, All through out all my cooking, Like Fresh ground pepper to fresh herbs and other spices (some I even grow myself)and Organic, locally grown produce, I'm cooking for fresher more flavorful dishes. I telling you it is amazing what a little Fleur de Sel can do... Pinch you later.

review/summary: This is what quality salt tastes like.
review/text: This salt is phenomenal. My husband and I had it in a restaurant in Montreal. They served it in a vile along with the bread and butter. We were floored. First, we never thought to put salt on our bread and butter before, but because it was such a straightforward application it really allowed the taste of the salt to shine. This was a quality restaurant where we had a fantastic meal, but the salt stole the whole show. We loved it so much that we asked the waitress to bring the container out at the end of the night so we would know what brand it was. Not realizing that Amazon and other retailers in the US sold it, before we left Montreal we bought a large container for ourselves and a small container for a foodie friend. No regrets. It's expensive but it's the best finishing salt I've ever tasted.

review/text: So...this is my first Amazon review.  I wouldn't take the time to write it if I didn't feel strongly about this product.  It is fantastic!  I am a fairly new coffee drinker.  I have always loved the smell but hated the taste.  As a mom of an active two year old with a full time job, I felt like I needed a little caffeine boost, so I used lots of cream and tried lots of different coffees.  A friend told me about Dallmayr.  It is absolutely fantastic.  Crisp and clean, with no bitterness at all.  I use a fraction of the cream I used to, and who knows, I may try it black before too long.  I honestly don't think I'll ever drink any other coffee.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I had the opportunity to try coffees all over the world and have found a few that met my taste. An excellent prepared Kona coffee in an upscale hotel in Hawaii with coconut pancakes was my favorite. Dallmayr Prodomo is the best everyday coffee with a consistent smooth and full coffee taste. The water is a major factor though--filtered water often helps. Having lived in Asia, America and Europe and traveled to many coffee loving countries, (try France, Italy, Turkey, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Hongkong--before it was returned to China), and many others, I know a wide variety of coffee roast/beans/brands. Still, with filtered water, this is the most consistently smooth tasting coffee readily available. Be careful though, once the vacuum seal is broken the coffee loses its flavor fast. I usually buy in larger quantities and often receive a package that is a "reject." But I have seen people picking up "soft" packages of coffee (a sign that the vacuum packaging is compromised) in the commissary and in other stores--I always wondered about that. To enhance the flavor of coffee that has been out of the vacuum pack for a few days, just add a pinch of salt to your coffee when you brew a pot, sometimes a hint of Dutch processed cocoa. Use quality filters for drip style coffeemakers (I prefer for everyday the cold brew method), and realize that you have to be able to adjust your coffeemaker to allow for the much finer grind of German coffee. So, a good coffeemaker is half the battle.

review/summary: Discovered in Munich
review/text: I once ordered an entire pot of coffee at a cafe in Munich. I was studying abroad in Europe and was in Munich for the weekend. I had the morning and decided to take it easy. There's nothing better than spending a morning outdoors in early spring in a cafe, watching the world go by, with a newspaper or three. In Europe, they never rush you along in a cafe. Anyways, the coffee they served was Dallmayr. I was hooked from that day on. I coworker recently brought a bag of Jacobs for the breakroom coffee maker. It's his favorite. I told him Dallmayr's better. Now, thanks to Amazon, I have a chance to prove it. Maybe I'll convince him, maybe not, but now I know where to find this lovely coffee regardless. :)

I still remember going down town Augsburg and the aroma of coffee wafting out of the bakery cafe's. That's something you don't forget. This is one of the most readily available German coffees in the US. The great thing about this coffee is the pure coffee flavor and lack of acidity. Now you probably won't like this if you're a big Starbucks fan because the roast is mild to medium. Just about everyone I serve it to asks what kind of coffee I'm using. By the way, I often find this coffee in Marshalls stores at a pretty decent price.

review/text: Dallmayr has a rich coffee taste, without the bitterness of regular coffee. Very aromatic, enjoyable whether you drink it with milk and sugar or just dark. I tried several brands while living in Germany (Jacobs, Tchibo and Melita) but this is by far the best. At 5.30 EUR per 500 gram pack in a store (about 8 dollars), being able to purchase it in the US for 10 dollars a pack is a great deal, considering it is imported from Germany.<br />Surely a marvelous everyday coffee that won't disappoint your taste buds or your wallet.

review/text: Very rarely do I find something that impresses me. I originally purchased this from some local market (I can't remember which one, which is why I came to find it on Amazon).<br /><br />This truly elevates flavors. It's fresh and smells wonderful. Personally, I add it to ALL my cooking (alright, maybe not mashed potatoes). I'm glad I found it. It truly is a must in your kitchen.

review/text: This seasoning is truly amazing.  Fresh and flavorful, I use it in homemade chicken noodle and vegetable soups and it adds a delightful flavor and aroma.  It's also good on chicken.  I buy chicken breasts with the skin on, then I rub olive oil and this seasoning under the skin and bake it.  The entire house smells like Grandma's Sunday dinner...<br /><br />Oh, and if you mix some of this into your dumpling batter before making chicken and dumblings...you won't believe how good it is.

review/summary: One Rare and Special Dried Vegetable Seasoning
review/text: Pros<br /><br />Can't say enough about this product.<br />Well-thought-out combination of vegetables included. Dried red bell pepper, onion, sundried tomatoes, leeks, garlic, carrots, spinach, salt, black pepper, and spices(?) Hmmm...wonder what the mystery spice is?<br />Wonderful smell upon opening told me they were fresh. Turned out to be a real kitchen helper/flavor enhancer. Very little sodium, too (30g). Just check any multi-spice - mostly salt, and we get too much in our diets.<br />As other folks have said, very rare to find dried vegetables this wonderful anywhere, and certainly easy to find reasons to use it. From soups and stews, mashed taters to meatloaf, it enhances every dish.<br /><br /> Cons<br /><br />Doesn't come by the pound. I go thru one jar (4 for sale here) at least every month. Stock up, don't look back, and enjoy  a product that helps many dishes shine. -pd-

review/text: Enough Indian and English people have told me that Brooke Bond and Taj Mahal are perfectly fine teas, more than 95% as good as the best, etc, so I finally had to order this Taj Mahal loose tea. They were right, it is *very* good tea and quite a bargain as well! I do like a strong, full-bodied tea and sometimes prepare a masale for chai or add orange peel, vanilla, or other spices and herbs to the morning pot. This tea really stands up and is a good choice for drinking plain with milk or Indian style.<br />It arrives vacuum-packed in a foil (mylar?) bag which is not recloseable, but it's such a bargain it would be nitpicking to complain about the need to repackage upon opening.  :)

review/text: I've used this brand of tea for years and I still think it is one of the best teas around. It is quite strong and can serve as a substitute for a cup of coffee. This tea has outstanding flavor and will never taste weak or watery. Just a small amount of tea is needed for a pot of tea, therefore, even 2 lbs. will last a long time. To preserve flavor over time, I keep the tea in an airtight container. A must for tea aficionados!

review/text: I love the fact, that General Mills made the label reading process easy.  They now have a white check on some cereal boxes. Is it still the same old cereal? Now every cereal with the white check has more whole grain than any other single ingredient with the same great taste. You will see "whole grain" as a part of the first ingredient on the ingredient list, indicating that whole grain is the first and most prevalent ingredient. This is my kids' favorite (or at least one of favorites) and something that they keep asking for. Ingredients are good and the general sugar content is not high.

review/summary: Now with WHOLE GRAIN...like the HOLE in your BRAIN!
review/text: General Mills introduced Cinnamon Toast Crunch breakfast cereal in the mid 1980's with the simple but effective jingle, "Feelin' like cinnamon toast; Feelin' like Cinnamon Toast Crunch; Feelin' like cinnamon and sugar; Feelin' like homemade taste..."  Later, three jolly cartoon bakers were featured in Cinnamon Toast Crunch TV commercials, and were soon utilized to liven up the heretofore boring box design.  The Bakers enjoyed dancing around on black and white linoleum kitchen floors while singing, "We're cinnamon and sugar shakers, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Bakers," to enthralled youngsters.  Eventually, the slim brown-haired Baker and the chubby black-haired Baker mysteriously disappeared from both the box and the commercials, leaving only Wendell, the fat white-haired Baker with glasses.  Around that same time, a cinnamon swirl design was added to the cereal pieces.  Perhaps the two missing Bakers disagreed with Wendell's decision to swirl the cinnamon.  Or maybe the advertising executives at the "Big G" were afraid the three characters on the box would be mistaken for Snap, Crackle and Pop.  Whatever the reason, the two lost Bakers are sorely missed.<br /><br />In 2004, General Mills caved under intense pressure from health advocacy groups and agreed to make all their cereals with supposedly more nutritious "whole grains"...as opposed to half grains.  Ergo, all "Big G" cereal boxes are now emblazoned with the annoyingly ostentatious "G with Whole Grain" logo.  Fortunately, the taste remains pretty much the same.  The cinnamon pieces are still shaped exactly like Golden Grahams (little squares with ridges), and, like Golden Grahams, they still go soggy in milk in about 3 minutes.  But that's not a problem, because once that first "cinnamunchy-crunchy" spoonful hits your tongue, the bowl is certain to be emptied in well under 3 minutes.<br /><br />Three quarters of a cup of Cinnamon Toast Crunch (without milk) contains a mere 130 calories, 3 grams of fat, 10 grams of sugar and zero cholesterol.  Have a bowl with Wendell today...he's lonely!

review/summary: Tooth decaying, artery clogging goodness.... in a box!
review/text: If you're overweight or "fat" as some would say, you shouldn't eat this. It's got lots of sugar that's not gonna help you much. But if you're a healthy individual with an insanely efficient metabolism, like myself, eat away. This cereal is top notch, second only to Lucky Charms in my opinion. Each little piece of "toast" is coated in the most delicious sugar/brown sugar mix you will ever expirience, and anyone who specializes in the art of cereal consumption, again like myself, will know that this fact makes for some mouth-watering leftover milk.<br /><br />I must warn you however, if you searched Cinnamon Toast Crunch here on Amazon, you may have seen the "reduced sugar" version of this cereal. STAY AWAY! If I didn't know any better, I would say they replace the sugar with some sort of beach sand. It tastes terrible and makes you're mouth feel like you just comsumed several sticks of chalk. Stay with the full sugar version and you'll be satisfied.

review/summary: I like it mixed half and half with Cheerios to make less sweet
review/text: Cinnamon Toast Crunch consists of small squares of wheat and rice covered with cinnamon and sugar. Because of the rice content, when immersed in milk, one can hear "snap" sounds coming from it, similar to Rice Krispies. I love cinnamon so I always try any cereal that has cinnamon in it. I find Cinnamon Roast Crunch a bit too sweet for my taste by itself. However, I found a way to make it just right. To make it less sweet I mix it half and half with Cheerios cereal (which has 1 gram of sugar per serving). In that mixture I find it pleasant to taste and not sugary.<br /><br />One serving of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal (� cup or 31 g) has 130 calories or 170 calories with � cup of skim milk. A single serving has 3 g of total fat, no cholesterol, 220 mg of sodium and 45 mg of potassium. One serving has 25 g of total carbohydrates with 2 g of dietary fiber, 10 g of sugars, 13 g of other carbohydrates, 1 g of protein.

review/text: I love Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and somehow I doubt that people decide to purchase a particular cereal based on customer reviews on a website, so I'll spare you all my warm feelings about how tasty the cereal is.  But believe me, it is AWESOME.  That being said, I've ordered several multi-packs of cereal from Amazon in the past, and each time I find that at least a few of the boxes look like someone sat on them before they got put in the larger box.  The cereal is fine, but the boxes always look distressed and mildly crushed.  It's annoying to get items that are already damaged, and even though the food is okay, it still bothers me a great deal.
