review/summary: Should almost be labelled a "BOLD" flavor
review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best almonds ever
review/text: These almonds are my favorite almonds.  Wal-Mart used to carry them, but now I have to order online.  They are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet.

review/summary: If You Like Almonds and You Like Cinnamon You will like these
review/text: The Almonds are very very fresh tasting.  The cinnamon adds an extra bonus of goodness to the almonds with a great flavor.  We keep them in the fridge.  We also mix them with all the other nuts we have making our own nut mixture.  Excellent snack with protein.<br /><br />Just ordered some more of them.

review/summary: Best Almonds Hands Down
review/text: After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/summary: wow  really
review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/summary: Two minutes of fun
review/text: I hesitate to give this only three stars, because it is definitely a high quality product. All the pieces are nice solid plastic, and they slide around as they're supposed to. My dogs have no trouble moving the tiles.<br /><br />And therein les the problem. Every dog I have tried this with is vastly entertained--for about two minutes. My Golden, two German Sheperd puppies, and a Havanese all mastered this toy almost instantly, so it does nothing at all to keep them occupied on their own. Even still, I would probably still give it four stars for its fun factor, but the price is too high for its function.<br /><br />If you are going to sit around and refill it over and over again to let your dog play with for longer than two minutes, use a Manners Minder instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B8CHG">Premier Manners Minder Remote Reward Behavior Training System for Dogs</a> You can use it to train all sorts of things and dogs think it's Christmas with a remote control.

review/summary: Fun but not long enough entertainment
review/text: I initially got this toy to keep my normally active dog occupied during the 8 weeks of inactivity following her knee surgery. It's supposed to be of moderate difficulty, but is very easy for my Rottweiler.<br /><br />The plastic Dog Brick is sturdy, well made, and dishwasher safe. It would be better if it was a bit heavier so it didn't move around so much, though if your dog is small, this shouldn't be a problem. The compartments slide open way too easily. When my dog removes the middle bones with her paw (which must be removed before the compartments slide open), it jostles the entire game and causes some of the compartments to slide open on their own.<br /><br />I found that using a bit of peanut butter in each compartment instead of a dry treats, works VERY well. She works more methodically this way, and licking the peanut butter keeps her occupied a lot longer. However this toy still doesn't occupy her for long.<br /><br />Another plus is the holes in the "bone" pieces which fit between the sliding compartments. You can knot a rope into it if you'd like to give your dog an extra option for removal of the piece, and would maybe work well for a small dog.<br /><br />Although fun, this toy won't keep your dog busy for long at all. If you'd like to occupy your dog for longer, I'd recommend the Bob-A-Lot interactive toy.

review/text: I've always felt my dog needed more challenging toys.  She has all the usual squeaky, furry, boney and pulling toys, yet seems to get bored with them after about 15 minutes.  I decided to buy this toy to see how she liked it, and also to see how smart she actually is. After the first two or three times I used this toy I saw my dog really enjoyed figuring out to get the treats and looked forward to playing with it.  I like that I can change the combination of treats in the toy to make it more challenging to keep the dog more involved.  Now I want to buy more to keep challenging her and keep her mind sharp.

review/summary: Good quality pet puzzle
review/text: I own the Nina Ottosson Dog Brick and the Tornado.  This puzzle is made of good quality durable plastics.  The removable white bone pieces are durable, but should be well supervised for play.  The bone pieces are only 3 inches or so in length and could be a choking hazard to larger dogs.<br /><br />There are 12 insets to fill with food, and the 4 in the middle are covered with the removable bone pieces.  These are shallow and the puzzle does not hold an entire meal (1 cup for my pet).<br /><br />I agree with the intermediate rating of this puzzle, considering the Busy Buddy toys and the Kong Wobbler are easy and the Tornado is a bit more challenging.  Once the dog figures it out, the puzzle can be completed in just 1-2 minutes.  This toy is a little pricey considering the limited play time, but it is absolutely adorable watching them figure it out.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Brick if you are willing to spluge.  If you are looking for an intermediate food puzzle and are a bit more budget minded, consider the Buster Cube.  Of all of the different puzzles we have tried, the Buster Cube still ranks at the top.

When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.<br /><br />I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.

review/text: I love these - easy to handle - easy to take on trips.  They keep better int he small packages instead of buying the larger box unless you eat them up quickly...we aren't huge cracker eaters so these work great for us.<br /><br />They are easy to dip too!

review/summary: Awesome Little Cookies!
review/text: These are so delicious!  My kids are on a diet restricting all preservatives and artificial ingredients, so I was thrilled to see these.  I'm not usually a fan of commercial cookies, but I am so tempted by these--which is more than I can say for any of the other prepackaged treats I buy them.  The package is small enough that I don't feel TOO guilty, but chocolately enough to really satisfy.

review/summary: back to Nature 100% Natural 9 oz. cookies
review/text: I saw these cookies at my whole food market several years ago and I purchased several varieties:  peanut butter, choc. chip, oreo, ginger, lemon, vanilla, etc.<br /><br />These are very pricey cookies that cost $3.99 per box, but they are worth the money.  Sometimes you can get them on sale at 2/$5.<br /><br />They are delicious and I am officially addicted to them.  However, not all the flavors are my preference.  I prefer the ginger, peanut butter, & vanilla.  You might prefer another flavor.<br /><br />The cookies have no artificial preservatives, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup.  They are made of whole grain wheat flour, and other natural flavors.<br /><br />The box contains approximately 45 cookies at 9 oz.  They are typically 170 calories and 10 g of sugar depending on the variety.  The product contains unprocessed cane sugar.<br /><br />Five cookies equal one serving size, and the product typically has 3 g of fat with about 21 g of carbs  The product contains dietary fiber ~3 g and 0 g trans fat.<br /><br />I like their slogan...simple ingredients, simply delicious, simply good.  Since the cookies use wholesome ingredients and techniques, they have robust flavors much like days gone bye.<br /><br />So many people, including myself, have gotten so accustomed to artificial flavors and the like that real flavors can be alarming at first, but this is what whole foods hopes to accomplish--getting back to the real thing.<br /><br />This product is made in Canada.

My son really likes to snack on these, and I think they are better then the Earth's Best graham sticks I used to buy for him.  I stole a bag of these from our pantry and tried dipping them in nutella on the ends.  Heaven!

review/summary: Like a healthier Nutter Butter
review/text: We normally buy Back to Nature Chocolate Chip Cookies and decided to try the other varieties for our boys' lunches. We've tried the Madagascar Vanilla, California Lemon, and now the Peanut Butter Creme. While the Vanilla and Lemon cookies are very, very crunchy and have a strong, wheat-y aftertaste, the Peanut Butter Creme cookies are just as good as the Chocolate Chip. These cookies taste like a healthier (note that I didn't say "healthy") version of Nutter Butters! The filling is not as sweet as other peanut butter sandwich cookies, but it is definitely rich. I don't mind my kids having a processed treat once in a while, and when they do I like to make sure that the ingredients are acceptable. Back to Nature is a nice alternative to other processed cookies with chemical additives and coloring.

review/text: This item was featured on Dr Oz show as he was spotlighting healthier snack alternatives.  The chocolate chunk are the only ones available on amazon right now so that's the one I tried.  They are crazy good!  My mistake was giving some out at work and now I have to order more.<br /><br />The reviews for all the products are being lumped together in the ratings.  The Honey Graham Sticks doesn't taste like graham at all.  It's more like an animal cracker with a little more flavor.  The vanilla wafers are very good and taste much like Nilla wafers.  The madagascar vanilla have a buttery taste and are very crisp.  I've liked all but the graham sticks so far.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I really like these as a snack for both myself and my children. First off.. they are really good. They taste great, are all natural and the bags are the perfect size. I like the honey graham flavor. There are 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat in one bag. None of this two servings in one bag. I often find that many "individual" bags contain more than one serving and are too much for one child. I don't want my child eating two or three servings of cookies! And trust me mine would if allowed. So they are perfect for school lunches or as a snack or treat during the day. I will be buying these again. And how can you beat 15% off with subscribe and save delivered to your door!  It amazes me how much I buy on the internet now. Practically everything and I love it!

review/text: I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.  I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now.

review/summary: Didn't really enjoy them
review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so "happy". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!

Crunchy little gems without all the trans-fats & preservatives, that I try to keep out of my children's diets as much as I can.  These will definitely remain on my grocery list.

I do like that the portion size was small, though the packaging is a little excessive for what you're getting--but individual portions always are. But you can always recycle the Mylar bags & feel less guilty about using excess packaging to curb your gluttony.

review/summary: Unbelievably good!
review/text: I usually don't write food reviews because, well, 'one man's meat is another man's poison', as the saying goes. We actually stumbled upon these cookies. On a whim, I picked up a package marked for clearance at Target and, since then, my daughter and I have been fighting over it. Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Target so I guess we will now have to buy in packs of 6 through Amazon. Never mind, I suppose I can store them in the cool basement.<br /><br />We try to not eat too many in a day as 2 cookies will cost you 130 calories (so this pretty much means eating only 2 cookies per day!). I am very sensitive to food additives and can always detect the chemicals in some 'natural' foods (e.g. Kashi). One bite and I could tell that there are none in these cookies. Also important was that it is just gently sweet; most off-the-shelf cookies are much too sweet for me. Think I'm also going to try Back to Nature's Graham Cookies through Amazon since it's got some rave reviews! I'm definitely sold on this brand.

The sell by date is important in a product that says it's all natural!<br />The boxes say 100% Natural and are packaged in at least 55% recycled packaging.<br /><br />No artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. No high fructose syrup. No hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />The cookies are delicious!<br />A nice crunchy cookie with a semi-sweetish tasting peanut butter filling. The cookies taste like wheat more than the white bread side of things. Two cookies is supposed to be a serving size... I'm sorry to say... the first two times I had them... I couldn't stop at two!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthier peanut butter cookie... with a decadent taste... look no further... you've found it!<br />I highly recommend these cookies.<br /><br />They're a bit pricey to be serving for children's snacks on a regular basis... but I would probably hide them in the top cabinet... lock it... lol... and bring them out in portion size servings for the children. :)

review/text: This review is for the Honey Graham sticks.  My son was diagnosed in 2010 with food allergies and I immediately set out to find foods he could enjoy.  It was not easy.  Some foods that don't use corn based sweeteners taste horrible- I am so happy to say that this is not one of those.  These crackers are SO good, we often run out before our next shipment comes.  There are usually 13 sticks in each pack (we've used them in math lessons quite a few times, my son gets quite a kick out of eating his work!), so not a lot, but a nice little snack for a child.  We love them with the JIF peanut butter cups to go or plain.  They are way better than Honeymaid or Keebler grahams!

These are truly some of the best cookies we've purchased, and I love the fact that they have no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives! It makes me feel a little better when giving these to our children as a treat. As long as the company keeps these on "the shelf", we will keep buying them. As a matter-of-fact, to make sure we don't run out and that I wont forget to order these, we have them on "auto ship". The bonus to doing that is we get a 15% discount on them! How awesome is that?!!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Love, love, love these p/b cookies.  We keep them in the frig because we like them cold.  They are expensive in my local health food store so I was happy to find them here at such a great price.  The auto-ship is perfect for the cookie monsters in my house.  I only wish Amazon would find a better way to ship them.  They do often come a little banged up for my liking.<br /><br />Try them!  If you like Nutter Butters I think you will like these.  You should at least like the fact that they are made with ingredients you can actually pronounce!

review/summary: Healthy and Delicious
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and healthier than other cookies since made with wheat flour, rice syrup and cane juice rather than white flour and sugar.  My kids love them and enjoy them as a snack with a glass of milk.

review/summary: delicious and no additives
review/text: Absoutely delicious. They taste the way nutter butters should taste (or the way I remember as a kid). Now, as an adult, when I eat regular cookies they don't taste as good because of all of the artificial ingredients. These cookies taste delicious and one doesn't feel yucky after eating them. While I wouldn't call them healthy, they are exactly what PB cookies should taste like!

review/summary: It's A Ugly Little Cookie..but they are GOOD!
review/text: I purchase the snacks for my department and it's hard to think what everyone would like. Who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies? I chose these because of their organic ingredients and the price. The cookies are not pretty, in fact the first co-worker to try them named them the "ugly cookies" but guess what she loves them. She hides them in her desk drawer. Everyone agrees they have good chocolate taste and despite their unattractive appearance of non uniformity and chunkiness they are tasty. Don't let the cover fool you.

review/summary: Big Disappointment
review/text: I purchased the BACK TO NATURE crispy oatmeal cookies locally.  They were delicious.  The cookies were no longer available locally so I purchased cookies through Amazon as directed by the BACK TO NATURE website.  The cookies are disgusting.  They are not the same cookies that I purchased locally.  BACK TO NATURE must get rid of their rejected cookies through Amazon.  Since I cannot return the cookies, they are now in the garbage. I will never again purchase any product from BACK TO NATURE.

review/summary: Fan of Grace Island Crackers for years!
review/text: One of the biggest pitfalls of the low-carbohydrate diet--or any diet--is snack time. Sometimes we just want to crunch and raw broccoli dipped in salad dressing doesn't exactly satisfy the craving. These crackers do the job, believe me. First, they taste amazing, especially the Asiago crisps. Second, they are extremely low in carbohydrates without gluten or any funky additives. Each container comes with 3 packages of about 15-18 crackers and that entire package is 4 grams carbohydrate (3 grams fiber). I am a diabetic and I have purchased "low-carb crackers" with wheat flour and corn starch in the past. Unfortunately, even modest quantities of wheat flour and corn starch raise my blood sugar too much. Grace Island crackers have basically no effect on my blood sugar, I am happy to say. I even made a dinner out of these with various cheeses and a warm cream cheese and mushroom dip. My blood sugar stayed low and stable the whole time. My fasting blood sugar was great, too. That's the real test of whether I'll buy a low-carb product again.<br /><br />The only downside I could think of for these crackers is that they're quite expensive and so they're not really something I can afford to buy very often. Also, the crackers are really small, maybe between a quarter and a half dollar in size. That's not necessarily a negative because the small size lends itself to better portion control, but it's easy to devour 1-2 packages really fast if you're not careful, and then suddenly you have eaten most of your crackers. Sad.<br /><br />Give them a try, but then be disappointed when you get addicted and find that you can't afford to support your new cracker habit.

review/summary: Bragg's is the Best
review/text: I have been using Bragg's Liquid Aminos in place of soy sauce for many years. But when our local wholesale food co-op went out of biz several years ago it was hard to find, and when our local store started carrying it it was only available in 8 oz bottles. It is much more convenient and economical for me to be able to get it by the gallon! I use it on just about anything, and also put it in a Pampered Chef Kitchen Spritzer to spray on meats as a marinade, or salads, or whatever.

review/summary: Read the label
review/text: As a bodybuilder, I have been looking for a cheaper alternative to the Twin Labs Liquid Amino Fuel. I was considering the Bragg. I have not tried the Bragg. However, there is one major flag with the Bragg. The nutritional label. Even on the Bragg web site it confirms 110 mg of sodium. 110 per serving. That is a ton of salt. Compare to the Twin Labs that has on 10.<br /><br />So this product is definitely not recommended as a chug down amino supplement for bodybuilders.<br /><br />But to spritz on salads or whatever, it's great.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 2011<br />I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I did indeed purchase the Bragg Liquid Aminos thinking it would be a more cost effective amino supplement, compared to the price for Twinlabs Liquid Aminos. This product is not to be used in that context, which I learned. I'm glad my review will clarify the usability of the product for "those seeking an amino supplement while undergoing strenuous workout regiments and training". I believe Bragg should consider a clarification on the label. It's an excellent product as a selective, minor boost of amino supplementation in accordance to recipe augmentation and flavoring. But, not in terms of dosing. I'm sorry for any confusion my review may have caused. My perspective came from a different interpretation based off Braggs label description which actually motivated me to purchase the product because my dietary and monthly supplementary costs are staggering since I'm natural, and this product is affordable. I actually do use the product. But only as a flavoring enhancer that provides an additional boost toward my daily protein intake. For those working out, I hope that helps.

review/summary: Not like the old days...
review/text: When I was growing up, every year just after Thanks Giving, our home would be filled with multitudes of boxes from the Swiss Colony. From cheese spreads, meat logs, candies, and most importantly, the petit's fours! I remember Swiss Colony Petit's Fours being much larger, tastier and not dry as stale cake that has been sitting around for months before shipping. I was very disappointed in the flavor and quality of these little cakes and they are not at all the quality I remember growing up. It has been about 14 years since I had anything from the Swiss Colony and I have to say, it will be the last time I order anything from them. There are so many companies out there now that make them bigger, better and fresher (I know, I picked up a box from a famous brand at a local mall kiosk) than what I had when I purchased these. Granted, the price was cheaper...but I guess I got what I paid for. Very disappointed Swiss Colony!
