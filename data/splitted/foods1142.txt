review/summary: TASTES LIKE TURPENTINE!
review/text: DISGUSTING!!!! I really don't know how there are reviews about this product being good. I bought this product because I didn't have any homemade amchar left and would have to wait for someone to go the distance to acquire some more. I read the ingredients, picked up and put down the bottle about 4 times until I gave in out of desperation. Brought it home and opened it to accompany dinner and it literally gave me an irritation on my tongue like that of a pizza burn from hot cheese; my husband tried it and thought we should use it to clean the toilet. It's the worst product that I've ever purchased I have to say. I'm a born West Indian and was utterly appalled that such a product exists. Even worse is the store I bought it from will not refund or exchange my money or even accept a complaint; what the hell is that? I have nothing nice to say about this except, it looks like the real thing but looks can be deceiving. I'll suffer the long wait for the authentic thing to come back into my life. For now, staying far away from this crap.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: NEW RECIPE LOG CABIN SUGAR FREE:PERHAPS THE BEST SUGAR FREE SYRUP
review/text: I've tried many sugar free syrups - from the original Log Cabin syrup, to Mrs. Butterworth's, to Maple Grove.  One thing I've always hated is the gummy texture of all these syrups.  The taste of all was about the same and more on the just-below-light-syrups side.  Log Cabin has come out with a revised sugar free syrup which says, "great new taste" on the top of the bottle (7/10).  It not only tastes better and slightly richer but it flows like real maple syrup! Not gummy!<br /><br />When comparing the different sugar-free syrups, check the amount of sugar alcohol on the nutrition facts label. The higher that number the sweeter it will obviously be.

review/summary: I knew Log Cabin syrup, and you're no Log Cabin syrup.
review/text: After acquiring the Log Cabin brand, Pinnacle Foods (which also owns Mrs Butterworths) reformulated Log Cabin. It no longer contains any maple syrup at all; now it contains artificial flavors instead.  Some of those flavors (probably the artificial butter?) are really foul, and the syrup tastes positively horrible.  (Logcabinsyrups.com says they now have a 100% pure maple syrup variety; that one might be OK, but I wouldn't touch the others with a 10-foot french toast stick.)

review/summary: Red quinoa
review/text: Quinoa is a staple in our household, it has tons of vitamins and minerals, a higher amount of protein then any other grain so it doesn't spike a blood sugar, gluten free, and comes naturally in "two flavors", white and red. i add white to my son's oatmeal and chicken dishes (white has a milder taste), and red quinoa goes better with red meats and tomato/avocado dishes. Although the difference is not significant, it is nice to have a variety.<br />I like Alter Eco brand because it is a fair trade.<br />I highly recommend it to everyone! I'd give it ten stars if i could.

review/summary: Very healthy alternative
review/text: It has a different texture than the white Quinoa....more nutty I guess you could say since the hull around the red Quinoa is slightly thicker. This makes it taste a tad bit different as well which isn't a bad thing at all...but it's hard to put my finger on it though. The thing is, if you like or are used to the white Quinoa, you may welcome this as a good change. You have to cook this a bit longer than the white Quinoa as well to get near to its fluffiness. What happens is that the hulls surrounding the red Quinoa (which the white Quinoa has as well but they are much thinner so it's not noticeable when eating) stay on the red Quinoa giving it that nuttier texture. I don't really care for that (I guess since I'm so used to eating the white Quinoa) BUT I cook it a bit longer than the box says to (about 5 - 7 minutes longer) and it's almost as fluffy. You cook it just like rice in a pot on the stove. I have not tried to cook this in the rice cooker as of yet nor do I think I will...that goes for the white Quinoa as well. Other than that, it's great for a number of things although I use it primarily for my stir fry veggie meals. Try a box at your local co-op/health food store and if you like it order it here. Its way cheaper to by it through Amazon even with a small shipping costs.

review/summary: A terrific new grain for me
review/text: I've been exploring organic, whole grains, and this is a winner. I was thrilled, after browsing quinoa, to find this fair trade variety (and a different variety of quinoa from the traditional white which I also bought). It was easy and fast to cook (just boil water or broth, pour in the right amount of quinoa, drop to a simmer and cover, check after 15 minutes and every 3-5 thereafter until almost all the water is absorbed, then remove from heat and let the rest of the water absorb). Then just use as you would any other grain -- under sauce, with veggies, in salad, or with just salt and butter. I don't cook much during the week so I fixed a whole box and it lasted for 3 meals. A new grain staple for me.

It cooks just like rice and can be flovored in the pot with a bit of broth, chopped onions or other vegies...but it doesn't really need a thing. We started tasting it the first time we made it right out of the pan still on the stove, and before long we had eaten it all. Plain. What a great side dish.<br />I was impressed with the shipping speed and packaging from Alter Eco. And their business concept makes me feel good about doing business with them.

review/summary: High Mountain Magic.  Food of the Gods
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking. As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.<br /><br />Recently, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Berry Farm, and Angelinas have been added to my list of healthful, gourmet food purveyors.  The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

review/text: I'm a big fan of mint tea - particularly peppermint.  Sadly, most mint teas are weak beverages.  In order to get a strong, clear minty flavor one has to steep tea for a long time or use more than one sachet; but not with this tea!  The Bigelow k-cups are terrific, much better than the other mint tea k-cups I've purchased in the past (Gloria's and Celestial Seasonings) in offering a bright and brisk cup of tea.  But please note: these might be a bit too vibrant for those with a more subtle palette.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: I've loved this flavor of tea in the regular tea bags for a long time so naturally when I got a Keurig I had to find out if they made K-Cups. I am so happy to say that they do. It comes out perfect when I use my machine on the 10oz setting. It's very refreshing and what I especially love about it is the hint of spearmint. The mint flavor in my opinion is just right- not too overpowering, but not weak. It makes great iced tea in the summer as well. Love this stuff! A++ in my book!

review/summary: Could be better- very strong tea!
review/text: I like to drink herbal tea every once in a while as a break from coffee.  I love Mint Medley tea bags, but it doesn't work so well in k-cup form.  It seems to come out very strong, so I add more hot water in (which kind of defeats the pupose)!  My Keuring brewer can only make an 8 oz. cup.  If your brewer can make a 10 or 12 oz. mug, this tea would probably be worth a try.  I'm sure personal taste preference is also a factor here.

If you like stevia and english toffee, I'd definitely spend the money and give this a try.

review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.

I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/summary: Best cookies in the world
review/text: These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.

review/text: These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!

review/text: Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price.

review/text: Rich, dark chocolate thinly covering a tart orange marmalade-like substance on a soft sponge cookie. It melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. Chocolate and orange are an addictive combination.  There are other brands out there of these sponge cookies, but the Bahlsen brand is by far tops in the quality of the ingredients used.

We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now).

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.
