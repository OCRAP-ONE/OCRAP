review/summary: Vegetarian "Sloppy Joe" from Bombay
review/text: A long time ago, textile workers in Bombay needed a quick lunch as their break time was not long enough to have a leisurely meal (doesn't that sound familiar?) A local vendor came up with a curry cooked on a tava (iron plate) along with a toasted roll and Pav (pronounced "pow") Bhaji was born. This is the Indian sloppy joe (vegetarian of course) and it's basically a potato and cauliflower curry, cooked relatively dry and served with bread, not rice. Pav is a loanword from the Portuguese for bread, though some think its roots really mean "kneaded dough."<br /><br />The method for cooking the Pav Bhaji is clearly a mix of Portuguese (the bread), English (it is cooked exactly as you would cook a mutton or corned beef hash) and Indian (a curry vegetable mix, the spices cooked first in oil with onion to release the flavors, and a mix of sweet, salt, sour--characteristic of Indian foods.)<br /><br />Pav Masala is the unique, necessary spice mix. It is sweet-spicy, with more sweet spices than you'd find in a normal wet curry and it gives a reddish color along with the tomatoes in the recipe. This mix is only medium-hot--I use about a tablespoon for 4 servings but you can adjust this. The box recommends 15 grams but I just use a tablespoon to start off.<br /><br />This is a great way to make a lunch or light dinner, and the recipe can be used to incorporate cooked leftover vegetables like mixed veg, carrots, peas, what-have-you.<br /><br />1/2 cauliflower head in florets<br />2-3 potatoes, boiled in jacket, peeled, diced<br />butter  --about a tbs or two, depending on your tastes<br />1 onion diced (red or yellow)<br />1 medium fresh tomato diced<br />1 tbs golden or reg raisins<br />3 dried apricots, diced (optional)<br />Pav Bhaji Masala spice (Indian store or link below) about 1 tbs<br />salt to taste<br />some garam masala if you have it<br />chopped cilantro for garnish<br />lime for garnish<br />water as needed<br /><br />cast iron skillet<br /><br />Method:<br />fry onion in butter until clear, browned and tender. Add tomato and spices, salt, and Pav spice (about a TBS or to taste) Stir until pasty.<br />Add in fruit and boiled cauliflower and potato and about a half cup of water: HERE you can put in leftover VEG from dinner (peas, carrots, mixed veg) and it uses them up.<br />MASH and fry like hash in skillet for 10 minutes.<br /><br />Serve garnished with fresh cilantro, chopped red onion, lime wedge and a toasted crusty dinner roll.

review/summary: Maybe the best coffee I've had.
review/text: In spite of the fact that this is decaf (which normally means brown dishwater), this ranks up there with the best coffee I've ever had.  I like rich dark coffee.  This stuff is excellent.  Give it a try.  (We need to make it more popular so I can find it on the shelf in the grocery store.)

review/summary: Superb Decaf
review/text: Rich chocolate note, more complex than most decaf, and very smooth.  The Seattle Best Twilight Blend is probably the smoothest decaf I've tasted.  My stomach also like the relatively low acid level, probably due to the dark roast.  If you don't like the so called "bright or spicy" tasting coffee, give the Twilight Blend a try.

review/summary: Very convincing decaf; best I've found yet, but...
review/text: while the numeric system seems logical, Seattle's web site is ridiculous. Try figuring out what their products are by going to the "Products" section, let alone find the decaf. I don't think the decaf is anywhere on the site. The product descriptions read more like horoscopes than substantive explanations of the actual varieties. It's useless, "happy horsesh_t" really. The pseudo-logical numerical system stylistically has nothing to do with the overall vapid stupidity of the site. Should Seattle's Best "wake up and smell the coffee," I'd consider upping my rating by at least one star. Yeah, I know I don't drink the web site, but presentation counts, unless your idea of fine dining is an Angus burger at a fast food place.

review/text: I got the Ghost Pepper flakes because I wanted some SERIOUS heat, but that's not what I got. While they are a good amount hotter than regular red pepper flakes, they don't even measure up to a habanero. Given the Ghost Pepper is 4x hotter, I expected to get at least that much heat. These flakes are about the heat level of the cayenne powder I get at the grocery store.<br /><br />I know the Ghost Pepper is the hottest chile pepper in the world (actually, it's now 2nd - the Trinidad Scorpion captured that title earlier this year), but these flakes don't taste like they really came from something that hot.

review/text: My Great Dane is very sweet, but he is extra hard on toys and treats, destroying both in a matter of seconds.  This Zuke's Z-Bone was a different story, though.  While it didn't last for a tremendous amount of time, it kept my dog working for a while longer than his usual time.  He loved the taste and, although he had never had one before, after sniffing it, he jumped right in.  I loved the quality ingredients (I recognized what I was feeding my dog) and the fact that it freshened his breath.  I also appreciated that it was grain-free as my dog has sensitive skin.<br />I will definitely continue to buy these!

I also wanted to point out that in our last shipment of this particular flavor, I noticed a few oddities on the nutrition information.  After a bit of searching, I realized that this particular order was "Product of Canada."  Not sure if this is at all a big deal (I doubt it), but just wanted to inform the seller and potential buyers.  Just seemed odd!

review/summary: Interesting texture and super-yummy!
review/text: My 6-month-old daughter loves all the "Brekkie" blends and we love knowing she's getting to experience a slightly different texture and a very different flavor as well.  I also love feeding her something knowing that I would enjoy it too, it helps me feel like I'm offering her the best (although I will feed her things I personally think are gross, because I don't want to limit her palate at all).  The pouches are the most convenient way to feed her too.  It helps keep the mess to a minimum and when used in conjunction with the Boon dispensing spoons, it turns feeding into a one-handed endeavor!  I was so excited to be able to introduce some different stuff once we got past the basics to check for allergies and all the exciting flavor profiles offered by Ella's are exactly what I wanted as a foodie mom.  Taste preferences develop at a surprisingly young age, so it's important to introduce lots of different flavors as soon as you can and thanks to all the modern baby food blends, I can find such a wide variety!  '  I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for some baby food.

review/text: These Crown Prince Sardines literally changed my life. You live for a few decades, a good 40 or 50 years, and you think you know some things. You think you know sardines. You think you know tomato sauce. But until the luscious, succulent, inappropriately erotic essence of tomato sardines that defines the Crown Prince line of product grazes your virginal, awaiting lips, you know nothing.<br /><br />When I discovered the Crown Prince Sardines it was a sort of rebirth for me. I had hit a low - my wife had dies three years previously in a freak zoo accident, and I had turned to substance abuse to dull the pain. My reliance on Oxycontin and other narcotics eventually took its toll on my life, both personal and professional. My relationships were a mess, and I had recently been fired from my job. I was sitting in my house, on the stained couch, staring at the eviction notice on my window, when I opened up a can - a little, red, 7.5 ounce can - a can I thought would contain some fish and sauce... But that can contained more. That can contained my salvation.<br /><br />Fast forward a year, and I'm kicking like a celebrity, living on Malibu with the stars. I eat a dozen cans of Crown Prince a day, and it gives me all the energy and positivity I could ever need. I've dropped my drug habits and started to take control of my life. No drug on earth can compare to the creamy, sweet-yet-tart tomato sauce contained in these cans. The sauce, though, is just the start - the sardines! The sardines are the thing! I bid you - if you have ever cared about anything, or anyone, you owe it to yourself and to them to order a 12 pack of these today. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />BUT. But. But. Why, you may ask, did I only rate this product four stars if it so changed my life? There is a catch. There is a trade-off. Nothing this good could be so (nearly) free. And I'm not talking about shipping.<br /><br />Three weeks after I started my Crown Prince consumption habits (which I continue to this day) I started to realize something strange was happening to me. I would wake up early in the morning - full of energy, certainly (thanks to my lovely sardines) but also somehow feeling as if I never slept. I remember one Monday, waking at the crack of dawn. I had a hunger for sardines, but there was something else, too. When I brushed my teeth that morning I coughed. A knucklebone came out of my throw and clattered into the sink. A human knucklebone.<br /><br />I can't say any more. The wrong person might be reading. Just know this: while the power that the Crown Prince Sardines grant is a great power indeed, it is also a heavy weight. It is because of this that I must only give the Crown Prince Sardines in Tomato Sauce a 4 star rating, though they are by far the most blessed and delicious fish to ever grace the sea or my plate.

review/summary: Swimming in sauce
review/text: I've only openned one can so far and I haven't actually bought a can of sardines for decades, but saw these on a deal site and had a hankerin'. I used to buy sardines in tomato sauce as a treat when I was young/kid.  Yes, strange kid.  Love sushi now too!<br /><br />Well I openned the can and was greatly surprised to what appeared to be a can of only sauce until I noticed sardine shaped bump.  I litterally had to blindly dig around in the can to find the 4-5 3"x1"x.5" sardines in the tomato sauce.  This was nothing like I remembered where the can was packed with sardines and a coating of tomato sauce.<br /><br />I'm not sure I bought this brand decades ago, the can was shaped the same, but either way, the can contained way to much sauce.  Upon fishing the sardine out, the sauce left in the can was still up 40-50% the way up the side of the can, which is rediculous.  It's not like I'm going to put this over spaghetti!<br /><br />The sardines and sauce tasted decent.

review/summary: Extremely healthy eating; No added vegetable oil
review/text: ADVANTAGES:  (1)Because no vegetable oil is added, we are being served just sardines (with skin and soft bones) with tomato paste and salt.  Despite the salt, that's an extremely healthy combination.  (2)The fat from the sardines plus the salt is enough to make it taste moderately good.  No, it doesn't taste as super-delicious as herring fillets with added vegetable oil but it's healthier because it has less calories.  (3)The price is extremely good.  These high-quality sardines are a wild-caught product of Thailand.  (4)If you "subscribe" to buy these sardines, then you will not only save even more money but it will arrive very fast with free shipping.  (5)The can opens easily with a can opener.  No need to worry about splatter.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Yes, each can contains about 3 to 10 scales from the skin of the sardines.  They are thin, perfectly flat circles about the size of a Roosevelt dime or smaller.  You can either spit them out or swallow them.  (2)Too much sodium.  The people of Thailand love to eat lots of rice and might see Americans eating these canned sardines with rice.  However, the vast majority of us would prefer to eat these canned sardines for our health directly out of the can without rice.  We would prefer this product with about one-third less salt.

review/summary: Buckwheat honey at it's best.
review/text: My doctor told me to get buckwheat honey and use it in oolong tea twice a day to help soothe a cough that was lingering on way past a cold had ended.  I sometimes go into a temporary type of asthma after having a chest cold.  My doctor's recommendation works very well. This is dark, very flavorful honey.  Some may think it is too strong, but I think it's great; especially used to sweeten tea.

review/summary: Fiber One: It helps you go to the toilet.
review/text: Just paraphrasing Emory Leeson's Metamucil ad from the movie "Crazy People," because eating these bars produces a similar effect.<br /><br />They are absolutely delicious, like a candy bar. The Chocolate Mocha flavored ones taste appealingly of coffee. The bars contain 9 grams of fiber as well as a generous portion of chicory.<br /><br />I would highly recommend them for long road trips, when you're facing a constipating diet of grease, cheese, starch, and more cheese day in and day out. These bars will clean out the pipes, and they travel well, being individually wrapped in fairly sturdy cellophane. For other situations, keep in mind that you might be spending quality time on the can within a few hours of eating one. So, maybe not the ideal desert with which to finish up a hot date.

review/text: While working in the Middle East and being at the mercy of the DFACs, I decided that the lack of good, fresh vegetables was hampering my ability to get the daily fiber that I needed.  Plus, they help settle my stomach during the frequent cases of, shall we say, food borne upset stomachs.  The taste pretty decent and help keep me full when I'm not inclined to go to the chow hall so...can't really complain.

review/text: These are such delicious bars! Everyone I've ever give one to also loves the flavor. Once you open it, you can smell the mocha. Definitely a unique flavor and interesting alternative to the regular chocolate, though it is a bit too sweet. Warning: they can make you gassy. If you have 2 in one day, your stomach might be discomforted, so definitely try not to eat too many in one day, especially if you won't be in the privacy of your own room!

review/text: I had been buying these from target, but since there are only 5 bars per box I looked on Amazon to buy in bulk. The bars are typical of healthy granola bars, but there's actually a good amount of chocolate chips and chocolate flavor in these bars. I cant really comment on the nutrition content compared to others because not much info is listed on granola bars on Amazon. All in all they taste good, but don't expect anything soft.

review/summary: Better than Quaker!
review/text: I was a huge fan of the Quaker chewy bars for a long time, but these have me converted! The coffee flavor is fantastic, noticeable but it doesn't overwhelm the chocolate flavor. I really do look forward to eating them, and they don't last long around my house. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't noticed a significant increase in time spent in the Throne Room, but I'm pretty young (23) so either my digestive system adapts more quickly or I'm just less observant. Either way, I haven't had problems and I wouldn't quit eating them if I did. Since everybody is different, though, I would recommend trying them out during a week when your schedule is routine, not during a road trip, so if you have a digestive change you'll be in comfortable surroundings. Happy munching!

I remember a review I read when I was researching fiber bars, that review saying about the bad gas, and its true for the first month or so. At least that is how it was for me. I have IBS and had so many problems with belly ache's and bowel problems. I put my self on a high protein and high fiber diet, and quit eating foods that upset me. Know its been 6 months or more and I haven't had a belly ache not one and my bowel problem much better. but about the gas problems you need to eat one every day, even missing one day and the gas is back, but doesn't last as lone.

review/text: I too lived in Germany many years ago and found Jacob's coffee to be delicious. I ordered this a few weeks ago remembering the good taste. I don't think that it's 100% coffee that I'm drinking. There's another taste in there ...what is it?  I also see that it's now a 'KRAFT' product?? Also the expiration date is July '11 and it was delivered 3 weeks ago so it must be pretty old. I ordered the beans for freshness but there's probably a limit on that. I guess I'll stick with buying coffee beans locally from now on.

review/text: My cat was pulling his fur out and gnawing on himself until he would bleed, so I switched him to this food. He stopped that day. He must be allergic to something in the cheap junk I was feeding him. His fur is softer and shiny, and he plays a lot. I buy this locally, and it's the best value at almost a dollar a can cheaper than Wellness.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Completely Fat Free!
review/text: I was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so I started looking at Beef Jerky, but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them, usually a minimum of 1g, which may not sound like much, but when you're dieting, every gram counts. So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.

review/summary: A new favorite!
review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I've tried the sweet and the mild and I highly recommend. These are a bit pricey at $50 per box of 20, but you get what you pay for. Perhaps if enough people start purchasing these, the price will come down a bit. The grass fed beef does not taste gamey either. I do wish they were certified organic though. My guess is that they are from organic cows on small farms but these farms don't want to pay for organic certification due to price.

review/summary: Good treats, but could use more variety
review/text: After occasionally buying Jones Natural treats for my dog at an over-priced dog boutique, I decided to give this variety pack a try.  Although the description indicates the bag will contain some combination of hooves, ribs, grizzles, bacon rolls, ear slices and bully sticks, the bags I purchased had mostly hooves, ribs, pig ears, and a few grizzles, but no bacon rolls or bully sticks.  My dog will not eat hooves as they are too hard for him to chew, but a friend's giant rottie enjoyed them and apparently one hoof lasted a few days.  My dog loved the pig ears, but since they are so fattening I would have liked a better assortment in this bad.

review/summary: Macadamia Nut is my new favorite Torani flavor!
review/text: I've been trying to lower my caloric intake but I can't stand plain water, so lately I've been drinking water with a little bit of Torani syrup added to it (3/4 - 1 oz syrup per 36 oz glass), and I have to say that the Macadamia Nut flavor is definitely my new favorite!<br /><br />The flavor is distinctly Macadamia Nut, with the same buttery nut flavor that I love in white chocolate macadamia cookies & Ferraro Roche candies (both of which I'm trying to avoid now). As soon as I opened the bottle I could tell that it was going to be good just by the smell, but I was surprised to find myself skipping over my old favorites (Coconut, Mango, & Orgeat/Almond, linked below) and choosing the Macadamia Nut flavor for most of my drinks now. I've been avoiding caffeine, but I definitely think this would be great in coffee or hot cocoa too. And this morning my husband replaced some of the sugar in his pancake recipe with this syrup & the results were wonderful!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2SQ">Torani Syrup, Coconut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2T0">Torani Syrup, Mango, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2ZE">Torani Syrup, Orgeat (Almond), 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: An incredible deal on the world's best black tea!
review/text: Twinings English Breakfast Tea is by far the best black tea sold in teabag form that you can get on the retail market. Rich, full bodied and spicy. It's great alone or lightly sweetened. I drink a cup every morning for my caffeine rush, and it's MUCH healthier then drinking coffee! The price to buy Twinings English Breakfast Tea in bulk from Amazon is truly a great deal. Normally, in the grocery store, a 20 bag box sells for $4.99. This 50 count x 6 boxes makes it about $4.75 a box, but for 50!!! Not 20! If you're a tea lover, then trust me, you will love this tea. And buy it from Amazon, cause you can't beat their price!

review/text: When I was younger, the only tea readily available in my area was Lipton orange pekoe. It was okay, but not great, and very easy to over-steep causing a bitter cup of tea. One day while traveling in Canada, I tried Twinings English Breakfast Tea. It was so good that I purchased a large amount of it to take home. Now it is readily available and the English Breakfast Tea is still my favorite. Every other Twinings tea has been very good, but I always return to my favorite.<br /><br />You can read in the other reviews about the flavor. It is a robust, full-flavored tea that only turns bitter after grossly over-steeping. There are some very bad brands of tea out there, and a lot of good brands, but as far as I am concerned Twinings is by far the best.

It is the one I use early in the morning when I am in a hurry.  It has a great kick to it and feeds my caffeine addiction wonderfully.  Now don't take me wrong, I love coffee too and certainly drink my share of the stuff, but coffee will never replace a good cup of tea in my book.  This is also the tea I take with me on camping trips and backpacking trips; a time when you really need a kick in the tail to get you going and keep you going.  The flavor is excellent.  In the morning I use a bit of honey and cream in mine..to each his own taste, huh.  Twinings makes a good product and this is some of their best.

review/text: I love Twinings Prince of Wales and Earl Grey but wanted something a little more full bodied, so I tried English Breakfast and English Afternoon. Both were excellently flavored, but this tea could be bought for 4.34 per box of 50 thru Amazon. So, I put it on subscribe and save. I was always a coffee drinker until recently, but with this tea, I don't even miss my coffee. I know I should be doing green tea as the caffiene has started messing with my blood pressure but at least this tea has half the caffiene of equal coffee and I have come to like it better. English Afternoon has a very slight hint of orange which this tea does not. I wish I had known about Twinings teas years ago.

review/summary: A great, basic black tea
review/text: When I gave up soda I decided I would drink only unsweetened tea without milk (to cut back on calories) and I picked this up on impulse at a local grocery store. Thus began my addiction to Twinings teas. Yes, it is more expensive than Lipton or Tetley, but it is also better.<br /><br />English Breakfast is moderately strong and if you steep this for too long it will become bitter; about three minutes is perfect for me, but you may prefer stronger or weaker tea. Overall, I think the taste of Twinings loose English Breakfast tea is better than the bagged tea, but bagged tea is more convenient. Twinings English Breakfast is great both hot and chilled and the price at Amazon is quite reasonable.

review/summary: Great bagged black tea for a great price!
review/text: While I would not say that this is the best black tea on the market, as others have said in their reviews, I do want to point out that it is a great bagged tea and for an amazing price (especially when purchased off Amazon) although nothing really beats loose leaf tea. Because each bag is individually wrapped (while I feel bad about the environmental waste) it will stay fresh even if you purchase a boat load of these 50-count boxes. I enjoy tea nearly every morning (unless my significant other wants me to run out for some coffee... in which case I'll have a coffee) and prepare it in my travel mug and drink it on my way to school. It think it is a beautiful habit to prepare your tea every morning, and it is a peaceful activity that I enjoy. Twinings English Breakfast makes my morning routine easy, and it tastes great to boot. I generally steep this for about 4 minutes with 2-3 tea bags, depending on if I am using just a regular cup, or my travel mug which holds a lot more. I then squeeze the bags before I throw them out to get as much flavor as possible. I then add a little milk (not much though!) and a bit of sugar. I know some people enjoy the tea just the way it is without additives, but I am a former coffee drinker and find a bit of milk and sugar creates a very full bodied drink. Twinings English Breakfast has enough flavor that you are not drowning it if you add some milk.... but I never brew just one bag so I couldn't tell you how it is with a single bag.<br /><br />This tea is a great alternative to coffee, and a healthier option as well. Enjoy!

review/summary: Great Buy!
review/text: Twining tea is a quality product, and the English Breakfast is one of their best. Don't hesitate to buy the 50 count even if you don't drink as much tea as I do since each tea bag will stay fresh in individual foil wraps.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Twinings English Breakfast Tea
review/text: This is a nice, full-bodied tea. When I'm not able to brew a pot of loose tea in the morning, this is my go-to breakfast tea. It's handy to have the tea bags individually wrapped, as I can throw a few in my purse, suitcase, or backpack when I head out. After all, there are a lot of places one ends up that don't have tea available.

review/summary: Tea
review/text: I was hesitant to order tea is such large quantities but found to my pleasure that each bag is individually contained in a foil packet so I don't expect shelf life to be a problem.  I like the tea fine and think that the quantity is offset by the price.
