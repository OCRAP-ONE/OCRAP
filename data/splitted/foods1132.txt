review/text: Received the "the best of Ghirardelli Gift Basket,"  was giving it as a gift.  Looked fulled in the picture, also instead of being set(as per picture) all the chocalate was in a pile inside the red basket covered in plastic.  You had to ripe the plastic open to try to set it up to make it look presentable and then nothingheld the way it was shown. It looked like a mess and not a great gift basket

review/summary: Good Value but does not look like picture.
review/text: I purchased two of these to give as gifts during the holiday season. From the picture it seemed that the chocolates and other goodies would be upright to give the basket an extra visual appeal. However on receiving the basket the chocolates lie flat. The quality of the product is not questionable. However the over appeal as a gift is decreased because of this. Good product overall.

review/summary: Cocoa bags of paper and punctured = big mess.
review/text: This is a very nice set, but as the other reviewer I paid $13 and wouldn't have paid more. The cocoa pouches are made of paper and was punctured by the box of chocolates next to it. This resulted in a lost cocoa and a big mess I had to clean up before I could send this to the recipient. Which is sad, not only for the lost product, because it doesn't all stay in the box very well without the plastic encasing.

review/summary: less waste
review/text: We started buying this on our breeder's recommendation.  We bought the canned because we already had a dry food and like to give him canned in the evenings to help speed the digestive process.  Anyway, what I love about this is that his stools are smaller and less stinky.  Truly, they are.  I didn't believe that I would notice that much of a difference, but I do.  For that reason, we are switching his dry food to innova evo as soon as possible because I hate stinky poops.  It is expensive but he only eats 1 cup/day because he's a little dog.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it is so expensive

review/summary: Great Food to Add to Dry
review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it! In addition, some of Innova's canned foods are low carb by design which is terrific if you have a pooch that needs to lose a few pounds. Most dogs tend to be very carb sensitive - they simply don't need them as much as we do - and I have found that if mine get a little pudgy, I switch to giving them mostly or all low carb Innova and they drop the excess pretty quickly and without suffering through a diet.

review/summary: My 3 dogs love this food. Healthy and happy.
review/text: I have two tiny dogs &lt;5 lbs. and one 78lb. standard poodle. They all love the Evo Beef canned food. We mix it with Beef Small Bites Evo Beef Dry food for the little guys (one of them has a mild chicken allergy), and Large Bites Poultry Evo Dry for the big guy. I feel their nutrition is really good - regular, uncomplicated. Easy to clean up after. They also eat the Evo Beef Wild Cravings treats when we treat. Carbs and grain, such as that found in people food, are anathema for our dogs. Makes them sick, gassy, and even have diarrhea. We really try to avoid giving any scraps. Just don't overfeed with the Evo. It's super concentrated, so take your dog's activity level into account. When my walking time decreased bc of the extended heat wave, my poodle soon gained a few pounds he didn't need. I cut back a little, and he is evening out. You pay more, but life is simple and my dogs absolutely love this food.

review/summary: Fairly good chocolate but needs more salt!
review/text: This is a pretty decent dark chocolate although it does seem a bit "light" for dark chocolate. I really enjoy the bits of almonds and sea salt. I just wish the sea salt was a bit chunkier. I really like the salt ratio in the Lindt sea salt dark chocolate bar but that chocolate tastes like milk chocolate and I'm not a fan of milky sweet chocolate. I paid $12.00 for the 6 bars of Ghiradelli which is .50 cents a bar cheaper than the grocery store. Only trouble is if I buy 6 bars I'll eat 6 bars!!

review/summary: Healty, Filling, and Tasty
review/text: A friend who has recovered from a stroke and prostate cancer is trying to eat really healthy food.  He told us about Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Rolled Whole Grain Hot Cereal, Plus Flaxseed. We found some in a local store -- 16 ounces for $2.09!<br /><br />Following the directions on the package, I cooked a batch of it tonight. What a delicious and filling meal!  The package instructions recommend serving it with milk and honey.  It also tastes good with other things, such as cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, toasted almonds, and bananas.  It tastes good plain, and it does not require large amounts of butter or sugar to taste good.<br /><br />The ingredients are whole grain oats, wheat, rye, barley, triticale, and flaxseed.  quoted from the side of the bag:  Scientific evidence suggests that eating whole grains reduces the risks of some cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers.  Antioxidants contained in whole grains may work with fiber and other compounds to reduce your overall  risk of heart disease.<br /><br />A few more bits of information:  There's a neat cookie recipe on the package.  Since it is all natural, it keeps best in the refrigerator or the freezer. A serving made from 1/3 cup dry cereal has 120 calories and 5 grams fiber.<br /><br />We're glad our friend told us about this cereal, and we highly recommend it.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.

review/summary: Hearty!
review/text: I found this when looking to upgrade my oatmeal. As expected this is MUCH heartier than regular oats. I used the microwave to nuke a small portion of this and the grains retain a lot of texture; they don't melt into mush like oatmeal does. (But not TOO much texture. You won't be eating a bowl of grains/seeds). The flavor was very mild and I found adding a bit of dried cranberries, brown sugar, and splash of vanilla coconut milk made for a subtly sweet and filling breakfast! I enjoyed this mix much better than plain oatmeal. It's not as bland and boring. It's hearty and healthy without actually tasting like health food!

review/summary: This is my favorite decaf green!
review/text: You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing. It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well. The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming. Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well. I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.

Bernard's Chicken Soup Base is a great way to punch up soups, stews, braises, it's even good sprinkled on cooked veg.<br /><br />Buy a can, see for yourself. If you make it to eat hot as a broth on its own, I would spike the heck out of it with black pepper, dot of hot sauce, some cilantro and parsley. YMMV.

review/summary: Cheap & Easy Professional Quality
review/text: I bought this product because it's the brand my favorite hometown coffee shop uses to make Starbucks style blended coffee drinks. To be honest though, I wasn't expecting the beverage to taste quite as good when made at home, because I don't have one of those super-expensive, industrial-quality blenders.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised. I just ripped open the packet, dumped it into my cheapo blender with five ounces of milk and 12 ounces of crushed ice, hit the blend button, and a couple minutes later, viola! A Starbucks style frappy just for meeeee. Add a dash of whipped cream, a straw, and I had myself a four-dollar drink for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />One thing I should add: My fridge at home dispenses crushed ice, so the ice-chunks I put into my cheapo blender were smaller than you'd get out of your average ice cube tray. I think this helped with the drink-consistency. Specifically, I'm not 100% sure the drink would've been quite as smooth and professional-feeling on the ol' tongue if I'd started with bigger ice-cubes.<br /><br />But overall, I was pretty darn impressed.

These individual sized packets make a great drink and I even use sugar free syrups to flavor the drink on top of the java flavoring it already has.  I used to buy the Orange Java Chip Frappucinos years ago from Starbucks and they stopped making them.  If you want one, you have to pay an extra 50 cents for a shot of orange flavored syrup, if they even have any.  No thanks!!!<br /><br />Other flavor combos I've tried are with banana, raspberry, german chocolate, and creme de menthe.  Yummy!!

review/text: Big Train's mixes taste pretty good, but there's no excuse for the huge amounts of trans fat they contain. Partially hydrogenated coconut oil -- pure trans fat -- is listed as one of the first ingredients! (The nutritional information posted by Amazon must be for a different product, because it incorrectly claims that the product contains zero trans fat... not possible with that ingredient list.) According to a nutritionist friend, even made with skim milk they are, nutritionally, heart attack city. (I'm surprised that they haven't changed their formulas simply so that they can be sold in the city of New York.) And I don't want Big Train to give me a big caboose. So, I'm holding off on buying more of this. I'll mix up my own smoothies until they make their product more healthy.

review/summary: Great Cookie
review/text: These cookies are a little pricey in my opinion but you always pay more for natural food products and these cookies are made from natural ingredients. Sometimes you do not get that many cookies in a bag but that's okay, just go eat another bag of cookies. :) They taste great and have mostly if not 100% natural ingredients. I have made many orders for these cookies and plan on making more orders for them in the future. Highly recommended if you are looking for a delicious, individually packaged, chocolate chip cookie snack.

review/summary: Seriously
review/text: I don't mess around when it comes to peanut butter or cookies. These are the BEST pb cookies you'll find in a box for sale at the grocery! As good as Nutter Butters, Girl Scout cookies and the rest, but without all the unneccessary ingredients. My only complaint is that they should sell them in larger boxes, ha. You won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: These are so delicious!  My kids are on a diet restricting all preservatives and artificial ingredients, so I was thrilled to see these.  I'm not usually a fan of commercial cookies, but I am so tempted by these--which is more than I can say for any of the other prepackaged treats I buy them.  The package is small enough that I don't feel TOO guilty, but chocolately enough to really satisfy.

review/summary: back to Nature 100% Natural 9 oz. cookies
review/text: I saw these cookies at my whole food market several years ago and I purchased several varieties:  peanut butter, choc. chip, oreo, ginger, lemon, vanilla, etc.<br /><br />These are very pricey cookies that cost $3.99 per box, but they are worth the money.  Sometimes you can get them on sale at 2/$5.<br /><br />They are delicious and I am officially addicted to them.  However, not all the flavors are my preference.  I prefer the ginger, peanut butter, & vanilla.  You might prefer another flavor.<br /><br />The cookies have no artificial preservatives, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup.  They are made of whole grain wheat flour, and other natural flavors.<br /><br />The box contains approximately 45 cookies at 9 oz.  They are typically 170 calories and 10 g of sugar depending on the variety.  The product contains unprocessed cane sugar.<br /><br />Five cookies equal one serving size, and the product typically has 3 g of fat with about 21 g of carbs  The product contains dietary fiber ~3 g and 0 g trans fat.<br /><br />I like their slogan...simple ingredients, simply delicious, simply good.  Since the cookies use wholesome ingredients and techniques, they have robust flavors much like days gone bye.<br /><br />So many people, including myself, have gotten so accustomed to artificial flavors and the like that real flavors can be alarming at first, but this is what whole foods hopes to accomplish--getting back to the real thing.<br /><br />This product is made in Canada.

review/summary: Like a healthier Nutter Butter
review/text: We normally buy Back to Nature Chocolate Chip Cookies and decided to try the other varieties for our boys' lunches. We've tried the Madagascar Vanilla, California Lemon, and now the Peanut Butter Creme. While the Vanilla and Lemon cookies are very, very crunchy and have a strong, wheat-y aftertaste, the Peanut Butter Creme cookies are just as good as the Chocolate Chip. These cookies taste like a healthier (note that I didn't say "healthy") version of Nutter Butters! The filling is not as sweet as other peanut butter sandwich cookies, but it is definitely rich. I don't mind my kids having a processed treat once in a while, and when they do I like to make sure that the ingredients are acceptable. Back to Nature is a nice alternative to other processed cookies with chemical additives and coloring.

review/text: This item was featured on Dr Oz show as he was spotlighting healthier snack alternatives.  The chocolate chunk are the only ones available on amazon right now so that's the one I tried.  They are crazy good!  My mistake was giving some out at work and now I have to order more.<br /><br />The reviews for all the products are being lumped together in the ratings.  The Honey Graham Sticks doesn't taste like graham at all.  It's more like an animal cracker with a little more flavor.  The vanilla wafers are very good and taste much like Nilla wafers.  The madagascar vanilla have a buttery taste and are very crisp.  I've liked all but the graham sticks so far.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I really like these as a snack for both myself and my children. First off.. they are really good. They taste great, are all natural and the bags are the perfect size. I like the honey graham flavor. There are 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat in one bag. None of this two servings in one bag. I often find that many "individual" bags contain more than one serving and are too much for one child. I don't want my child eating two or three servings of cookies! And trust me mine would if allowed. So they are perfect for school lunches or as a snack or treat during the day. I will be buying these again. And how can you beat 15% off with subscribe and save delivered to your door!  It amazes me how much I buy on the internet now. Practically everything and I love it!

I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now.

review/summary: Didn't really enjoy them
review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so "happy". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!

I do like that the portion size was small, though the packaging is a little excessive for what you're getting--but individual portions always are. But you can always recycle the Mylar bags & feel less guilty about using excess packaging to curb your gluttony.

review/summary: Unbelievably good!
review/text: I usually don't write food reviews because, well, 'one man's meat is another man's poison', as the saying goes. We actually stumbled upon these cookies. On a whim, I picked up a package marked for clearance at Target and, since then, my daughter and I have been fighting over it. Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Target so I guess we will now have to buy in packs of 6 through Amazon. Never mind, I suppose I can store them in the cool basement.<br /><br />We try to not eat too many in a day as 2 cookies will cost you 130 calories (so this pretty much means eating only 2 cookies per day!). I am very sensitive to food additives and can always detect the chemicals in some 'natural' foods (e.g. Kashi). One bite and I could tell that there are none in these cookies. Also important was that it is just gently sweet; most off-the-shelf cookies are much too sweet for me. Think I'm also going to try Back to Nature's Graham Cookies through Amazon since it's got some rave reviews! I'm definitely sold on this brand.

The sell by date is important in a product that says it's all natural!<br />The boxes say 100% Natural and are packaged in at least 55% recycled packaging.<br /><br />No artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. No high fructose syrup. No hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />The cookies are delicious!<br />A nice crunchy cookie with a semi-sweetish tasting peanut butter filling. The cookies taste like wheat more than the white bread side of things. Two cookies is supposed to be a serving size... I'm sorry to say... the first two times I had them... I couldn't stop at two!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthier peanut butter cookie... with a decadent taste... look no further... you've found it!<br />I highly recommend these cookies.<br /><br />They're a bit pricey to be serving for children's snacks on a regular basis... but I would probably hide them in the top cabinet... lock it... lol... and bring them out in portion size servings for the children. :)

review/summary: decadent treat with less guilt
review/text: These peanut butter sandwich cookies had the right combo of salt and sweet. IMHO these taste better and less cloying than Late July sandwich cookies (those are good too though). I will definitely buy more of these and would be proud to serve to family and friends. My only gripe is it contains soy.

review/summary: Honey Graham Sticks
review/text: This review is for the Honey Graham sticks.  My son was diagnosed in 2010 with food allergies and I immediately set out to find foods he could enjoy.  It was not easy.  Some foods that don't use corn based sweeteners taste horrible- I am so happy to say that this is not one of those.  These crackers are SO good, we often run out before our next shipment comes.  There are usually 13 sticks in each pack (we've used them in math lessons quite a few times, my son gets quite a kick out of eating his work!), so not a lot, but a nice little snack for a child.  We love them with the JIF peanut butter cups to go or plain.  They are way better than Honeymaid or Keebler grahams!

review/summary: Not like Oatmeal, but tasty none-the-less
review/text: I was disappointed at first, these taste nothing like Oatmeal cookies.  You'll be disappointed, too, if you buy them looking for a yummy Oatmeal cookie, they taste more like "Ranger" cookies (e.g. Krogers).  They do taste good and make a fine snack, but they should have called them something else, as I'm sure many will be disappointed.<br /><br />Still, now that I know what they taste like, I might buy them again if they go on sale.

review/text: WE love them, our kids love them, the kids @ their school love them. These are truly some of the best cookies we've purchased, and I love the fact that they have no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives! It makes me feel a little better when giving these to our children as a treat. As long as the company keeps these on "the shelf", we will keep buying them. As a matter-of-fact, to make sure we don't run out and that I wont forget to order these, we have them on "auto ship". The bonus to doing that is we get a 15% discount on them! How awesome is that?!!

They are expensive in my local health food store so I was happy to find them here at such a great price.  The auto-ship is perfect for the cookie monsters in my house.  I only wish Amazon would find a better way to ship them.  They do often come a little banged up for my liking.<br /><br />Try them!  If you like Nutter Butters I think you will like these.  You should at least like the fact that they are made with ingredients you can actually pronounce!

review/text: I purchase the snacks for my department and it's hard to think what everyone would like. Who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies? I chose these because of their organic ingredients and the price. The cookies are not pretty, in fact the first co-worker to try them named them the "ugly cookies" but guess what she loves them. She hides them in her desk drawer. Everyone agrees they have good chocolate taste and despite their unattractive appearance of non uniformity and chunkiness they are tasty. Don't let the cover fool you.

They're more like the US candy bars with cookie bases, filling and chocolate coating. The chocolate coating is CHOCOLATE- not some brown wax as can be found in some cookies.  I've tried 3 flavors- and while I can't indulge very often, they are a real treat.  They do cost more than our standard cookies- but these aren't standard cookies (or 'biscuits', as my Oz friends  call them).  Notably better :)

review/summary: Delicious but very sweet
review/text: When a colleague brought a package of these "biscuits" back from Australia to share with the office, they didn't last long.  The entire package was gone in about 15 minutes.  For me, the best part about these cookies is the texture.  The soft chocolate creme sandwiched between crispy chocolate wafers is a nice contrast of crispy and soft.  I was hoping for more chocolate flavor, though.  The predominate flavor is plain sugar, and these cookies are very sweet.  I enjoyed trying a new kind of cookie, but I still prefer something with a stronger chocolate flavor (like Oreos, for example) to balance out all that sweetness.

review/text: Amazing that 'spread-ability' was not one of the criteria (overlooked) for consideration for the "gold medal". Maybe a bought (Outpost Natural Foods) a couple of bad jars (Sugar Free Blueberry).....but, I found this "jam" to not have the typical (benchmark) 'soft, grainy, homogeneous paste' texture; but, rather a loose, watery syrup containing small, hard berries-----difficult to (knife) spread on a piece of toast! A spoon should not be the 'tool' to remove and apply (pour) a fruit jam on a piece of bread (or toast)!<br /><br />There are far better jams on the market and others being (home) made. And, I will never buy this product, again.<br /><br />I discovered the same discrepancy with the judging (Mukgonago, Wisconsin) 'apple pie'. It needs to be clarified the difference between a conventional apple pie vs apple cobbler!<br /><br />Rblask

It was just what I had been looking for, a sugar free jam that actually tasted like the fruit it was made with and not just sweet blah.  The texture is very soft but this is great as you don't have to put a lot on your toast at a time. The flavor is there with just a smear.  I can't wait for the new supply to arrive.

review/text: First off, top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing!  Please keep it up!<br /><br />Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)<br /><br />If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.<br /><br />Thank you kindly!<br /><br />UPDATE: October 2010-<br />Just want to add, that it's now almost 3 years since my original review- and I have ordered dozens of beans from JR since this first order, and never have I been disappointed with the product received.  I stand firmly behind my five star mark.<br />Thanks so much!

review/text: I bought seven beans for seven dollars, and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. They didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. That is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. After all, it's the guts that really count. Even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans, this is still a KILLER DEAL!!! I recently purchased one bean from a popular brand "Spice Islands" for seven dollars. An unbelievably aromatic bean, but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? I think I'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. I'm still making away like a bandit!

review/text: I decided to make my own vanilla extract, so started shopping for vanilla beans. Based on the outstanding reviews here, I purchased 7 Vanilla Beans for what I found to be a great price. (Though the price has increased 62% since I made my purchase exactly 30 days ago.)<br /><br />The beans arrived quickly and were packaged well. I didn't experience the amazing smell that other reviewers had commented on smelling before even opening the package. I did smell SOME vanilla scent when I opened the package, but prior to cutting into the beans, I sent a message to the seller asking if I should expect more smell. Imagine my surprise when I recieved a response the same day....on Saturday! I was told to use the beans and if I wasn't happy, let them know and they would replace the beans or issue the refund. What great customer service!<br /><br />Well, no refund needed here. The beans were plump and though they didn't have an overpowering smell when I cut into them, my hands did smell delicious for the rest of the day. My vanilla extract is currently living in my pantry and I cannot wait until it is ready to use. I was so happy with the purchase that I ordered 16 more beans to make more vanilla extract!

review/text: These Beans are the very best. And you will not believe the kindness and caring of the sellers. I used mines for Vanilla Sugar. Coffee is much better now.

review/text: These are not the shriveled scrawny beans you find in a jar in the grocery store.  They are amazing.  Don't tell JR - but he isn't charging enough!!

review/text: I got these to make jam with and they were great.  They smelled great and were exactly what I expected.  I will order these from here again when I need some more.  I also plan to make my own vanilla extract with them too.  I can't wait.  Yum, Yum.
