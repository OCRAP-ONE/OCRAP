review/text: This product is a snap to make.  The two flavor components (oil, flavor powder) are in separate packets so you can choose to use more or less if you wish.  The soup is not strongly flavored, but is very rich tasting and definitely satisfying.  It's also a good, simple base to work from if you happen to have a few fresh ingredients to toss in as enhancements.  A little sliced chili pepper, scallion and/or cilantro would really put it over the top.  I will buy it again and recommend it to others.

I'd have to say it was very good.<br /><br />So how do you review chili? I would say it was quite substantial (not watery), mild in spiciness, the beans were not too soft, and overall just quite tasty. The texture was just quite good. And being chicken chili, it wasn't as fattening as the beef chili.<br /><br />After finding that I liked Stagg's, I proceeded to try their beef and turkey chili, but in the end found I only liked this one.

review/summary: great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.
review/text: I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!

review/summary: EASY TO USE GREAT SMOKEY FLAVOR!!!
review/text: I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.

review/text: To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I've only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating "fish tummy" and this couldn't have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I'd need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland.

review/text: I bought this item based on such good reviews. I thought I would do some ribs in the stove using a smoker bag instead going out in the cold to use the barbeque grill, but what a mistake. I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a smoky house and smoky clothes. The ribs had a weird and faint wood taste not smoky like you get on the grill. YUCK! The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results. I give this one TWO THUMBS DOWN.

review/summary: "Organic" from China!
review/text: Skip eating questionable food from China and demand USA grown food. You can get garlic grown in the USA at your farmer's market. You can also get it from farmers online and distributors such as: spicesinc.com. Or you can search under "garlic not grown in China" like I did. It does exist.<br /><br />Please join me in encouraging Amazon to get an organic source of garlic that is from the USA; they currently have none. Let's help our own economy and not buy food from communist China.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/14/12: spicesinc.com carries USA garlic whenever possible, but they can't always find it. When I wrote the review, they had it in stock. I spoke with Greg, the CEO, today and he is searching for more USA sources. Just call to verify when you place your order.<br /><br />Another way to search the internet is to list a state such as: "California organic garlic powder".

review/summary: This product is more like Garlic flour
review/text: This garlic is a powder not like any garlic I've seen. Its strong, but not bitter and blends well when cooking. I'm used to Garlic powder being more granular. This product is more like Garlic flour it is the consistency of flour. You should be aware of this in case this isn't what you're looking for.<br /><br />Tastes like fresh garlic. This is a great value - Product comes in a resealable Mylar bag and should keep the power fresh for a long time with proper care.

review/summary: "This Tea should get the Nobel Peace Prize"
review/text: This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: Great hard-to-find product!
review/text: Red lentils (Masoor Dal in an Indian grocery) can be hard to find outside of specialty stores, and Bob's are fresh, clean, and tasty. They make delicious soups with an earthy flavor and great texture. My favorite recipe is made in the slow cooker with onion, celery, tumeric, coriander, and cumin. It is so simple and easy but I can't stop eating it! They are also good cooked with rice as is common in the Middle East and India.<br />Some people seem confused about the desired consistency of red lentils. Unlike the brown or green lentils that most of us are used to, red lentils have had their husks removed. This is why they cook so quickly. This also means that THEY WILL NATURALLY DISINTIGRATE INTO A PUREE. If you don't like this "mushy" texture, then you should probably stick to lentils that still have their seed coats.<br />All lentils are a great health food with lots of vitamins and fiber and huge amounts of iron and protein, making them especially important for vegetarians. I would give Bob's 5 stars if they were organic. I'm also a little puzzled about 27 oz being chosen as a unit size. But you can't argue with super saver shipping!

review/text: Bob's Red Mills lentils are my favorite legume. They have a slightly sweet taste and cook very fast- 20-30 minutes. Be careful not to over-cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart, still tasty though. The soup I make calls for sauteed carrots, celery, & onion. Add ham or sausage if you wish. 1 garlic clove, oregano, salt (if you haven't added salty ham), and optional hot pepper flakes. It is very hardy and filling. Caution: Lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle.

review/summary: Delicious AND nutritious
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Red Lentils are delicious.  They are very different from regular brown lentils, with a lighter, less earthy flavor.  Red lentils do not require any soaking, just rinse.  High in fiber, they are superb in soups and appealing to children as well as adults.  I highly recommend an easy Moroccan type red lentil soup with lots of fresh lemon.  Google for recipes.  Or  Simply chop one onion and saute quickly in olive oil,  add plenty of chicken or vegetable broth, a can of diced tomatoes (or chopped fresh), perhaps some chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and juice from several lemons (I make the entire lentil bag at once because the soup goes fast in my house).  The soup cooks on the stovetop in only an hour or so.  Warm and tasty in winter, light and citrusy  enough for summer.  Red lentils freeze well.  Fabulous healthy vegetarian meal served with whole grain crusty bread.  Comfort food at its best.  Try them!

review/summary: Delicious if Mushy
review/text: "Bob's Red Mill" is a name synonymous with healthy grains, and these red lentils are no exception. These are exceedingly tasty lentils that cook surprisingly quickly--too quickly, in fact. Definitely reduce your cooking times from other lentils you may have prepared, for the slightest overcooking of Bob's red lentils will break them down and turn them into mush.<br /><br />Now, that mush is surprisingly tasty, and I wouldn't be surprised if you spiced them up and added some flour and eggs for structure and strength that you could turn them into delicious vegetarian patties for burgers. But if you like lentils with some toothsome feel and visible structure, then you might be happier with a different variety, or a different brand of red lentils than Bob's.<br /><br />This 4-pack comes in a large box--be careful when cutting it open so as not to pierce the 4 inner bags.

review/summary: Love this - not too sweet - great vitamins!
review/text: I love this drink mix because its not a sweet sweet drink mix...its a hint of sweet - at first if you are used to sweet drinks you will think its bland...but then you realize that its refreshing and great to hydrate prior to exercise. I try to drink a water bottle full of this in the morning - and it definitely helps my running...I'm able to jog without getting so tired out. I keep ordering this over and over as we run out - a great drink that's refreshing and not sweet - nice and light!

review/summary: tastes okay but I won't buy it again
review/text: I bought this coffee because the product website said the Vermont Country Blend is a medium roast with mellow, smooth and  brisk taste. It is some of those things, it just doesn't taste that good. VCB has a little bit of a gas station coffee flavor in that it's a bit abrasive. You can almost taste the soil the coffee was grown in before you taste the coffee itself--if you like an earthy taste with a hint of road-trip rest stop, this is the coffee for you. The most disappointing thing about this coffee is the amount of sugar needed to sweeten it. I need three times the amount of sweetener for it to taste like I added something. (I used the same measurements that I use every morning: a 10 ounce mug plus one teaspoon of sweetener but with VCB I need 3 teaspoons to taste the sweetener and I could add more but I can't bring myself to dump much more into the cup.) Perhaps Green Mountain makes other blends that taste better, but my experience with VCB hasn't been that positive.

review/summary: An OK Taste-Not Too Hot!!
review/text: Either my taste has changed in the past twenty years or they have changed their process of how they pickle the Penrose Big Mama Pickled Sausage. It could also have been because of being vacumn packed instead of aged in the pickle solution of a jar. The taste was OK and it wasn't too hot! I do like the the idea of being vacumn packed for the convenience of shipping without the probability of a jar filled with the brine solution breaking during shipment as happened to me in the past.

review/summary: Tasty, but NOT as pictured or labeled!
review/text: These are really, really tasty, with just the right amount of smoke flavor. I think someone said they are ugly, but really they're not. Plus, they give your brain a great boost, so you feel good after eating them. The smoke flavor was just right for eating over rice, but in sushi (to make unagi rolls), the smoke was too overwhelming. For making unagi rolls, I'd recommend finding something that is not smoked, or they won't taste like sushi anymore.<br /><br />The only thing is they are NOT as pictured. The case arrived, but they were packed in SOYBEAN oil, NOT cottonseed oil as it says in the product description. I called Amazon, and they were great about sending out a replacement, thinking it was just the wrong item shipped. But the new case arrived the same: different color label, and packed in soybean oil. This would not be a big deal for most, but I ordered these SPECIFICALLY because my husband is allergic to soy. I contacted the company (Roland), and the woman I spoke with seemed surprised at the discrepancy and promised to call me back with an answer the next day as to whether these were mislabeled, or if they're really packed in soy. She never called back.<br /><br />So, these are tasty and great, but BUYER BEWARE they are swimming in SOYBEAN OIL. NOT allergy-safe.

review/summary: A useful amount of tastey organic parsley!
review/text: Parsley is one of the best sources of flavonoids on the planet. It is loaded with apigenin in the form of apin, and it is very difficult to get this much apigenin from any other source. It is roughly 10:1 gram for gram, so that parsley is pouring flavonoids. This ample supply makes it practical to add parsley using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. I recommend up to one cup of parsley daily, which necessitates a large supply, such as provided by this product.<br /><br />I will admit that I am not an expert regarding parsley as spice, but I love the fresh green parsley flavor that is imparted by this product. It brightens and freshens every food that I have added it to, which is many. When I get a little more money, I will get more so that I can have some in storage. I am sure that it stores well, in a cool dark place.<br /><br />I may write a parsley guide, so that I can provide recipes to use this much parsley. Apin and apigenin are not absorbed very well by the body, so it probably helpful to use parsley with yogurt, cheese, and acid/oil emulsions in order to improve the absorption. Fatty fish, such as red salmon, is a often neglected source of healthful oils. Citrus and vinegar work equally well for the acid. Be sure and add plenty of fresh ground pepper as well, which is very flavorful, but also likely to aid absorption. Until the time that I am able to write a guide, you can check my blog, which is linked from my profile page.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus

review/summary: Fresh, Lots, Well Packaged
review/text: Keep in mind, if you've never used dried parsley, that it is a little different in scent and flavor than fresh parsley.  All herbs are; we all know that.  Just mentioning it just in case.  :)<br /><br />Having said that - this is excellent "fresh" organic dried parsley.<br /><br />My biggest joy here was the giant 1 lb. bag (one of those Mylar foil packages, not just wimpy cellophane).  It's nearly impossible to find dried parsley in anything but a tiny jar priced as if it contained gold.<br /><br />Fresh parsley is of course awesome.  But it's not always easy to get healthy fresh parsley at a grocery store.  "Fresh" produce is usually well over a week old.  It was probably harvested and left to sit for a long time before being loaded into a truck (or even a shipping container for a train or sea voyage).  Then after days in transit, it's unloaded at a distribution facility and shipped again (or unloaded directly at your store, if you're lucky).  At the store it's unloaded and left to sit outside while they get around to putting it into the back of the store.  There it sits while it's processed by your local produce people, who finally put it out for sale into the produce section.  There, it sits further until/if someone buys it.  And then, it probably sits in your car and then your refrigerator for even longer.  That's pretty abusive to a little herb plant.<br /><br />So having dried herbs available as an option is definitely worthwhile.  Parsley goes well with pretty much everything but sweets.
