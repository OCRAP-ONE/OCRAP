review/summary: My 10mo olds fav's!
review/text: This is all my son will eat, besides oatmeal. The texture works for him, because he's always choking if things are too chunky. This has a mushy with texture consistency that he swallows just fine. I'm going to try other Happy baby products now..

review/summary: Mama grain -- not tasty at all
review/text: I've tried pretty much every type of organic pouch food currently available with my toddler son.  I like all of the Happy Baby foods EXCEPT for this Mama Grain.  Yuck.  I bought a multi-pack of these and have tried to force my son to eat this one.  But I really can't blame him for disliking it -- I've tasted all of the Happy Baby meals and this one just makes me gag, which is a bummer since this is the only pouch meal that seems to be appropriate for breakfast.  Would recommend avoiding Mama Grain.

review/summary: Nice healthy option for baby, not your typical combination
review/text: Obviously all babies have different taste preferences so far be it from me to criticize the other reviewer's assessment of this product; however, my baby loves this flavor and I do too.  I love that it is black beans and quinoa because it saves me from having to open a whole can of beans or cook a whole pot of quinoa just for one serving of baby food.  I suppose one could make large batches ahead of time and freeze, but my freezer is overflowing with baby purees! From what my son has tried of this line of food he has liked.  I look forward to trying more flavors.

review/summary: good for on-the-go and practicing with a spoon
review/text: My baby HATED this when he was first ready to move on past the stage 2 foods.  The texture is very different because of the quinoa.  He also didn't liked purees with chunks.  Now he's 17 months old and LOVES this pouch (which I saved for 8 months since I also bought a multi-pack).  I transfer it to a bowl and he uses a spoon to eat it.  It's great because it doesn't fall off the spoon very easily.  It's very sweet, and maybe too strong flavored for the little ones.

review/summary: Smells Horrible
review/text: We usually have good luck with Happy Baby products but this one is the exception. The smell of the banana, bean, quinoa mix is the most off putting smell I've ever experienced and it shouldn't be. Independently each of the food items are either appealing or mellow in smell. Not so with this product. It's almost as if the mix fermented in the packaging and is off-gassing the moment you release the contents.  My kid eats anything so I'm the one that stopped the feeding because of my uneasiness. She did however give me the look that said, 'why are you doing this to me?'

Easy to use, easy to clean, the handle may be plastic but it is a very sturdy plastic and handles the dishwasher just fine.

review/summary: Fresh-tasting, mild yellow curry paste with long shelf life
review/text: New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.<br /><br />So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.<br /><br />I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.<br /><br />I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation.

review/text: I bought this on the recommendation of the other reviewers on Amazon.<br /><br />It is easy to use and tastes just like what you buy in a good Thai restaurant.  I highly recommend this Yellow Curry Paste.<br /><br />I love Yellow Curry in Thai restaurants, but did not want the hassle of making it myself.<br /><br />I bought this curry paste, and mixed<br />-2 Tablespoons of Yellow Curry Paste<br />-1 can of Thai Coconut Milk (13.66 oz)<br />-1 Cup of water<br /><br />Heated in a saucepan and then put in carrots, cauliflower, snow peace, onions and cooked for 20-30 minutes.  I put in enough vegetables to serve 2 people.<br /><br />Then cooked 2 salmon fillets in a frying pan w/ olive oil on the bottom at low heat for 8 minutes w/ the lid on frying pan.  Cooked the salmon w/ the skin on the bottom touching the frying pan.<br /><br />Once Salmon and veggies were cooked, put vegetables and yellow curry sauce in a big bowl, and gently placed the salmon fillet on top (took skin off after being cooked thoroughly). Garnished with Cilantro and squeezed a little lime juice in for extra kick.<br /><br />Very delicious and fast and easy to do.  I love this curry paste and it tastes as good as what you would find in an authtentic Thai restaurant.

review/summary: Very tasty, good heat level
review/text: We liked this curry paste. It comes in a plastic tub with an inner sealed bag so it should stay fresh longer if it is not opened right away. The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot. We were quite happy with this product and would order again.

Everyone I've ever shared this with loves it and wants more. Subtle curry taste that creeps up on you. Awesome on burgers, bangers (sausages) - even chicken nuggets.

review/text: This is just like what they serve in Germany for currywurst. It is light in flavor, not too spicy, but lots of good curry flavor. The consistency is runnier than regular ketchup. We use this on everything you would use regular ketchup for. It's a great condiment to share - unexpected, unique and yummy!

review/text: For fans of curry ketchup, this one's an excellent choice. It's sweet and despite of the name it's not too hot. Wish the bottle was larger though. Once you start using it you want to put that stuff on everything...<br /><br />Tip: put this on chopped up bratwurst, sprinkle some powdered curry on top of it. Close to the real thing ("curry wurst").

review/summary: Tastes delicious!
review/text: Being from Europe, I have used this sauce for years and years. I have not found anything that comes even close to its delicious taste. In Europe you can buy several brands that are alike but I like the Hela brand the best and I always have a bottle in my fridge. I prefer the smaller size bottle (400ml) because it fits better in my fridge door.<br /><br />It says ketchup on the bottle but it nothing like ketchup or the spicy ketchups you can find at the regular shops. You just have to try it for yourself to decide whether you like it or not.<br /><br />The sauce goes well on fried or grilled potatoes but it is also very nice on your bratz or other grilled meats & poultry. Mix it up with some mayonaise and you will get mayonaise with a kick.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of would be the price. The price + shipping would be 7 times more than a bottle bought back home.

review/summary: The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making
review/text: First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good.

review/text: I have loved the taste of  Pike Place Roast coffee since its first offering. I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon. I look forward to my first cup of coffee each morning!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-22-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520269926">Everything but the Coffee: Learning about America from Starbucks</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4">Starbucks Pike Place Roast, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 54-Count</a>

review/summary: Good, but not Great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and "Oh my God", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the "ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ.

review/text: Bought this blend for my sister when she came to visit. She was happy with it, but we are left with several K-cups because she could not take them with her.<br /><br />It is just too bland for us. We like bold dark roast coffee and also get our K-cups from Amazon. But since my sister liked Pike Place roast, I gave it five stars.

review/text: What are these K-Cups made of?  $1.00 per K-Cup and that is at a discount?  Starbucks came late the the K-cup party and looks like they arrived way over dressed as well.  Don't waste your money on these.  A friend picked up some and I tried them, while they aren't bad, they certainly aren't worth twice the price as the equally good coffee produced by several other K-Cup brands.

review/text: I'm not sure what happened, but my box of "54 k-cups" only had 52 cups in it.  There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.  The product I received was sold by "BECCO CORP" through amazon.

review/summary: Mediocre Flavor & Brew, Not StarBucks Quality!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

review/summary: Convenient, Healthy, and Tastes Great
review/text: Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others.

review/summary: Salmon shouldn't contain soy
review/text: A bit bummed out that this salmon contains a soy filler. Never dreamed it would. Thyroid problems + soy = bad combo.

review/summary: Quick and easy to use and low in calories
review/text: First of all, Chicken of the Sea's Pink Salmon tastes great and it is easy to use for a quick topping on a salad or at lunch.  The health benefits are strong as well with the omega 3 but also the entire packet is only 70 calories and is low in fat as well.<br /><br />This si a great on the go container and we would buy again.
