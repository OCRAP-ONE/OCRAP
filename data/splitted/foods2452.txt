review/summary: Arguably but not defintively Better than Greenies
review/text: My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows. Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs. Greenies. The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage. slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices.

review/text: My dogs like these the best and I'm glad if it cleans their teeth.  I bought a 32-count for what I felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more, hopefully for the same price.  I have two VERY picky eaters of food and treats, a toy and a miniature poodle.  They turn down practically all treats offered them.  These are their favorite (except for the gourmet duck treats from Costco that I can't find anywhere else).  These are really worth buying.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/summary: Poor Plastic
review/text: I have purchased this as well. The plastic is so thin that when I drink from the bottle, and of course I drink it fast when i'm thirsty, the plastic practically gives out. It crushes as more water excapes and unlike the other bottles, when you pause from drinking to let the air go back into the bottle, it stays crushed. It doesn't matter if I even try to mold it back to it's normal "bottle" form with my hands. Useless! So you have to drink it all in one sitting so that you may recycle the bottle right away. Otherwise, your left with a deformed bottle you have to lay down flat in the fridge. Which ends up taking more space and it looks ridiculous.

It tastes like chemicals from the plastic bottle leaked into the water! I usually get the generic Great Value bottled water, and they taste 100x better! I have to hold my nose to drink this water because I almost threw up from the aftertaste. You know what? I'd rather drink tap water since this water isn't any better than it, and tastes a lot worse!

review/summary: Not just any water
review/text: Aquafina is not just any bottled water. When tried it, I wondered why it tasted better.<br /><br />I found out when I learned more about Aquafina.<br /><br />It goes through a seven-step purification process, which includes ozonation and reverse osmosis, which "uses semi-permeable membranes with smaller pore sizes than microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration to remove unwanted substances in the water, like sodium and chloride."<br /><br />The other steps remove most TDS (total dissolved solids) from the water. Aquafina's average TDS is 4, which is 2.5 times lower than the FDA standard.<br /><br />The result is a more delicious tasting water.<br /><br />I find that with this water, I drink more water, because it tastes better to me. Because I drink more of it, I'm getting more health benefits.<br /><br />Other bottled waters do some steps, but Aquafina does seven purification steps. The result is a better tasting water.<br /><br />I haven't found a better tasting one yet. If I do, I'll switch, but for now, I am satisfied.

The bottles do not stand up. The plastic is so pliable that when you remove the bottle from the case and try to stand it on a flat surface, it will fall over. No matter how I have tried to squash the bottle flat on a table, it will fall over. It's frustrating and annoying. I will never buy Aquafina again. I'm sure the plastic is "green" or whatever but I'd like it if the bottle would stand up.

review/summary: Convenient.....But Expensive Is Right
review/text: I was along on a camping trip with my sons scout troop when someone brought along a half dozen or so of this vegetable blend.  It was very convenient since it required no refrigeration, plus it was surprisingly flavorful for a dry blend when made into a soup or stew.  Unfortunately I have to go along with the other reviewer here when he calls it a major rip off.  Even for an average size soup that is about 2 quarts, two bags of this 4 oz size would be needed.  That makes it far more expensive than it is worth when you can add canned vegetables at 10 oz. (minus the water) for about a dollar a shot. At the same time I cannot honestly put down all of the Barry Farm products, thus the extra star I added.  I have bought and used several other dry products from Barry Farms including their bouillon and powdered eggs and have been very satisfied with them, both price and product wise. Unfortunately as for this particular veggie blend, I cannot recommend it despite its fairly decent taste.  Way too expensive. Even if bought at a case at a time...

review/summary: Delicious & caffeine free!
review/text: As a former soda junkie, I've been looking for different beverages to replace my beloved Pepsis & Mountain Dews. A friend of mine practically lives on Crystal Light & recommended that I check it out. I'm officially a big fan & convert!<br /><br />The Skin Essentials brand of CL boasts that it will help improve your skin as well as taste good. It is still 5 calories (which is the usual amount for CL mixes) & contains some new plant extracts which are supposedly good for your skin. While it still has a bit of vitamins in it, it doesn't have as many as some of their other lines do. (Presumably so they can fit those skin improving elements in!) This shouldn't bother anyone unless they are specifically drinking CL in order to get their daily vitamins. (If you're only getting your vitamins from CL then there's something wrong with that picture!) This drink has no caffeine, so if you are abstaining this is a good one to have. If you need caffeine, well... there's still several other CL drinks to have.<br /><br />Now onto what you really want to know: does it taste good & does it work? Taste wise, it's fantastic. I'm a big fan of tea but not caffeine, so this works out really well for me. The peach element is very good but not overpowering. It's a bit sweet, so people who don't like overly sweet things may want to stick to the pomegranate lemonade skin essentials. I'd still give it a try. I was a bit skeptical about whether I'd like it or not, but ended up adoring it. As for whether or not it works skin-wise, I can't honestly give a real answer yet. I've only been drinking it for about a week or so, off & on. I can say that I've noticed my skin getting silkier & a bit softer, which is enough for me to keep drinking it! (Well, I'd keep drinking it for the taste as well!)<br /><br />Now for price. Getting it from amazon... maybe not such a good idea if you are looking for value. You could honestly find it cheaper at your local grocer's. HOWEVER, if you are in an area where there's not a good selection of CL or far from a proper grocer's, it may be more convenient to order online & have it shipped to you. Then again, it could end up that even if you do live next to a well stocked grocers, ordering from amazon could still be more convenient to your work & life schedule.

review/text: We found this flavor of tea in our local store, bought it and loved it.  Then we could never find it again.  Researching it on the 'net, we found that "it is not available in your area".  Why not?  We bought a whole lot of it from Amazon and hope that when it runs out, we can get more.  Yes, it's that good.

review/text: I love the Crystal Light Skin Essentials white peach flavor.  It's much lighter tasting than the regular peach flavored crystal light or other similar drink mixes.  I find it refreshing and satisfying.  Even better, I can carry a few packets with me wherever I go and always have access to a drink I'll really enjoy.  Even better, since it's so hard to find in stores, I can just order from Amazon and have it on stock in 2 fast and easy days.

review/summary: Taste is excellent and the price was right
review/text: Sunflower oil. During a recent trip to Europe I had the opportunity to be blown away and not by the amazing architecture! When I ordered French fries (or chips, maybe), I was met with a light, unique flavor. And it wasn't just the fries that I was enjoying. After inquiring to my fiance, a European, as to the taste, she told me they cook nearly everything in sunflower oil. How have I gone so long without ever having the opportunity to enjoy sunflower oil? It seems it is the corn industry of Europe, so sunflower oil is "cheap" in Europe like corn oil is cheap here in the US.<br /><br />The other issue is that sunflower oil in the US, when and if you can find it, is super expensive. Sure, the Zvijezda oil isn't cheap even after shipping, it was still cheaper than the $5 for 16 oz I can find in stores, so I jumped on this.<br /><br />I assume the marketplace seller didn't have anymore of the 3L bottles and instead shipped 3- 1 liter bottles instead, which was just fine with me as it takes up just about the same amount of space in the cupboard.<br /><br />Sunflower oil has a lighter taste than corn oil but still definable. Sunflower oil also has a similar smoke point as corn oil, which means you can use it at a higher temperatures (especially for deep frying). Over all, I am quite pleased with this oil. It isn't the highest grade, but if you are using it for cooking over cosmetic use (go for higher grade for something like that!), this is a heck of a deal and a great replacement or compliment next to your corn and olive oil (if you want oil to flavor something, best to use olive).

review/summary: Absolutely fantastic!
review/text: I had read on Dr Oz website that Sunflower oil helps fight belly fat. So I got this as an alternative to other cooking oils that we have been using. I have even used this to replace the olive oil normally used in pizza dough. It makes the texture of the dough fantastic and so easy to handle. I love this product and will buy again and would certainly recommend to friends and family and other users of Amazon. Side Note: There is not a real difference in flavor between this and other oils that I have seen or tasted and this one is better for you. The only time I use any other oils is when I am low on this one and/or I need the strong flavor from olive oil for Italian dishes.

review/summary: excellent cracker, but doesn't survive shipping
review/text: I first ran into this cracker at AJ's Fine Foods (a local grocery).  These crackers taste great and have a generous amount of Rosemary on each cracker (when it hasn't fallen off the cracker).<br /><br />I recently ordered a pack of 6 boxes from Amazon and found the same problem that most of the boxes in the local grocery had.<br /><br />Each box *should* have several large crackers the size of the box.  But the large crackers don't seem to survive shipping/handling either from Amazon or to the local grocery and so what is in the boxes are lots of cracker pieces ranging from 1/2 cracker size to pieces the size of a quarter.  Plus, most of the rosemary has fallen off, so each box has about a tablespoon of the spices that should be on the crackers at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />A real shame -- I hope the company figures out a way to produce these so that they survive transport, because they are great crackers.  The boxes which were shipped from Amazon were boxed well (I don't believe this is an Amazon specific problem).<br /><br />I won't be buying any more of these online, since even the ones in the stores require visual inspection if you want crackers instead of pieces of crackers.

review/summary: Best mix for white GF bread
review/text: When my son was first diagnosed, I tried making GF bread from scratch. I spend copious amounts of time and money on a variety of flours. When I found this mix, it was like a gift from God. I've since tried several other mixes, but none turned out as consistent a product as this mix. I do make some tweaks, however. I add a packet of unflavored gelatin (increases the protein content and helps with texture) and a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Often I will use my own yeast, just to make sure it's fresh. With these tweaks, I can easily make very good bread--without a bread maker (I have one, but I get much better results without it). I do find that I have to double the cooking time, but that could be from our area's temp and humidity and our oven.<br /><br />I've occasionally tried some variations, such as raisin and cinnamon, poppyseed, etc., with varying results. Overall, however, this is so much better than the awful pre-made, mass-produced shelf-stable breads, better than other mixes, and as good as many of the local freshly-baked GF breads that sell for eight dollars a loaf in our area. My son still likes his frozen bread for some sandwiches, but otherwise we often make this.<br /><br />Amazon's subscription-price is competitive, so we'll move to that!<br /><br />Updated to add that I no longer add xanthan gum to the mix, and the results are just as good.  With better proofing, my cooking time is only a little longer than what is listed on the box. Try cooling the loaf in the oven, with the temp turned off and the door opened a little bit.

review/summary: Favorite GF Sandwich Bread
review/text: Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread.<br />The title says it all. It is my hubby's favorite - GF, MSG & related products free, aspartate free, easy to make, stays together, and tastes great - much like potato bread only a little heavier. Yes, I know Amazon just raised to about $3.91/box + free shipping on the subscription plan. It makes a large 2 lb. loaf which I cut into two 1-lb. loaves before slicing which makes it $1.96/1-lb. loaf. If you look at the price of a decent white bread in the stores, the actual price is not too bad, considering it is a GF product. I look for not only GF and great taste, but affordablility.<br />The only difficulty I have had is that it doesn't keep more than a week at best at room remp or in the frig, so I put 2 slices in sandwhich bags, then put the sandwhich bags in a freezer bag and pull out just what I need to use at the time.

Will definitely keep using! I just wish the price was a little better--there's not even much of a savings to buy it as a six-pack.

review/summary: Great, quick bread!
review/text: We use this mix when I'm strapped for time. It's quick and easy and is our favorite alternative to my own recipe. I add 1/4 cup of sweet dairy whey which adds to the taste and texture! My entire family likes this bread, even my picky hubby! It makes a great sandwich, perfect french toast and UNBELIEVABLE grilled cheese!

review/summary: Good all purpose bread
review/text: This bread has a good taste and texture. It is simple to make in the bread machine. I have found, however, that in my particular bread machine it does not do well on the gluten free setting. I have had much better luck using the traditional settings that take longer. On the GF setting it ends up too doughy. It is good for a couple of days after baking. I always have some of this on hand for when I am feeling too lazy to make homemade bread.

review/summary: Not MY Favorite Sandwich Bread, but it is good
review/text: I can understand why so many people love this sandwich bread. Especially when compared to pre-made frozen loafs of gluten free bread, this is especially good. It compares very favorably to "real" sandwich bread.<br /><br />So why the 4-star review? No single reason was worthy of removing a whole star from my rating, but taken all together, there were several things that left me less than excited about the bread. The main issue is that although the bread has a wonderful texture, is soft, moist, and chewy, it was too moist to make decent grilled cheese. The grilled cheese lacked the necessary structural integrity to hold together while flipping over and we had some difficulty with that. In my household, this is a big deal. Grilled cheese is my husband's favorite dinner, and he's pleased as punch that we can have grilled cheese again, but was very clear that this was not the best gluten free grilled cheese he's had. He's not gluten free himself so his standards are pretty high, I'll grant you that.<br /><br />Additionally, the PBJ test wasn't ideal. The bread had all the qualities I would have expected would make a delightful PBJ, but the peanut butter and the jelly seemed to get lost in the bread. The bread is a little "wiggly" too, which made the slices hard to keep from tearing apart when handling. cutting the sandwich in half helps.<br /><br />I also tested different storage methods for this bread. It kept well on the counter, wrapped in plastic. It also did well frozen, and defrosts on the counter quite well. Storing in the refrigerator is not recommended, however. The moisture content of the bread is high enough that storing in the fridge leads to condensation inside the plastic, making for slimy, soggy bread. Not good. But who says you have to store it in the fridge?<br /><br />Making the bread was easy with a stand mixer. It took all of ten minutes to make the dough and get it into the pan. The dough isn't nearly as sticky as the dough from the French Bread mix, but the process is basically the same. It's got a relatively short bake time, as well, at 30 minutes. This makes it less time-consuming to make than many other mixes and recipes. I'm continuously pleased with the mixes that Gluten Free Pantry produces.<br /><br />So yes, overall this was a great loaf of bread. Not my favorite, and not the best for grilled cheese or PBJs, but I can definitely see why it's so popular, and if you're looking for a loaf of bread that's close to the "real deal," this will probably make you very happy.

review/summary: Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread
review/text: This Gluten-Free Pantry Sandwich Bread is very good.  I have made many loaves of their French Bread, but after trying the Sandwich Bread I actually think this one is more to my liking.  It's a little softer than the French Bread and more like "regular bread".  After baking, cooling, slicing and freezing the loaf (in 3 bags), I find it tastes better and holds together better if I toast it a little first before eating it.

review/text: Do you miss having a good sandwich since you became gluten free? No more worries! Buy this, bake it, slice it to your heart's desire! It won't crumble like other GF bread. Make French toast, etc. too!  I sometimes make cinnamon raisin bread by adding spices, fruit and nuts. Heavenly!  I usually make it in my bread machine on a 3-hour basic bread cycle. It needs to be lightly stirred at first until it mixed. It's also very good when baked in the oven.  The mix is not lactose free but is tolerable for me. I have it on regular shipment!

review/text: I've never used a bread mix for a bread maker before, much less a gluten-free one. Since the bread maker wasn't the latest model (Toast Master 2 lb. 'Bread Box'), it had NO directions for gluten-free bread. I was worried about outcome. There are several "directions" for different types of bread. I started with and used the directions for 'white sandwich bread'. No problem. Everything worked great and I ended with a good tasting, nice textured loaf of bread. Very pleased with mix and outcome. It tasted better than the gluten-free loaf we bought!

review/text: This is the best GF bread mix I've used, although I didn't think so after the first time I baked it. It was under baked, very dense and heavy. After a few more tries I have a great recipe for a success: first I use more liquid (2 cups), add 4 tbsp ground flax seed and extend baking time to 40-42 minutes. I baked it in an electric oven and in gas and both do great job.

It makes quite a decent sandwich compared to any recipe I have tried in the past 11 years - and believe me, I have tried a LOT of recipes...  I just think it is  pretty pricey, not cheap, but cheaper than buying all those different GF flours, only to turn out a pathetic, crumbly & peculiar-tasting loaf.  So far, this is the best alternative I have found.

review/text: This is one of the best gluten-free breads I have ever tasted.  It is far better than the ready-made breads in the store.  The one caveat is that you have to be careful if you are using a bread machine to bake this bread...each bread machine operates a little differently, even if you are baking to the instructions for gluten-free bread.  You might have to adjust the amount of yeast and/or water to get the bread to rise properly and to not over-flow the bread machine.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Successfully Egg-Free!
review/text: I initially purchased this mix because the eggs were not included and it doesn't contain peanuts/tree nuts and is not processed in a facility that does. My 3 year old has nut and egg allergies and is gluten intolerant. I have made 3 loaves now and finally my 3rd attempt came out perfect. I used ENER G egg replacer for the 2 eggs required in the recipe. The first batch I made in a machine that did not have a gluten-free cycle. I used the quick cycle and the loaf came out ok, not great. The crust was very thick and hard an I had to cut it off to make it edible. The second batch I made in a machine with a gluten free cycle and the loaf was slightly underdone in the middle, so a little dense. I just made the third loaf with the gluten free cycle, I just extended the cycle by choosing a darker crust option. The results were a beautiful, fluffy, tender loaf that my 3 year ate with gusto. My search for sandwich bread is over! Now on to burger buns... =)

review/text: I'm not gluten free, but I have recently become wheat free and doing without bread has been a challenge. The premade stuff in the store is horrendous, so I thought I'd try making my own. After a couple of failed projects, I decided to try this mix. My bread machine is old and doesn't have a gluten free cycle, so I just used the regular large/light cycle and it seemed to work fine. It rose well and had a more pleasant aroma than other GF breads I've tried. The texture and taste are also much closer to the real thing than others, albeit a bit dense in comparison to wheat bread, but that's just a fact of life. And surprisingly, it is easier to slice than regular bread I've made. All in all, a more than acceptable substitute.

review/summary: Closest thing to regular bread!
review/text: This is the closest thing I've found to regular bread. I find it simple to mix up and bake as well, which is even better! I warm the oven and pop it in there to rise, especially when it's cold out. It rises really nicely and then cooks up great. I have to cover mine partway through with foil to keep it from getting too dark on top. I have had trouble with it sticking to the pan when I go to get it out. My mother-in-law uses a double-walled pan (like the air bake cookie sheets, only in bread pan form I guess) and doesn't have any trouble with sticking, so I guess I'm going to have to try that! This gluten free bread mix is worth the time and money.

review/summary: nearly foolproof mix, low on flavor
review/text: I've had great success with this mix in my zojirushi bread machine. Ithe mix comes with a premeasured packet of yeast to which you simply add milk or water, eggs, and oil or butter. I have made bread with milk and butter and also with water and oil. I don't notice much difference between types.<br /><br />the loaf produced rises well, bakes quickly and has a fantastic crust. I find the plain white recipe lacking slightly in flavor, but have done well adding Italian spices/garlic/onion powder twosome loaves, and cinnamon and sugar to others.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfect loaf of bread for my gluten free kids' lunches. I bake a loaf on Sunday night and we slice off of it all week. the texture is excellent and the bread hold up well, no toasting required.

review/summary: Better than Glutenated Breads
review/text: Wow... I'm not gluten insensitive but my girlfriend has celiacs.  We recently got a bread maker and have tried a few packaged bread mixes.  I can honestly say that this is easily the best gf bread mix and is better than most whole wheat gluten breads or regular breads you purchase from the supermarket.  It has caused me to give up normal breads and join my girlfriend in her gluten-free diet.  Bob's is good too but (very spongey) but Gluten Free Pantry's sandwich bread has amazing flavor and that homemade bread texture.  The store bought gf breads aren't even close to being on the same level as this product. Simply great!

review/text: I've tried a few different bread mixes and recipes using gluten-free flour, and I think this mix is by far the best. No gluten-free bread tastes the same as bread made with wheat flour, but this bread is just as good. My bread machine doesn't have a gluten-free setting, so I used the Quick Bread setting and it came out perfect. The only thing I had to do was to scrape down the sides of the bread pan a couple of times during the process. Great texture and flavor. After eating this, I don't miss "real" bread at all!!

review/summary: The Best Gluten free bread - hands down!
review/text: I have been making gluten free breads in my breadmaker for a couple of years now. Not much to it - very simple to follow and great results every time (get a breadmachine with gluten free setting if you want to use this mix). I love the flavor of this bread - not a strong taste at all, which is what you want if you want to make sandwiches. People who expect gluten free breads to taste like regular breads will always be disappointed - there is nothing that will be exactly the same as regular bread, but this one comes the closest, in my opinion. Almost all freshly made gluten free bread mixes will end up in a slightly spongy, damp bread. I always toast mine if I'm making sandwiches and it turns out fine. I don't toast it, however, if I'm eating it as a side with my meal (such as soup), and even my whole family who is not GF loves this bread! I used to be a devout Pamela's bread mix fan (which is also good), but after trying this one I have to say this is the winner hands down. Pamela's tastes fine, but doesn't slice as easily and has a flatter shaped bread -- not the most ideal if you're looking for sandwich bread.<br /><br />This bread also makes nice thicker slices if you're looking for dinner bread. I also use leftover bread for excellent french toast even if it's stale. Makes great stuffing cubes, too. I slice and freeze leftovers, take them out of the freezer and either toast them or leave them on the counter for 30-45 mins before serving and they are perfect. Smaller amounts of leftovers can be used for bread crumbs in recipes if you toast them first (can also be frozen).<br /><br />By the way, I happened to add sliced olives, grated parm cheese, and italian herbs to the liquid before adding the flour, and the bread had a wonderful flavor! Great for dipping in olive oil.

review/summary: Finally--bread that comes out great in a machine!
review/text: I found out I had a sensitivity to wheat so tried to find alternatives. After getting tired of soft corn tortillas for lunch every day, I decided to try this mix. I put it in my plain old Regal bread machine on the rapid cycle. (Mind you, it's very basic and doesn't have a gluten-free setting.) Wow! I couldn't believe how well it came out. I have made many breads in that machine but none have been better than this one. In fact, I rarely use the machine because the breads don't have the texture I want. This one was different. It was super moist and cut into beautiful even slices. Very good tasting, too, though I'll probably add a dash of stevia to the mix next time (since I like a tinge of sweetness). Even though I'm the one watching my wheat intake, my husband ate up half the loaf he liked it so much. The only drawback is the price, but I guess you can't complain when you get a pack of yeast along with it.

review/summary: excellent in every way, but....
review/text: Gluten Free Pantry's bread mix is the best I've tried (and I've tried many mixes, including some homemade ones myself).  It tastes great (maybe slightly too sweet), has perfect consistency for GF bread, and is fairly durable and not too crumbly.  All this combined makes it my "go-to" mix when I want bread.  And no, you don't have to microwave/toast it like you do with other GF breads--it's perfectly fine as-is, even after being taken out of the fridge.<br /><br />However, one thing that bothers me is: whenever I make it and take it out of the oven, it always seems to rise much higher on one side than the other, and winds up almost splitting in half sometimes on the side that's risen too much (in fact, that's exactly what happened to me the first time I tried it).  I'm using the correct size pan for it...it REALLY poofs up when you bake it.  Has anyone else experienced this issue?

review/summary: Love this Bread!
review/text: I have been gluten free for a little over a year now and bread is the one thing I miss. I love this bread, tastes just like "real bread" should. I made this bread in the crock pot and I also made it in the oven. Both ways it turned out perfect!

review/summary: Sceptic no more!
review/text: As I type this, I am eating my first sandwich since going GF in Sept '10. I have tried every GF loaf on the market and tossed every one of them at first bite. My dad bought me a bread maker for Christmas and there is no specific "GF setting". There is a quick bread/cake setting which I used according to the package directions. I was so skeptical and just bought a box from the store to try before I paid for a case from Amazon. BUY IT HERE! Do Super Saver and buy it. That makes it about $3.50 a loaf, which isn't unheard of for better breads, and certainly cheaper than store-bought GF breads. Don't expect a light and fluffy texture. I hesitated to put it on the "regular" setting since the directions say use the quick setting. It's moist, denser, but holds together SO well! Don't crumble at all. I'm going to get a case and have it on hand!!

review/summary: Still the BEST!
review/text: I've tried several other brands of Gluten Free Bread mixes, and I've always returned to Favorite Sandwich Bread mix.  It freezes well and toasts great.

review/summary: The BEST - tweaked for my GFCF daughter
review/text: I have tried several other ready mixes for my bread machine, and this is hands down the best.  My 2 1/2 yo daughter was diagnosed PDD-NOS and we thought we'd give GFCF a try.  It's like a light bulb came "on" with the diet.<br /><br />Anyway, I made a few substitutions to meet our needs:  I use Almond Milk (instead of cow's milk or water) and a popular, vegan, organic buttery spread that is dairy free in place of butter.  Added a dollop of honey, and it is so yummy.  Even my husband thinks this is the most "real bread" tasting option we've had thus far.<br /><br />Now, if I could find an acceptable hazelnut spread substitute, I'd be golden!!!

review/summary: Wonderful bread every time.
review/text: Highly recommend this product.  Bread is one of the better gluten-free breads on the market, alongside making your own from scratch.
