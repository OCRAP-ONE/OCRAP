review/summary: Good, but not on its own
review/text: I was disappointed at first with this syrup.  I tried mixing an Italian soda with seltzer water.  I was expecting a flavor like grenadine or red popsicles-- this is not the case.  The black cherry flavor is pretty reminscient of the real thing; but on its own, there is a bitter note that is unpleasant.  The Italian soda almost tasted creamy, again, not in a good way.  However, the syrup is delicious when added to other things, like lemonade or orange soda.  We made a tasty cocktail with vodka, sweetened lime juice, and black cherry Torani.  In the end, the black cherry flavor is delicious and not like any old generic cherry flavor, but it really needs a tangy flavor to balance it out.  I will be trying other flavors of the sugar-free Toranis.

review/summary: Great start but bitter after-note
review/text: We have a SodaStream soda/seltzer maker, and I bought the Torani Sugar-Free Black Cherry syrup with the hope that it would be a nice complement to SodaStream's flavor lineup, which is missing flavors we really like, like Diet Cherry Zero, or Diet Cherry Dr. Pete (Dr. Pepper). The cherry flavor is there with this syrup, but we find the syrup is not rounded out to be quite sweet enough. And no matter what sweetness, we always experience a bitter aftertaste. What we find is that using a little Equal to offset the aftertaste and enhance the sweetness will help, but of course, that is no good for phenylketonurics. We'll keep looking.

review/text: I recently purchased my Bosch Tassimo coffee maker and received a free package of this coffee from when I registered my product.  I initially shied away from purchasing this coffee with my own money because I thought it was over-priced.  Instead I bought another, well-known brand of coffee because it was cheaper, but that turned out to be a mistake.  This coffee is now my favorite -- it's rich and isn't bitter like the other brand I tried first.  In addition, the price on Amazon for two packages is very reasonable.  I will be purchasing this coffee exclusively in the future.

review/summary: my favorite cup of coffee
review/text: Tassimo is the only system that has starbucks coffee, there are more choices of coffee with other companies, but now after drinking starbucks from Tassimo I don't think I would be able to drink other coffees on a regular basis.. Starbucks medium (house blend and colombia) are strong enough for great taste and stimulation for more than half the day, if I drink it at 4 pm or after I have trouble sleeping and I am a coffee addict.. I prefer colombia though, breakfast blend is light (for me) and bold ones (verona and others) are too strong and bitter.. it is expensive but coffee is one of my luxuries, and it makes my mood better, so I'll live with that.. once you drink starbucks from tassimo you won't even enjoy the one from the starbuck cafe.. I also recommend Seattle blends and somewhat Maxwell for a lighter coffee, I do interrupt the cycle to make it stronger though, but it is cheaper..

Real, Italian San Marzanos are grown in an area near Sorrento in southern central Italy where the ground has a lot of volcanic ash which imparts a special flavor.<br /><br />We have tried numerous brands of San Marzano tomatoes and found this one to be the best flavor.  We use it in preparation of a tomaoto sauce base from Mario Batali's recipes.  We also use it with garlic and fresh basil and fresh mozzarella to make an incredible pasta dish we call penne sorrentino.<br /><br />Highly recommend this brand.

What I like to do is to saut&eacute; some onion and garlic, a little red pepper flake, add my tomatoes that I've pureed with a hand blender (or use a food mill, if you prefer), then let simmer for about 20 minutes until thick and creamy. Nothing's better for homemade ravioli or freshly made pizza, or my personal favorite, pasta bolognese. If shipping seems out of whack, just order more cans...that should offset the cost immeasurably.

review/summary: Delicious but other products taste better and are healthier.
review/text: I used this product for many years. I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavor for everyday drinking, chocolate for treats, and original for cooking. Buying 12 at a time saves on shipping costs.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online. The claim that canola is not safe is controversial, and it is a multi-billion dollar industry. No controlled long-term longitudinal studies of human safety with respect to all these medical issues have been performed to my knowledge. If you have confidence in the US FDA safety standards after reading these references, it is a delicious drink!<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

review/text: This product should be labeled naturally sweetened instead of unsweetened.  They are sweetened with cane juice.  They do not have sulphured preservative.<br /><br />Since Mangos are sweet already, why do they even bother.  The following is my theory.  I think this importer gets the mangos un-ripened since they are shipped so far.  They then load them up with sugar to disguise this.  The result is dried mango which is nearly white in color and has very little mango taste to it.  It basically tastes like you're eating a chewy piece of crystalized sugar.<br /><br />Not what I was looking for.  Oh, and Amazon does not allow returns on this product.  Another let down.<br /><br />Country of origin for the mangos was Thailand if anyone cares.

review/summary: Good Taste
review/text: These mangos have a good flavor and are sweetened with cane syrup which is unprocessed and tastes like brown sugar.  They do not have preservatives.<br /><br />One thing I don't like is that they say "Manufactured in California" which I doubt.  Usually mangos are imported and I would like to know which country they import these from.<br /><br />They taste great though.

review/summary: The best dog toy I ever bought :)
review/text: I have two smaller dogs and they absolutely love their Tug-a-jug's.  The many uses of this product; training, feeding, tug, play, fetch, etc.. are incredible considering the low price of it.  Ingenious design and functionality.  Be sure to use (smelly) smaller treats to have your dog get the "hang" of it and adjust them in size to make it more challenging.  Trust me, if you put just a little time into showing your dog how it "works", it will easily become its favorite toy. The BEST!!!!!!

review/summary: My Pugs love this!
review/text: I bought two of these for my Pug puppies.  Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories), I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is, "do you want your bottle" and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.  Oh and I've had ours for probably a year and a half and we're not even close to needing to replace them.

review/summary: Great fun for my dogs!
review/text: My dogs love this toy!  They're Golden/Lab mixes, so they love to play and are very food-driven.  One of them figured out how to get the treats out within a matter of minutes ... her father hasn't quite gotten it yet.  For him, it's still trial and error, but they both love it.  I like that it is so easy to fill; the bottom simply screws off so you have easy access for filling and cleaning.  It's easy to clean too; I've washed it in the dishwasher with no problems.  My dogs have destroyed several other treat-dispensing toys by simply chewing through the toy to get to the treats.  I've had this one for a few weeks now and it's still in good shape (only a few scratches on the surface of the jug from being bounced around my hardwood floors).  So I'm pleased with how durable it is as well.

review/summary: Provides Hours of Durable Fun for our Puppies!
review/text: I purchased our first Busy Buddy Tug for Hudson's 1st Birthday! He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.... not this toy! It is by far the most durable!!! He did eventually chew through the rope, which I removed and he continues to play with this and carry it around most of the day. Our other little Springer Spaniel loved it so much that after months of fighting over it, I bought Wrigley one for his 1st birthday last month. I was so pleased with the first one, I also purchased the Preimer Waggle for him. If it is possible, this toy is even more entertaining than the other! Hard to believe ... these toys have kept our puppies busy, entertained and constantly concentrating and working on getting the treats out! I love them!

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE Tug-a-Jug!
review/text: My young Keeshond puppy is a master of the Tug-a-Jug, but even my 10 year old Border Collie loves the thing!  She will play with it until every last bit of kibble is liberated.  After many hours of play, the jug is a bit scratched, but the rope remains intact.  My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.  Tug-a-Jug is definitely a hit!  It keeps my very busy puppy occupied for 45-60 minutes per refill.

Though if you have more than one dog, I would suggest one for each. The bottle is made from 'bullet proof' material and is really hard and could cause some damage if it's being swung around and fought over. Over all though, I am really happy with this purchase. It's great to watch the dogs figure this out!!

review/summary: very durable "toy" to keep dog entertained
review/text: We have the large Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug for a lab/shepherd mix that is a major chewer!  He goes through toys fast and destroys the yard when left alone outside, so our trainer recommended products that you can hide treats in that he has to WORK to get out.  I thought for sure he'd just shred the rope, but he's happy to flip it around endlessly... just for little morsels.  We use about a half cup of dry items like KONG brand "Tail Mix" and GRIZZLY NUTREATS smoked wild salmon for the week.

review/summary: Awful!  Didn't make it through a day!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>It took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this.  First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.

review/summary: Easier than I expected
review/text: This toy seems well-made, which is important for my puppy who is a powerful chewer and destroyer. Sometimes, though, the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble.<br /><br />I have used the toy with my 8-month-old, medium-sized dog 3 times now, putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats. The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success.

review/summary: Amazing toy for dogs who devour their food quickly
review/text: Absolutely LOVE this toy. We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution.

His first one lasted about a year, and we used it every day, sometimes two to three times.  The threads on the bottom of the screw-off bottle eventually all broke off (i believe there is a picture of what it did on the item description already) and we needed another one.  So i bought 2.  It is a good toy that i will continue to give my dog, as it effectively keeps him busy and engaged.

It's tough and has withstood our large Bernese Mountain dog puppy chewing at the neck of it and throwing it around the room. It took her a few days to figure it out.  I had to show her how to use it, and she seemed uninterested, but then I left it in her crate with her, and when I came home later it was empty.  Since then, she's a pro at it.  The rope didn't last that long, but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it, and it's still a challenge for her.  Our last thing that we tried in it was baby carrots - she loved it and it took her a good 30 minutes to get them out.

review/summary: Pug loves it...
review/text: I have 2 very food motivated pugs (never met one that wasn't...). The outgoing one LOVES banging this toy around the house for hours. The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily. After a week of using it, I realize the small size is just fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />dog loves it<br />durable<br />keeps them occupied for unlimited time<br />i like the "difficulty" level of this toy: it is not too easy that it's emptied in 15 minutes like a treat ball, but not so hard that she won't play with it<br /><br />cons:<br />rope is difficult to clean and attracts moisture<br />the noise as she bangs it around the house is insane

review/text: I have been searching for some good toys for my little pup.  After him beating up some of his stuffed animals, I knew i needed to provide something more durable and safe.  I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall).

review/summary: Two Years is a LONG Time
review/text: After 2 years, this took one too many headers off the stairs and broke into (large) pieces, which Destrcto-dog enjoyed chewing on (but not chewing up).  Smarter dog took a few hours to get the hang of this one -- she still barks at it occasionally - total crack up!  Destructo-dog was just baffled till there were pieces...  Good thing Smart dog shares!!

review/summary: Good Toy--A few Drawbacks
review/text: My labs like to play with this toy-- which is good.  I don't put treats inside it and they still will play with it and fight over it.It seems durable and it seems safe.  The problems are two fold.  If the dogs play with it on a hard surface, like a concrete patio or a wooden deck, it makes a lot of noise as they drag the bottle end around and bounce it off of objects. Also my Labs will grab this thing by the rope end and swing it around in the air and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction whacking fixed objects or another dog while being whirled around. Nothing is perfect. I let the dogs have play time with it regardless of the negatives.

review/summary: Puppies All Time Favorite Toy
review/text: We have an English Mastiff puppy, and when we has about  months I picked up a small one of these on clearance. He loved it and played with in multiple times each day. As he grew it was just too small, so we upgraded to the Large Jug.<br /><br />He would hold this my the role and swing it back and forth hitting himself in the head. We eventually took it away because we didn't want him to give himself brain damage, but dang he enjoyed this thing.<br /><br />It was really durable. We have dents in our walls from it, but the plastic never cracked. The only part that eventually broke was the rope itself from our dog chewing on it. That wasn't a fault of the product, just a puppy with sharp teeth.

review/summary: Great Toy But Not Durable Enough
review/text: This toy has been a favorite of my 2 Year old GSD's since she was a puppy.  The first one lasted a really long time but our home is all hardwood flooring and my dog is so obsessed with this toy, she carries it around and drops it on the floor in front of us when she wants us to fill it!  This has resulted in the bottom screw caps breaking pretty quickly and she is now on her 5th one.  She broke two in one week.  Problem has been solved by no longer letting her carry it around the house, however, it would be nice if Premier could come up with a more shock resistant plastic to use.  I give it 5 starts due to the love my dog has for this toy but I wish it was more durable.

review/text: My 7 year old yellow lab figured this out in minutes and loves it.  My 2 year old chocolate lab just doesn't get it.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that Buster (yellow lab) carries it by the rope when empty and drops it at my feet on the tile.  After about 3 drops the screw on bottom breaks.  After he broke the first one, we ordered another and sprayed the bottom with rubberized coating.  That made it last a good six months.  We are ordering another one for his Christmas present.  It would be the BEST if the manufacturer would put an unbreakable bottom on it.

review/summary: Fantastic puzzle toy for our clever and busy pit bull! Just try not to get conked out with it.
review/text: This is really one of the best purchases we've ever made for our 3-year-old pit bull (aside from the giant orthopedic dog bed that she loves like candy).<br /><br />Like many pits, she is very clever & very eager to work, and that means she needs a lot of mental stimulation in order to be a good citizen around the house. She's not terribly food-motivated in general, but she adores this toy, and we've taken to giving her one of her 2 daily meals out of the 'food bomb.' She seems to love working to get all the food bits out of it, and when that's done she alternates between gnawing on the screw top end of the toy, chewing on the rubber bit, and whipping it around by the rope.<br /><br />That brings me to the only potential drawback of the food bomb--I am convinced one of these days she's going to give me a concussion if she loses her grip on the rope while she's flinging it about. But since she has those strong pit bull jaws, hopefully that won't be an issue... Sometimes I'm shocked she hasn't given *herself* a concussion with it, but her head is apparently made of concrete.<br /><br />(Oh--and it has withstood a year's worth of her efforts to destroy it so far, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of toys that enter the house.)

review/text: My 5-month-old Black Lab/Boston Terrier mix is a very curious puppy. We have been looking for toys that are interactive, as well as durable. This keeps her occupied for at least an hour (sometimes more), and after a week it doesn't show any signs of wear. We do give this only under supervision, as she has been known to destroy other rope toys :) This is one of our favorite purchases for our dog, and it's just as good as the Kong Wobbler!

review/summary: Keeps my big Dog busy for a long time!
review/text: My Doberman/pointer mix has a lot of extra energy and really enjoys to chew. I purchased this product on a whim at the animal shelter that we got her from. I really had no idea how the toy was supposed to work, so she really did not use it for the first few weeks.<br /><br />Initially I put just a few Zuke's Mini Naturals treats in the container. She was able to get the treats out eventually, but lost interest quickly.  This toy is dishwasher safe! I put some peanut butter and a few broken up Milkbones in the toy to make it smell appealing and rattle when she shakes it. This made all the difference.  She now will sit calmly trying get to the peanut butter, and accidentally making the Zuke's treats fall out.<br /><br />Other reviews stated that their dog was able to break the plastic, but my dog has been playing with this for a month now, and she hasn't even been able to rip the rubber ball by the rope. As with any toy, you should try to supervise your pet. I would recommend this toy to any owner whose dog gets bored and will get destructive.

review/text: This is the primary way our Bouvier gets fed.<br />1) It's a challenge, she keeps her doggy mind and paws busy.<br />2) It eliminates gulping, so she can't inhale her dinner. She needs about 20 minutes to empty the jug.<br />3) So far ( after 9 months ) no problems with breakage or chewage. This could be because we always set it out on the hall carpet, so it bangs less on the hardwood!

review/summary: Took a while to figure out, but great toy!
review/text: I got the medium/large size about 2 weeks ago for my 2 year old, 40lb dog. He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor.

review/summary: Not very busy buddy
review/text: I purchased this toy for my very busy-mouthed blue heeler who seems to love everything that is half-way chewable.  It seemed to be the perfect combination of things he adores:  rope, bottles, noise, and chewable plastic.  We bought treats, showed him the treats inside (and they were good and stinky - his favorites), swung the thing around in the air a couple of times.  He was very interested, and we thought "this is it!".  We tossed the toy in front of him.  He smells it, pawed it once, and then nothing.  OK, that's fine.  Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.  Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  "Oh - it's still this toy, huh?"  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.<br /><br />This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.  For a dog that loves just about every toy, he doesn't like this.  Two paws down.

review/text: We got this for our 45lb dog and it occupied him for 30 minutes the first time we gave it to him. He had a little trouble getting a treat out. A miracle! However he is a smart dog and quickly learned how it worked. A scoop of food that used to last him 20+ minutes now only lasted him 10 minutes. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks, the plastic lid that screws onto the jug cracked and it is now useless. This is probably best for pet owners with carpeting since my dog would pick it up and drop it constantly to get the treats out which would be very noisy.

review/summary: So much better than a bowl!
review/text: The Tug-a-Jug has become our Hobbes' favorite toy.  We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night.

review/summary: Favorite toy
review/text: I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.

review/text: My puppy loves this toy, although I don't like that the rope gets smelly and it is hard to clean (I prefer toys that can go in the washer or dishwasher).  I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device.

review/summary: My dog loves this thing
review/text: My dog Sawyer even as a puppy took right to it.  He drains it pretty quickly, but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well, since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things.

review/summary: Puppy Loves It!
review/text: My large Labradoodle puppy loves this toy.  He quickly figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him busy for a few minutes so that he is not chewing things that he shouldn't be!  The only downside is that it makes a lot of noise on the floors; but that's OK since he is a happy boy with this toy.

review/summary: Challenging and Durable
review/text: I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for "aggressive chewers" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)

review/summary: Great for smart busy dogs!
review/text: I have a 2 year old border collie mix who gets bored easily and loves interactive toys. She gets so excited when I bring this toy out. However, she is a very strong chewer so she was able to chew through the rope within a day or so. I read on the Busy Buddy website a great suggestion: put a tennis ball in the bottle to make the toy useful again. This has worked well and makes the treats a challenge to get out. She figured it out very quickly but she is also a very smart and curious dog. My only complaint is that it is very loud on the wood floors! this toy is best if you have carpet or at least don't have a basement tenant in your house.

review/text: It keeps my blind dog entertained, but he does get frustrated sometimes. He's never been one for playing with toys or staying focused on any one thing for a period of time. He does seem to like it, though.

review/summary: Keeps dog busy
review/text: Dog broke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him.

review/summary: Good for fast eaters
review/text: I put my dog's kibble meals in this so she doesn't gobble it up so fast.  She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out.  I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it.  I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope.  I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the "slow down" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation.  I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time.

review/summary: Tug-A-Jug Med/Lg
review/text: I got this for my GR puppy at about 6 mths old but she didn't quite know how to get the treats out. However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does, it could definately break something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92.

review/summary: My dog loves this
review/text: This can be a tough mental challenge for a dog. My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released. This was tough for him to figure out. However, he has many different feeding toys and he doesn't give up.

review/summary: Great Lab Toy!
review/text: We have a mouthly labrador & this toy keeps him out of trouble.  He will carry it around all day long.  Don't leave it outdoors with food or it gets moldy as you would suspect.  My big lab loves his toy!  I prefer the one with the rubber handle over the fabric/rope handle.  Easier to clean.
