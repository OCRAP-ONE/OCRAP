review/summary: Good tasting and Good for you
review/text: So many times in the past I have tried natural products that turned out to be average tasting or even hardly edible.  Not these.  These taste good.  I can just barely tell the difference between them and regular Graham  Crackers.  These taste like they have more nutritional substance to them, including fiber.<br /><br />My daughter likes them, my grandchildren like them, and I like them.  In fact, a few minutes ago, I asked my grandson how he likes them, and he pulled out a package of from the box to nibble on while he watches TV.<br /><br />Always great when something good for you is actually a pleasure to eat too!  Also, like a lot of snack food. it's hard to quit eating them!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: They're yum yum yummy in my tum tum tummy
review/text: These are to graham crackers as are bran muffins to muffins...tasty, flavorful, bran muffins...mmmm.<br /><br />On the end of health:<br />The first two ingredients for these crackers are whole grains. One of the great things about this for me (and for you if you eat them) is that these tasty snacks end up containing a healthy amount of Iron and Dietary Fibers (2g). Another added bonus is that I know (and can easily purchase) most of the ingredients listed on the side of the box. These are sweetened with evaporated cane juice (as opposed to corn) along with a few other seasonings and spices.<br /><br />On the end of taste:<br />I really like the grainy texture of these crackers. There is a satisfying crunch when you chew them and a full mouth-feel experience in eating them. I kind of wonder what sort of magic they're doing with the sugar though as these taste like honey (you know... like the box says) but don't actually have any honey listed as any of the ingredients. My only guess is that perhaps they slightly burn the sugar (along with the aformentioned seasonings and spices) to achieve the taste.<br /><br />My wife loves these crackers, and she has had a variety of graham crackers to justify her experience. I love the value they add as a healthy and tasty snack. I don't think you'd go wrong in eating them yourself!

review/summary: A great big healthy YUM!
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure:  I am not employed by the Back to Nature Foods Company, nor am I related to anyone who is.  I have received no compensation for this review, other than a sample of the crackers.<br /><br />The first thing that impressed me is the business model.  This is not a 'pseudo' health food company; these folks are serious about offering a healthy product and protecting the environment at the same time.  The box is made from 100% recycled paper.  Right on!<br /><br />Enough about that--the crackers are delicious.  I think the last time I ate a graham cracker might have been when my grandkids--who are now teenagers--were tiny.  I bake my own bread so that I can control what's in it, so I approached these crackers from the viewpoint of a skeptic.  I loved them.  They are sweetened with cane juice and honey--no high fructose corn syrup!  There is a tiny bit of cinnamon, but just the right amount, and I love that they are made with whole grain.  I intended to eat one or two as a snack, but ended up crunching down about six of them with a cup of coffee, so be careful--they're addicting in the most exquisite way!  This is a truly great product.

review/text: These crackers are made of all-natural ingredients, so that's probably good.  The kids all liked them and thought that they had a good flavor, although they said that they like regular graham crackers better.  These were a bit messier than the normal graham crackers that I am used to, as they have oats on them and they tended to fall off and make a bit of a mess.

review/summary: Best graham crackers ever!
review/text: The only complaint I have is that many of the crackers were broken, as another reviewer mentioned. Well, that is because they sent only one box in a bubble-wrap envelope. With all 6, you get a big box and they will probably, I hope, not be broken. Anyway, they are delicious!! I am very happy with the slight cinnamon and honey flavor, no sugar on top, and extra crunch! In my opinion, Nabisco's are a bit bland and they tend to break easier when you put cream cheese on them. Keebler are better, but these are the best! The price is higher than others, as you are only getting 10oz, but the ingredients are all natural and the sugar is evaporated cane juice, better for you than either white sugar or corn syrup.<br /><br />Ingredients: Graham flour, rolled oats, evap. cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, baking soda and monocalcium phosphate (leavening), sea salt, cinnamon, vit E for freshness.<br /><br />That's real honey, real cinnamon. If you can afford to splurge on these, I would say do it. They stood up really well to cream cheese and strawberry jam, and probably with your favorite topping, too.<br /><br />And, I was happy to find that the box is 100% recycled materials. Good to show the kids what can be done with recycling.

review/summary: Wow, what a great flavor!!
review/text: Having always eaten the Honey Maid Graham Crackers... I was thrilled at being offered a more natural version to try.  I can sum up my experience in one word: Succulent! Wow!  What a great flavor!  You almost feel like you are eating a treat, and not a cracker!  So I took at a look at the ingredients and I was happy with what I found there too: all natural, simple ingredients (and ones that you KNOW what they are!).  If this is what a graham cracker is supposed to taste like, I've been jipped all these years!  I absolutely LOVE the oats in them too... it gives a nice crunch and I have to admit, I am a bit fan of oats in dry goods, so that definitely was a plus in my mind.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was better would be the price.  They are probably about 50% more expensive than the typical brands. But hey, who says I can't buy those "other" crackers for the kids (who could care less), and hide these on the top shelf for me?  :)

review/text: These fall squarely into my 'got to try them for free, and will actually actively look for them now' category of tasty foods.<br /><br />They're not excessively sweet, and at the same time they're not too 'healthy' tasting, if you know what I mean?  They are wholesome tasting, and with just enough sweetness.  They have a good crunch to them, not soggy at all, nor are they too dry.  They're a bit firmer than the grocery store grahams, so they don't crumble/crumb quite as easily.<br /><br />Short version: they're delicious!

review/summary: Best graham crackers I've ever had
review/text: Oats are, apparently, what graham crackers have been missing all these years that made them so bland. While I wouldn't exactly call these "health food" because there is a rather significant amount of sugar in them, these are probably the healthiest graham crackers you'll find, made with whole grain flour and oats, and using no corn syrup derivatives (only sugar and honey) as sweetener. They are also, by far, the best tasting graham crackers I've ever had. As snacks go, this seems like a great choice.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy treat
review/text: I received a 10-ounce box of these crackers through the Vine review program. The crackers arrived with about 95% of them intact. There are three packets of crackers inside the box, each containing seven crackers. Per the box label, a serving is two crackers at 110 calories with 2 grams of protein, 2 grams of fiber, and 2.5 grams of fat. The ingredients are graham flour (whole grain wheat), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, baking soda, monocalcium phosphate, sea salt, cinnamon, and vitamin E as a preservative. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors, and no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated fats.<br /><br />The company who makes these crackers, Back to Nature, has been in business for over 50 years. Their carton is made of recycled paperboard, and Back to Nature states it supports the Nature Conservancy, a leading conservation organization.<br /><br />Now to the main point: How do they taste? Personally, I think they are the best tasting graham crackers I've ever had. I love the crispy texture and the lightly sweet taste. I'm looking forward to using these to make graham-cracker crust with coconut oil. It should be really delicious. This is a product that I'm definitely going to purchase again in the future, and perhaps try some of the other flavors the company offers.

review/summary: Actually like it (thought I would not)
review/text: Alright, how do you review crackers>  Seriously? Well, her eit goes.<br /><br />I liked these crackers a lot.  I expected some brittle flaky crackers.  The taste was sufficiently good enough that I went back for more and in fact ate the whole box.  The honey taste is just right with a slight taste of cinnamon.  The crackers are a little dry compared to other leading (not so healthy) brands like Honey Maid.  There exists a definite whole grain type of texture that I actually find appealing.  I found that I did not need liquid to "wash down" the crackers as suggested by some other reviewers.  For a healthier choice cracker, I am very impressed.<br /><br />I am also impressed with the use of recycable and recycled materials in the packaging, providing a leg up on the competition IMHO.<br /><br />This product does not use corn syrup or regular salt.  Instead you get natural sugar and sea salt with no preservatives or other additives.  The crackers break apart easily, whcih I am personally OK with but might pose a problem if you use a spread or want to make smores. My 4 year old did not like them but my 9 year old did.  They both eat organic and whole foods regularly.<br /><br />Worth a try at the right price in my opinion.  They seem a little more expensive than Honey Maid.  But with food prices going up everyday, who knows by the time you read this.

review/summary: You're never too old to enjoy graham crackers.
review/text: Possibly, many Americans are familiar with Nabisco's Honey Maid graham crackers. The configuration, shape, size, and flavor, of these crackers has been standard for decades. While I do not have any Nabisco's graham crackers on hand right now, for a side-by-side comparison, I can easily remember the characteristics of this product.<br /><br />Now for the review.<br /><br />The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers comes in a box of moderate size. I was surprised by its heavy weight, that is, by its density. The BACK TO NATURE crackers seem a bit crisper and crunchier than the Nabisco product which, in my opinion, is somewhat soft and gets softer with storage. Crunchiness is generally considered to be a good thing (though the excessive crunchiness of food products such as Almond Roca can cause damage to teeth and to fillings and such). Even though I received the BACK TO NATURE products in the mail, there was very little breakage. I can conclude that the BACK TO NATURE graham crackers are a sturdy product, and will not likely be broken when toted in a plastic container by your kids, on the way to school.<br /><br />The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers are distinguished by the flecks of light-colored bits of oatmeal, which are baked into the top surface. In fact, the color photograph on the box shows a stack of three crackers with an abundance of oats adhering to, or baked into, the top surface of the crackers. This is another good thing.<br /><br />The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers have a dotted line that bisects the cracker, to make it easy to divide the cracker into two equal halves. This dotted line is not effective in the BACK TO NATURE product. Instead, the cracker always breaks just to the side of the dotted line, leaving you with two halves, but where one half is slightly larger than the other half. But this is neither good nor bad, unless you have a need to break the crackers into two equal halves, for example, for manufacturing a peanut butter sandwich.<br /><br />The BACK TO NATURE package label discloses that one serving contains 110 calories, 2.5 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbohydrate, and 2 grams of protein. The box informs us that one serving is 2 full cracker sheets.<br /><br />Now, let us compare this with the standard Nabisco Honey Maid crackers: 130 calories per serving, 3 g fat, 24 g carbohydrates, 2 g protein. And now, let us compare this with the low fat Nabisco Honey Maid crackers: 140 calories, 2 g fat, 28 g carbohydrates, and 2 g protein. The differences in these ratios are slight, and are not dramatic. Now (just for fun), let us look at a box of ordinary, unflavored oatmeal. I'm looking now at a box of generic oatmeal from Raley's Fine Foods. A serving has 150 calories, 2.5 g fat, 27 g carbohydrate, and 5 g protein. What does this all mean? I calculated the GRAMS PROTEIN/CALORIES for all of these products. There was little difference between the three graham cracker products, though it might be noted that the best (highest protein content per calorie) was from BACK TO NATURE. But ordinary oatmeal proved to be the best. For ordinary oatmeal, the ratio of protein/calories was twice that of the three graham cracker products. Now what can we conclude from this? If you are interested in the best nutrition, as far as oat products are concerned, then I recommend eating oatmeal right out of an oatmeal box. But in view of the fact that nobody does this sort of thing, I can recommend the BACK TO NATURE graham crackers as the next best way to satisfy your protein requirement.<br /><br />The protein requirement for a young child is 24 grams of protein per day (see my book, Nutritional Biochemistry, Academic Press, 1999). In the unlikely event that you want your child to acquire all of his or her protein requirement from BACK TO NATURE graham crackers, junior would need to consume twelve (12) of these crackers per day. This is not unreasonable. While writing this review, I consumed eight (8) BACK TO NATURE crackers. Just for the record, the protein requirement for the adult baby-boomer is 2.6-times greater than that of a child (aged 4-6).

review/summary: A treat, great for snacks and desert
review/text: These crackers were a big hit at my home; in terms of taste, they are quite delicious, even better than other brands (Nabisco, etc).  We previously purchased the standard Graham Crackers and I expected these to be very similar, but in fact they are much more substantial!  They contain a lot of oats as well as some vitamins, and a single serving (one full cracker) actually is fairly filling if you're having it for a snack.<br /><br />One issue I did have with these is that because of their composition they are very crumbly.  I don't think I had a single cracker break neatly apart, rather they fell into small pieces directly when bitten or snapped.  This can be a little bit of a hassle and you might want your hand-vac around to tidy up afterward!<br /><br />These are fairly calorie dense and VERY sugary, although it's all natural sugars rather than high fructose corn syrup.  However the fiber they contain is pretty substantial, in a snack you could do a lot worse.

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy graham crackers
review/text: I had actually been in the market for better graham crackers (that is, some not made with horrible ingredients), and these certainly fill the bill. No partially hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, or artificial flavors here! And the result is not the bland slab of wheat some natural foods companies are calling graham crackers; this is a graham cracker that tastes like a graham cracker. It's sweet, albeit in a softer, subtler way than its HoneyMaid counterpart. These are also very crunchy/crispy and therefore somewhat fragile.<br /><br />Still, these are qualified for all traditional graham cracker uses: light snacking, pie crust, S'mores, or (and this may not be traditional outside my family) slathering with royal icing when you need something sweet but don't have a lot of ingredients. Just note that these aren't always the most presentable graham crackers (if that's something you're looking for), as they break easily and you are basically guaranteed to get a couple shattered graham crackers per package.<br /><br />Somewhat disappointing fact: Back To Nature is a subsidiary of Kraft. Sigh.

review/text: Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers are an okay cracker. Nothing special, and far from the best graham cracker I've ever had.<br /><br />The box says there is a "hint of cinnamon". I couldn't really detect any cinnamon flavor, so it must be a pretty small hint. Cinnamon is the next to last ingredient on the label.<br /><br />Here's my real complaint. And this is something I've seen more and more often in foods that are labelled "natural" and "organic". The box says there is "No High Fructose Corn Syrup". That's a good thing. I'm diabetic, so I always check the ingredient list for sugar. And there is none listed on this box! Yay!<br /><br />But wait ... what's the second ingredient on the list? "Evaporated Cane Juice". Excuse me, but isn't that SUGAR???<br /><br />I think it's deceptive of the natural/organic food industry to disguise the fact that there is sugar in their products by calling it something else. Calling sugar "evaporated cane juice" is misleading, and it's wrong.<br /><br />I would have given the product three stars, but they lost one for that.

There's more of a crunch to them and you can see the dried pieces of oats on top.  They're slightly less sweet as the Honey Maid brand but overall very satisfying.

They have this really nice grainy flavor and they don't just turn to powder in your mouth.  We didn't like the honey flavor as much as the apple cinnamon but they were still excellent.  We'll definitely get more though we'll lean more towards the apple cinnamon.

review/text: i love graham crackers and these were just ok.<br />they were a little dense for me and really didn't have that "graham" taste like the normal ones you find in the store.<br /><br />they weren't horrible but they weren't my favorite.  i would buy them only if the store was completely out of normal graham crackers.<br /><br />i just didn't care for the dense feeling, the lack of "grahamy" taste and just the overall graham cracker feeling.

review/text: Since my kids have been very young, we have strived for healthy eating.  That includes whole grain breads, pastas and snacks.  This is a HUGE hit our family and I'm not surprised.  It's not something out of the ordinary for me to buy this.  My entire family was thrilled with the heartiness of this graham cracker.  It's not loaded with sugar sprinkled on it and the visible pieces of oats make it even look healthy.  Don't be fooled... they are simply sweet and addictive.  Be sure to keep a box in the car for the "after school or sports" snack time!<br /><br />When looking for a hearty snack that can sustain your children, this is a great choice.

review/text: These graham crackers may not be for everyone, especially the purists, but I liked them. I've been eating whole grain foods for several years now so I have gotten used to the heartier texture and flavor of whole grains. Most Back To Nature foods are quite good and these Golden Honey Oat Grahams are no exception. They're crispy, not too sweet, and have a lot of flavor. You really do taste the graham and oats. I'd give them five stars but for the price.

review/text: I anticipated "healthy cardboard," but was happily surprised.  The box contained 3 packages of crackers - to prevent stale or soggy crackers if not eaten immediately.  The crackers were tasty!  Not very sweet, but rather honey-nutty flavored (sugar content seemed low in comparison to other brands).  The texture was crisp and slightly crunchy. I could see the whole grains.  I enjoyed them with milk, as a cookie kind of snack.  However, I thought these crackers were a great compliment to cheeses. Great snack!

I enjoyed them as a snack and shared them with family members, who liked the taste as well. I kept the open packs in an airtight container and they remained fresh for quite a few weeks before I finished them all.<br /><br />So far I have not tried the other flavors from Back to Nature, but this one is great for a slightly sweet and healthy snack. Definitely recommended for anyone needing a better option to satisfy the occasional sweet tooth.

review/text: I was happy to find a graham cracker that was fairly healthy. But it doesn't matter what something is made with if you can't eat it. These were terrible... dry, tasteless, not even very sweet. Basically like eating a piece of crunchy cardboard. My preschooler took one happy, big bite and then looked at me in horror. I gave her permission to spit it out in the trash and then the whole box followed. Simply awful.

review/summary: Good for you but...
review/text: These Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers are certainly good for you. I haven't looked at another box of regular graham crackers but I'm sure that these are a better alternative to them. The serving size is 8 cracker and total intake of calories from those 8 are 110 calories. That's not bad at all when you consider a lot of snacks (even ones that claim to be low calorie or good for you) are smaller and pack as many or more calories than that.<br /><br />The one thing that disappointed me was the taste. It has a taste of a graham cracker but I don't think that it tastes as good as other, more fattening, graham crackers out there. It reminded me kind of a dry flavor and not as palatable. So these are a good diet snack but I don't know if I could eat them more then every once in awhile.

With a great graham, hint of honey flavor these are terrific as a bed for peanut or almond butter and delicious on their own.<br /><br />However, if you war looking for a natural graham cracker for a crust you will need to go by weight as these little guys are smaller than traditional graham crackers. Also since they pack real old-fashioned oatmeal simple crushing might not give you the results you want. But a food processor or blender should solve that problem.

review/text: These Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are the most tasty crackers we've ever found. I could have eaten the whole box on my own! The flavor was lighter than a traditional graham cracker- less honey/sugary flavor and more cinnamon. The fact these were made with natural ingredients and not fructose, corn syrups, etc. gives these crackers a huge edge over regular grahams.<br /><br />The only thing I can say I didn't care for was the fact these came fairly broken. I think shipping and handling mangled it too much. For this price, they really need to be packaged better so you aren't paying for crumbs.

review/summary: Healthier, But Not Necessarily Better
review/text: Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are a decent alternative to their traditional counterparts.  They have a few things going for them.  They provide a very light honey and cinnamon taste much like most standard graham crackers, and soak up milk quite well.  I have not had the opportunity to hold them to the fire (literally) to make s'mores, but I'm sure they would hold up just fine.<br /><br />Where I find them lacking is in the texture of the crackers.  They are stiff and nearly cardboard-like.  Eating them can turn into a task due to their coarseness.  While the oats sprinkled all over the cracker might look good to health conscious adults, they might prove to be a turn off for children.<br /><br />Overall, this is an average graham cracker that suffers from bad looks and texture.  If you're going on the Graham diet (look it up), these are right up your alley.  Adults will probably have no problems with eating these crackers, but I'd stick to the more traditional Honey Maid brand for children.

review/text: I, too, thought that Back to Nature made slight compromises with taste and texture in order to offer only healthy, whole grain ingredients in their Golden Honey Oat Grahams.  However, I didn't find the difference to be any greater than that between, perhaps, a brand-name and a generic "unhealthy" brand.  Obviously, it will depend on your and your family's tastes whether the less-sweet flavor and heavier, more-dry texture is an acceptable tradeoff in order to choose a healthier product.  I certainly felt it was close enough that I would let "more healthy" make the decision.

review/text: Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams were quite delicious.  They taste faintly of cinnamon and honey but have oats in them and are healthier than regular graham crackers.  They are crisp on the outside but soften while you are chewing, so that you get a good mouth feel and a slightly sweet but satisfying taste.  As one who is prone to eat through the entire box, I also liked the fact that they were packaged in a smaller box than regular graham crackers.  These are good by themselves, were surprisingly good with mild cheese (such as gouda or havarti), and would probably make killer s'mores!  (Healthy s'mores...what a concept!)  Oh, and the box is made from recycled cardboard too.<br /><br />I'll be looking for these in my local grocery store.

review/summary: good basic graham cracker
review/text: These graham crackers are quite good; they are made from wholesome ingredients, and they taste delicious.  They are very thin, almost wafer-like crackers made from whole wheat flour, rolled oats, and natural sweeteners, including honey.  They are relatively low-calorie, with 110 calories per serving, and they are a very good source of whole grains.  If you're not going to buy organic, this is a reasonable alternative, with natural ingredients and produced by a brand that uses recycled packaging and contributes money to the Nature Conservancy (although it is owned by Kraft).  I would have given them a 5 out of 5, but I've had the apple cinnamon graham crackers that Back To Nature also makes, and those are much, much better tasting.  I you are not a fan of apple cinnamon or are looking for the traditional honey graham cracker, definitely buy these.  Otherwise, I would have to recommend the apple cinnamon flavor over these.

What makes these graham crackers so good? Before I open the box I noticed the box was smaller but heavier than the competitors. The taste and texture of this product is what really stands out. These graham crackers have smooth rich well-balanced flavor. Mouth feel is a little heavier than a typical graham cracker but is not a distraction, mouth feel conveys more of a sense of richness. The flavor of oats is present and at first might be a distraction. One sampler of the product at first did not take to the oat flavor but eventually came around to favoring these graham crackers compared to the competition. All the graham crackers sample including these had no hyphenated oils. A+

The Honey flavor tastes like a regular Nabisco (or other brand) graham, but without the artificial ingredients found in those other brands. The box is a bit misleading because it says "no high fructose corn syrup." That's true when you check the ingredients. But it has "rice syryp" which is effectively the same as corn syrup. Nonethless it is a relatively healthy snack. As with other Back to Nature products it is an excellent alternative to other brands.

They traveled well in my purse for our daily park outing after school.  They are packaged just like your regular Honey Maid Graham crackers and if you tried passing them off to your kids as such, they'd be none the wiser.  Their are some small oatmeal flecks, but minimal.  They are slightly dry and crumble easily, but the taste is good.  If I were going to sit around and want a sweet snack, I would lean towards the Honey Maid crackers but these make great snacks during the day (and a slightly healthier option).  It all boils down to personal preference but if you are looking for less calories and higher fiber, try these.

review/text: These graham crackers are a great alternative to the highly processed grahams that we have had since we were kids. Though my husband was skeptical, we have been trying to gradually improve our choices at the grocery store, and this was yet another experiment. He actually loved them and ate nearly the whole box himself (over time of course!).<br /><br />The rest of the family liked them as well, though they did note a difference, and we actually prefer them. They are slightly "dryer" than the average honey graham, but taste just like them, only a bit more natural and ever so slightly less sweet. The oats are in the cracker yet they are not grainy or rough like some health food alternatives can be. However, they are not a health food by any means, they are still a snack food.<br /><br />These are tasty, as are many of the other Back to Nature products (we also LOVE their cookies) so I would certainly recommend them. Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent hearty graham cracker
review/text: I've loved graham crackers since I was a kid but many of the brands just aren't as good as they used to be.  Enter Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams.  They are crispy with a hearty, whole grain, nutty taste.  They are great with coffee or tea.  They are a bit crispier than your elf or other name brand graham cracker, so they don't always snap apart on the lines but they are very good.  They are a bit pricier as well (10 oz. for about $3 vs. 12-14 oz. for $2.50 - $3.00 for the other brands) but for me, I don't mind paying more for a better quality product.  These crackers have less calories, less fat and more fiber than your typical graham cracker too so what's not to love?

review/summary: Amazing re-interpretation of honey oat grahams
review/text: Upon biting into one of these, I was not only convinced that the product was a good as its less healthy alternative, but found it to be head and shoulders above it. The cracker is amazing and then there are these bits of oats on each of them that give it an extra kick. I will buy this product again and give it my highest recommendation

review/summary: More, please!
review/text: I really enjoyed these graham crackers a lot more than I ever remember liking graham crackers.<br /><br />For one thing, they are made with real graham flour, something that is generally lacking in most mass produced graham crackers.  I think the oats add even more to the wonderful graham texture.<br /><br />As far as sweetness, I am not a fan over overly sweet things, and this, to me, was just right, a touch on the sweet side; but still very tasty. I will never even bother with the regular "graham" crackers again!

review/text: The packaging looks like this should be healthy - its recyclable. However that does not mean that the contents don't also taste like cardboard! Thankfully the cracker tastes wholesome and even though a little crispier than regular Grahams is more flavorful with the honey more distinct. The oats are a welcome addition.<br />The real test is of course - the child test. Have no fear - my discerning 5 year old - wolfed most of the packet. What better endorsement do you want? And I know he's getting good nutrition as well.

review/summary: Not bad, but not great. Probably best for baking needs versus snacking
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying these healthier graham crackers, but in the end I was a bit disappointed with the Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams. As a snack, these graham crackers had a bit of a cardboard texture to them; the flavor was pretty good, but a little understated on the honey. Ultimately, I was not drawn to them as a healthier snack.<br /><br />Where I did end up using them with better success was in recipes that called for graham crackers... they worked very well in my peanut butter balls. I think they would work pretty well as a graham cracker pie crust as well.

review/summary: Good Graham Crackers with a Touch of Oats and Honey
review/text: My immediate family (my wife, my daughter, my son, and myself) all love Graham crackers so I was eager to give these new "Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams" a try. I'm not crazy about the bland packaging that looks like 90 percent of the boxes in the organic foods section of my grocery store, but you shouldn't judge a food by the box it comes in.<br /><br />The Grahams themselves look pretty much the same as any Graham cracker you've bought before. The only obvious difference to me is the fact that these crackers have bits of oats sticking out and feel a little drier to the touch than the Graham crackers we usually purchase at the store.<br /><br />You can certainly taste the oats and honey in these Grahams compared to typical Graham crackers. It's almost as if you took a regular Graham cracker, sprayed it with a mist of honey and sprinkled oatmeal on them. Overall, I like these a lot and would recommend them as a change of pace compared to regular Graham crackers.

review/summary: tasty AND whole grain!
review/text: I am very impressed by these.  I'm one of those that actually likes most whole grain products, appreciating the slightly drier crispy texture of many of these products, and this is no exception.  I think the flavor is better than the typical store brought graham cracker, and the texture is really nice, crisp but not cardboard dry.  They contain whole grain wheat as well as rolled oats.  Two full cracker sheets is only 110 calories, making this a good choice for dieters.  They have no artificial preservatives, flavors, coloring or high fructose corn syrup, and the box is made with recycled paper! An excellent product.

review/summary: Subtle honey flavor & chewy oatiness = best of the pack
review/text: Back to Nature Honey Oat Graham Crackers are perhaps the best tasting of all the "natural" grahams I have tried.  There is a subtle natural honey flavor and a slight oaty chewiness to each bite with no strange aftertaste.  The flavor profile is further enhanced by an ever so slight hint of cinnamon.<br /><br />The texture is crisp and not cardboardy like some of the other natural brands and is best suited for out-of-hand eating, rather than pie crust making or conversion to cereal/dunking as it lacks the structural grittiness of regular grahams. [See photo above]<br /><br />Overall a very pleasant and enjoyable surprise and one I will be definitely buying again.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

review/text: Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.

review/summary: Great for snacking or for a small meal!!!
review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.

They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/summary: Mildly Spicy
review/text: I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.

review/summary: BEST SNACK EVER
review/text: They are tasty, well flavored, always premium cuts, nothing tasted substandard.  On top of that high protein and low calorie! Only problem - everybody else thinks the same thing and its hard for Jack Links to keep them in stock.  You may have to wait a few extra days for the specialty orders.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love this product! Tasty and soft (but not too soft). Very good flavor and it's safe to say, I can't "eat just one!" If you like the jerky, but not the dried up, tough stuff...you might want to give this stuff a try!

review/summary: Much better than beef
review/text: These are really good. Not hard to chew like some other beef nuggets, and they don't dry out so much.<br /><br />They only downside is that the bag stays very moist inside, so it can be a little messy. If you try to eat a bag while on the drive home you have grease all over your steering wheel.....

review/summary: Awesome "Hot Wing" supplement
review/text: Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!

review/summary: Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets
review/text: I actually really love the Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets, however the 4 pack I received seemed to be old.  They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.  Makes you wonder why that would be. These were tough and much drier then I expected. I have to say I will not order them again through the mail. If they had been fresher I would have rated them as I love them because I really do.

review/summary: Dry, overly chewy and bland
review/text: Don't buy these from Amazon Warehouse like I did...total waste of money for these dry hunks of blandness.  I wouldn't know what they are like fresh, it wasn't sold to me that way...but at least my dog had dog chews.  Not sure why Amazon insists on selling worthless food rather than throw it away and risk ticking off customers and/or poisoning them.  I know they are closer to the expiration date buying it through the warehouse but seriously...THROW BAD FOOD AWAY AMAZON!  Sheesh.

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)

review/summary: Tasty jerky
review/text: I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.
