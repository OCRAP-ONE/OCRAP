review/summary: Amy & Brian's Coconut Water - Amazon Purchase
review/text: Due to the economy & my resulting waning budget, I have tried to give up my monthly shipments of Amy & Brian's Coconut water.....impossible!  Particularly in the summer when I'm working to exhaustion all weekend long in heat & humidity. Wouldn't be without this particular coconut water.

review/summary: Man! I love this stuff
review/text: Man! I love this stuff. This is some of the Best Coconut Juice out there! I have it on monthly delivery with Amazon so I always have some on hand. Great after a run or on a hot day. I've got a cold right now and I'm using it to stay hydrated. It may take some folks a little getting used to, when I started on the Coconut water kick, I used to mix it with pineapple juice, but after awhile I switched to the straight stuff. YUM!

review/text: I love this stuff. I'm practically addicted! I use the monthly delivery option and usually order an extra case half way through. It's great for hydration and a sweet treat after a long bike ride or even with a little white rum and pineapple after a long day. It's just soooo good. Try putting some in your rice cooker instead of water, just use a few tablespoons extra... DELICIOUS!!!

review/summary: The closest to drinking straight out of a coconut
review/text: Back in India, I used to drink fresh out of a coconut. I've tried lots of varieties of canned coconut juice here, but none come as close to the real thing as this one. I go through about 2-3 cans during a 3 hour table-tennis (not basement ping-pong) practice. Revitalizes, energizes and replenishes you without any additives. I prefer the unsweetened no-pulp over the pulp version.<br /><br />Amazon's subscribe and save helps keep it inexpensive.

review/summary: No sugar added - just what it says it is
review/text: Doesn't really taste like coconut - It may be no use to write this description for folks who do not like coconut flavor, as I'm sure they won't likely be shopping for anything with "coconut" in the title, but there you have it - doesn't really taste like coconut.<br /><br />Fact is, Amy & Brian Natural Coconut Juice Pulp Free has exceedingly little flavor at all, and what flavor there is rides down your throat as a vaguely fresh fruit/fresh vegetation flavor, decidedly not sweet, not tart - just mild, easy to gulp refreshment.<br /><br />As to the promised effects - yes, this will hydrate you quite quickly, restore a sense of energy, and make it easier to face work outdoors in the heat.  More importantly, no crash like sugary sweet drinks.  It also has staved off leg cramps for me - just as well as, if not better than scarfing down bananas - take a note of the potassium content on this one.<br /><br />As to other brands, you've got the ones with sugar, or even worse, HFC.  They of course taste sweeter, and usually have coconut bits in them.  Shop ethnic groceries and enjoy, but do note the sugar.  As to the more readily available non-sugared ones (Zico, O.N.E., etc)  I just think Amy & Brian taste a bit better as Amy & Brian does not have the funny aftertaste that I've detected in those cardboard carton brands.  (problem with the packaging??)<br /><br />To sum up - a hot weather staple in our house.  Beats gatorade every time.

review/text: I was initially a little skeptical about trying coconut water out of a can. But Amy & Brian coconut water doesn't taste like it has been canned!! It is fresh and refreshing without the yucky aftertaste that comes with other coconut waters like One or Vita or Zico.  And there are no additives like the other brands! All in all a win-win product! You can also find this in your local Whole Food stores (especially on sale on Saturday Mornings before 11 am), but with Subscribe and Save you get it about 4 dollars cheaper. I have no complaints.

I've tried a couple of different brands and this definitely tastes the closest to the real thing. The cans are large enough that I can drink half, then store the rest for later.

review/summary: Coconut water is awesome
review/text: I bought and taste-tested all the major brands available at Whole Foods...some contained a lot more sugar than others, some had vitamin C added. Overall this brand was the best value. I also bought some from an Asian store but all the brands there contained preservatives which gave them a horrible flavor.<br /><br />Being a natural product there is of course some variation in taste between batches. However I've found this to be true when getting fresh water straight out of coconuts too - some is sweeter, some isn't very good, etc. (All packaged coconut water I've found is pasteurized btw).<br /><br />In the summer I drink coconut water every day - tastier than water plus has vitamins/minerals/electrolytes, and a lot healthier than Gatorade at a similar price point. I've settled on this brand since it's the most affordable.

The use of Thai coconuts, which tend to be naturally sweeter, opposed to the Brazilian variety is what separates them from some of their other competitors. Will purchase again even though it's bit pricey.

review/text: We are now getting the Amy & Brian Natual Coconut Juice Pulp Free and also the With Pulp 17.5 oz on subscription. I had read the reviews about the dented cans caused from shipping but ordered anyways. My husband is a semi truck driver & inspected the orders we got. He says the dents in the cans that we got are not from shipping, but commonly happen because the contents are required to be pasteurized when bottled (canned) and the sucked-in part of the can occurs when the can is sealed before the contents have completely cooled. We have received 3 different shipments and some of the cans (most) have some of these dents. Dents caused from this suction action do not cause harm to the inner lining so it is safe to drink.

review/text: I find this juice very light, much like water but with a pleasant and not too sweet flavor. Great before or after exercise. I once drank it as a headache threatened -- the headache went away, maybe due to the potassium? Anyhow, I got a case and I'm glad I did.

review/summary: Great Product.....poor package protection!
review/text: I think this is a great product considering all the garbage out there today! The only issue I have is that the provider does not protect the cans well at all for shipment. Last shipment that arrived all but a few cans were severely banged up and dented.  To further update this product, price has risen due to high demand. Worst of all, they still send it in poorly thought out packaging, which provides me with damaged product all too often!  Still, this version of coconut juice seems to provide the best tasting of all varieties out there.

review/summary: No comparison with fresh coconut juice.
review/text: I thought this might be a good alternative to buying fresh coconuts every week and having to hack into them to get the juice out. Unfortunately, while fresh coconut juice tastes great, this canned stuff has kind of a nasty flavor in it.<br /><br />I will say that it's a better alternative than the many sweetened, watered down cans of coconut juice, but that's the only thing it has going for it.<br /><br />I may try one other brand to see if I can find one that tastes more like fresh coconut juice, but otherwise I'm sticking to the real thing.

review/text: I love VitaCoco and ONE coconut water (especial Vita Coco's pomeg. and acai one...tastes like a less sugary sprite with a hint of berry).<br /><br />This stuff was TERRIBLE.  Each 8 oz. has 31 calories more (so altogether this can has over 150 calories where vitacoco has 90.  WAY too sweet, tastes as if it were stale, unnatural, but it claims it is just coconut water and that alone.<br /><br />I don't know...maybe healthwise it was worth it cause i got it at $13.50 per case with all the coupons and rebates that were out, but if it weren't for it being 50% off of the last sale price i got vitacoco for then I would never have bought it...much less 8 cases :(

review/summary: Unnaturally sweet
review/text: I purchased the 10 oz size of this product: "Amy & Brian Natural Coconut Juice Pulp Free" (I also tried the pulp version, too.)  I found this to be unnaturally sweet. (I have tried many different coconut waters; both packaged and fresh from the coconut.) The product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water I have tried. Given these two things, I'm thinking it's likely this product is boiled, or otherwise condensed.  This may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages, but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut, this is not it.

review/summary: The Tonic for the Perfect G&T
review/text: Fever-Tree Naturally Light Tonic is a great mixer that won't overpower the taste of your favorite alcohol.  I never really liked the taste of diet tonic water.  I also didn't like the fact that diet tonic water is sweetened with artificial sweeteners.  Regular tonic water has a taste that masks the alcohol and it contains too much sugar. This Fever-Tree tonic has less than half the sugar of regular tonics.  My perfect gin & tonic has 1.5 oz of my favorite gin and 1/2 bottle of Fever-Tree Naturally Light Tonic Water over ice, which ends up being only 4.8 grams of sugar.  If you think this tonic is too expensive, remember what it costs for a good bottle of wine.  If you want a great cocktail, this tonic is worth the price.

review/summary: Incredible - Who Ever Knew
review/text: Never in a million years would I imagine tonic water could possibly taste this darn good. Seriously, this stuff is absolutely the best.<br /><br />I saw this recommended in some bar books, why in the world would anybody specify Fever Tree Tonic Water? That's just crazy. Schweppes works just fine, thank you very much. Oh no, one taste of Fever Tree and my days of drinking a regular old Gin and Tonic are over forever. I'll never order one again at a bar unless they have this nectar of the gods.<br /><br />Now the amazing thing, each bottle has 40 calories. Yes you read that right, 40 calories. And guess what I don't miss at all? That's exactly right, all that darn sweetener.<br /><br />Fever Tree's mantra you spend a lot of money on fine alcohol to only mix it with crummy ingredients. That sounded like good marketing hype, shame me into spending more money on my tonic water. Wow are they ever right.<br /><br />This is a clean, lightly sweet flavor. There is a hint of bitterness of the quinine, just exactly the right amount. The fact that it says Light in the name made me hesitate, why do I want a diet drink with my Gin? Hey, I'm getting happy with Gin, why do I care about calories. Oh no this is full flavored and just right. No artificial sweetener flavor.<br /><br />The sweetener is apparently fruit sugar - fructose. Now that's significantly different from high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). In theory, people who are sensitive to HFCS will not have a problem with this drink. The sensitivity is from the byproducts of making HFCS from corn. Since corn isn't involved and the process is different, this is simply pure fructose, something that is good for you.<br /><br />The perfect Gin and Tonic - fresh ice in a tall glass, one ounce of your favorite Gin (I happen to love Plymouth Gin right now), a small wedge of lime squeezed over the ice, pour in one bottle of Fever Tree tonic water. Enjoy. Whatever Gin you use, the Gin flavor will come out fresh and clean.<br /><br />There is a big downside to this stuff; your Gin budget will have to get larger. You can't just mix this with Fleishmann's or Smirnoff or random bathtub Gin.

review/summary: Best tonic, period.
review/text: I had been looking for a "light" tonic water forever - regular tonic is often syrupy and oversweetened and diet has that terrible aspartame aftertaste. This is almost perfect - the right balance of sweet and bitter that pairs with my favorite gin. Sure, Q-tonic has slightly fewer calories (10 per bottle), but it is undercarbonated and flavorless, resulting in a very expensive gin & (slightly carbonated) soda. My only problem with fever tree light is how hard it is to find. My local Bevmo carried it for 3 months, then abruptly decided to pull it from the shelves. Thankfully it's available online - the premium price and shipping are worth it.

review/summary: Pricey, but worth it for special occasions (or special people)
review/text: I did purchase this product from amazon.com, but I have to be honest and admit that I hate gin and hate quinine, and have never tasted it!  However, my husband and a couple of his friends are "connoisseurs" and LOVE it - but they only go to the effort of writing a review if it's for a product they absolutely HATE.  We all like the idea that this mixer  is "light," but does not use artificial sweeteners.  One of the grocery stores in our area still sells the small Schweppes or Canada Dry smaller glass bottles; and I usually buy those in the "diet" version for him.  They definitely do NOT measure up to this stuff, but at least they are  more practical than the large plastic bottles.  In my humble opinion, the plastic carbonated beverage bottles start to lose their fizz even before they are opened - and they really go flat fast after they HAVE been opened!  These little 6.8 oz. bottles are just right for one person having a before-dinner drink; in fact, my husband likes it so much, he has occasionally just drunk it with ice in the summer, without the gin.

review/text: I am currently cooking my way through Richard Olney's cookbooks -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0020100604">Simple French Food</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1607740028">The French Menu Cookbook: The Food and Wine of France--Season by Delicious Season--in Beautifully Composed Menus for American Dining and Entertaining by an American Living in Paris...</a>, and<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0067575986">Provence: the Beautiful Cookbook</a>, et al. --after reading his biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883283434">REFLEXIONS</a> and also learning that he, along with Elizabeth David's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1908117052">FRENCH COUNTRY COOKING</a> and Roy Andries de Groot's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0880015047">Auberge Of The Flowering Hearth</a> were the books that most influenced Alice Waters of Chez Panisse fame as she cooked her way through them and taught herself to cook after being inspired by a visit to France during her student days.<br /><br />Olney stresses that he only used sea salt from Guerande, one coarse, and one fine, and that no other thing would make so much difference to one's cooking as the salt one used. Olney said:<br /><br />"My kitchen contains no fine salt. I use two coarse sea salts,&#8232;one grey, the other 'refined' (white). The grey salt has the&#8232;finest flavor but it holds too much moisture to be used in a salt grinder and it throws quite a heavy scum, harmless but unattractive, when added to boiling water.  The white&#8232;salt is reserved for anything that requires seasoning with&#8232;finely ground salt, for boiling vegetables and for use at&#8232;the table."<br /><br />So I tried it, and it's true.  It has the flavor of the sea and makes food come alive just a little more than other salts.<br /><br />Olney also had a unique blend for his pepper grinder as follows if you want to give it a try:  approximately 5 parts black pepper, 3 parts white pepper, 1 part allspice.  Because the size of allspice berries are uneven, Olney coarsely broke them up in a mortar to match the size of the peppercorns before adding to the mixture (add all together and stir in a bowl to distribute evenly, then fill pepper grinder).<br /><br />Olney also stated that cooked in a liquid (such as in soup), pepper turns bitter and loses the aromatic qualities its prized for.  Olney never used pepper in soups, stews, stocks, sauces, or in gratins that begin in a liquid.  He did, however, always use it for stuffings, terrines, sausages, pates, seasoning the interiors of meats, and for roasting and grilling.<br /><br />He also kept the pepper grinder, along with the fine salt from Geurande, at his table and encouraged its use.

review/summary: Didn't Work Out
review/text: I was quite excited to try Wellness Complete for my 7 year old cat after much research into the "best" food.  Sammy had been on Science Diet since he was a kitten.  I bought into the gluten and corn issue that has been discussed so thoroughly on here and decided to move over to Wellness.  When the food arrived, I began mixing it in with his remaining Science Diet and eventually got him over to a full diet of Wellness.  Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, Sammy became lethargic and was peeing all over the house.  I took him to the vet and they exctracted a urine sample and found it loaded with Struvites.  The Doc suggested 30 days of straight Science Diet Bladder Control food, followed by a permanent regimen of adult formula regular diet.  He indicated that the change in diet upset the cats chemistry enough that the change in behavior and crystal formation were likely the result.  His advice seems to have worked.  Sammy is back to his regular self and uses his box normally now.  I donated about 20 pounds of leftover Wellness to the ARL so it wouldn't be wasted.  I'm disappointed that it didn't work out.

The magnesium level is guaranteed at not more than 0.098%, which is not the absolutely lowest, but is still lower than many other brands. So many great ingrediants in here. It even has probiotics like acidophilus which is important for the digestive tract.<br />UPDATE: My cats will eat this food, but when placed side by side to blue buffalo, they seem to prefer the blue buffalo.

review/summary: yummiest of the gummies!
review/text: I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on....

review/summary: Two flavors, actually.
review/text: There are two apple flavors in the bag, as shown by the red/green v white/green candies.  The red/green is a bit less tart than the white/green, with an excellent apple flavor.  Neither of the candies tastes like the generic "sour apple" flavor used in most cheap candies.  In short, there are no other candies with this apple flavoring out there, making this a must buy.

review/text: I've ordered several Haribo products from Amazon. The first was a 5 pound bag of gummi peaches, which were excellent. I didn't think they could be beat. I saw these shortly after the bag of peaches was finished and had to give them a try. Although they are not quite as good as the peaches, they still have a very unique apple flavor, like nothing you've ever tasted before. I would highly recommend these apple gummi candies if you like the haribo gummi peaches or similar items.

review/text: I never purchase huge bags of candy like this but I love all things apple. Plus, there was an extra 25% off Haribo sale so I went for it and purchased this and the peach :). I like the peach a little better, but both are good.<br /><br />A good tip that I read on the reviews here, was to keep them fresh in a ziploc bag or tupperware. I plan on splitting the bag with friends because it is definitely as much candy as 5 lbs sounds like - A LOT!<br /><br />The gummy is chewy, fresh (as much as candy can be), not too sweet, and basically just a perfect bite or two of yummy goodness to satisfy your sweet tooth. I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Yuck! I threw out the whole 5 lbs.
review/text: First off these "gummi" apples don't have the gummi consistancy that haribo's other gummi candies have. They were so soft that they were like eating gum drops instead of a gummi product. I know what you are thinking, they were probably just really really fresh. No that wasn't it. I have purchased (and enjoyed) the haribo gummi sour cherries and they were very fresh when I received them but they still had the gummi texture that I was looking for. I had someone else try the candy just to see if they agreed with me and they said the same thing I do, that these aren't anything like gummies. I don't know... maybe I got a bag from some weird mutant batch and maybe they aren't always like this. Who knows.<br /><br />The second thing is that the flavor is a bizarre apple-ish flavor that was not enjoyable in the least. It had kind of a chemical taste to it.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend this product. Try the sour cherry, it is much, much better.

review/summary: Very pleased!
review/text: I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word "jaw-breaker" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch.

review/summary: A blast of taste for your steaks, burgers, or any type of meat actually
review/text: Well..this is the third time I've tried to review this, so lets cross some fingers...and actually 'copy' this before I hit send this time..heh.<br /><br />I've been using this product for probably a good 8 years now. Slowly improving on my marinade for my steaks as I get older. My steaks have gone from "hey I'm young lets throw all kinds of stuff and also beer on it" to "people roll their eyes back in ecstasy when they eat my steaks"...with some help from this seasoning (as well as some other ingredients).<br /><br />I've used this on burgers, and even in my spaghetti sometimes. All in all, it's just a great blend of spices to quickly throw in some marinade or just throw on the meat while it's being cooked.<br /><br />I never thought I would actually review this, but right now I'm in Iraq, and we grill up some steaks once a week. The BX/PX sells frozen steaks and charcoal and we found an old barrel grill out back our work compound. We use sauces from the chow hall for seasoning. But I was fiending for more of a little kick, so I thought..hmmm..maybe Amazon has some McCormicks. Well what do you know...they do. You gotta love Amazon sometimes..lol. So I ordered it and it got here to Iraq in a week. Used it once already (as well as about 6 other people) for steaks AND burgers.<br /><br />Yummmmmmmmmy.

review/summary: Montreal Steak Seasoning
review/text: I've been using this product for years now.  I use it in all kinds of foods and it really is out of this world good, but you really need to be mindful of the amount of salt in it, as I've used it in sauces and it was way too salty.  In the much smaller containers they have 40% reduced salt versions, which is what I use in my sauces now.  I just wish the reduced salt variety came in a 28 ounce container - I seem to go through a lot of this seasoning, because I use it very often.  Wonderful product, though. It's kind of my secret ingredient - couldn't cook without it!

The cost of the items was a total ripoff for money reasons and i got them on sale!<br /><br />The cheese is ok but it is like those cheap cheese slices you buy from non brand name stuff.<br />The pretzels hell we all know we can get those super cheap!<br />The meat well is was mild as in taste not hotness. I tasted these and felt like i got ripped off. I wanted to try something new and this was a dud for the sale price i got it at.<br /><br />The last point is there is not much of the product really for the money to. It sure looks like alot at first glance but that is cause half the package is hollow and nothing in it. This felt like smoke and mirrors. I recommend this to people that find them dirt cheap and on a budget type product. If you want to spend more money on better names look somewhere else this this product here. It was fine tasting just not even close to being worth the cost i paid even when it was on sale..<br /><br />I never tried there other products but after this product i will never bother trying another product from them.

Because they were so unappealing, I didn't really burn through them and, after a few months, they really started to look even worse, and that was with keeping them stored in a very stable, dark environment (desk drawer in a climate controlled area).<br /><br />So, I think you could do better to buy better quality versions of these items; but if you really want the convenience of having them packed together like this, and can get around the low quality, they are probably okay for you if you don't try to keep them too long or in a hot car etc.

review/summary: Tasty but pricy
review/text: I bought these for my boys thinking they would like them over Christmas vacation.  Boy was I right!  It was the favorite snack until they were gone.  Sometimes a little oil would accumulate in the cheese compartment, but they boys didn't mention it.  I do think they are a little on the pricy side.  It would be nice to get a price break when you buy them in larger quantities.  So that will probably keep me from buying them again, but they did taste good.
