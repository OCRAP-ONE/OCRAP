review/text: The best brownies I ever tasted.Initially brought in by my sister and after few bites; got to have recipe and where are these from.I will only eat these brownies and so easy to make. Follow instruction in the box and you'll be hooked. Used to buy in Costco but no longer so good to know amazon has this value package. Worth every penny..Need I say more?

review/summary: Best brownies out there
review/text: I don't know what it is about these brownies, but they are famous around my office and in my circle of friends.  The best part is I follow the directions to the T, and everyone always asks what kind they are and what I did to make them taste so good.  People think they are homemade.<br /><br />At 350 degrees, cooking them for 24-26 minutes is the best as they turn out super moist.  I forgot what brand I used one time and bought something else, and that was just sub par compared to these.<br /><br />The only thing I do that isn't in the directions is take a stick of butter and lightly grease the pan before I pour the batter in as that makes them easy to remove.<br /><br />Hot or cold, hands down these are the best.

review/summary: Betty Crocker Fudge Brownies, Family Size, Pack of 12
review/text: My family and I have baked and eaten these great fudgy brownies for many years. Everyone has a different taste and I have not found anyone who dis-liked these brownies.<br />When these brownies are baking in the oven, a delicious aroma just fills the house<br />and everyone drools--even the dog.  Just kidding.<br />Since this is a 12-pack, why not give a box to a neighbor or a friend?

review/summary: cost twice as much as my local grocery store
review/text: My shipment arrived and they don't have the Hersey's label on the front, but they still taste the same.......which is to say they are unbelievably great!!!! They cost 1/2 price here on Amazon subscribe and save. I will always have these on hand. In fact we bring these brownies (in a disposable aluminum pan) to every carry-in event that we are invited to. Just cut them into squares before you go, or if you are rushed.....let them cool on the drive and just bring a plastic knife with you. My brownies are always the first to go, and there is no clean up/no pan or utensils to remember to bring home.<br /><br />Also, my 3yo LOVES to make them. It is one of her favorite activities to do, she gets so excited when she sees the box. We put a little apron on her and give her a spatula and she thinks she is cooking. These brownies are so freakin good and so easy to make. I don't even use the beater. Just add the 3 ingredients together, have fun stirring the mix up (it's ok if there are a few lumps), pour it all into a sprayed pan and viola! 30 mins later everybody is happy :)<br /><br />I am giving away all my secrets here. But seriously, if you have the room to store 12 mixes, this is a great deal!

Wish I had to use my own milk, as I sometimes like to use water over milk, especially when I'm sick and milk is not good to have when you're sick.  The only other complaint is that the bag is difficult to use. A can would be much more user-friendly.

review/summary: Tea Experience That is Zen-Like, Relaxing
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint". The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Great herbal tea
review/text: I grew up on lipton black tea, brewed for hours, no sugar, no lemon... as Dad would say, "it'll put hair on your chest".  This (and the other Teavana products that I've tried) are certainly no Lipton.  The strawberry lemonade is great as an iced tea, although the fruit expands quite a bit, so you may want to split the dried product into two tea balls (I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RIZ7">Stainless Steel Mesh Tea Ball</a>x2), for a 2qt pitcher.  It also pairs well with oolong, roobios or green tea... friends have tried it with black and white teas, but I'm not a fan. You can definitely taste the different fruit flavors, and the rosehips give a nice scent but it doesn't taste like you're chewing on flowers.  Happy drinking!

review/summary: Convenient Size for Owners with One Cat
review/text: I normally purchase Purina Healthful Cat Food in the larger 6lb bags. I saw these small bags on Amazon and ordered some. They're a little pricier than buying the bigger bags, but way more convenient. Especially if you only have one cat. My fussy cat, Sophie, loves this brand, yet we only go through about 6lbs of cat food a month. These small bags are in a sturdy zip-fresh bag that stands up on your counter. When you open one, you know the cat food is very fresh. I like the durable plastic bags. They're probably more "pest resistant" which can be a big problem with cat food. They're much easier for people like me with arthritis to pick up and pour. They'd probably be great for senior citizens to use. The bags pour real easy into Sophie's bowl with no spillage. I usually spill a bunch of food over the floor when I pour from the larger bags.<br /><br />They probably wouldn't be the best deal for people with multiple cats, but I'd highly recommend them for one or two cat owners or people with disabilities.<br /><br />I'm going to continuing ordering them from Amazon. Amazon shipped them really quick and they were in a big sealed plastic bag inside the box. The packing was excellent and they arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />For me, some things are worth paying a little extra for and this is one of them.

review/summary: Contains Citric Acid
review/text: I usually buy the plum organics pouch foods as I love the organic and simple ingredients.  I bought this one day expecting the same only to read the label when I got home to find that it contains Citric Acid.  This is bad for children's teeth and ultimately digestive system so if you feed this to your baby daily you might want to reduce.

review/summary: Amazing, my daughters favorite
review/text: I completely disagree with the previous review. This food is a perfect consistency for a "Training Meal" as its labeled. I starting feeding this to my daughter at 8 months and she has never had an issue. She is a great eater and has loved a variety of foods, but this is her hands down favorite. She will eat the entire pouch without a bit of prodding. I have have fed her dozens of these pouches and I have never seen a lump even as big as a Cheerio. Its a great quality food.

review/summary: Good quality and taste, but use caution
review/text: The quality and taste of this product are excellent!  However, use caution when you feed your baby (which goes without saying).  This is labeled as a "starter" meal, but for some babies it may actually take some sophistication to tell the difference between regular pureed food and slightly lumpy food (like this) that needs more chewing.  My 11-month old baby is good with finger foods, so I was looking for something intermediate to give him to add some texture and variety.  A few bites into this food, he gagged on the lumps and threw up everywhere!  This product is smooth enough to fool a baby into thinking it's like regular baby food, but just lumpy enough to catch in the throat.  I may try this food again in the future, and I'll try the smooth versions of the brand because I like the quality, but some babies may need more practice before eating the "starter meal" type.

review/summary: This gum fights off h. pylori.
review/text: I had a raging case of h.pylori. H. Pylori is a bacterial infection in the gut. I had tried the mastic gum capsules, but had no luck with those. I ordered this gum and began to chew it. The whole problem which I had been suffering from for months was gone in a few hours.  This product is absolutely amazing.  Don't buy the other kinds that have sugar or sugar substitutes.  This is the real deal right here, sans additives. When you chew it, it gets into your whole digestive system somehow. The capsules don't work because the gum needs to get mixed with saliva and coat your whole digestive tract. I like to chew it a bit and then let it dry out on a plate because it is really gooey and sticks to your teeth at first.

review/summary: I'm a bit of a caffeine addict.
review/text: I've had over 1,000 energy drink varieties, and i'm always looking for a good bargain. 30 days of energy for about $6? Sign me up!<br /><br />Well, it's sorta more like 15. If you have long days like I do you'll definitely need to dose at least twice throughout the day, maybe 3. I got this 2 weeks ago and i'm nearing the end of my supply. Still a good deal though.<br /><br />I've tried searching the internet and I can't find any information on what the caffeine content per spray is. A competitor has 33mg/spray, so i'm going to assume it is around there. It also has -<br /><br />665% DV Niacin<br />337% DV B6<br />2333% DV B12<br /><br />and along with caffeine, it's got some "normal" stuff like green tea extract, citric acid, and cinnamon bark, then some oddities like gingko biloba (good for memory), bee pollen, astragalus (ancient chinese medicine used for it's anti aging properties) and some other stuff i've never heard of. Let me get to how it works:<br /><br />- You spray 3-4 sprays under your tongue and hold it for 30 seconds. Kinda awkward, and it tastes like medicine of course. It's over quickly enough though.<br /><br />- It does kick in very fast. By the time you swallow it you'll feel something.<br /><br />- The energy is gone within 2 hours. No crash that I noticed, though your mileage may vary.<br /><br />All in all, it is a good deal of caffeine for your buck. It's the price of two energy drinks and should last you 2-3 weeks. I'll buy again.

review/summary: Value Box?
review/text: Oh well. I thought that "Value-Box" meant real, bulk value, as it usually does here. But 36 tiny little bags x 1.5 ounces = 54 ounces, which = 3.375 pounds. If I buy a pound of pretzels at the store for about $4.00 (the high-end), a bit over 3 pounds of pretzels (even Snyders) don't cost over $26.00! I could've bought over 6 pounds of pretzels at this price, at least 96 ounces. Snyders comes in 18oz bags for less than $4.00 at the store! In my rush to order treats, I thought that "Value-Box" meant the bags were 8oz each - my error. These mini-servings of delicious Snyders pretzels may feed a few mice for a little while, but not my barbarian hoard. The following selections are a much better value, if you do your own "portion control" and don't want to pay for extra packaging: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V394">Snyder's of Hanover Hard Sourdough Hard Pretzels, 13.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NNDDTU">Snyder's of Hanover Honey Mustard & Onion Pretzel Pieces, 12-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012DM8ZY">Snyder's of Hanover Olde Tyme Pretzels, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Who doesn't love these things?
review/text: In 2006 a local grocery outlet-type store had purchased some candy from a large conglomerate, I'm sure, and in that batch was two cases of Choco Baby.  My daughter went nuts over the candy.  I didn't really get the whole concept of what made Choco Baby fun at first, but slowly I was drawn to the Brown Side.  I began to look for the ones with stars, and I loved when she shared them with me.<br /><br />As is the way of life, all good things either come to an end or they change, like the one lipstick that you love but is changed.  You know that lipstick... it's awesome when it first comes out, but after a year or two the make-up company begins to screw with the recipe... putting more wax into it... less sparkly metal goodness.  [L'Oreal Sandstone, #383, I'm talking to you.  You look nothing like you did in 1987.  What's up whid'dat?  Liar!  Deceiver!]  So, our beloved outlet store ran out of Choco Baby.  My daughter was crushed the first time that we found none on the shelves.<br /><br />When I learned that Amazon.com carried Choco Baby I was elated!  Today she gets some of this in her stocking for Christmas, and every once in awhile I buy it for her for her as a surprise.  This candy never, ever, ceases to bring a smile to her face.  I love that, because she will be thirty someday and I know that this candy will still make her smile.  This will be one of her childhood memories.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Choco Baby, it's basically guinea pig pellet-shaped pieces of blandly flavored chocolate.  It's like human pellet treat.  If it was made by Nutro or Friskies it would be labeled "Human Treat Pellets -- Chocolate-Flavored".  Some of the pellets have little stars on the ends of them.  The stuff tastes pretty good.  It's not Sno Caps or anything (my favorite chocolate of all time), but it's good.  It has a fun name.  It's Asian.  Whatever.<br /><br />Buy some.

You can purchase the same-sized package of these at a brick-and-mortar grocery store for $3-4 with sales tax.

So I loved the Chips but Hated The shipping of a Fragile as Eggs food product. Guess I'll wait for them to come to the local store.:(

review/summary: Best Chip Ever!
review/text: These are one of the best tangy tart chips we have tried. Other dill pickle flavored brands do not compare. Most other brands have too much vinegar & salt. Not these. The dill flavor is awesome. And they do not leave the mouth so raw after just a few like other brands do. When you can not get them in your region paying the price here is worth it to some. But be patient like we did. It took about 6 months and now they are available to us locally for about 5 with tax. But then ask yourself how much gas it cost to go get them? So I think the price fair if you are only going shopping for these chips just order them, save the trouble, and have them delivered.

review/text: I recently re-read of how good sardines are for people, in "EAT THIS, NOT THAT, BEST AND WORST FOODS IN AMERICA" Edition.  Believe it or not, SARDINES were listed amongst "the best foods you've never heard of" (!)  I'll admit most of the other foods listed ARE somewhat new to me....but SARDINES?  I've been eating them since I can remember!  They are NOT a "strange new food" to me -- and, I hazard to guess, to most people in the western,(and pronbably also the eastern), world!<br /><br />EAT THIS, NOT THAT, author David Zinzenco mentions that "Crown Prince" is the bargain brand of sardines, and -- always on the outlook<br />for a bargain, I decided to get some Crown Prince sardines.  This particular variety, 'CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES IN OIL/ NO SALT ADDED", caught my eye, because I've been eating a LOT of processed foods from the supermarket lately....most of them with a lot of salt.<br />After eating far too much, I could feel my heart going, "pitter-patter, pitter-patter", far too fast!  As there were no pictures of<br />my favourite movie or TV stars around, I knew this was a danger-sign I had eaten too much salt!<br /><br />These sardines are packed in SOYBEAN oil -- not the olive oil recommended by Mr. Zinzenco.  They are tasty little morsels, and I, at least, don't notice any flavour gone because there is no added salt. (There IS salt -- sodium -- in these sardines, (125 milligrams per serving -- there is one serving listed, per can), but I guess this is only because the sea IS salty, and these sardines, (which are a WILD-CAUGHT, product of Scotland), do come from the sea.  But no salt is ADDED, and this should make for less salt than is had in other, salt-added sardines.<br /><br />It is amazing, though -- despite the relative HUGE amount of soybean oil in each can -- that the sardines inside taste semi-dry.  I have read that the larger, "skinless and boneless" variety of sardines, (which are also offered by several manufacturers, and which I have also tried through the years), are not really sardines at all -- they are mackerel! Tasty morsels as well -- but very, very dry.  These CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES are NOT THAT dry -- (and, from their somewhat smaller size, and included skins and bones, definitely seem to be sardines and not mackerel) -- but they ARE a good bit drier than any other fully skinned and fully boned sardines I have ever eaten.  This is my one caveat with these sardines.  However, they do have a lesser price, and they do have a lesser salt content.  So, if these things are important to you, a little dryness shouldn't really be a problem.  If it is, I suggest that you get another, fully salted variety of sardines, (perhaps from another manufacturer), open two cans, (one of each), at a time, mix them up, divide the mixture into halves, and put half of the mixture away, (in one of the cans), for another serving!<br /><br />So, nothwithstanding a slight dryness, these less-expensive, less-salt<br />variety of sardines, may be just what you desire!  Yummy!

review/summary: Great taste, and good for you
review/text: Of all the sardines I've tried (and I've tried a lot of brands), these are the best tasting I've ever had. Aside from that, being brislings (the smallest of all commercial sardines), they are practically at the bottom of the food chain, which means (1) they should be almost completely free of mercury and any other toxins that accumulate in fish as you move up the food chain, and (2) their diet consists almost entirely of algae and phytoplankton that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These "fish oils" are not actually produced by fish, but by the microscopic plants and animals that the smallest fish eat. As a result, larger fish contain a smaller amount of these oils per unit of body weight. Most larger fish have a gram or less per serving, but Crown Prince brislings have 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids, which is practically a medically therapeutic dose. So you get great taste and the maximum health benefits by eating these (though depending upon your taste, the same sardines are available in several varieties -- I just happen to prefer the ones in soybean oil).

review/summary: Sardines are Better When Packed in Oil
review/text: I've been looking for these to appear on Amazon for a while because I like sardines in oil better than those in water.  The oil helps them slide down better and the oil gives a bit more flavor. I'm saddened to see they've used soy bean oil, I'd rather have them in sardine oil or olive oil; soybean oil is OK for printing inks and such but shouldn't be fed in any form to the unsuspecting public.  Oh, well, beggars can't be choosers.

review/summary: Excellent wild caught sardines.
review/text: These are the smaller, brisling sardines--several per can. The taste is quite good, not overly fishy. Despite having "No Salt Added," I can't imagine wanting sardines any saltier than these. Being salt-water fish, they do contain some salt (125 mg per can, or 5% of the recommended daily intake). Two ingredients are listed: brisling sardines and soy bean oil. If you enjoy sardines and want to reduce your salt intake, these are for you. Also, I disagree with a previous review claiming these are "dry." I highly recommend these.

review/summary: good product, the brand is mostly irrelevent
review/text: I don't buy this particular item, but I do like the brand.  I regularly eat two cans of Crown Prince sardines a day and have been doing so for years.  I have eaten them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  In fact, I remember when I ate nothing but sardines for three consecutive days due to financial hardships.<br /><br />I definately wouldn't spend $14.00 or more on sardines, even if it's a twelve pack.  I take advantage of Crown Prince's coupon deal where they send me coupons after I send them proof of purchase labels.  The sardines only cost me 1 or 2 cents a can after using the coupons.<br /><br />Indeed Sardines are among the healthiest of foods.  Sardines contain more Omega-3 fatty acids than any other fish.  Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatories and inflammation is the root cause of many diseases (if not all).  One of the things I've noticed over the years after eating sardines regularly is a drammatic reduction in headaches.  Before I ate sardines regularly, I used to get tension headaches quite often.  Since I began eating sardines regularly, it has been years since I've had a single headache.<br /><br />Whenever I buy the varieties which have salt added, I put the sardines in a colender to wash away the excessive salt before eating them.  From time to time I also like to put a few cans of sardines in a blender, add water to improve the consistency and then drink it or just scoop it up with a spoon.  It's an excellent energy booster.

review/summary: Great coffee In my opinion.  But!!!
review/text: This is the best coffee that I have found that is still a reasonable price.  I started drinking coffee a little over a year and a half ago.  I started with dunkin donuts, that proved extremely costly.  I moved to the 1.00 mccafes at McDonald's, after some "adjustment" time I took a liking to.  I needed something similar to that and I would say this has to be the closest that I can find.  Heck, might even be it, for all I know.  I've tried folgers columbian, black silk and found the folgers Columbian to be slightly less flavorful yet more bitter than maxwell house.  The black silk was more robust yet you again suffered bitterness.  Max. House seems to be the perfect blend, at least for me.  Buyer beware though, check out all of your local grocery stores.  ***mart had the same size for only 11.33 last time I went at my local IL.  Store!!  I came here looking for a deal,  Im leaving it at this review.

Very healthy, especially if you use skim milk. This product uses Splenda as a sweetener and my doctor says there are no concerns about Splenda the way there are with Aspartame. This has a nice level of protein and extremely low fat - but not over the top protein like body builders like to supplement, and there's no need for blenders etc. - just spoon stir.  I drink some almost every morning and it helps curb my apettite.  You can prepare and drink in about one minute.

review/summary: Awesome nutritional supplement
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended Pediasure for our 2 year old son since he was underweight. He'll go days with hardly eating a thing and doesn't seem to mind. It's very stressful trying to make sure he has a healthy diet. I refuse to go the junk food route just to get food in him. But he needed 1-2 Pediasures a day, and they are prohibitively expensive, about ten bucks for a 6 pack. That's over 100 bucks a month. I tried a couple of substitutes, like Gerber smart drink and Ensure for kids. But he didn't like them as much, and eventually refused to drink them anymore. Ovaltine was an affordable alternative, but it doesn't have nearly as much nutritional value and it has a lot of sugar. In fact, sugar is the first ingredient in lot of these substitutes. I had to keep going back to the outrageously expensive Peidasure and was at my wits end.<br /><br />I've had the original Carntion Breakfast drink and I loved it many years ago. Totally didn't think of it for this scenario since it's an "adult" drink, but then I happened upon it by accident. Still had a lot of sugar though, so I was super excited to find the No Sugar Added formula. Especially happy that it has sucrose and not aspartame since it's for a toddler.<br /><br />Best part is, my son LOVES it and drinks it without a fuss. This, along with vegetable/fruit smoothies and whole grain cereal helps me feel like he's getting a good diet. He's at a healthy weight and I'm a happy mommy!

review/summary: A great and inexpensive alternative to products like Ensure and Boost
review/text: I had bariatric surgery (the sleeve gastrectomy) a year ago, and due to my diabetes, part of the diet regimen was the Glucose Control version of Boost. Now, Boost is actually pretty tasty (even the sugar-free Glucose Control version), but it's also expensive, around $10 for a six-pack of 8-oz bottles (maybe a few dollars cheaper in certain spots). Clearly, a less expensive alternative was desired, if not to replace then at least supplement my use of Boost.<br /><br />Enter the No Sugar Added version of Carnation Instant Breakfast. It was originally a part of the liquid diet I was required to be on before and after the surgery, so I already knew it tasted good and was quite filling. Since I still use Boost, though, I wanted to save some money, so I continued to use it to "boost" my Boost supply. It's giving me the same (or similar) benefits as Boost, while costing a whole lot less (each canister has 12 servings, so 36 servings per three-pack, plus the cost of skim milk, equals saving a ton of money compared to Boost). Ordering it from Amazon has been beneficial as well, as it's almost impossible to find the NSA variety in stores, and even if you do it's usually the boxes of individual packets.<br /><br />In short, good value, good product, tastes great, quite filling.

review/summary: Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials
review/text: I decided about six months ago, that I needed to lose weight.  Among other things in my endeavor was to sign up with a weight loss group.  At one of the first meetings, we were introduced to food labels.  The thing I found interesting was there was a can of Carnation Instant Breakfast there.  I didn't think that would be good nutrutionally, but they said sure.  So, I decided to try it.  My breakfasts are not limited solely to this, but it's just one of a variety of breakfast choices.<br /><br />I couldn't find the cans of no sugar added at the grocery store, so when I saw it at Amazon, I decided to order.  Of course, I was disappointed to see a five week wait, but ordered anyhow.  As it turns out, the five week wait turned out to be only about two weeks, so no big deal.<br /><br />I always enjoyed the taste of the yellow packaged breakfast, and was worried the no sugar added may not have the taste, but it does.  It really does taste good.  I also add about 10 - 15 g of flax seed meal, and it makes a great breakfast.  I'll continue to buy and use it.

review/summary: High Protein, Low Sugar!
review/text: I bought this because I was on a high protein, low sugar diet.  There are a lot of bad tasting protein powders out there!  This mixes easily with non-fat milk and tastes good.

review/summary: Instant breakfast
review/text: This product was an awesome deal through Amazon.com, because I am in the process of going in for gastric bypass surgery and this drink is a basic requirement on the meal plans, both before and after surgery. I would recommend this to everyone weather they are having surgery or not. Sincerely, Christina Adams

review/summary: Good for diabetics
review/text: My daughter is diabetic and this is a good breakfast drink for her.  The grocery stores don't carry it in this size anymore, just the individual packets, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the way to go.

review/summary: Great price for hard to find item
review/text: I drink sugar free instant breakfast every morning as part of a protien fortified breakfast drink. Finding the sugar-free product is almost impossible in the local markets. I buy it regularly from Amazon and get a good price as well as speedy delivery. What a godsend!

review/summary: No Sugar and Tasty way to save calories
review/text: I have used this for years. The sugar free canister is not in most stores so I buy it here as a better value too. Some grocery stores will special order a case but you have to pay tax on it and also pay a higher price so the store makes a dime or two. Tastes great and is filling for the morning. Beats cereal and toast most mornings.

review/summary: YUMMMMM
review/text: I just love this stuff. It tastes terrific when mixed even just with water. Sometimes I make a Trader Joes Chocolate Protein powder drink, but it tastes terrible. Just mix in a little bit of the Carnation and it's pretty good.

review/summary: QUICK AND YUMMY
review/text: THIS STUFF IS GREAT IN THE MORNING OR WHEN I NEED A QUICK LUNCH. NUTRITIOUS, CREAMY, CHOCOLATY, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? THE CANISTER IS CONVENIENT AND ECONOMICAL. I'VE BEEN USING THE PACKETS FOR YEARS, AND AM GLAD TO FIND A SOURCE FOR THE THREE-PACKS ON AMAZON.

review/summary: Love the chocolate!
review/text: I had never noticed feeling "gassy" or "bloated" after drinking this, until I read the reviews.  I'm still very happy with this product, but I noticed what the others were talking about.  I think if you let it settle a bit after stirring, you wouldn't swallow so much air with it.  I don't think the problem is the product, but rather drinking it too quickly and too soon after the initial stirring.  I think this is a great product and will continue to buy it!

review/summary: Sugar free
review/text: great price, great product. good alternative to Nestley's Quick when you're a diabetic and love chocolate milk or just need something to get you started in the morning when you don't have time for a real breakfast. With the good price I can enjoy chocolate milk more offen without feeling like I just "bought the bank".
