review/text: I love this product I have two giant schnauzers on raw diet but when we travel I give them Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried, as is for evening treat and to be honest it keeps those stools firm for pick up at campgrounds! They go crazy for them.  I was especially happy with Amazon service where I ordered and had them shipped asap to a future rv park<br />Thanks  Mary Ann Free, Sarasota, FL

review/summary: Fantastic for travel and picky-eaters!!
review/text: I am sold on Stella and Chewy's!! These dehydrated patties are perfect for travel and picky eaters, I use them to supplement along with kibble, vegetables, frozen raw and/or canned food of various brands. I add pro-biotic DOGZYMES powder by Nature's farmacy and have never had any tummy upset in my dogs from this product. Some people need to transition their dogs diet as the packaging states but once your dog is used to variety you can be more relaxed in feeding. My dogs have a diverse omnivorous diet, as it should be.(owner of sight-hounds, dobermans and GSDs)

review/summary: Not good for my pup's tummy
review/text: While my pup loved this food (especially  wet), she had lots of tummy upsets including 2 separate days of vomiting, and diarrhea (at the same time). I tried to feed her this for 2 weeks, and her poo was still really weird and soft. I asked our vet for her opinion about raw food and she felt that they are considered unsafe because of possible e.coli and salmonella poisoning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to switch from my dogs tummy trouble and our vet recommending that we not feed her a raw food diet.

I swear each piece has more flavor than an actual apple does. I love the texture because it makes it still feel fresh vs. the dried apple chips than make me feel like I'm eating processed foods. I'm going to order all the flavors in a huge pack as soon as possible! Looove this product. Tastes amazing.

Just to give you an idea of what a greens lover and hater think.  I think if they were a little thicker it would make a difference.  They're very thin.

review/text: I often order Go Dog Food from Amazon, but lately the stock options for Prime are very limited and the 1lb bags were all that were in stock so I ordered them. Unfortunately, there is something wrong with the food, it is rancid or spoiled and my dogs wouldn't first touch it until I encouraged them to eat it and then both promptly got sick and threw up and had diarrhea and won't go near it now. They have eaten this food for years, so it isn't due to a change of diet.

review/summary: licorice is DELICIOUS, but price here way too high
review/text: I'm a huge Twizzlers addict so I was intrigued by this Australian licorice when I saw it for sale in bulk at a local shop. I bought several pounds and WOW- delicious!<br /><br />Kookaburra licorice is soft but not gummy, tart but not sour, and has a lovely taste that doesn't have the weird waxy, slightly-too-sweet taste Twizzlers do. My husband, who also loves Twizzlers (but not at the same level I do) doesn't love the Kookaburra. But if you eat both Strawberry and Cherry Twizzlers, the flavor of this is sort of a mix of the two. It's lovely.<br /><br />However, the price point here is way too high. If you have a grocery store that sells candy in bulk nearby, I would head over there. This is NOT a large bag for $10- it's about 1/3rd the size of a potato chip bag. So do your price comparison, but don't miss out. This stuff is probably my new favorite candy, and just addicted to it.

review/text: I'm working on getting my cats coat and weight on the proper track.  I haven't noticed any immediate changes but it's been only a week.  I had someone taking care of my cats (or so I thought) but was told that one of my cats had lost weight but this was due to the fact they'd changed his food.  When I saw him I was horrified!  He was so thin that there was no way the weight loss was merely a byproduct of a better diet but more likely that he wasn't eating but enough in order to keep himself alive.  So far I know he's eating better and he seems to be more active.  I'll make an update at some point on how the dandruff is going and weight gain since those are two things I can't review yet.

review/summary: Be careful
review/text: I bought these treats at PetSmart for my older dogs.  One dog is a 100lb AmStaff and the other is a 100lb Great Dane/black lab/GSD mix and both are 11 years old.  I was looking for treats that are made in America and that were softer than rawhides because their teeth aren't as strong as they used to be, but they still love to chew.  Well, when I was out in the yard scooping this weekend I discovered that these treats are not being digested.  At all.  In addition, both of my dogs have thrown up chunks of these treats over the past week.  One earlier this week and one today.  This from two dogs who have never had stomach issues in the past.<br /><br />I'd be very careful about giving these (or the peanut butter flavor) to your dogs.  It's nice that they're made from natural ingredients and are made in the USA, but if they can't be digested then they're not worth buying.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

review/summary: Excellent quality.  My dogs LOVE it!  =)
review/text: My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.  Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

review/text: I look for grain free food only as my sight hound is mostly raw meat fed.  In the AM she needs something to take up the extra bile her very acid belly produces.  I also need to mix her tick garlic tabs into something in order for her to eat them.  This does the trick as well as a couple other canned meat products do.

review/summary: What What?!!??
review/text: Got my first taste of The Shizzle last year (locally made in NC) and I'm so happy to see it available nationwide here on Amazon.  when I first saw the name I thought that these guys were cocky naming their product "the shizzle"... but they're right... its good, damned good.  cover your chicken, shrimp, pork and throw them on the grill and you'll be a hit at your next gathering... but don't stop there, use it in the crock pot, as an ingredient in your burgers (turkey or beef), steaks, heck, I'm going to follow their lead and smoke a whole turkey marinaded in The Shizzle this year... I'll try to remember to get my camera before the bird is devoured so I can post pictures, but there are no guarantees.  don't just get one bottle, you'll wish you had more... trust me.  and if you can stand some extra heat, pick up a bottle of The Shizzle: Voodoo Hot too, they bumped up the habanero content and kept the delicious flavor... take this ridiculously easy step to perceived grill mastery... add The Shizzle to your pantry and use it often!

review/summary: Aptly named -- this stuff is greatness...
review/text: I'm a big fan of jerk chicken/pork/shrimp. I have enjoyed the products made by others but found they didn't suit my preferences exactly -- until stumbling across this product during my quest for a fine jerk marinade. Since then I've been a regular user of The Shizzle as I have found that it is amazingly versatile, easy to use and quite tasty.  Perhaps most importantly I have also discovered that everyone in the family enjoys it.  The regular Shizzle is has the perfect amount of zing to please even those who like a bit of spice but won't chase away those who don't.  That is the beauty of this stuff.  I've some harsh critics in the family so the first time I broke this stuff out I didn't mention it until they tried it.  The all asked what it was and then asked for more -- I knew I'd found my stuff.<br /><br />I also own some of the Voodoo Hot Shizzle which is not outrageous but just right for those of us who enjoy some kick.  I skewer my fresh shrimp and then let it bathe in this stuff overnight prior to firing up the grill and it is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />I guess the real beauty of this product is the knowledge that there is no crap in there.  It's made from all natural stuff and all of it is good.  Bottom line -- this is the jerk marinade I would make if I were talented enough to make a good jerk marinade.

I've also used it on pork, grouper and shrimp which is an AMAZING treat!  Voodoo Hot has a nice punch--great with any meat, and perfectly complimented by the beer of your choice!  We've purchased Shizzle at Whole Foods but there is not a store near us so I'm very happy to see it on Amazon.  We grilled Shizzle Chicken and Shizzle Ribs at a family reunion over Easter weekend and it was the hit of the party.  Wake up your sleeping taste buds and get BE Shizzled!

review/summary: SHIZZLELICIOUS!!
review/text: After serving two years in the heart of Jamaica in the Peace Corps and hitting every small and large jerk stand from Negril to Kingston I thought I would never be caught dead trying a jerk marinade off the shelf of an American supermarket.  But then the Shizzle, through a network of friends, found its way to me and I reluctantly took my first bite of Shizzled chicken.  Praise Jah!  The Shizzle not only stood up to my Jamaican host mothers famous Friday Jerk, but its mix of spices and explosion of flavor blew it away!  I went back to the grill four times for more! I'm not sure what Rasta came up with this, but my memories of my favorite little jerk shack are never going to be the same.  Oh well, a small price to pay for my Chicken and Shizzled Veg being the highlight of our Peace Corps Jamaican Reunion here in the States.  At first I wouldn't give anyone the recipe, but the Shizzle finds its way and now they are all using it as well.  All this, and you just gotta love the name!

review/summary: A Very Good Snack Chip
review/text: Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though.<br /><br />Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down.<br /><br />All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good.

review/summary: The best veggie snack
review/text: These are THE original veggie stix.  If you go to to a major grocery chain store or Whole Foods, most have resorted to selling veggie "straws," which are like veggie stix but hollow, hard, and overly salty.  The Good Health veggie stix are a lighter snack and simply, just taste better in my opinion.<br /><br />I was happy to find the product on Amazon, but learned quickly that 10-7oz bags is a lot.  I bought the product in the beginning of Summer and it had an expiration date for August.  Unless you really love snacking on these things, it's probably more worth it to buy in the store if you can help it.

They are a terrific alternative to potato chips or fries as a side "dish" when serving hotdogs, hamburgers or a simple tuna sandwich.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a light, tasty, not-too-salty or oily snack food, this product is just the ticket.

review/text: Overall one of the better veggie stix I have tried. I liked that they have much less of an oil taste than other brands I have tried; very fresh tasting. Also better than store bought price especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />I got these in late December and they had around a 3 month expiration date. The have the standard potato, tomato, and spinach flavors. And like most brands I have bought in store they are not evenly placed in the bag, the potato flavor dominates. But not more than other brands, and these taste better and better priced at Amazon. Recommended.

review/text: Trying to break the frito habit, I tried veggie chips.  Really yummy and no greasy aftertaste.  Buy them by the case and put on monthly auto-delivery.  You will always have something appropriate for late night snacks and those take-along snacks to the lake or golf course.  Each bag contains only 140 calories - with much better ingredients.  Unfortunately, I'm now addicted to Veggie Chips, and so are my five children and 12 grandchildren.  But I don't feel guilty.

review/summary: A surprising find
review/text: I was grocery shopping two days ago at the local Wal-mart. My daughter went down the chip aisle looking, of course, for potato chips. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bag that read Veggie Stix. I picked them up, glanced over them and said to myself "Naw, probably tastes like crap.",and walked away. I was trying to find a snack for myself and everything was high in sodium or contained additives. So, I went back and decided to try the Veggie Stix. That was the best purchase that I made in the store that day. I got them home, tried them and had to force myself to stop eating them. And the BEST part is that when I let my grandkids try them they LOVED them. That was the only bag that I saw in the store that day, but believe me I will be checking to find out if it is an item that Wal-mart regularly stocks. If not I will be ordering from Amazon.com. Very Good.

review/summary: The best chip I've EVER had
review/text: I'm not even going to lie, I learned about these delicious little snacks by snagging a couple from my roommate's bag.  I go to the store that is almost 10 miles away--on the bus--just to get a bag of these.<br /><br />As one commenter suggested, they can be a little bit greasy, but since I bring them to work in a paper towel and inside of a baggie, I don't have a problem at all.  I don't think they're too salty.  They're about as thick as fries from burger king and they taste EXACTLY like french fries.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, almost 40 straws is one serving and its only 130 kCals!  I've switched to eating these as a snack instead of any alternative and I don't even need to portion them out by serving size.  They're so filling, I usually don't even eat 25 at once.<br /><br />I hope these are sold all over the country because the prices here are pretty steep and I'd love to share Veggie Straws with my family back home.  I get them at the grocery store for about 3.50/7ounce bag.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Potato Chips
review/text: If you want a low-fat and low calorie natural snack, these veggie stix are tasty and have 55% lower fat than potato chips.  They are fun to munch on.  I was surprised, however, that they had no Vitamin A as some vegetable snacks do.<br />No fiber, and only 1 g protein.  So, they are more healthy for what they don't have, than what they do offer.  And that's fine for a snack.  If you want snacks that offer some nutrition, popcorn chips offer fiber and sweet potato chips often have Vitamin A.  I'd get these for fun for a party for something different, but it would be great if they had a little more nutrition in them.

review/text: Most everybody loves chips, but don't want to feel guilty (at least I don't), about eating them. These chips are a good way for me to get the crunchy/salty flavor and satisfaction from eating "chips", yet these are healthier than just regular potato chips. I love the hint of salt and garlic. For those that are afraid of the "spinach", you really can't tell that you are eating spinach. I love the convenience of the size of these. Since it's just me , I can sit and eat a whole bag (bigger), without even thinking about it, but with this size, it's easier to control the portion. Since not all stores carry this product, it's great that I know that I can order from Amazon. I think the price is reasonable also.

review/text: I got these, thinking that they'd be a good healthy snack, and they do indeed taste pretty good. But they are way too oily. I expected them to be more like Veggie Chips, which I really like. But they aren't.<br /><br />Hey, they might be healthy but it doesn't matter. They leave a greasy residue in your mouth/throat after eating just a handful of them. Just as bad as french fries.

review/text: Great stuff!  Its pretty hot.  I thought because I can take on 12 blazing from bw3 that this shouldnt be too bad.  I must say....this stuff is creapingly hot.  some friends and i used this to season chicken wings.  the first wing...its pretty hot.  i felt it creapingly getting hot as seconds came by...  the duration didnt last very long..  about 5-7mins..  afterwards it gets less intensified.  going for 2nd round wasnt too bad.. less intense this time.  3rd round..  i can still feel the heat but its not as intense.  30 minutes later..  my stomache started to burn for about 10mins.  after that its all good..  a friend of mine... on his first wing.. in 3 mins, his eyes was soo watery...  it was pretty funny.  great stuff!

review/text: The sauce is pretty hot but I must say that the flavor is lacking. Very big tomato flavor but it seems as though it has an odd task, possibly from the "natural chili flavoring" or whatever it is. Almost has a metalic taste. Not too bad overall but it takes a while to get used to.

review/summary: Super hot, but not so good taste.
review/text: I really like hot sauces of all temps, but they have to taste good. This hot sauce certainly does meet and exceed the tempuature requirements, however it just tastes like hot. Cannot find much that I like to eat it on. I guess if you put some in A bowl of Chilli it would mask the taste of the hot sauce, but the hot sauce does not compliment the taste of anything, it is just hot.<br /><br />I do like the packaging and skull key chain though. Good as a novelty item, or if you have a dare contest, that's for sure.

review/summary: Just the sawce I was looking for
review/text: I added just 2 drops (very carefully) to an ordinary batch of Hormel Chili with meat and beans fresh from the microwave and I could sense something was not right. Every bite was more uncomfortable as the last but I was prepared with a gallon of whole milk. I did finish the chili but my eyes were watering and there was a spicy aftertaste of something new. I am used to the Texas Pete, Tobasco, and Franks on anything I eat. I even douse Hard-Times XXX habanero sauce over chili and chicken wings but I could not imagine adding more than 2 drops of Blair's per 16 ounces of whatever is to be consumed. One whiff of a freshly opened bottle is as satisfying as huffing paint thinner; it burns and I wouldn't be surprised if it also kills brain cells too. What's scary is there is hotter stuff like Blairs 2 and 3 am, but even as a hot-sauce head I am afraid to try anything higher octane than this stuff.

review/summary: Serious chili heads only.
review/text: I've tried all of the hottest sauces I could find in Jackson TN. Being disappointed by every one I turned to Amazon. Based on various articles this sauce is up there with the hottest non-extract based sauces. At 800k scoville units this is a serious sauce.<br /><br />The smell was wonderful. I tried one drop on a piece of pizza, it tasted great but the burn was shockingly mild. I then reverted to my roots as a hardcore redneck. I poured a line on the pizza like  it was weak. This was a major mistake. I ate quickly since I started to feel the burn. Within 5 minutes I bolted outside to spare my 2.5 and 4 year old their father's agony. I felt the tickling in my throat like I was hit with pepper spray (I had a friend spray me once, great friend). My eyes, nose, and mouth were watering. But the taste was honestly fantastic. Some milk and sour cream later my mouth and throat were numb. It took approximately 2 hours for me to recover. I was thrilled.<br /><br />From now on I will reserve this for chili, gumbo, and various other dishes. The taste is wonderful. I strongly recommend for anyone seeking a hot sauce with flavor and crazy heat.

review/summary: Extremely hot but tastes unpleasant
review/text: I buy a lot of hot sauces, and this sauce is the hottest of all that I've tasted. It's so hot that my mouth was burning for 15 minutes after I put a couple of drops on a taco. Unfortunately, it has a very strong smoky taste, and just tastes weird in general. I'm sure it's because it's an extract sauce; I also have Blair's After Death Sauce and that has a similarly unpleasant flavor, even though the Original Death Sauce is delicious.

review/summary: Incredible Hot Sauce.
review/text: Extremely hot sauce rigth here.  It only takes about two drops to heat up a bowl of (already slightly hot) chili to the point that you're likely to start sweating.  I LOVE hot food.  I will caution you NOT to try to eat a full tablespoon.  My friend decided it would be a good idea to try it and he ended up drinking a half gallon of milk, a few slices of pizza, and laying on the gorund moaning for about 2.5 hours before finally beginning to recover.  This is some HOT sauce.

review/text: Ive been dying to buy on of these bottles of hot sauce. When it came my sister opened it to try it (I wasnt home yet). I came home to a note saying "My tongue feels numb, and it HURT!". Kind of spooked I didnt try the sauce until bout 2 days later. When you put the sauce in your mouth you dont feel much... But then it starts to creep up to you and it starts to burn more and more. It was hot but not as hot as I thought. It tastes good, and it might make you cough once or twice. Overall it was great. I recommend this to any Hot sauce lover who is looking for a little punch. Not something your average Joe would buy. :D

review/summary: I'll be blunt
review/text: I'll be blunt; if you leave just this sauce in your mouth, you will get a chemical burn. If you eat a few drops in one meal, your BM's will burn. When I got my bottle, it was advertised as 1,000,000 scoville units. The scoville scale however is flawed because it's based on guys tasting a diluted version until they can't taste capsaicin anymore. The number of times it has to be diluted until it cant be tasted is the number of scoville units.<br /><br />The taste is decent, but a bit on the hot side in my opinion. I think tabasco is mild and can dump it in my mouth without flinching, and I can eat fresh red Jalapenos from my garden right off the vine, not like candy mind you, but I will tell you, this sauce is much hotter than a fresh red Jalapeno, not even comparable. But a fresh red jalapeno has a much deeper and full bodied taste, but that is probably more from the freshness.<br /><br />If you don't think this sauce is hot enough, then your only route to go is into extracts, and those taste like ka ka, since they basically have to remove flavor to get to pure capsaicin.<br /><br />Note that there is vinegar in here. It is not like Tabaso where it is mostly vinegar with a bit of pepper. This stuff is like dense habenero seeds that you have to smack out with the palm of your hand that comes out in globs of deep-red fire. Note that it is all natural with no preservatives or food coloring. That red is mostly from the red habenero pods.<br /><br />High quality product.<br /><br />Blair's death and Jersey death are two different products. They are somewhat ambiguous with which one it is. The death sauce is "only" 500,000 scovile units and is a black label, this stuff has the orange label so I'm sure it must be Jersey death (hotter). I can't bring myself to finish the bottle, too hard to dilute it to my liking. But it's a 5 star product, just be careful and know you should be a die hard chili head before trying out a product like this.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

review/text: This is hands down the best Honey I've ever tasted in my life! It's sad that it comes only in mini-jars but it is every bit worth to order it! They also make a great gift!

review/summary: Perfect for Wedding Favor
review/text: I purchased these honey jars to give out as a wedding favor. The jars arrived intact and without crystals in the honey. They are small, but perfect for a favor or even to offer guests at a B&B or Inn. The honey is very tasty!
