review/summary: So fresh and so clean
review/text: This is by far my favorite guayusa. There's an incredibly solid blend of just enough of the hint of the smooth, clean guayusa taste with a refreshing crispness of peppermint. I have struggled with stomach problems for years and significantly cut down on coffee as a result. The peppermint guayusa is great as peppermint is actually a known stomach calmative. As always the balanced energy effect is exactly what I need for that 3PM pick-me-up.

review/summary: Awesome tea!
review/text: I was so psyched to try this peppermint flavor of guayusa.  I love the traditional flavor too, but it's always nice to have a little variety.  It's good to know that drinking this tea will wake me up as much as a cup of coffee, but won't lead to a crash afterwards.  I also appreciate the high level of antioxidants.  It's perfect to sip snuggled up with a book on a cold day!

review/summary: The best Tea I have ever drank
review/text: I actually buy directly from the Runa website as their prices are a little better. This tea is amazing, I used to drink coffee like a mad women now I drink 1-2 cups and then it's the Guayusa tea. I actually can feel the difference when I drink this tea, energized but not jittery, focused and the taste of this tea is like no other. Besides supporting these local farmers buying this tea also supports the rainforest as this tea is grown under shade. I can not say enough good things about this tea and highly recommend this product....

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!

On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else.

review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: DISAPPOINTED!!
review/text: I had been salivating over these "steak" flavored kettle cooked potato chips for a long, long time. I just couldn't see myself paying so much for them...well, finally they were on special, so I bought a case of them. They are good--don't get me wrong--but they don't live up to the description on the package. It's cool that they list the actual variety of potato and where it was grown on the bag--that, I truly dig (no pun intended.) But they don't actually taste of flamegrilled angus steak. They aren't overly salty, and they are good, but nothing special and that's what disappoints me. Know what really gets me? We went to a discount chain last week and bought a big bag of Heinz Ketchup chips and paid two bucks for them--and they are delish! Who woulda thunk it? I did not expect to like them, but the kids wanted them. Now, if you want crunchy, fresh chips, go with these Mackies of Scotland brand chips--they have other flavors and I think maybe they might have been better than the beef ones. I just don't taste beef with these chips here. More like slightly smoky, slightly salty, very crunchy. Not bad, but not worth the extra money, at least for this variety, in my opinion.

review/text: I'm from New England & Baked Beans are tops there.  But good ones are hard to find.  For years the standard was B&M baked beans.  A great dish, but since showing up in stores 10 years ago or so Bush's beans have always had a looser consistency & a smokier and more robust flavor. Recently I had an opportunity to try the new Bush's Grillin' Beans.  These are hands down the most flavorful hearty rich baked beans I have ever tasted.  True attention has been paid to the spices and texture of the sauce. I especially like the Steakhouse style. Haven't been able to find the Southern Pit style in my store but hope to try it. I will never buy another brand of baked beans again.

review/summary: Break the cycle of overpriced coffee pods once and for all !!
review/text: Just because these come in a tea bag type of pouch does not mean they can not be brewed in a single cup ($20) coffee pot. I tried this method of brewing single cups of coffee out of disgust with the price of the all-mighty K cups pods. With K cups, I found myself spiraling toward financial ruin simply to enjoy coffee in a single serving cup.<br /><br />So, for A FRACTION of the cost here is what I recommend. Purchase a $20 single serve coffee maker, doesn't matter the brand but this is the exact one I use with the metal permanent filter removed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041GNZSS">Single Serve Coffee Maker</a> ...get the cheapest one you can find. All it is doing is heating water - keep that in mind. Put one of these tea bag style pouches in the filter compartment. Push it down really good in the filter holder and make sure the water won't flow around it as it hits the bag. Sit back and wait, soon you will have a perfect cup of Folgers coffee.<br /><br />I have not brewed a pot of coffee any other way since going to these. I have purchased hundreds of packets and have never been disappointed. I just hope Folgers doesn't realize what they have here and jack up the price.<br /><br />So...cut yourself loose from the K cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out-of-service space shuttles, or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to Harvard.

review/text: I was terribly upset when the McCormick's potato steamers products were no longer available at my supermarket. I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I actually prepared it just the way I did the steamers - with the help of a microwave steamer bag. I coated the chopped up potatoes in 1 tablespoon of oil, then added the seasoning packet, squishing it around to coat all of the potatoes and steamed it for 7 or 8 minutes.<br /><br />It was delicious. In fact, my husband liked it better than the steamer product b/c the seasoning was a little more subdued.

review/summary: Highly disappointed
review/text: I had this recommended to me by a friend of mine who claims he likes weak coffee... and my siblings often complain that the coffee I like is weak as well, so I figured maybe we have similar tastes, you know? So I tried this one, and... I really wonder if I got a bad batch, because I've never had such weak coffee. It comes out looking and tasting like its mostly water. It's a great price for 24 cups compared to what seems to be the norm of ~$1 per cup, but it would seem I got what I paid for here.

review/summary: Wrong seed!!
review/text: After received the shipment, I found that the seed is not the one I had from living whole food before.It's a smaller in size and lots of dead bugs inside! Even the packaging saying TODD SEED or something like that. I e-mailed them and this was the  reply was from them...... "It's the identical product, but we were getting too many complaints about the packaging from Living Whole Foods, so we went with an upgrade to the packaging from another company.  The seed itself is absolutely identical.  QAI certified, etc." So I thought,let me try and see.I made one tray and juiced but it's not the same taste and the grass is not dark green.I contacted them for refund since it's a wrong item they send me but they refused the do the full refund.I had to ship back out of my expense for $12 shipment and they refund me only $19 out of $23 .I guess,I used 1 pound which they deduct and refund $19.What a cheap company!!Why you are using LIVING WHOLE FOOD name and selling diffrent seed?Isn't that illegal to do?

review/summary: Quick sprouts for wheatgrass juice
review/text: We got sick and tired of paying 2 bucks for a tiny shot of wheatgrass at the juice bars, so decided to give "growing at home" a try.<br /><br />I bought this,<br /><br />an Omega J8006 juicer ( here on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Omega-J8006-Nutrition-Commercial-Masticating/dp/B001L7OIVI/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1328216581&sr=1-1-catcorr ),<br /><br />a growing rack (here on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Gardman-R687-4-Tier-Mini-Greenhouse/dp/B000NCTGQE/ref=sr_1_7?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1328216609&sr=1-7 ),<br /><br />some trays (here on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Gardman-R687-4-Tier-Mini-Greenhouse/dp/B000NCTGQE/ref=sr_1_7?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1328216609&sr=1-7<br />and here http://www.amazon.com/Durable-Plastic-Wheatgrass-Growing-Without/dp/B000E7MTUI/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1328216637&sr=1-2 ),<br /><br />some sprouting soil (bought at my local hydroponic shop, but anything with a high perlite percentage works),<br /><br />and  Azomite (here on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Lbs-Azomite-Additive-Fertilizer-Minerals/dp/B000E7MTT4/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_text_b )<br />and gave it a try.<br /><br />I started with 2 trays, then a week later did another 2 trays.  This seems to be perfect for two of us doing at least one double shot a day (regular tequila shot glass).  I keep 6 trays in circulation.  There are lots of videos on how to grow your own wheatgrass on YouTube ( like this one, but there are SO many more:  &lt;...> )so I won't go into the details.  The only advice I can give is do NOT overwater.  It's easy to do, and you will probably find yourself overwatering that first batch as you get used to growing your own.<br /><br />This particular wheat sprouts really nicely!  I don't see any wasted grains (amazing) and the plants are strong and healthy.  The price is right, too, especially with the Prime shipping.<br />Juice up :)  It's good for you.  And doing it at home is cheaper, more reliable (you know where your grass is coming from), and looks pretty on the counter and on the growing rack).  It's expensive to start up, but worth it in the end.

review/text: There were bugs in this product.  I've grown wheatgrass from seeds for over 15 years. You can tell when you first fill the soaking jar w/water (to rinse them). Gently shake it back and forth and the bugs float to the top.  If you bring a bug into your pantry it will lay eggs and you'll have bugs in all of you grains.  I had to throw it away.

review/text: I am new at growing wheatgass about a year into it. I have purchased seed from many different vendors but I have to say this seed "Todd Seed" have been the worse to grow, it normally takes 5 to 7 days with other seed from sprouting to 7 or 8 inches for harvest. I'm growing under the same conditions and this stuff is taking forever and does not look healthy, I gave it a try 2 other times with the same result...SO I will go back to the other vendors who did me right. Sorry Todd your seed is poo.

review/summary: Excellent Germination Rate!
review/text: This order arrived in good time and was securely packaged. I soaked about 6 cups of the seed overnight in a gallon of water, with appx. 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder, and they started to sprout in the water. This is my first experience growing wheatgrass, so I was definitely impressed. I got a few flats, filled them with organic soil, watered the soil through and sprinkled the seeds evenly across the top. I covered the seeds with damp paper towels and set the flats out on the porch away from direct sunlight. They are growing so fast! They germinated so well that now I'm wondering if I put too much seed on the flats. I have no complaints about this product.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I read reviews before buying this. The product is of high quality and there are instructions that you can look up online that tell you exactly how to use it. I believe some of the bad reviews are due to not following instructions perhaps. You have to soak the seeds in water 3 times for 8 hours so that they sprout before planting them. One review said that there were a lot of bugs in them, I only found maybe 6 dead ones that weren't a big deal because you are told to drain them and that gets the few that are in there out. One would expect a few bugs in there because it is such a big batch. The minor amount doesn't affect the growing of the grass at all. This is a much cheaper way to get your wheat grass. I will post another review when the grass has grown fully and I can juice it.

review/summary: Does *not* taste like carrot juice should taste
review/text: I've been enjoying carrot juice for years -- home made in my juicer and also another well-known brand sold in the produce department, which is also good. But recently I purchased Lakewood brand and was so disturbed by the taste that I thought the bottle of juice had somehow gone bad. Thinking it was an isolated incident, I didn't say anything about it when my boyfriend bought two more 32 oz. bottles to use in a recipe we planned to make this morning (a wonderful "pumpkin pie" smoothie made with carrot juice, sweet potato and dates). We were making a large quantity, to serve to friends, and it turned out these bottles of juice were terrible too, so we had to scrap the whole plan. There is a real "twangy" almost metallic taste, bordering on rotten carrots. I don't know if it's the pasteurization process or what, but this brand of carrot juice does *not* taste like carrot juice. I would hate for people to buy it and think they don't like carrot juice due to how this tastes. I don't know what their process is, but the end result is very icky. (Sorry, Lakewood -- I really don't like giving bad reviews! But this stuff is not good!)

review/text: Godiva chocolates used to be la creme de la creme years ago, but they don't seem that good anymore. They're also outrageously expensive for the lighter, smaller amount you now get, just 7.2 oz. instead of 1 lb. The creme fillings in the 19 Belgian chocolates pack aren't very substantial compared to the chocolate shell and alot of the chocolates are just solids. The filling flavors aren't as good as I remember them and there isn't much variety. There are so many more choices in fine chocolate now than a few decades ago, somehow Godiva has lost ground.

review/text: We were happy with the gift baskets that were delivered. However the company only has one distribution center in California, which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast.<br /><br />Despite the company's ambitions to become a national company, they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California.<br /><br />This maybe great if you live in California. However I live in Florida and I ordered on December 22 and my basket did not arrive until January 4th. I think that would be unacceptable in anyone's view, espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive.<br /><br />Until this company gets with the program and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered.

review/summary: Great for chicken curry dishes
review/text: I have been using this curry paste for several years now, and it makes a great dish. Although it doesn't beat eating Indian out, its the best paste I have used for at home dishes. Even though this is a "hot" paste, I would consider it mild.

review/summary: Easy Indian cookingat home
review/text: Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1-1 � lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2" cubes<br />1 cup nonfat plain yogurt<br />Salt<br />3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste<br /><br />1 (generous) tsp cumin seed<br />1 (generous) tsp mustard seed<br />1 small onion diced<br />3 cloves garlic diced<br />2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice<br />� cup frozen peas<br />2-3 tbsp cooking oil<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about � tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables<br />2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot<br />3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn.<br />4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn.<br />5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.<br />6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.<br />7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.<br />8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.<br />9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard.

review/summary: Not our best idea
review/text: As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did.

review/summary: Not durable at all!
review/text: This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this "Edible" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but I don't after reading the ingredients
review/text: First thing first, my dog goes absolutely nuts over this!<br />She can smell the roast beef flavor from another room.<br /><br />I originally bought this as a healthy alternative to rawhides for my dogs teeth.<br />But after reading the ingredients, there is really nothing healthy about it.<br /><br />It's nice the product is fortified with vitamins, but not so nice when it's full of grains and fillers as the base ingredients.<br />I went with Sam's Yam's Sweet Potato Raw Hides, as they are truly "natural".<br /><br />But for those who are feeding low-grain or no-grain dog food, this should be ok as a once-in-a-while treat.<br />But if your dog is on a more generic dog food, then there is absolutely no place for even more grains in their treats.

review/text: I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy. She's quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8.

review/text: Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.  She was fully unconscious before I could dislodge the bone and breathe into her nose to bring her back to life... We almost lost her over this bone.  If your dog is a greedy chewer or eater, then please don't buy edible Nylabones.

review/text: Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too. We have one 12 year old and her teeth are perfect. They are one of our dogs favorite treats that we buy. Your dog will love the flavor and they are made in the USA. Can't beat that, just wish they were a bit cheaper.

review/summary: Too expensive & made my dog puke!
review/text: My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.<br /><br />I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.<br /><br />I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.<br /><br />I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product.

review/summary: If you know what you are buying, these are great.
review/text: Let me start off by saying I love these. My dog gets so excited when he gets one of these. These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: is eaten way too fast
review/text: I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest "souper" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a "treat", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for "my dog loved it".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.

review/summary: Once in a while special treat
review/text: My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed.

review/summary: doesn't last very long
review/text: As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.

I LOVE the raisins.  They have an almost carmelized taste.  But they ARE hard, and best enjoyed like any hard "candy".  Actually, I like to sort them out of the mix and keep them in a separate jar.<br /><br />The only reason I give the "Munchies" a four rather than five star rating is 1) the cost, and 2) the non-airtight package.  For maximum enjoyment, find a truly airtight container and dump the fruit into it as soon as the package arrives (and, if you're like me, separating out the raisins as you go).

review/text: I absolutely love Just Tomatoes's dried fruit products, such as these Just Fruit Snacks. They are crunchy and flavorful, like eating a fruit candy, only much healthier and "reduced guilt"! I especially like eating them plain or over greek yogurt.<br /><br />They are unfortunately pretty expensive, but I find them worth the cost. The large pouches last quite a while, though I recommend transferring them to snap-top containers to maintain maximum crunch and freshness. I've ordered them (and the Just Fruit Salad variety, also quite yummy) several times through Amazon.com and have never had a problem.

review/summary: Good but overpriced
review/text: When I travel I bring a wide ceramic mug, plastic spoons, baggies of this, and instant oatmeal packets (Dr McDougall's are good). I put the fruit in the mug first, then the oatmeal, and cover with hot water from the coffee maker. The fruit softens up perfectly for a great healthy breakfast or late night snack. They are also good for straight snacking, but there are less expensive brands. I recommend trying these and Sensible Foods cherry fruit blend to compare on taste and price.

review/summary: DANGER!!!! - Was Fantastic, Now Somewhat Disappointing
review/text: This is sooooo good - I cannot stop eating it!  If they threw in some of their dried strawberries, it would be the ultimate perfection.<br /><br />However, the mix is sooo tasty... it's going to start becoming lunch and/or dinner!<br /><br />**Update**<br />This product has changed. It used to come in a plastic tupperware-style container and now comes in a bag. That change I like. However, the quality and taste of the dried fruit also seems to have changed. Sadly, it's gone downhill :(<br /><br />The fruit before used to have several different types and flavors. Now, they primarily taste like light caramel popcorn and are not nearly as delicious. For the price, I'm afraid I won't be ordering again.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: We love the Just Fruit Munchies!  My husband and I can, and will, eat an entire 8-oz tub in one sitting.  They are just so delicious.  My favorite fruit in the mix are the crunchy grapes - I try and pick all of them out to eat for myself!

review/summary: Best Yogurt Mix-in Ever
review/text: These are so good in yogurt.  They are like fruit and cereal in one - very crunchy.  I love the contrasting sweet and tart aspect of the mix.

review/summary: LOVE THESE!!
review/text: I was VERY pleasantly surprised with these - although as in another review - the packaging left alot to be desired (the Amazon boxing of it)  I also received dented containers inside the box which was barely holding together.  but the product is great and I am buying more today!
