review/text: I have personally not tried this brand yet. But after discovering from the Nutiva website's FAQ page that their plastic containers DO NOT CONTAIN BPA, I decided this is the brand for me. Just wanted to let you all know, since some of you expressed concern about the plastic container.

review/summary: The best !
review/text: This is the best coconut Oil on the market.  I have tried several others, even those marketed under extra virgin & organic.  The minute you open the jar the difference is obvious.  The price cannot be beat!!  I use this for everything.  I use it on my skin, for cooking, and even for my dog ... eliminates pet skin allergies.  a godsend.  I don't have to put my dog back on harmful prednisone.  I wish I knew about this stuff years ago!  The list of uses are endless, do a google search.

review/summary: Yummeh Yummeh... the BEST EVER
review/text: Okay, so... since I've started the paleo diet, I've tried a few different brands of coconut oil... all expensive, all not that very good tasting (one even smalled/tasted like chemicals... I use that externally now)... and really? Just not all that great. I used them up though for the fact that coconut oil is supposed to be good for you...<br /><br />AND THEN I BOUGHT THIS ONE. Ooooh wow. Now I use coconut oil for all its benefits, but also for it's tastiness! It's so yum, and it surprised me. Not to mention it smells GREAT.<br /><br />And with Amazon's subscribe and save, I only paid $41 for a 2-pack of 54 ounces... that's 108 oz for only $41! WAY better than any other coconut oils I've seen... and I've searched not only on Amazon.com, but iHerb.com, other random coconut oil manufacturers' websites, Raley's & Bel-Air, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Winco, Walmart... even Ebay.<br /><br />This is the best quality and the best deal... and when my huge dinosaur-sized (I may be exaggerating there) containers of coconut oil run out, I will be awaiting my next subscription of these awesome babies. :)

review/summary: I Love Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil!
review/text: I usually get Nutiva coconut oil in the smaller 15 ounce two-pack, but I love it and use it so much that I decided to buy the larger 54-ounce, pack of 2 which was an even better deal, using subscribe and save.<br />  This coconut oil smells great, but what's more is all the uses for it.  If your new to using coconut oil I would suggest starting with just a few simple things, like sauted veggies, a fried egg, or fried potatoes.  After a while you will find more and more things to do with it.<br />  I use it in all my baking, either to substitute butter or half and half with butter.  I have used it for muffins, brownies, cake, potatoes, bread, veggies, and well, just about anywhere you need oil. Another use for this is to make toothpaste, as a skin softener, hair conditioner, making deodorant, mixing with lavander and/or tea tree and other essential oils to make a balm for boo's boo's and other skin irritations, diaper rash cream and throwing into a smoothie.  This is a great all around product, and this brand is good.  Shipment was very quick also. If you are going to try coconut oil, this is a great brand, and have fun discovering how healthy it is and all it's uses.

review/summary: Oil Pulling/Psoriasis and Freshens Breath, What Else you Want?
review/text: I originally bought this for my son. He has psoriasis of the scalp which on occasion migrates to the eyebrows. When he applies this religiously, his condition is under control and he can stay off the medicated steroid shampoos that cost $300.00 a bottle.<br /><br />I myself started using this for oil pulling. I can't say that I am cured of anything yet, but I have to tell you this oil tastes good, feels smooth and is easy to use.<br /><br />One thing I can say it does, eliminates ALL mouth odors. My breath is fresh and clean and my teeth feel like they were just cleaned after I use it. So I guess, from that aspect, at a tablespoon per use, it is cheaper than mouthwash.<br /><br />Frying in it is excellent too, leaving a slight hint of coconut, it seems to fry up freshness, rather than gunky oilyishness, if you can relate to that description lol.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to the price of this, but I ordered one day and it was on prime subscribe and save for a total of 35.99. 2 days later I checked on the status of the order and holy cow, almost 20 dollars more PLUS 12 dollars S/H. I think I got a steal.

I used it every morning and night for 2 days and noticed a huge difference!  Her skin was softer and the eczema was much less noticible.<br /><br />We cooked with it and made popcorn and chicken fried steak.  Both turned out great with this oil!<br /><br />It is AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone!!

review/text: This is by far the best coconut oil I've tried! It really tastes of coconut not soapy like some others. I use it as a moisturizer, conditioner, in my smoothies with frozen banana and strawberries YUM and I also cook and bake with it. If you do a lot of asian type cooking this is great, it adds a wonderful coconut flavor to all kinds of food. Great for curries and adobo shrimp mmm too good! It smells and tastes so good you want to just bathe in it, you will find yourself using it for everything : )  Love this stuff!

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff!!
review/text: A couple weeks ago, I decided to try adding coconut oil to my diet/regimen because of all its health benefits, and settled on this particular brand after much research. I have to say, it is amazing so far!<br /><br />It has a wonderful coconutty smell, and gives a great flavor to everything you cook with it (though I'm sure there are some things that don't go well with coconuts). Just last night, I made a delicious panko lemon pepper chicken cooked in the oil. Crazy good!! I've even used it to cook ground meat and veggies for a spaghetti sauce, which was yummy as well.<br /><br />For the last couple weeks, I've also been adding a heaping tablespoon to my morning coffee along with a pad of grass-fed butter, some unsweetened organic cocoa powder and almond milk - this being my own version of Dave Asprey's Bulletproof Coffee (google Bulletproof Exec...his site is amazing!).<br /><br />The energy boost I get from my morning coffee is incredible and much longer-lasting nowadays, compared to how I used to feel after a normal cup of coffee with coffee creamer. At first, I started adding just coconut oil, but I find that the little bit of butter helps the oil incorporate, so it's less of an oil slick - but I still have to swirl it once in a while. Another big bonus is that my morning coffee, laden with these healthy fats, can easily stave off hunger until lunch time, so I don't need constant snacks throughout the day!<br /><br />I have also found that I have tons of energy in the evening until I decide to go to bed, and consistently wake very refreshed, even if I've only gotten 5-6 hours of sleep. I don't have a midafternoon slump like I used to, and I largely attribute that to the addition of healthy fats, like coconut oil, and near elimination of sweets and bread in my diet (though I still enjoy a cookie now and then... :) I wish I had made these changes sooner!!<br /><br />I've also been using it as a light facial moisturizer after showers, and it's been great for that. I feel much better knowing what I'm putting on my face. The oil is also a great hair serum! I use a tiny bit (just enough to barely coat the very tip of your finger) spread in my palms, then rub through the middle/ends of my almost dry hair, then roll it in a bun for about 10-20 minutes. When I unroll it, my hair is wavy and smooth and silky and feels just as good as if I had used one of those $50 an ounce serums from the salon! That's easily one of my favorite uses...<br /><br />Coconut oil has been a great addition to my life, and I've been so excited about the changes in my energy and sleep in the last couple weeks. My boyfriend is beyond tired of hearing about it :)<br /><br />A note of caution: Eating too much coconut oil at once, especially if you've never used it before, may give you an upset tummy and an urgent trip to the bathroom. After a quick search online, I found that this is most likely caused by die-off of bad bugs in the body. Apparently coconut oil is great for detox!<br /><br />I promise, you will not be sorry for giving this a try!

review/text: I can't rave more about this Coconut Oil. I have been using it for years and truly love it. I have searched for other deals as good as this, but have found nothing quite like it for the quality and price. Coconut oil is an amazing addition to your health and wellness regime; I highly recommend it for ALL of it's incredible healing and medicinal properties, besides the fact that it just tastes great! I use it everyday for body oil, cooking, baking, on salads, raw as a supplement, in my hair, as a make-up remover, wound healer, and sooooo much more. There are so many websites that explain the health benefits of this exceptional food source; check it out. This product is the best and I will continue to buy from this brand for years to come...best of all, it delivers within days of ordering with Free shipping right to my door...in Hawaii! Can't beat that. :)

review/summary: not your everyday oil...
review/text: just a word of advice from an "ignorant" amateur cook...the consistency of coconut oil is NOT the same as that of most cooking oils (veggie, peanut, olive, etc.). somewhere in the product's "description" I remember reading that the oil's melting temp is 75 degrees farenheit...and BOY they aint kidding...! if you want to use this oil in a (normally) fluid batter like cakes or brownies you will need to heat it up to AT LEAST 80 degrees (I nuked it for about 30 seconds) just to get it to pour..BUT WATCH OUT...once you mix it with other "cooler" ingredients it will try to solidify again, making your batter VERY thick and hard to mix...ON THE OTHER HAND...I love the flavor and health benefits...highly recommended...!

review/summary: coconut oil is the best!
review/text: if you ever use vegetable oil, butter, or shortening, then try coconut oil instead. it's very delicious, healthy, and vegan.  and this one by Nutiva is organic and affordable!<br /><br />when used as an ingredient, it imparts a very slight coconut flavor and a filling feeling. like butter and other animal fats, it's a soft solid at room temperature, but it melts when slightly heated. as a result, it can be readily used in everything from stir fries to toast.<br /><br />coconut oil is composed almost entirely of saturated fats, but unlike most animal fats, it has no significant effect on cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. unlike many other thick vegetable fats, it's not hydrogenated, so it doesn't degrade your cell walls. it contains high quantities of fatty acids that have potent anti-microbial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. some research suggests that coconut oil could be effective in preventing infection by HIV, measles, and herpes. other research suggests that it increases the rate at which calories are burned, decreases the rate at which fat deposits are built up, increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />and did i mention it's delicious?

review/summary: Addictively Healthy and Smells AMAZING!
review/text: Extra-virgin coconut oil is one of the few fats that everyone should be incorporating into their diets. Despite the fact that the "saturated fat" content is very high, the body processes it differently from other saturated fats and is able to use it for energy much more efficiently. I feel absolutely no guilt eating this stuff or even licking it off my fingers. I use this stuff in EVERYTHING I can and it works well in all: muffins, cookies, scones, scrambled eggs, even high-heat wok stir-fry. It has a lovely faint coconut smell, and you can barely taste it, but I absolutely love the flavor. Sometimes I will use half coconut oil and half butter (this works better for cookies).<br /><br />You don't have to keep it refrigerated, but you can if you want to, so it's nice to have the option either way. I go through this stuff really fast and the price on Amazon is excellent, especially with Subscribe & Save. I'm sure my friends appreciate that I am serving them baked treats that feature this wholesome, healthy fat, rather than something that is going to slowly kill them like shortening.<br /><br />It also seems to work really well for dry skin! Miracle stuff, I tell you.

review/summary: Seriously Awesome.
review/text: If you don't like the taste of coconut, I guess you should avoid this product, but otherwise, you must buy it. Now.<br /><br />It tastes amazing. Light and fresh and mildly sweet. I bought it after reading so much about the benefits of coconut oil.I figured it if it only does 20% of what's claimed, I'll still be coming out ahead.<br /><br />It is, frankly, too early to be passing judgement on whether the health benefis really are as promised, and I'm not sure I'd focus on that too much anyway. Everyone's body is different and will react to any given substance differently, so I can't ask anyone to give too much weight to my personal experience.<br /><br />What I will say is this is a superior product in texture and taste. I eat it right out of the jar like peanut butter. I put it on almost literally everything. Waffles? Mm. Steamed vegetables? Mm. Fish? Mm. Coffee? Mm.(It is NOT good in cold dishes because it solidifies and makes the dish weird, usually.)<br />For Thanksgiving I used it on/in the turkey and stuffing, and for whatever reason, it was deemed The Best Turkey Ever. It was INSANELY moist. (Did not taste of coconut, btw, though usually things do.)<br /><br />The jar is very large and the subscription option is awesome. I originally subscribed to a smaller size, but switched when I discovered it tastes like sweet,sweet manna.<br />DO NOTE that on two occasions I have received jars that Amazon packed in the laziest fashion possible, just rolling around in a cardboard box, so that everything was covered in a sheen of oil. Uncool, Amazon.<br /><br />But seriously, go order some right now. Delicious.

review/text: We have been using coconut oil for cooking for 2 years now. Very satisfied with it this way, cooks very good and tastes very good. Also use for dry skin, dry hair, sun baked hair and skin. Works as well as any other product we have tried, and its all organic and natural. At times when we use none for cooking I use it in my coffee, pretty good if you like the flavor of coconut. I think the good benefits of this oil far out weigh the bad. I researched the different coconut oil products out there and Nutiva seems to be as good as any other, although there are other brands that are right up there with it, but I seem to be able to find better deals on this one. I highly recommend the organic products as opposed to the farmed and fertilized brands.<br />Also cold pressed is the only way to go for me. I have bought it in quantity to save and have stored for 6 months with no affect on flavor or taste. I have made all my purchases at Amazon for conveinence as some other places have matched their prices but none have beat their price. Also shipping has always been free and very quick.<br />  Satified customer, Gary Q.

review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil - Two Thumbs Up!!
review/text: Nutiva provides an excellent source of coconut oil. We use it everyday in our baking - in place of shortening and butter in pies, cookies and breads. We use it when cooking anything in the skillet (eggs, chicken, veggies, etc.) We also use it on our skin as a moisturizer, diaper rash, on the little guy's boo boos, and to dilute essential oils.<br />Coconut oil used to have a bad rap because it is fatty, but it is a GOOD fat - the kind that our bodies were made to break down easily. It is one of the BEST oils for our consumption! Enjoy!

My daughter is allergic to dairy and it has been a great substitute for her.<br />It's also really good as a moisturizer, although it stains clothes.<br />I went through a 54-oz tub in about three months!

review/text: There is really not much more to say.  All of us seem to think this is an excellent product, and of course I agree.<br />I used to buy the smaller jar but found the larger one easier.  There is one small problem with buying large is the distribution of the oils.<br /><br />Let me explain, when you get your larger container you probably have noticed, that (most of the time) the oil has melted somewhere along the line, not a problem.<br />The problem lies in how it has set back up.  If you look you will see that they creamy oil portion is on top, it is floating atop the sediment that is inevitable on the bottom.<br />So if I may make a suggestion before we use the top oil and are left with the healthy tasty sediment of coconut on the bottom.<br /><br />When it arrives place the container in pot of very warm water until it melts again (this does not hurt the oil unless you boil it) stir it up well and portion it out into smaller clean sterile jars such as canning jars.  This way when the oil separates you just have to soften a small portion to get the even flavor.<br /><br />I use this oil every day and I give it to my dog it is very healthy but one word of caution when giving it to your dog, start with a small taste for a few days and add a little every day until you up to a few tablespoons for a full size dog.  It is just as healthy for them as it is for us and their coat gets so shiny and soft, my pug, who normally sheds a lot, does not, while he is on this oil, I do not intend to go off it. I am on the auto ship to make sure we get the benefits of this oil all the time, the auto ship is less expensive and you can control how often you get it, just a thought.

review/summary: Wonderful product, attractive price
review/text: We use coconut oil for so many things. I make fudge out of it (cocoa powder, coconut oil, palm sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt). I use it to bake, to scramble eggs, and in place of butter in many recipes. We have also used it for various skin conditions including diaper rash and dry skin. We've also made toothpaste out of it, and I have known friends use it to make their own deodorant and massage oils.<br /><br />Many sources say that ingesting a bit of coconut oil each day is great for your health, but in addition to health benefits, it smells lovely and is wonderful to work with. We have this delivered in bulk every couple of months and go through quite a bit of it. It is a staple in our house.

review/text: We've switched quite a bit of our olive oil and butter usage to coconut oil for health reasons. My father in law gives it to his wife beset with advanced Alzheimer's and has seen a noticeable improvement in her mood and cognition. The taste is subtle and delicious! It's liquid at 78 degrees, which makes it a bit difficult to spread on toast - we use a spoon, but will solidify at just a few degrees cooler. Can't refrigerate because it gets really hard.

review/text: I have been buying Nutiva Coconut Oil for over a year and am very happy with it.<br />For a few months now I have been on the 'Amazon Subscription Service' and have only good things to say about it. At first I was nervous to sign up but I finally took a chance and I have to say I've been pleasantly surprised.<br />The products are sent out in a timely fashion, with plenty of advanced email notice that they are coming.<br />Also, it's very easy to change or cancel a subscibed item, amount, and/or delivery date. And, or course, there is the product discount that you receive from being on the subscription service.<br />If you have a product that you purchase on a regular basis, I would highly recommend trying the subscription service.

review/summary: Coconut oil is great
review/text: I used to buy small jars of organic coconut oil to add to my old dog's diet because the oil made her feel better and reduced her body odor.  I was very happy to find the 54 oz size containers here on Amazon to add to all my dogs diet.  When I was reading other reviews about popcorn poppers, I read that movie theaters used coconut oil to pop their popcorn, but they use seasoned and colored oil. I didn't want to try the "movie theater" oil, so I tried using the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in my Whirley Pop hand crank popper instead of vegetable oil, and was amazed at the difference.  The popcorn tastes wonderful and is very tender! An added bonus is that the popper stays cleaner, and doesn't get the brown "gunk" build up on the turning gears like it did with the vegatable oil.  I highly recomend this coconut oil especially in this large money saving size from Amazon.

review/text: We normally buy Tropical Traditions, but this buy was too good to pass up.  The oil is just as good, and we use it a lot (frying eggs and baking).  If you've never used coconut oil, I highly recommend it.  It is super healthy!  We even use it as a moisturizer for our skin.  If you are looking for coconut oil without the coconut taste (i.e. to pan fry chicken, pork chops, green tomatoes), we use expeller expressed.  We're always looking for ways to consume this oil.  It's that good for your body.

review/summary: Strong Flavor in Nutiva Brand
review/text: I purchased the Nutiva brand of extra virgin coconut oil because I'm exploring the paleo diet. I had used Spectrum brand from the supermarket before and loved it. It had no strong coconut taste or smell. But it was expensive ($9 for a 1-lb. jar).  So I got a big order of Nutiva coconut oil from Amazon. Unfortunately, it adds a strong coconut flavor to anything you cook with it or add it to. I like coconut in general, but a cooking fat should have a neutral flavor. I'm going back to Spectrum coconut oil if it's on Amazon.

I have spent a lot of time in the Islands and "fresh" & "real" coconut was always a treat.  This is the ONLY product that brings "REAL" coconut goodness to my kitchen.  I have found so many uses for this product and am adding new ideas daily.  My "every day" use is a tablespoon in my old fashion oats - wow, as good or better than fresh churned butter.  Make frying eggs an enjoyable experience and replaces bacon grease in fresh green beans for a wonderful taste without the trans-fat.  I cannot imagine how anyone would not be delighted with this product.

review/text: YUM! This stuff rocks. Recommended by a yogi for my very dry skin/lips/cooking needs/etc. It is d.e.lightful. I have replaced my lotion, facial moisturizer, chapstick (mostly), deep conditioner for hair, and makeup remover (SO FAR) with this coconut oil.<br /><br />It smells fantastic; it's slightly oily but with enough rubbing, you're good. I use it daily for most of the above. I've used it for cooking a few times (red curry, yummm) and possibly slightly wasted a bit by using to deep fry coconut shrimp. Results were great, but definitely had to use a cup or two worth of oil just to get a few inches deep for shrimp. Didn't know if I could re-use... chose not to. Probably won't use for futre deep frying, even though the flavor was on point.<br /><br />I've also put a little in my dog's water bowl, per something I read indicating it can help shine up their coat/fur. No results from the one time, but he didn't seem to mind it :) I have brought it into work, sharing with as many people I know, spreading the good word about this wonderful natural stuff.<br /><br />Love.

review/summary: Mild coconut flavor
review/text: I never liked coconut, but wanted to have this for the health benefits.  I am getting used to the coconut flavor, finding I like this better in sweet things, like cereal, smoothies, etc.  It's pretty good on oatmeal or cream of wheat hot cereal in the morning, and I do substitute it for butter in some recipes (sometimes I will do half butter and half coconut oil).Tried sauteeing veggies, the taste is not for me, so I will stick to the sweet things.  Also added this to popcorn popper (again with butter) and it's great.  I might try the expeller pressed coconut oil which has no flavor next time for when I don't want that slight coconut flavor, because it is noticeable to me.  If I was a baker, I could see using this all the time. This is my first purchase of coconut oil, so nothing else to compare it to, but it seems like a quality product, I have no complaints.

review/text: I so love this coconut oil! I first tried coconut oil (NOW Foods brand) from my local natural foods store. The NOW coconut oil was also excellent but costlier. I then made the mistake of purchasing LouAna brand from Walmart. What a difference! After realizing the error of my ways, I did some research and found that many people recommended Nutiva brand because it is unrefined (unlike LouAna and Spectrum brands at Walmart) and it can be purchased from Amazon in bulk at a reasonable price. I have already used half the first container because I love this stuff so much. I use it as a replacement for butter, shortening and cooking oil in almost all of my recipes. It has just a slight coconut smell and flavor that adds to some foods nicely but is not noticeable in other foods. I find that my son and I especially love it in place of butter on popcorn because it coats the popcorn rather than being absorbed by it and making it wet. It's also much healthier and tastes better too. Of course, taste is a subjective thing, so others may not agree about that. We also use it in place of butter on toast and sandwiches, and it is perfect for homemade no-cook fudge. I even make my own chocolate chips using coconut oil. It is so versatile and healthy, I am sure that I will keep finding new uses for it all the time!

review/text: This product has been great!  It does smell of coconut, but for me that's a plus.  It reminds me of vanilla in the sense that it adds to the recipes you use it in, but it doesn't really change the taste noticeably.  I've been using it as a super conditioner for my hair (cannot stress enough that you need a minuscule amount), my skin (my elbows, knees and hands are no longer dry), to season my cast-iron pans, to cook with (eggs tasted light, not greasy or coconutty), on my kids after bath and for my own facial creme, make-up remover, toothpaste and moisturizer.  My skin feels like velvet.  My hair has bounce and shine, my cuticles are not dry even in January in the NE, my face is brighter somehow and my teeth are whiter (though I don't know how this is possible).  I've gotten compliments on these and I've only been using it for a week.  I really love this product for all it's uses!

review/text: I love this stuff - use it in everything. I notice a number of reviewers here saying, "even though it's saturated, it has medium chain fatty acids that are easily converted...etc. etc." Folks, the idea that saturated fat is dangerous is the biggest scientific fallacy of the 20th century. Read "Good Calories, Bad Calories" or any other work on diet by Gary Taubes. Natural saturated fats (NOT trans-fats) of all kinds, including from pasture-raised animals, are very good for you. And this one is absolutely delicious!

Be careful when digging around once the jar gets more than half-empty: the edge of the plastic container is actually pretty sharp, and I managed to nick myself twice now (on the inner arm, ouchies).<br /><br />It does have a pronounced coconut oil, as one would expect, but this becomes much more subtle mixed with stronger flavors (cocoa, meat, strong spices).<br /><br />And you can't beat the price per ounce!

review/text: Big Franks are the best vegetarian frank that I have ever tried. They taste far better than real meat weiners. They have a somewhat soft texture and could be easily broken down and used in a casserole or some other recipe. They come in a broth that could also be used to add flavor to recipes. I dare anyone to who hates meat analogues to not be pleased with this product. I can't say enough about Big Franks!

review/text: These franks have such a great flavor. Unfortunately for me, I could eat one after the other AFTER the other, and I'm NOT kidding!<br /><br />They are a bit softer than some of the other vegetarian hot dogs, but, that's easily solved...just don't stick a fork in one and walk around with it. Simple, right? They work perfectly fine in hot dog buns and can be chopped up and used in recipes.

review/summary: great dogs if you know how to cook them~
review/text: I LOVE these dogs BUT you have to know how to cook them ..so here's the method I use .. First you must rinse them since they have a sort of brine that is not that good kind .. then soak them in a bit of liquid smoke( if you have it)and water if you have it .. also optional for those who like it spicy add a dash of chili powder .<br />Now since they virtually have no fat add a little/some oil to your pan and coat them before you start to cook or they will stick to pan .. and fry to lightly browned on a few edges ..  you can also bar b que them ..<br /><br />add the usual and they are great!!!! .. not soggy .. but yes the reviewer who said soggy.. you will get that if you just eat out of can without rinsing and then micro ..  you need to rinse and cook .. but it only takes a few mins..<br /><br />experiment and you will LOVE them too!

review/text: I LOVE these!!! I grew up on them but everyone I have try them end up loving them too- including my boyfriend who lives by meat. It is often a turn off when people see they come packed in cans. Ignore that part because they are fantastic and very high in protein. I did catch my boyfriend trying to boil them- not recommended! You can microwave them (about 1 min), fry them on non-stick, put on BBQ, or my favorite way- over a camp fire! Yummy :)

review/text: After reaching in the bag with my hand and having a very sharp piece of plastic cut me (it was baked into a piece of food) I began to look for options. I now know the real dangers of feeding dry food to cats, it's just not natural at all. Cats don't cook their meat and neither should we. My Bengal is now on a raw diet and is healthier then ever.<br />Buy the book Raising cats naturally. It's not hard to do.  No more special dry food to cure this and that. Pet food companies care about profit, not your cat.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I was hesitant to try this as it's written in German. Instead of using Google to search for the ingredients, I figured I'd give it a shot since I am currently suffering with laryngitis which stems from a nasty cold/sinus infection. It's got a very light sweet taste and it has helped soothe my throat far better than the cough drops I had been using. I do find myself getting slightly sleepy after I drink it though I can't say if it's the tea or the fact that it's a warm beverage right before bed. I usually microwave it with the tea already in the water for about 45 seconds to a minute. I also decided to add just a touch of honey and some vanilla. It does not have a medicinal taste and I can see myself continuing to drink it long after the cold is over. While it may not cure cancer, it certainly makes me feel better and more relaxed and frankly, what more can you ask of a tea? You don't need to add the honey or vanilla. I was just feeling experimental. I've had it plain and that's just as tasty. Don't hesitate to try it out. I hope you find it as pleasant as I did. Ricola now has a fan for life. The tea in the green can is quite nice as well for those cold fall and winter mornings. Thanks go to Amazon for allowing me to write this review.

review/summary: Good for gout relief, but another is better
review/text: Not everyone takes cherry juice for gout symptoms, so this is a fine organic cherry juice concentrate for those who want to make a good quality juice. It is sweet, but not too sweet. It can be mixed with varying amounts of water to suit personal strength preference. Enjoy!<br /><br />For gout symptoms, I have been trying various brands and, from personal experience (nothing scientific), this juice concentrate  by Swanson is a close second to my first choice."Dynamic Health Laboratories (DHL) Organic Certified Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate", (for about the same price, also sold on Amazon) is most effective for me. There is something in tart cherries that helps dissolve  uric acid. Uric Acid crystals build up in the joints and elsewhere, generally causing trouble for gout patients.<br /><br />I have tried the following juices: this one by Swanson, Dynamic Health Laboratories' Organic Certified Tart Cherry Juice,  Country Spoon's Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate, Dynamic Health Laboratories' Organic Certified Black Cherry Juice Concentrate, and Knudsen's Just Black Cherry Juice. As mentioned, the Tart Cherry by DHL has been best for me. It works fastest, giving results as soon as an hour (or less) after drinking on an empty stomach. Or, it provides relief the next day, especially when taking it at night, nearer to bedtime. I take 2 tbs, in a cup of water, twice a day. Other juices I've mentioned give less noticeable results, or no results at all.<br /><br />Of course, I avoid high purine foods in my diet, but I seem to need the extra help from cherry juice concentrate. I have not tried the prescription gout medications yet. I am hoping to avoid  pharmaceuticals by improving diet and overall health. The cherry pills I've tried do not give noticeable results. Good luck!

review/summary: Stock up on this excellent calorie-saver
review/text: This great mayo alternative has gotten hard to find in grocery stores, so I was pleased to see that Amazon had it available in 12 packs for a reasonable price.  I've used this for years instead of mayonnaise on sandwiches -- its light flavor isn't as pungent as regular mustard and it has a nice creamy texture with virtually no calories.<br /><br />Since I now don't have to worry about running out, I decided to try some as a baste for baked chicken.  I mixed a full jar of Dijonnaise with about a quarter cup of honey, and liberally covered a large package of skinless chicken breasts before popping into the oven.  Wow -- the chicken was moist and delicious and had a nice sweet/tangy glaze of the honey-mustard mixture.  A quick and easy way to give chicken breast a great option for a busy weekday dinner.

review/summary: Delish but overpriced
review/text: A one-ounce package consists of a little over a dozen bites. This package has only 18 oz in it... and is way overpriced! I bought a 1 oz package from Walmart for $0.88. I've tried the orange, apple, and pomegranite flavors and all are really yummy and no artificial ingredients although I don't see any pomegrante in the ingredient list for that flavor. They are mostly made of apple, very soft, chewy, and just about melt in your mouth.<br /><br />If Amazon becomes more reasonable on their bulk packaging... I'll be picking them up here, otherwise I'll buy them individually.<br /><br />They do come in a resealable ziploc package but not enough in a 1 oz to really "keep" for long so I feel it's a wasted benefit. However, if the bulk packages were 5 or 6 oz, then the ziploc would be great (and the price would be more fitting)!

review/summary: Excellent vegetarian burger
review/text: Don't think of this as tasting like hamburger.  Just think of it as tasting good.  We love this product - and this is really a very good price considering that it ships for free.  One can is approximately the same quantity as 1 lb. of ground beef.<br /><br />Some examples of what we do with this product:<br /><br />hash:<br /><br />saute small cubes of potato & chopped onions, add burger, break up lumps, & brown all together; add a couple of shakes of (optional) Angostura Worcestershire sauce [no anchovies in that brand], & serve with eggs for breakfast or veggies for dinner; even buttermilk ranch dressing is good on this.<br /><br />stir fry:<br /><br />brown burger & set aside, stir-fry onions, celery, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bean sprouts, mushrooms, radish slices, and/or water chestnuts (or whatever combination of veggies you like) as you would for any stir fry; add burger to reheat & serve with Ramen noodles or other pasta, on bread, or just as is, with soy sauce or Angustura Worcestershire sauce.  Buttermilk ranch dressing is good here, too.<br /><br />burgers:<br /><br />to each can of burger, add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 rib of finely chopped celery, 1/4 C. chopped green pepper (optional), 2 eggs, 1/2 C. cracker crumbs, 1/2 C. oatmeal; form into patties & brown over moderate heat [onions & celery must be done & raw eggs thoroughly cooked]; when crispy on both sides & done inside (about 7 min. per side), serve on buns, rolls, bread, or plate with mayo, ketchup, onions, pickles, tomato, sprouts, or other burger fixin's.<br /><br />casseroles:<br /><br />1 can burger browned with onions & celery, 1 tsp. sage, 1 can mushroom soup, 1/2 soup can milk, 6-8 oz. noodles (cooked),  16 oz. shredded cheddar cheese, 8 oz. Jack cheese; reserve half of the cheddar, mix all other ingredients together & put in greased casserole, top with remaining cheddar, bake covered at 350 F. for 1 hour, remove cover & bake 15 minutes more<br /><br />quick burger:<br /><br />open both ends of the can, push contents out a bit, slice carefully, & brown in skillet until very crispy on both sides (turn carefully) for a quick sandwich filling.  You can sprinkle on a bit of onion and/or garlic powder or other seasoning before turning the slices.<br /><br />Bon appetite!

Now that I have eaten this more, it has started to grow on me.  I wouldn't say that it tastes like ground meat per se, but it does taste good and it is an excellent substitute for ground meat in recipes.  I like to sautee some with onions and various spices to add to pasta sauce.  It's also good to use with taco seasoning for tacos...it's pretty versatile.  The fact that it's shelf stable is a bonus.

review/text: I bought this product because of the other reviews because I was not sure about the taste.  The other reviews were right as these were very much like meat and had a nice texture. You can use them just like hamburger.

review/summary: Good vegan alternative to ground beef
review/text: I use this in spaghetti sauce to give it texture.  Good as a vegetarian alternative to ground beef.  Very easy to crumble, though it's not dry.  Decent taste, but I'd suggest using it as an ingredient rather than eating it on its own.

review/summary: Pretty good. Gives boyfriend gas.
review/text: I am a vegetarian, and my boyfriend is not. I really like this product, and love it mixed in with scrambled eggs for breakfast, or in veggie Chili. Sometimes I eat it right out of the can if I am feling particularly lazy. It doesn't stick very well to itself, so it doesn't make very good burgers IME, even with a ingredients added to help it stick. Back to my boyfriend, this product gave him MAD GAS, and intestinal upset. He is afraid to eat it and asks me if I used "the canned burger stuff" before trying anything I cook. It digests just fine for me.

review/summary: The best meat alternative!
review/text: I have tried a lot of other types of proteins for meat replacement, but Worthington is by far the best. I can make tacos, burgers, meatballs with this and people who usually eat meat are still able to fully enjoy the dish!

review/summary: Great meat substitute for cooking
review/text: I have to admit I was nervous to try a canned product but I was very pleased. The appearance is not great coming out of the can but when you mold it or mix it in with other foods it's just like ground beef. The taste is very subtle, almost nothing, which I think is a great benefit because it will absorb the flavor of whatever you cook with it. In general I'm very happy with this product and I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I have never seen it in a store!

review/summary: excellent versatile veggy alternative
review/text: This mix is really great, you can use it in any number of dishes.  It's even reasonably good straight out of the can (though somewhat bland).  I use these for anything from burgers, to ground beef mix, to soup, to pasta, to hash browns.  This is a staple on my shelf, and will stay on my subscribe account.

review/summary: We really like the convenience
review/text: We bought a case from Amazon in February and will be subscribing soon. We eat a lot of Morningstar soy-burgers so I had respect for Worthington right away. I had been adding dry soy to my home-made vegetarian chili. Now we use the Vegetarian Burger in my chili, spaghetti, enchiladas and lasagna. The first time my wife used it for spaghetti she said it looked like dog food. We use it once or twice a month and we still refer to it jokingly as "dog food". The VB has not much of its own flavor which is typical of soy products so use spices liberally. I like the convenience. I can turn out a big pot of chili with about 20 minutes of preparation and very little mess. Saute peppers and onions, add diced tomatoes and beans, pop in the Worthington VB, add the chili spices, simmer for as long as you like.<br />This product is not for everyone but it works for me. We have a ready supply of burger substitute that requires no refrigeration, minimal preparation and has no possibility of the kind of contamination that sometimes pops up with ground beef products. We are not strict vegetarians. We use soy product for the convenience and health benefits.<br />A tip: to get all the product out of the can just open both ends and push it out.

review/summary: Great Diet Food
review/text: I started dieting from 211 lbs and got down to 179 before stuffing myself over Christmas, so I am back to 187 lbs 1/05/  I just received this product and am very pleased.  I only had about 1/4 of a can with some lima beans, and I am still full and satisfied 5 hours later.  Usually my stomach is grumbling about that time.  I just heated it up and it was a little plain without "fixings" so I added some ketchup and mustard and it was very tasty.  I can't wait to try more dishes with additional ingredients and am thrilled to have found a new delicious diet meal that seems to be working.  Amazon also makes ordering easy with Subscribe and Save shipments

review/text: I mostly used this to make taco meat. I also tried it in chili and it was good. The flavor is good but mild. It has a nice soft texture that's perfect for making meatloaf or salisbury steak. I like crumbled and fried Redi-Burger best as chili, taco meat, etc. because it has a savory flavor.

review/text: This is the second case we have ordered.  I am a vegetarian and always looking for a protein meal.  This is a flexible product that can be used in many ways.  We have used it in sauces and in meat loaf.  I mixed it with green peppers, onions and garlic and heated it in a skillet. I recommend it!

review/summary: Worthington Burger
review/text: I absolutely love this vegetarian burger.  All others I have tried don't even come close to this one.  For those who are not vegetarians, don't expect it to taste just like hamburger.  I haven't been able to convert the nonvegetarians in my family because it doesn't taste exactly like hamburger nor does it have the same consistancy. For me, it's a winner!

review/summary: Good product :-)
review/text: This type of vegetarian burger is both tasty and versatile. The taste isn't fancy; rather, it's unpretentious and delicious. As for being versatile, you can slice off a portion of it and fry it as hamburger; or you can slice off some, break it up and add it to rice, macaroni - or even off-the-shelf products intended for hamburger (in other words, something like Hamburger Helper or its store brand equivalent). When you use Super Saver shipping, it becomes even more cost-effective because the shipping cost is included in your purchase - and, during a recession, every penny counts.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: First I ordered a case of Loma Linda Vege-Burger.  It was disappointing--a whoooole case of disappointing.  I thought that my memories from youth of how good canned vegeburger had been must have been overblown.  Then I tried this Worthington Vegetarian Burger.  This is exactly what I remembered.  The big problem is I can't stop eating it.  I love eating it straight out of the can!  The texture is great, the flavor is great, it crumbles nicely--easy to use.  Calories are moderate as well.  Good imitation meats help me resist eating the real thing, and this product is perfect for me.

review/text: I use this stuff in many things.  Lasagne, Hamburger Helper, spaghetti sause, etc.  My meat-eating husband loves it.  I'm from-birth vegetarian and didn't know that it was imitating chopped animal until I attained a certain age of understanding.  At any rate - I highly recommend it.  Most delicious.  Use it in anything that you would use hamburger.

review/summary: Wonderful and very versitile
review/text: I use this all the time in cooking.  I make chili and taco filling with it.  I use it to make a vegetarian meatloaf, browned to go in spagetti or on pizza, make a Vegeburger mix with it and so much more.  Great flavor and texture.  It is extrememly versitile.  Tender, yet just the right amount of chewiness to it.  I've used this product for years and we are so glad to find it available on Amazon.

review/summary: Worthington Vegetarian
review/text: Whoever Worthington Vegetarian uses to ship is a very POOR shipper!<br />Over HALF  (6) of the cans of Burger I received were DENTED.  I<br />am too nervous to use them.  What I have used is not the best Vegi<br />product I have tasted.  The Texture is pretty close to real meat but<br />WE really do not like the flavor.  I have to OVER season it with a lot of<br />Heat spices or mix it with real meat for my son to even nibble at it.<br />The entire reason I paid soooo much $44.00 for it was to help convert  my son away from real burger.  Forget that! He'll never trust me again.<br />So I will Never trust Worthington again.
