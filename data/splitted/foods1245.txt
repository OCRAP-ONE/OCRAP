review/summary: Doggie crack
review/text: After searching for this product to return to market, I found that not only did Amazon have it, but that their pricing was the best. Not that it's cheap. These treats are kind of pricey, even though they are made in China. Who knew that even dog treats came from there. But my dogs absolutely love these. This is one of the only treats that never gets refused, and I mean never.<br /><br />The only problem with the product has been uneven availability.

review/summary: My Yorkie loves these so much that she actually gets posessive of it...
review/text: We have given my dog many types of treats and she's liked them all. But with these, she LOVES them.<br /><br />I recently bought a handful of these from a local boutique dog store and my dog was so ecstatic to have them. After we gave her one, she became a bit posessive of it (which she has never done with any of her food or toys or anything!) We tried to (jokingly) take it away from her but she growled a little.<br /><br />I know you might think it's a bad thing for her to love her treats, but it was her birthday so she deserved a little something different.

review/summary: Decent colors mostly
review/text: I got these with my first airgun - have used them as a spray and with a paintbrush.<br />With the airbrush - they can clog if you use them straight. So, I'd recommend some vodka or vanilla/lemon extract to thin it down. May have to spray a few times, but better than heavy spray turning into no spray - then having to clean the tip to try again. Some colors just seem to work well, others are meh.<br />Paintbrush - obviously you're going to have better coverage. My daughter and I used these and the normal colors to paint easter eggs this year - came out cool but they didn't fully dry with the weather we had.<br /><br />Worth getting, I will be buying replacements when I run out. The pearl is nice to finish off a paint job.

review/summary: Old, Outdated Dog Treats...Made my dogs puke!
review/text: Prior to this purchase, I had been a staunch supporter of Dog Nips brand (previously "Free Range" brand) chicken wrapped apple treats.  And, perhaps it's just this particular merchant that sold me old, outdated dog treats.?  But in any case, they made both my dog & my parent's dog puke.<br /><br />Only after both dogs became sick did I closely inspect the bags for an expiration date.  The only thing I could find was an imprint on the front that said "LOT # 20110305."  I took this as an expiration date of March 5, 2011.  I just recently bought the treats (in October 2011,) so they were very outdated!  When I received them, the chicken had indeed appeared somewhat darker in color than other bags I've bought in the past, but I didn't think a whole lot of it.  After the dogs became sick, however, I felt I had to discontinue feeding them to our dogs.  3 BAGS & APPROXIMATELY $50 DOWN THE DRAIN!<br /><br />I was very unhappy with the purchase, and I wouldn't recommend ever buying doog food or treats online because of this experience!

But the price of 3 bags pushing $50 is what put me over the top. One of my dogs is Newfie, so 3 bags is a snack. I don't like this buying from China and being charged a quality 'Made In America' price. It's a dog treat for pete's sake. I guess my babies will have to do w/o this poor quality high priced item.

The treats are not hard so it's easy for the princess to chew. lol  I give it to her whole...normally anything I give her has to be cut up in tiny pieces.<br /><br />Okay, now here is my big concern. I just realized they are "Made In China".<br />I don't like this. With all the tainted products out there, the majority come from China. Take a LQQK at FDA recalls...veterinary. I am not saying that this product is bad, it may not be & than it may be bad for dogs.<br />I have to research it further, as we all should do before letting our pets eat treats & food.  I hope this is okay for my dog since it is the only treat that she'll eat.

review/text: These are really great dog treats!  My dog loves them.  They are made of good ingredients, and a low fat alternative to many types of "dog biscuits". So definitely helpful in keeping him at a healthy weight while still being able to treat.  He loves all of the varieties as well!

review/text: With 3 picky dogs was not sure how these would fare, but they loved these biscuits immediately. Even my super picky dog begged for more. Although when I first got them I gave too many and they were not used to them digestivally. Make all food transitions gradually, even if they are all natural.

review/text: Thank you Amazon for carrying this bulk box of Dog Biscuits! Seriously, 20lbs of medium sized dog treats will last a LONG time.<br />I wanted to buy in bulk since my Dogs are constantly going through treats and I don't feel like its worth it to spend money over and over on snacks that only last a few days in my house.<br />This is how I will be buying their cookies from now on. :o)

review/summary: Great snack gifts, great little chest to re-use
review/text: My sister sent my family this spicy snack chest for Christmas, and we've been enjoying it for days.  It comes with lots of packs of spicy snack mixes, cheeses, summer sausage, crackers, etc.  None of the items are "take your head off" spicy, but all of them are at least a little spicy.  The picture here on Amazon doesn't show it, but it actually comes in a small wicker chest with a hinged lid that snaps shut.  I'm as happy with the chest as I am with the snacks inside, and plan to use it to attractively store needlepoint supplies.<br /><br />I'm taking away one star because the chest was ordered on Dec 18 and we didn't get it until Dec 28.  No big deal, since we still had company to entertain after Christmas, but if I had ordered it to be a Christmas gift I would have been upset that it arrived late.

review/text: My kids have been eating these as a "healthy" snack for a couple of years.  We are on a special diet that restricts food dyes, artificial colors, and preservatives, and we thought we were safe eating this until I recently looked at the box and it said that it contained BHT or one of the preservatives, and I was not happy at all.  This is an organic company, and I don't understand how they could do this.  This is the only brand on the market that is affordable and supposedly healthy.

review/summary: A Snack for My Daughter and Me!
review/text: I had not thought about purchasing these Annie's Organic Cheddar Snack Mix at Amazon until my sister-in-law told me about Annie's products being available on here.<br /><br />A reviewer previously mentioned that BHT was a listed ingredient in this product and it scared me, too, since I thought I read the ingredients thoroughly and knew what each ingredients were.  I'm happy to report that there is NO BHT, at least on the boxes I've purchased from my local farmers market grocery store. They had a sale and I swiped the shelf clean. hehe<br /><br />My daughter prefers the pretzels and I eat the bunnies and an occasional pretzel. If it was made with less sodium, it would be even better! Crunch, crunch, crunch!<br /><br />So here are the ingredients listed in order on the six boxes I recently purchased, if you're interested in knowing:<br /><br />- organic wheat flour<br />- organic expeller pressed vegetable oil (organic sunflower, organic canola, organic safflower and/or organic soy)<br />- salt<br />- organic valley(R) organic cheddar cheese (organic pasteurized milk, cheese culture, salt, non-animal enzymes)<br />- organic cane sugar<br />- organic whey<br />- yeast<br />- organic barley malt<br />- organic butter<br />- yeast extract<br />- color (organic annatto, paprika extract)<br />- natural cheese flavor<br />- organic onion<br />- organic garlic<br />- baking soda<br />- organic paprika<br />- citric acid<br />- lactic acid<br />- sodium phosphate<br />- organic celery seed

They're very crisp and light, they don't gum up your mouth or make you feel like you need to drink 3 gallons of water.  SO good and surprisingly inexpensive for an organic snack!

review/summary: Love this tea
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the White Ayurvedic Chai with the  Samurai Chai Mate and they taste fantastic together. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out to find your favorite. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one. They use German rock sugar (which they sell) and that costs a little more. Most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea and drink happy.

review/summary: Great Bar for Breakfast
review/text: These are great bars and I became used to having one each morning. The taste is addictive and if you're a chocolate or snickers lover you're really going to like them.  Nothing like eating a "healthy" candy bar for breakfast, and now I have to hide them from my third grader!<br /><br />Unfortunately, my local Wal-Mart quit carrying them (as did everyone else), and Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them.  Luckily, the price here is cheaper than they were with Wal-Mart.

review/text: I used to buy these bars from my local Walmart to eat as a snack / breakfast.  I am marathon runner (9 and counting) and while I wouldn't eat these during a run I definitely feel like they leave me feeling fuller and stay with me as a result of the higher protein levels compared to "junk food".  They are a nice way to indulge my sweet tooth and feel OK about it.  For a while they were the only reason I would go to Walmart as I couldn't find them anywhere else.  Then they stopped carrying them. So thank you amazon for starting to carry these!  You have made my year :)

review/summary: A superior coffee
review/text: I am rather hard to please with 'straight' (unflavored) coffee.  I don't like any bitterness, nor too strong a taste, but yet want a rich coffee flavor that can stand up to a large mug.  I've found this Kenyan AA to have all the qualities that make a satisfying morning coffee.  To me, it tastes like really good coffee is supposed to.  I've tried many types of K cup coffees and this is always the one I come back to.  I enjoy flavored coffees for later in the day, but my first morning cup needs to be 'pure' and to me, this is as pure and rich as it comes.  If it were wine, it would be called smooth and full-bodied.  If it were chocolate, it would be semi-sweet.  In fact, it reminds me of chocolate because of the roundness of its flavor.<br /><br />For those who like 'rocket fuel' type coffee, this will seem too mild, but to the coffee drinker who prefers medium or even light roast coffee and wants something deeply satisfying, this really fits the bill.<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon would sell it in those big 'frustration free' boxes.  I'd sure buy it.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Really good coffee, but (today) inflated internet price
review/text: This became my favorite coffee after spending a week in Kenya.  While I continue to search for the "right" beans and/or ground Kenyan AA coffee by which to duplicate the "real deal", the appeal of K-Cups--for both home use as well as to insert in my office's Keurig machine--was too much to resist.  I was happy to find the Kenyan AA K-Cups on Amazaon.  However, based on its availability at another just-discovered internet site, it does not make sense to pay 36-60% more (depending on quantity purchased) from Amazon.com, even though I so value its excellent service.

review/text: I love this coffee!  Unfortunately, the only way to get your attention is to give it one star, and I do so because of the pricing issue.  Do not buy the larger quantity.  Order 2 boxes of 24 instead.  Do the math.  You will pay much more if you order 48 than if you order two boxes of 24.  Shame on Amazon.  Those in a hurry may automatically assume there is a savings if they place an order for the larger quantity.  They will be wrong, and feel duped.

Using different thickeners like flour, arrow root, corn starch, etc, you can fine-tune the consistency of the rue to your liking.<br /><br />You may have to add salt, sugar, maybe even more heat to balance out the flavor, but this is an excellent base to start with.

review/summary: Chocolate Heresy! Not the same Hershey Cocoa it used to be
review/text: I have been buying and using Hershey unsweetened powdered cocoa for over 30 years now.  It was pretty good stuff for the price, and always reliable.  Alas, imagine my dismay to bite into a chocolaty-looking brownie made with the same recipe I've used for years, and taste -- blah.  Blah?  From a BROWNIE?  Gasp!  What was this?  No rich, dark, pungent, distinctly chocolate flavor?  Brown, yes.  Chocolate, barely.  If you'd put a blindfold on me, I'd have been hard put to figure out what I was eating.<br /><br />You know the difference between REAL chocolate and those cheap, waxy brown little fake foil-wrapped abominations you can buy at the discount store to placate the neighborhood trolls every October?  Well, that's the difference between good old reliable Hershey cocoa of yore, and the stuff they're trying to pass off as cocoa now.<br /><br />I was aware that Hershey had removed cocoa butter and other quality ingredients from all their ready-to-eat chocolate products a couple of years ago and replaced them with vegetable shortenings, soy, emulsifiers, and God-knows-what-else.  But I naively thought Hershey cocoa powder had escaped a similar flavor hijacking, chemically-enhanced adulteration.  I was so, so wrong.  The ingredient list says, "COCOA."  Trust me, this is NOT the same cocoa it used to be.  And it's so, so wrong what Hershey has done to it.<br /><br />It's sad when an American tradition falls to the greed of a big corporation cutting corners.

review/summary: Delish! Serious size for seriuos Chocoholics
review/text: This large container is 3" x 5" x 6", it is perfect for cooking and baking for chocoholics like me!<br /><br />I like:<br />1. This powder has rich yet delicate chocolate flavor<br />2. 100% cocoa<br />3. It is unsweetened, so you can control how sweet the final result is<br />4. Economical size, best per oz price if you use a lot of chocolate powder<br /><br />I don't like:<br />Nothing!<br /><br />There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder: Dutch-processed and Natural. Natural cocoa is an acid. Dutch-processed cocoa is treated with an alkali to neutralize the acid. As a result Dutch-processed cocoa is has more delicate chocolate flavor and no bitterness, while Natural cocoa power has more intense deeper chocolate flavor with a bit of bitterness.<br /><br />Note that this why (its neutrality) Dutch-Processed Coca Powder does not react with baking soda, it must be used in recipes with baking powder.<br /><br />I found that I enjoy some bitterness when I eat a good chocolate bar or a brownie, but I prefer not to have that bit of bitterness when I eat a chocolate cake.

review/summary: Cocoa Powder With Rich Chocolate Flavor
review/text: LOTS of chocolate powder--this box measures 3" x 5" by 6"!  But it's the perfect size for me, now that I'm making my own chocolate ice cream.<br /><br />This excellent "Dutch process" powder imparts a full, rich, delicious chocolate flavor to ice cream (and presumably to hot cocoa, cakes, cookies, or anything else you might use it for).  It's real cocoa--100% natural unsweetened cocoa. This is the same Hershey's cocoa powder that is sold in grocery stores in 8-oz. boxes.  By purchasing this "economy size", I paid about 55 cents per ounce (including Amazon Prime shipping), instead of about 69 cents per ounce (for three 8-oz. boxes at a local store).
