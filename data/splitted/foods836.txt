review/summary: Hard Not to Eat the Whole Batch Yourself!
review/text: This is my latest discovery from Bear Creek.  Very tasty!  I had a tiny bit of corn and asparagus in the house, so I added those.  As other reviewers have said, it is terrific as is or with some added chicken, meat, or vegetables.  Love to have this on hand for a super quick and tasty meal when everyone is running different directions.  Two thumbs up!!

review/summary: "cheddar potato" not bad for a quick meal (GLUTEN FREE)
review/text: On my quest to find some easy Gluten Free meals to add to the ''easy list'' I happen to come across this and figured it would be worth a try (at Giant Eagle for $4.00). I was actually pretty excited to try it after reading all the positive reviews, but I really hate to say it....but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. I'm wondering if maybe it was just the "Cheddar Potato" flavor kind??? I did add some bacon to it, but it just had an 'after taste' to it??? Don't get me wrong... for a quick/easy meal I'm sure you could doctor it up some, as I also added some cheddar cheese which 'did' help take away the after taste some... guess there's just nothing to compare to homemade?!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I use this soup mix as a base for pot pie filling. I purchased it first at Costco and was sorely disappointed when they discontinued carrying it. Finally, I searched Amazon and viola! It is good even by itself on cold days, though I add spices for a pop. For my pot pies, I add a variety of things like cooked and diced chicken, veggies, white pepper, fresh minced garlic, minced onion, etc. Line little pie tins with dough from scratch, fill with prepared  soup concoction, top with dough, press finger marks along the the edges and it's ready to pop in the oven or freezer for future use (from freezer, great for home cooked last minute meals). I highly recommend this soup mix.

review/text: I usually add a cup of whipping cream to the cheddar broccoli soup and everyone loves it.  The last time I made the potato soup, I microwaved a bag of Ore Ida "Steam 'n Mash Russet Potatoes" (do not mash the potatoes) and added them to the soup. I usually serve it with shredded cheese and crumbled bacon on top.

review/summary: DELICIOUSLY ADDICTIVE SOUP
review/text: This is one of my favorite soups.  It is so delicious and easy to make.  I have tried most of the Bear Creek soups which are all delicious but this is one of the best.  Just add 8 cups of water (for the 12.1 ounce bag) and it makes a lot of product for the money.  I make it just for my husband and myself and we each have a great big mug and store the rest in the fridge.  It lasts for many days and tastes just as delicious after a few days.<br /><br />I also use the left over soup as broth to make a fish stew.  I simply put the soup in a pot on top of the stove and add cut up fish fillets, cut up shrimp, some crabmeat if available and add steamed vegetables like peas, carrots, corn niblets, cut up potatoes and whatever else is handy.  It only needs to cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the fish fillets are flaky.<br /><br />All I can say is FANTASTIC.  Try this soup and any other flavors that appeal to you.  You can't go wrong.  In case you are wondering; I don't work for the company.  I am a foody that knows delicious when I find it.  Enjoy!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25WNQ">Bear Creek Country Kitchens Cheddar Potato Soup Mix, 12.1 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Bear Creek Cheddar Potato Soup Mix
review/text: All you have to add is water and the soup is done!  Of course I add a few scallions and real bacon bits to make it taste even better!  You can't tell it's not like the first course in a 5 star restaurant!  I'm not advertising for Bear Creek!  Try it for yourself if you don't believe me.  My son invited us over for lunch one afternoon and said he was having "potato soup" and I was a bit hesitant at first... but after the first bite, I was a believer!  Don't forget the real bacon bits, and scallions...... (and he added a bit of grated cheese).  All of these extra ingredients were sort of a topping!  Mmmmmmnnnnhhhhh........ Good stuff!

review/summary: Yum! Excellent cold weather soup
review/text: For an easy to make warm Fall/Winter soup this satisfies the entire family.<br /><br />To make this, I heat 8 cups of water (10 if I'm doing add-ins) and then add the hot water to the crock pot, then wisk in the soup mix. Within a half hour the soup is ready to eat, but the flavor profile improves tremendously with a veggie and a meat add-in and a few hours on low in the crock pot. I either add shredded chicken and broccoli (or asparagus) OR a pound of Hillshire Farm Miller High Life Beer Brats and a 16 oz bag of frozen corn. I pre-grill and slice the brats first to add a slightly grilled flavor to the soup.<br /><br />Either way, the soup is yummy, warm, and very filling. To complete the meal you can add a green salad and some crusty bread.

review/summary: Lower sodium?
review/text: I bought this after reading many positive reviews, and because I'd bought the potato soup in single-serving size envelopes many years ago.  The product page in Amazon describes it as "lower sodium," and the preparation instructions end with "salt and pepper to taste."  Folks, this has almost 1000mg of sodium in a one-cup serving.  A more realistic two-cup bowl is almost 2000--that's higher in sodium than any of the canned soups I eat.  It's my own fault for not checking the nutrition info before ordering, and I'd have sent it back--but it's not eligible for return.  If you're looking for "lower sodium" soup look elsewhere.

Instead of water, I add 1 jar of pimentos, and 1/2 cup jalepenos with the juice, and add 1 cup of frozen (do not thaw) corn.  I also add 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Then it has to bake for 45 minutes.  It comes out very moist, and very addicting!

review/summary: Best cornbread I've ever tasted!
review/text: For years, I've been looking for cornbread like Mom used to make.  I've finally found it.  Pamela's cornbread mix has it all.  It's quick and easy to prepare and it tastes heavenly.  All the make-from-scratch recipes I've tried tend to be rather dry.  Pamela's cornbread is delightfully moist and it stays moist if you don't get it all eaten at once.  In fact, it's so moist it tastes good even without butter.  It has just the right degree of sweetness.  You can also make cornbread muffins from it and I've discovered they freeze well.  In addition, Pamela provides variations on the recipe if you're looking for something a little different.  I have no hesitation in giving this product a resounding five stars.  I like it so well I order it from Amazon in bulk.

review/text: I like the fact that the recipe provides alternative to some of the ingredients like sugar (replace with honey) and butter (replace with canola oil), which we did since we have moved into more consciousness in the ingredients we are consuming.  The honey option definately tastes better than cane sugar (our other alternative to white and refined sugar); otherwise, it was not that sweet and a bit gritty.<br /><br />I am just pleased to have a package ready that I only need to throw in a few addtional ingredients and I have cornready within 30 minutes.  The mixture made two very small loaf tins, which is enough for four-six people: nice portions.

I use it for muffins all the time, to have with soups, stews, etc.  Two hints:  use UNSALTED butter, and use the full amount -- don't try to go low-fat or they're no good.  Also, because I'm usually serving them with savory things and don't want them sweet, I use only  2 T of sugar.  They come out perfectly every time.  If you were serving them for breakfast you'd probably want at least 1/3 c. sugar.

review/text: After going gluten free/ casein free last year I've been on a mission for cake mixes, bread mixes, etc that don't leave a bad after taste.  I finally found the BEST cornbread in this mix and everyone in our family was pleased! I used 1/3 C honey instead of 1/2 C sugar and unsweetened Coconut Milk (SoDelicious brand) instead of the water.  They were extremely moist and tasted like true cornbread.  If you are wary of spending more $ on trying out yet another mix (I've been there plenty of times) then I would suggest buying a single bag at the store (I think mine was $3.99 at WholeFoods) to see if you like it. I think you'll be impressed!

review/summary: Worked for this cornbread connoisseur!!!!
review/text: I still can't believe it's gluten free! I made this for the first time today.  I am eating a piece (actually my 5th!!!) right now and sooo happy cause I thought I had to choose between cornbread and abdominal pain/bloating, which is a tough choice for a stereotypical African American like me who grew up on soul food. What was I going to eat beans and greens with?  I used halved the sugar in the sweet cornbread recipe since I don't like sweet cornbread.  My only complaint was that it wasn't brown on the top the way I like, but that was quickly rectified with some Pam spray on top and popping it in the broiler for a minute. The sides and top were crispy, and the inside was soft and delicious!<br /><br />I know one reviewer complained about grains, this is because Pamela's used organic cornmeal, which is not as processed. I do the same thing when I make it, and I love it that way!<br /><br />I guarantee you I could serve this to my family and they wouldn't know the difference, except maybe the absence of the heavy feeling cornbread usually gives us.

review/text: I was soo craving some cornbread dressing to go with my turkey....I thought I would have to give it up. I knew I liked Pamela's products and took a chance and bought the 6pack on here. It was SOOO great! I am the only one who needs gluten free and sometimes my friends complain about foods I make or can tell right away that it's GF. NOT WITH THIS MIX!!  I waited until dinner was almost complete and asked if everyone was satisfied and if everything tasted like it should....they all said it was amazing! That's when I told them the cornbread dressing was GF and the gravy was as well since I used Pamela's baking mix to make the gravy!!<br /><br />The other day I was making chili and told me husband how nice it would be to have some cornbread with it. In NO time he whipped up a mix and it made a dozen muffins.<br /><br />We are not used to sweet cornbread so I did not put the sugar in the dressing...but we tried half of what was suggested in the muffins and they were good too.<br /><br />I feel like I got a part of my life back and am able to enjoy the things I love to eat now. So happy!!

review/text: I love Pamela's products.  I get consistently tasty results that please even the non-gluten free eaters, the cornbread is no exception.  In addition to making cornbread and corn muffins with this mix, I also make corn pancakes and waffles.  When the bread is done it is very moist and stays together well for gluten free bread.

review/summary: you won't believe it's gluten free
review/text: The best gluten free cornbread mix by far. Just add eggs, oil (or butter) and water.  It's not dry like other gluten free mixes I've tried. We almost always use the cheese cornbread recipe (on the bag).  I really like the low fat version - then I don't feel so guilty adding the cheese!

review/text: This is one bread product that both the gluten free and non gluten free family members in my house love.  I don't even make any gluten corn bread anymore.  My family's favorite recipe is the cheese corn bread recipe found on the bag.  This corn bread comes out so moist and delicious.  We are very familiar with products that taste "gluten free" and this isn't one of them.  We are big fans of Pamela's in our house.

review/text: I'm new at this Glutten free diet so I ordered the Cornbread and muffin mix thinking that it was probably not going to be that good but I made the Cranberry Orange muffin recipe on the side of the package and I was pleasantely suprised at how good they taste. I even used Splenda instead of sugar and they turned out ok. I think I will increase the cranberries to a cup the next time I make them.

review/text: Tried a couple different ones, and they were ok. I thought Pamela's cornbread was really good. Also think that bit of sugar and melting the butter instead of oil really gives it a moist sweet taste. You wouldn't think it would be hard to find a gluten free cornbread. This is suppose to be corn and not wheat!!!!

review/summary: Best packaged cornbread I've eaten
review/text: A friend was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and I wanted to help her find food she can eat.  So I purchased this product and tested it to see if it was OK before I gave to her.  I don't like a really sweet cornbread so used half the sugar.  Wow, it was so good.  The butter gave it such a great flavor that it was perfect alone.  My husband is picky about everything and I gave it to him and he ate it.  (Though he prefers the sweet Jiffy mix.)  I will be purchasing this for us to eat, even though we don't need to be gluten free.

review/text: This is a very soft cheese, with 35 calories per wedge and about 1.5 grams of fat. So if you love cheese, but you don't love the fat, you can spread this on your crackers with good conscience.<br /><br />If you can find the Queso Fresco & Chipotle version (not sold here yet), I highly recommend it. The chipotle flavor is snappy and gives a mild heat; the queso fresco is not like Mexican fresh cheese but it is a creamy mild white cheese that goes well with Triscuits or toasted pita.

Swiss is my favorite flavor because I can dip both the sweet and savory Medifast pretzels in them.  I have also melted them down to pour over grilled chicken.  Amazing product for very little calories and little to no carbs.<br /><br />However, this price is quite high in contrast with typical retail prices.

review/summary: It'll Tickle Your Dairy Bone!
review/text: I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.<br /><br />I know that laughter can be contagious. And the little heifer on the Laughing Cow package looks like she just heard a real udder-slapper of a doozie. But the 'have you laughed today' slogan? Can a nibble of cheese really give you the giggles? I doubted it.<br /><br />I tried some on a cracker, and felt myself chuckle. Another bite, and the yuks kept coming. By the time I was halfway done, I was cackling like a hyena hopped up on laughing gas. The cheese was tasty enough, but the experience was sort of uncomfortable.<br /><br />(If you've ever laughed so hard you shot milk out your nose, take a word of advice: it's a whole lot easier in the liquid phase. Upsnorting cheese feels like passing kidney stones through your nostrils -- and everything around me smelled like a wedge of cheddar for a week.)<br /><br />To my surprise, this is one product slogan that's actually true, in an unnerving sort of way. It's delicious with crackers, but you might want to try pairing it with a sad movie or a funeral dirge. Or a Heimlich maneuver. Otherwise, it may be the cheese that has the last laugh.

review/text: I buy Roland peppers at a local restaurant supply store, but the prices from Amazon are better so I'm switching.  Roland roasted red peppers have a deep pepper flavor, and the texture is always just right.  Unlike some other brands of roasted red peppers, these do not have vinegar or additives that might interfere with your recipe.  I use them in many recipes that I would fresh peppers, adding to the recipe at the last minute.  I find them almost addictive!

review/summary: nice firm peppers in the past - not so firm now
review/text: It is now 2012 -- I will leave my original review below, but need to note that the last time I purchased the Roland peppers I was very disappointed because they were on the mushy side.  Not totally mushy, but definitely not as firm as they were a couple years ago.  Things do change over time.  And -- Amazon has the DeLallo brand in oil with garlic in stock again so that is what we are eating.<br /><br />Here is the original review I wrote in 2009:<br /><br />These are the second best roasted red peppers I've purchased.  The best ones were DeLallo, lightly marinated in olive oil and whole garlic....but I can't find that particular brand anymore.<br /><br />The texture is very firm and the cans are packed quite full so you really get your money's worth.  You can even divide the large can and put portions in small freezer containers and they are just as good after being frozen and then thawed. I use red peppers in a lot of salads and spreads because we don't eat tomatoes and I will definitely purchase these again.<br /><br />The only thing I would criticize is that there is a bit too much of the charred skin on the peppers, but it is not too difficult to clean off -- and you expect some of that when you get roasted peppers.

review/text: These roasted red peppers are the same as I've purchased in smaller glass jars under different brands.  They are good for salads, with cold cuts, and in various recipes.  The peppers are flavorful, firm, and the skin has been roasted enough so it it not tough.  My only disappointment was that the can showed a picture of whole peppers so I thought I would be receiving large pieces of peppers.  The can contains narrow roasted strips.

review/summary: Excess packaging is kept to a minimum and tastes great
review/text: While individual bagged teas are convenient for traveling, they produce a good deal of waste.  When at home, I prefer loose teas.  SerendipiTea makes some of the best teas.  They are fragrant and fresh and use earth-friendly packaging.  After trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00117O2M8">SerendipiTea Burroughs' Brew, Organic Black Tea & Coconut, 4-Ounce Box</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64FQ">SerendipiTea Buccaneer, Indian Black Tea, Toasted Coconut, Chocolate, Vanilla & Rooibos Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and drinking cup after cup, I felt confident their Mint tea would be just as good and it has met expectations.<br /><br />The SerendipiTea Organic Mint is delightfully fresh.  I love dipping a few of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGUYQA">Anna's Thins, Chocolate Mint, 5.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>in this tea. It is a simple tea. You know what you are drinking.  There is no flavor confusion that accompanies some teas. I'm a huge fan and recommend it to any mint fan.  For brewing purposes, I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters, Blue and Green</a>.<br /><br />If you don't want to fiddle with loose teas while traveling, two brands exist that are also very fresh and very minty.  They are Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Peppermint Tea Box 20 Tea Bags and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PGSL5K">Harney & Sons Fine Teas Organic Peppermint - 50 Tea bags</a>.<br /><br />As an aside, while some have had difficulty with bags breaking open after being shipped from SerendipiTea, I've never had a problem.  I started buying the company's products in the spring of 2011 and they did use a thinner plant-derived material for the inner bag that held the tea, which I could see might be prone to breaking open.  The last several purchases I have made from the company still use a plant-derived bag for holding the tea but this bag is much sturdier in composition.

review/text: The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chilies known to man. So it comes as no surprise that this sauce is very hot on a drop by drop basis. There is nothing wrong with that! In fact, I prefer a very potent hot sauce. However there is a nasty and bitter aftertaste to this sauce which I don't think anyone would like.<br /><br />Note: there is no smoke flavor to this sauce despite what another reviewer says. I suspect this reviewer was confused and was thinking of a chipotle sauce (which is made by this manufacturer and many others). A chipotle sauce has a wonderful smoked flavor to it but this sauce does not use that chile and there is not even a hint of a smoked taste to this one.<br /><br />This sauce is very potent but beyond that considerable heat there is little else other than a nasty and bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Not recommended

review/summary: Palatable, but cheats on the wheat.
review/text: I'm loyal to De Cecco for regular semolina pasta. Unfortunately its whole wheat fusilli (this product is fusilli despite the wrong picture) is only better than OK.  The taste is fine, not bitter at all, but the texture is difficult to get right, and resists binding with sauce.  I suggest creamier sauces that bring their own cling.  Note also that De Cecco's "whole wheat" pastas are not made with 100% whole wheat, but "enriched whole wheat" flour -- an euphemism for highly processed wheat.

review/summary: 6 y/o & 2 y/o love them
review/text: I love the organic ingredients & portability.  They love the taste.  Every flavor we have tried so far has been a hit - grape, strawberry, sour apple (think granny smith - just tart enough but not really sour), mixed berry & tropical.<br />A winner all around for us in the snack catagory.<br /><br />Price here on Amazon is very, very good compared to my grocery store where you can buy these individually for about a dollar each.<br />I think you can also find these at Starbucks for about the same dollar a piece if you want to try before buying.<br /><br />I find them to be very similar to Stretch Island fruit strips in both flavor, texture & stickiness.<br />Not too sticky for eating out, but wet wipes always come in handy!<br /><br />We used to be on the subscribe program for a monthly delivery for additional savings, but the 4 variety pack is no longer in stock & this one isn't being offered on S&S.  (Which is a darned shame!)  You can get the single flavors on S&S but we really like the variety packs best.

review/summary: First Grade Class Tasting
review/text: We are a first grade class (ages 6-7).  We bought these Fruit Ropes to try as part of our opinion writing unit.  We ended up having different opinions after sampling each flavor.  Here are our thoughts:<br /><br />:) These Fruit Rope snacks were very good.  We would buy them again.  Although the flavors tasted similar, they were all deliciously tart.  The strawberry flavor was our favorite because it tasted sweeter and smelled like real strawberries.<br /><br />:( We didn't really like the Fruit Ropes so much.  The taste of all three flavors was sour.  They got stuck in our teeth and were kind of hard to bite.  We wish that you could make them taste more like the fruit shown on the wrapper.

review/text: I bought these as a sweet treat for lunch boxes. Cliff is a favorite at our house, so I wasn't too concerned about quality. When I got these and read the ingredients, I was completely miffed that all 3 flavors have no other substance but apple. I will probably go back to buying the stretch island fruit because they actually include in the ingredients the fruit that is the flavor on the front label.

review/summary: Remember how flavorful the original Fruit Roll-Ups were years ago?
review/text: The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit is impressively reminiscent of the original Fruit Roll-ups I enjoyed during my childhood. I have tried many different fruit snacks as an adult and could not find any that had that great zing of flavor that I remember Fruit Roll-Ups had in the 1980's. Well, these fruit ropes are what those Roll-Ups used to be!! They are tangy and fruity. They are wonderful. I highly recommend these despite the cost. Fruit Roll-Ups are now plastic and sugar flavored. Clif Kids are THE BEST fruit snack you will taste. I promise! I've tried them ALL.

review/summary: Thought they would be close to twizzlers, but not so lucky
review/text: I have a kid who comes home from school, when Dr. Oz comes on, so she pays a lot of attention to nutrition information and ingredients wants to eat healthier.  We saw these at Costco and read some reviews on Amazon for a healthier alternative to Twizzlers because she really likes Twizzlers and it got a low score on the Fooducate App.  My daughter ripped them open and tasted them, but she didn't like them, said there was an after taste.  However, I did give them to my other daughter's track coach and they have become pretty popular with some of the middle school kids, which will probably be the only reason why I would buy these again.

These are portable, easy to hold for little hands, the ropes as opposed to fruit strips can also come in handy with teething.  Like all fruit rollup style creations they are sticky, so a hand wipe can be helpful, mostly if you have a messy eater.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: I used to get these at Sams Club every now and then, but got tired of them after a bit. They are quite tangy and very chewy. I tried sharing with my seven and eight year old nieces, but only one would eat them. She thought they were okay, but her sister took a bite and decided she hated them. I would recommend buying a few different flavors as singles if you can find them locally. It's a bit too expensive to buy them that way all the time, but you should try the different flavors before you commit to buying them here. Some people love them, others hate them.

In my local grocery store, these are $.99 each, so buying them in bulk like this (especially if you do Subscribe & Save) really saves money.<br />All the flavors are very nice, and not too sweet. They hold up very well as a snack to shove in a backpack or purse and are fun enough to keep my kids from begging for the artificially-colored "fruit" snacks so many of their friends bring to school.

Fortunately, I like apples, but if you're looking for variety in flavor you'll be disappointed here.
