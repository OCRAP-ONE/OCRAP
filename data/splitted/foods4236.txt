review/summary: Tastes exactly like its supposed to!
review/text: I really couldn't avoid trying Green Mountain's Golden French Toast after reading all the rave reviews.  I hadn't come across another maple flavor yet and wanted to see how that kind of blend would taste coming out of my Keurig.  I wasn't disappointed at all!<br /><br />This blend tastes exactly the way it's supposed to!  Well, okay, maybe not sugary at all but the maple and cinnamon is spot on.  This smells delicious while being brewed and is perfect on a night like tonight to keep warm while snow is dumping all over the city of Chicago outside.<br /><br />I think this tastes best with a little milk to soften the cinnamony flavor.  Really lovely.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is my favorite of the flavored coffees (that right is reserved for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHOITE">Timothy's World Coffee Winter Carnival K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> which tastes AMAZING!), but it's pretty good.  I'll pick up another box when we run out of our back stock of different k cup favors.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a try!

review/text: I got this flavor in the Holiday Pack and it was one of my favorites. I usually don't like a lot of artificial maple flavor, but the flavor in this K-cup is wonderful! It really reminds me of the best French Toast I ever had! As soon as it starts brewing, you start to smell the wonderful aroma and it reminds you of when you were a kid and your mom made French toast just for you! I've never seen these available on their own, so it was exciting to find them here!

review/text: I'm a big fan of flavored coffee, because black coffee is a little too strong for me.  This flavor is pretty good.  The smells while it is brewing is great.  The taste really is close to french toast.  I drink this sometimes on the weekend or at night when wanting something sweet.  It's one of the better flavored cups that I've tried so I would recommend.

review/text: In my family we like to try special flavor type k-cups. I purchased this one without expectation, it was pretty good. In fact we went through the box no time and we probably have 20 different k-cups to choose from. I guess I have to call this one a winner because everyone wants me to re-order. So if you are trying to decide if you should give this one a try, all I can say is we did at my house and everyone wants more.

review/text: Golden French Toast K-Cups are now one of my favorites!  The coffee is not toooo sweet, as French Toast on Bread would be, but mild and smooth tasting.  Before this my favorite of the K-Cups was 'Cinnamon Pastry', so you can see I like mild coffee.  (this smells soooo good when it's brewing too that I had other co-workers envious) I have never found a Green Mountain Coffee that I didn't like, in fact I have never found a K-Cup of  coffee that I didn't like, so you can see that I'm a coffee lover, but mostly in the morning.

review/text: I prefer strong coffee, and usually buy the extra bold varieties like Espresso, Revv, Paul Neumann Organic, and my ultimate fave - Jet Fuel.<br /><br />This coffee has an absolutely wonderful odor, but when it comes to taste, it is pretty watery and doesn't hold a match to my Jet Fuel.  If they could strengthen up the coffee itself, I'd buy it just for the smell, but for now I'll stick to the strong stuff.

review/text: I bought these K-Cups based on glowing reviews here (and elsewhere). They smell great while they are brewing: you can definitely smell french toast on the griddle. The taste, however, was a bit too artificially sweet for me. I'd prefer a more subtle sweetness that lends itself to adding my own sugar.

review/summary: Fragrant and Delicious ... No Bitter After-Taste
review/text: I truly enjoy the taste and aroma of this delicious K-Cup selection, which does indeed remind me of those special mornings during childhood when my mother would make French Toast and serve it to the family with warm maple syrup on the side. The coffee is medium-bodied (I would describe it as "mellow"), and doesn't have the bitter after-taste that so many flavored coffees seem to leave. And I very much like the fact that it is Fair-Trade certified, which means that the coffee grower was paid a living wage for their crop.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this K-Cup flavor, but of course taste is highly subjective ... especially when it comes to coffees, which we all "doctor" in our own unique way. (I drink mine with fat free non-dairy creamer and artificial sweetener.) So I might suggest that you read as many reviews as possible when you are considering an unfamiliar variety, and base your purchasing decision on the general consensus rather than any one review. Enjoy!

review/text: this is one of those coffees you have to try one time, just for the aroma. The aroma is 5 stars. It smells like IHOP when the waitress brings your order of french toast, and you pour maple syrup over it. The best way to describe the coffee is eat some french toast with maple syrup and wash it down with coffee, and you get this flavor. Great for a change from a different flavored coffee. Green Mountain has a wide variety of flavored coffees to choose from, and this is just one of the many.

review/text: I should have known that ordering Golden French Toast before its release date was too good to be true.  Either this seller sold me very old boxes or it was regular coffee that was packaged to look like Golden French Toast.  The label was a shade of orange.  When I bought a "real" box from a local coffee supplier, the label was more maroon in color.  When it's brewing it smells like really strong regular coffee....NOT french toast!!!  My husband and I were VERY DISAPPOINTED!

review/text: This is my most favorite Keurig coffee flavor (followed by Timothy's Winter Carnival and Green Mountain's Caramel Vanilla creme), so of course the coffee receives FIVE STARS. However, I am really disappointed in how the coffee was shipped. While it was in it's own box, the coffee box itself was horrifically damaged and ripped and smashed to the point where it looked like an elephant sat on it. D: Some of my pods were damaged, too, so I am very disappointed because I had coffee grounds all over. This is the first BAD packing experience with Amazon, so I won't be discouraged from ordering more coffee in the future, but this experience was among the worst. :(

review/text: I've only recently started drinking coffee, but I was turned on to Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood by a work colleague from the Netherlands.  I drink it black, and haven't worked up the courage to taint it with sugar or creamer... I somehow feel that would upset the balance of the universe causing the earth to stop spinning, hurling us all into the air at 1000MPH.  But maybe its just the coffee talking there.<br /><br />In all seriousness, the only down-side to this coffee that I've found is that it makes all your standard Folgers', Maxwell Houses, and other cheap blends taste like crap in comparison.  I am not a coffee snob/connoisseur, I don't know a darn thing about ingredients, or how to describe flavors... I just know what I like, and this is it.

Only wish this was a package of 3 large bricks of coffee instead of the small parcels... each 8.8oz pack is good for 10-12 12cup pots of coffee depending on the concentration you choose. For the full Dutch flavor I recommend no less than 9 scoops (standard cone shaped coffee scoop) per 12 cup pot of coffee... it is more grounds than you'd use for Maxwell House but trust me you will enjoy it much more! Now if we could only get the "Koffemelk" like the lucky Dutch enjoy!!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I was first introduced to this coffee at a restaurant. I normally have coffee with cream. The flavor and aroma were so noticeably better than regular restaurant coffee that I had the server find out what kind of coffee it was and write it down for me. I did an internet search when I got home and found it on amazon. I've been buying it exclusively since then. It's amazing how we have all grown used to mediocre coffee regardless of what brand it is. I serve this to my guests and they all notice a positive difference. I've gotten spoiled now and really can't stand the taste of regular coffee anymore. It's a bit more expensive but well worth it. I find it humorous that so many people will fawn all over starbucks and pay ridiculous prices for a mediocre product. This is the best, Consistently. Try a cup of this after drinking a cup of starbucks mud, the flavor and aroma will amaze you.

review/summary: Coffee is a matter of personal taste and the water.
review/text: Writing that this is among the best cups of coffee in the thirty-five years of consumption may be of interest to you, however this coffee is very good and tastes even better when made at a coffee shop or restaurant.  The reason is the water and equipment.  Several coffee shop owners have explained filtered water is more important than the coffee, followed by the coffee, and then the equipment (same pressure and temperature every time).  At home most of us have yet to invest in the expensive equipment to achieve this.  We use a simple single cup drip maker and it works well but the coffee at Glory Days, where we first discovered this coffee, is better and it's the same stuff.  They showed me the label at the restaurant which is how we knew what to order.

review/summary: Other companies could learn some things
review/text: These are very tasty nori strips.  I like the teriyaki flavor on these strips, and I am picky when it comes to teriyaki.  I also love how these are packaged.  One complaint I have with sea's gift and annie chun's seaweed snacks is the packaging.  You get a tray, in a foil wrapper, with a silica packet, in a box.  These jars are jam packed with much much more nori.  Plus the jars are useful after you are done (if you don't mind a slight fish smell... works great to store cat food haha). All in all a great product!<br /><br />FYI (I've seen this complaint on other nori reviews)... if you have never eaten nori... STOP... go to the grocery store... throw down a few bucks on some nori sheets for sushi.  Take those home and eat them.  If you don't like the flavor, you probably won't like these.  Nori has a fishy taste.  I hate when I see reviews on nori with people whining about the fact it tastes like fish and they just spent $20-$30 on something in bulk.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!

review/text: I had bought some roasted teriyaki seaweed from the asian food grocer, and because amazon has fast shipping I decided to see if there was some here. Well, there is and it is delicious. You get a lot of seaweed in this thing; 100 packs in each bottle, and each pack has 5 pieces of seaweed. The seaweed had a crisp, thin texture and taste like teriyaki. It smells like fish, but honestly its not a bad smell and is to be expected since it is seaweed.

review/summary: Very good tea for a tea bag
review/text: Personally I like to brew loose leaf tea and don't use tea bags.  I decided to try this out and compare it with my usual loose leaf tea - Lipton.  Don't laugh but Lipton is quite good tea and is very inexpensive.  I found the difference between the two very subtle. I find my loose leaf Lipton to be very refreshing and having a clean taste.  The Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea I found refreshing but having a "dusty" or "grainy" aftertaste.  What I mean by that is I think the tea in the H&B bags is ground too fine and some passes into the brewed tea thereby giving it a "dusty" or "grainy" aftertaste. It is surprising because the bag they use seems to be superfine mesh, much more than in you standard tea bag. So it appears to me that in the product that I got some of the tea was powdered in the bag and was able to pass through the fine mesh.  I'm sure it won't hurt me. :)  Apart from that I found the tea very good.  Would I buy it for the price presented - no.

I have only ever tried one other brand of English breakfast tea, so bear this in mind.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor immensely.  It is not as strong as I thought it would be, but I still enjoy the flavor.  Maybe it's because I do not drink coffee and my drink of choice is green tea, but I found it a good way to start the day, as well as a nice, relaxing drink for after dinner.<br /><br />If you are looking for a bolder taste, you should search elsewhere for something stronger.  If you are like me, though, you will enjoy the smooth and flavorful taste of Higgins and Burke: recommended.

review/text: I like tea, but find usual tea bags too weak.  Lipton, Bigelow, Trader Joe's teas don't seem to have flavor, I usually have to brew two bags per cup to get any flavor.  However, I brewed one bag of Higgins & Burke English Breakfast Black Tea at work and I think it is better than any other tea bag tea I have tried before.  This tea has a deep dark color and a great flavor.<br /><br />The reason for the four star rating is because, although I find this tea to be very good, in my opinion, it is not as good as some loose teas I have tried.  However, I think this tea strikes a perfect balance between the flavor and the convenience of a tea bag.

review/text: Well, I don't claim to be a tea expert. My basis for comparison is Lipton's Orange Pekoe and Black Tea, which I drink regularly and like. So, this tea I judge as just as good and perhaps a touch better, a bit richer. And, it does seem to dissolve fast, maybe a testament to its richness. So, between the two, I prefer this, but not enough to change because of the cost and what I judge as only marginally better with regard to its naturalness claim. Its claim for being ethically produced, I think worthy, but really can't judge and I haven't heard anything bad about Lipton's processes. That said, if its cost is not important to the buyer and/or its claim of ethics is important enough, I recommend this because I judge it a superior tea based on what I like, as described in this review.

Truthfully, for me Twinnings has a fuller, richer flavor, and I will continue using that.

review/summary: Very pleasant and healthy tea
review/text: Higgins & Burke offers here an English Breakfast tea that is all-round quality. It does not have the strong, full-bodied taste of some teas of this kind; neither is it weak or not palatable. There is no bitterness to it and I would say it is medium to strong-bodied.<br /><br />What I like about it is that it is natural. I recently ordered an organic, natural tea from England that turned out to have a very unpleasant taste while at the same time being overly strong. So it is a relief for me to find a natural tea that is a pleasure to drink. It does not leave any unpleasant aftertaste either.<br /><br />The company that makes this tea is very environmentally conscious. It is 100% sourced and purchased under Ethical Tea Partnership standards. The cartons are made with 100 percent recycled fibres, and each bag is individually wrapped and sealed for protection. Their website states that even their working environment "encourages employee wellness." How often do you see that!<br /><br />I also find it fascinating that Higgins & Burke also produces a white tea. Never heard of such a thing but someday I'll be daring and order some.<br /><br />This English Breakfast tea is superior to what can be found in mainline supermarkets. But one can purchase a more full-bodied tea in specialty shops. However, "natural" is important to me as I try to keep pesticides out of my system so I will probably make this tea a regular part of my kitchen staples in future.

This one counts for being a nice and reliable blend, as well as something you can take with you into work or while traveling (since it comes in bags and in sealed pouches) rather than in a tin or a loose leaf blend.

review/text: English Breakfast is one of my favorite blends, but this Higgins & Burke tea is not my favorite brand. It's a weak tea without any distinctive flavor, and is easily overwhelmed by the average amount of sweetener and lemon that I put in my tea. It tastes almost identical to standard Lipton's. I prefer more upscale bag teas (Twinings) when I don't want to pay for fancy loose gourmet tea (Peets or Coffee Bean Direct). On the other hand, I have met many people who are not picky about their teas and think Lipton's is just fine, so they will probably like this tea.  Note, if you want low-quality but very low-priced bulk tea, try a local Indian grocery.

review/summary: Good, but pricier than my standby (Taylors Yorkshire Gold)
review/text: This is a good, well-rounded, mellow English breakfast tea, an Assam/Ceylon blend.  It has a distinctive, sort of floral undertone or aftertaste, not unpleasant but unusual.<br /><br />I prefer to do without the additional packaging of individual foil packets.  And today's Amazon bulk price is $0.18 per for Higgins & Burke compared with $0.11 for my favorite everyday bagged tea, Taylors Yorkshire Gold.  I won't be switching brands, but I'll enjoy the rest of this box.<br /><br />If you're a tea-drinker, you probably have a good idea of what you like in a black tea.  There are many good ones to choose from.  I have my favorite, but that's a personal thing based on my budget and taste.  Above all, I'm grateful to Amazon for providing us with such variety and reasonable pricing.

review/summary: Interested taste
review/text: This black tea had a very interesting taste. It was kind of strong for my taste, but nevertheless it had a comforting taste. The tea is very strong, so I suggest using the minimal amount of tea bags when making tea for multipe cups. It's good to keep in the cubboard for company, but I don't think I would purchase it for myself.

review/summary: Spot-on English Breakfast Variant +++
review/text: Usual Higgins & Burke quality is shown via this spot-on variant of English Breakfast Tea. It is a balanced English Breakfast Tea -- being rich, strong and soothing. It compares favorably to other variants of English Breakfast Tea. This was especially evident after I accidently let a semi-thermos mug of hot Higgins & Burke English Breakfast tea [with cream and brown sugar] sit for a while -- ending up with just lukewarm tea. It was still excellent and I finished this cuppa. This accident was final proof for me of the quality of this tea. Not too many teas [or other drinks] are still good lukewarm. The box and enclosed tea bags in individual envelopes are well done as well +++

review/summary: Very weak English Breakfast flavor!
review/text: This is the second Higgins & Burke tea that I have tried and I am not impressed.  I find the flavor rather flat and weak even if I steep the teabag for a long time.  I have tasted some really great teas in all the years I've drank teas but this is not one of them.  From the written description I really thought this tea would be great but it's not.  It isn't bitter or acidic tasting but it is blahhhhhh.  I'll use up my remaining tea bags since I like to drink plain hot water but I will not be buying any more of this brand.

review/summary: Super-mellow, tasty, which mends the bones!
review/text: OK, I'm close to  tea fanatic. I've probably sampled 100's of tea types over the years, and like them all. Originally, it is said tea was a muscle and fatigue relaxer, a drink to calm the spirit, and mend creaky bodies. So when I wake up, mending the bones is first on my agenda before heading out into the real world. So, I ordered this Higgins and Burke tea here, and now it's a staple. Not only for the taste, but more important, the fact that it calms my bones; so it is good for all meals and all breaks. If you've ever wondered why the Brits, Chinese, and many others go for a tea break, this particular tea is the top reason!

review/summary: I liked it better than their other ones
review/text: I generally drink tea straight up (no sugar, no milk) and I like it strong--I let it steep at least 5 minutes.  In previous reviews, I've found Higgins and Burke <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUKDM">Higgins & Burke Green Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUIDY">Higgins & Burke Earl Grey Black Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a> rather weak tasting relative to other brands I've tried. But since I have found English Breakfast teas (esp. in restaurants and in England too) to be a bit strong/bitter to my taste, I thought this might work for H&B English Breakfast--and it did!  I find this a pleasant alternative tea and like it better than any other English Breakfast tea I've tried.<br /><br />BTW, I also sometimes add 10 drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TQIJ94">Sinus Formula 1oz</a> to the tea which not only opens my sinuses, but gives it a nice minty taste.

review/summary: Too much Ceylon; not enough Assam
review/text: Tea snob here, so be forewarned.  If I were comparing bagged tea to loose tea, the very best bagged tea would get about 3 stars.  So, I'm comparing only bagged teas.<br /><br />This tea held a lot of promise but didn't deliver.  English Breakfast should be one of those stronger teas that has a nice robust flavor from Assam tea.  Instead, I got a mildly strong flavor with the astringent bite of Ceylon at the finish.  Ceylon?  Yep.  I could go to Lipton tea for that.<br /><br />So, what you basically have is an upscale version of Lipton tea.  I gave it three stars because, well, it's okay.  Not undrinkable.  Someone out there is bound to rave about the flavor, and that's good, because it'll show them there's more to tea than just the generic stuff.  But I really expected more, even from a bagged tea.<br /><br />If you really love this tea, start trying loose teas.  There are plenty of companies out there that provide some great black teas.  Adagio is one, but not the only one.  Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4JS8">Adagio Teas English Breakfast, 4-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>  Much better stuff.

review/text: I have tried other teas from Higgins & Burke including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUKDM">Green Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUIDY">Earl Grey</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUN3E">Peppermint</a>. They were quite good with good flavor. Now I have tried the English Breakfast Tea, which, like the Earl Grey has a good amount of caffeine.  The caffeine rush that I got after a few minutes of drinking this tea was impressive.  I am not surprised that the English call it breakfast tea.<br /><br />Each tea bag comes in an individual packet, which preserves its freshness. The ingredients consist of only black tea leaves.  The tea brews quickly into a nice color.  The tea has a pleasant aroma. The taste is that of black tea.  This tea is as good as others that I have tried.  It will go well for occasions when caffeine is desired, in the morning or afternoon, for instance. I definitely recommend it.

review/text: What do I really know about tea?<br /><br />I'm sure there are some experts out there, but I'm your average, run of the mill shlub. Normally I drink my tea iced, but over the last few weeks with b'fast, I've been having hot tea in the morning.<br /><br />Many teas end up just colouring the water and not providing much taste, let alone anything robust - and that's really what I want if I'm going to drink it. Overall, I don't drink caffeine at all.<br /><br />Still, since I was on a tea kick, I thought I'd try and I'm glad I did. I found this Black Tea to have good flavour and it beats the normal kind you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />Since I'm not a huge tea drinker, I'll see how far the box will get me and then consider purchasing more. Even for company, it is so much better than the standard stuff that is out there.

review/summary: A bit boring;  I've had better..
review/text: Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas.  I don't drink that many different types. It's either Earl Grey for the caffeine, taste and aroma, or chamomile to help me go to sleep! I try a few others here and there, and usually drink more hot tea in the winter months.<br /><br />I normally drink the foil pack single serving bigelow, and I even get the de-caf version if I'm having a late night dessert!  Can't eat dessert without Earl Grey!<br /><br />Anyway, the good news is that the tea bag did not leak any leaves and the tag didn't fall off the string!  Other than that, and after steeping per the directions, I still felt that there was no punch to the tea; it was kind of bland.  I use an artificial sweetener in my tea, and sometimes, depending on my mood, I use the liquid vanilla coffeemate, which doesn't cover up the taste of the tea, and in my opinion, it adds to the flavor.<br /><br />However, when using it with this tea, there really was no sense of the Earl Grey; covered up the bergamot and it also has lemon in it, which I normally don't find in my Earl Grey be it decaf or leaded!<br /><br />So, overall, I don't think I would go out of my way to find this brand. I didn't find it disgusting, but not much to get excited about.  I do like the 6 boxes for the low price on Amazon and as also like that I can get an extra 15% discount with the subscribe and save program.  I would not, however, sign up for it for this product.  I did use the service however for my Earl Grey tea by Bigelow.

review/summary: A good spot of chai...
review/text: This chai is both fragrant and flavorful. Each teabag is wrapped within its own sealed package to ensure freshness up until you actually decide "it's time for chai." Unsealing the teabags produces and aroma that is reminiscent of Christmas for me - and why wouldn't it with Cinnamon, Ginger, and Cloves making up half the ingredients on the tea? The flavor is robust and sweet, leaving a little dryness behind as it slips beyond my uvula and into my belly (honestly, the back of my mouth "tastes" dry after I drink this, and I rather like that). Higgins and Burke chai leaves a pleasant aftertaste as well - always a plus.

review/text: Higgins and Burke Earl Grey tea is a pleasant cup of quality black tea. It has a nice floral aroma and a mild tea blend taste.  There is very little bergamot flavor and aroma. And that is what some Earl Grey drinkers want-a nice mild black tea and a hint of bergamot. This is a blend that probably works well in a restaurant or office situation since it makes no strong tea statement.  A middle of the road choice for occasional tea drinkers.

review/summary: A great choice for the chai tea needs
review/text: I love chai teas and was anxious to se how it compared to what you would find freshly made on your own or even from a restaurant.  I did it a few ways so you can see the different results.<br /><br />Iced tea maker with a medium brew - this made a good light tea that showed off the cloves that are in this blend.I added a light cream and once with a milk to it to make a thai type iced tea but the milk quickly overpowered it at the lighter brew.  But as an iced chai everyone loved it and we went through numerous bags before I stopped them so we could test the other ways.<br /><br />Iced tea maker with strong brew - this was much better for an iced Thai type and the cloves were stronger and held flavor when adding milk or cream.  Keep in mind the manufacturer says Assam which is there but the spices are stronger.<br /><br />Hot water light brew - just ok.  I did it once and didn't like it.  Simple enough in explanation I think.<br /><br />Hot water strong brew - this was by far the best result of the four showing off the care they did in individual packaging. While not fresh, it was great for home, blended well with the milk and held up enough as a chai.<br /><br />I wish there was more Assam strength but I was quite happy and will buy this type again.  I recommend hot strong brew, iced strong and iced medium brews for the best results.

review/text: These pricey little air-tight pouches reveal a delightful scent when opened, but the flavors are too light. Neither the tea nor the spices are sufficient to make an enjoyable cup. I have used more tea bags and less water, and finally got to a strength that is palatable, but there isn't enough juice in these things.<br /><br />And the flavor isn't that great. I am not a huge fan of flavored tea; I drink a lot, but usually just straight black tea,. However, back in the olden days I used to drink Constant Comment, and I've enjoyed many cups of chai at my favorite Indian restaurant. It is much better than this stuff.

review/summary: Spices more than Tea
review/text: Tea is not the best quality, but good enough for chai.  It professes to be an Assam blend<br />and I just couldn't taste it enough to tell.  I have about a dozen Assam estate varieties<br />at the moment, so it's not that I do not know what Assam tastes like.<br /><br /> The Karha for this blend is a bit unique but flavorful in a pleasant way.  The tea is<br />just background noise, not even a binder.  Ginger and cardamom were barely detectable<br />in my box. The cinnamon was a spicy variety (like a Saigon) not a warm variety, so it<br />adds some bite.  For those used to Masala Chai, the spice blend is a little different<br />than some, and reminds me of eastern flavorings more than south or west.  Meaning clove<br />and cinnamon was the stronger of the flavors.  If you're used to cardamom and pepper<br />heavy chai, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />This  cries for cream and sweetener.  Got for just a little half and half rather than a<br />moderate dollop of milk, and a lighter honey (like wildflower, not buckwheat or the like)<br />over sugar. Enjoy!

review/summary: Chai-ing to like it
review/text: I am a huge fan of tea but I have never liked chai teas, for some reason.  The first bag I opened smelled so lovely...very much like cloves. I was pleased to discover that the chai spice was not overwhelming and I thoroughly enjoyed my first cup of Higgins & Burke Chai Black Tea.  I also like the box as it has the punch-out section at the bottom so that all of the tea bags don't fall out at once...always a nice feature for single dispensing.<br /><br />My next cup of tea had an extremely strong taste of cinnamon.  Now, I like cinnamon but this was even too strong for me!  I found the next few tea bags to be inconsistent in flavor.  Sometimes they were good,and sometimes the flavors were too overpowering.  I tried the tea both hot and iced.  If you like the strong chai flavor, I suggest trying it iced as the cold really brings out the spicyness.<br /><br />I gave this product three stars because of the inconsistency in the flavor.

I am not surprised that a dried convenience product like this might need a boost from some sort of flavor additive, compared to tea infused with freshly grated ginger and whole spices, but still, I'd like to know more about these "natural flavors".  Nevertheless, it is still a great spiced tea.

It also holds up well to milk (though if you're looking for more than a 10 oz cup at time, I'd double bag it) and isn't overly-sensitive to a too long or too short steeping time.<br /><br />And, it's as good as the loose leaf chai teas I've tried from fancy places like Teavana.<br /><br />This is the only bagged chai tea I'll ever buy, I think.

review/summary: Very Pleasant Aromatic Chai Tea
review/text: I'm certainly no tea expert, but the Higgins & Burke Chai works for me. For the uninitiated, Chai Tea has been popular in Asian countries, especially India, for centuries. It consists of black tea, brewed strong, with a combination of spices. In this case, we have Assam Black tea with cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves and "natural flavors". Each box of H&B contains 20 tea bags.<br /><br />Traditionally, Chai is consumed hot and sweet, and diluted with milk. For my taste test, I tried the H&B three different ways: with milk and honey, with honey and no milk, and the tea alone with nothing added. I lean toward the undiluted tea, but all three are very pleasant and aromatic. If you dislike cloves, however, this blend may not be for you.<br /><br />Perhaps the Higgins & Burke Chai is not the hippest, trendiest Chai available, but most tea drinkers should enjoy it, especially considering its reasonable price. I would certainly get it again in the future.

Many chai blends include star anise, which ruins it for me.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke's chai doesn't have any nasty licorice-y flavors in it, so hooray!  It's a tasty chai that's heavier on clove and cardamom, and I really enjoy drinking it with a bit of vanilla soy milk.<br /><br />I would suggest steeping it for a solid five minutes, though.  I steeped for 3 and a half minutes the first time, and it was pretty weak.  At five minutes (or more; I like strong tea), it's perfect.

review/summary: Too Weak For Me...
review/text: Traditional Chai is made by heating milk with black tea and spices. When ordering a Chai at a Coffee or Tea House it is usually made with frothed hot milk and a liquid concentrate of tea and spices, so it is somewhat similar to the traditional method. Chai from a teabag is a bit dodgy, but worth try to see how well it is executed. Black tea is my favorite type of tea, and I usually enjoy it with milk. Since Higgins & Burke's Chai tea consists of Black Tea, it should also be enjoyed with milk,  As with all black tea the water should be near or at boiling when pouring it over the leaves or bag. The directions on the box indicate that the tea should steep for at least five minutes. I doubled that and let it steep for ten minutes before getting ready to enjoy what I hope would be an invigorating cup. When I poured just a little bit of milk into my cup, it immediately lightened the tea to a point beyond where I would normally lighten it to. It was at that point that I realized what I hopefully would be a cup of relaxation would be disappointing. I didn't initially think that the pre-milk color of the Chai was too light, but I was obviously mistaken. My first sip of Higgins & Burke Chai Tea had a clove taste to it, with undertones of some other spices, nothing really discernible. I could not distinguish the black tea at all, the flavor was a rather murky blend of spice and water, with a little bit of milk. I wish I could say something better about this tea, maybe I can. So, I steeped another cup, this time for only five minutes, took a sip without adding anything, just drinking the tea straight up, but it was too weak. I let it steep for another five minutes. I tasted it again, once again without any milk, I liked it even less. The weak spicy, thin liquid just had no zip. Sorry Higgins & Burke, maybe some of your other teas are better, but I will pass on your Chai Black Tea.

review/summary: Spicy comforting cup of tea
review/text: This tea is fragrant and spicy with cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves along with assam black tea leaves.  This brand is quality and brews a lighter cup than I am used to and I could use less creamer and sugar than with a heavier chai tea such as Tazo.  I liked the smoothness of the flavor as the spices did not overwhelm my palate but I prefer the black tea to be a big stronger for more tea strength and a bit bolder cup of tea.

review/summary: Great Aroma, And Flavor
review/text: This is my first nonw book review but when Amazon offered this for the vine review program I couldn't resist.  I love me some tea. For me tea and books go hand in hand, so this random review doesn't seem so strange. Now on to the tea.  Most chai teas in the bag are flavor flat.  However this one by Higgins & Burke is very flavorful. While I let the chai seep in the hot water, there was a nice and strong aroma. When I simply hold a tea bag in its individually sealed package close to my nose, I still get a great sense of the flaovers.  The tea goes down well and this is no lingering bitter after taste. It also taste great iced.

review/summary: Nice tea, but not like chai I've had
review/text: Each teabag is individually wrapped; when you open it, you'll definitely notice the spices.  Mostly I notice cardamom, but also some cinnamon (not as much as I would like -- I love cinnamon!) and perhaps cloves.  Not sure what else.  The tea itself was smooth, not overbearing.<br /><br />Without milk, it brewed up to be a pleasant, mildly spiced cup of black tea.  Not bad.  With milk, the spices were just gone.  Perhaps I needed to make a more concentrated brew, but even so...<br /><br />It's probably not realistic to think that you're going to get the real chai experience from a teabag, but if you like chai spices you might like this tea for that.

review/text: I like the balanced flavor of these tea bags -- not too heavy, good for a refreshing cup of tea, and not too heavy on the cinnamon. Each tea bag is sealed in a foil pouch and comes out fresh and fragrant.

review/summary: Lighter than Expected, but Still Good
review/text: The description here of this tea is that it's a "robust" Assam. What I found instead was that this tea is very light, even when steeped for longer than what I am normally used to. The first time I made this tea, I steeped for 3 minutes. In that cup, the tea was extremely light, and I would describe the aroma and flavor as more floral than spicy. The next few times, I let the tea steep for 5 minutes or more. The tea came out slightly darker, and with a more definite cinnamon and clove flavor. I didn't try it with milk...I don't normally put milk in any tea I drink. But I wondered if the tea would ever be "robust" enough to hold up to a full milk and sugar or cream and sugar application. It's not a bad tea overall, but I do tend to like my tea darker generally. But, some people do favor lighter teas, and if that's you, I would recommend you try the Higgins & Burke Chai.

review/summary: Spicy Chai
review/text: As a big chai fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sample Higgins & Burke's version of chai tea (which has all natural ingredients). The first time I made the tea, I steeped it for five minutes, since I prefer a stronger tea, and sweetened it with honey. My initial reaction was that it's good, but not the best I've ever had. The spices overwhelm the tea, mainly the cloves and cardamom. I really love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SAA">Yogi Chai Black, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> for a nice blend of spices and tea. On my next try, I added one part soy milk to two parts brewed tea. It was delicious! While the strong spices overpower the tea and aren't as evenly blended as they could be when alone, the added milk almost turns the chai into perfection. This works iced as well, but with maybe more milk and less brewed tea, depending on your preference. If you're a fan of a more spicy chai, or just chai in general, I'd highly recommend it.

review/summary: A fine product
review/text: This chai has a very good flavor, particularly if you let it steep in a little less water than you'd normally use for brewing black tea. You want it to be somewhat concentrated, because chai is best enjoyed sweetened, with milk.

review/summary: Spicy Chai, not from Oregon
review/text: This chai tea focuses on spices such as clove, cinnamon and cardamom rather than the sweet sugary stuff you get from a box.  This strong black tea is a strong and powerful representation of traditional Indian spices.  Some palates might find so much flavor off putting.<br /><br />I tried it both hot and iced, with sweetener and without and all combinations were tasty, though some sugar and milk really brings out the flavors well.<br /><br />A great do it yourself and versatile beverage solution

review/summary: Delicious Chai
review/text: I have tried several brands of Chai and I must say this one beats of them all. It has a nice flavor with a great blend; the fusion of traditional masala spices and the Assam tea leaves blend perfectly giving a fine taste. The cinnamon flavor is just about balanced. I drink black tea without any sugar and sweetener. This works well for me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1LP2">Tea India Masala Chai Tea, 72 Tagless Tea Bags, 5.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Soothing and Refreshing
review/text: When your using tea bags, things are never quite perfect as you are always getting someone else's "ideal" amount (or perhaps their economically driven amount) and never quite your own.  Thus it is a bit unfair to compare tea bags to loose tea that you can choose to your own preferred strength.  Of course, tea bags are a lot less hassle and hence the tradeoff.  So I will judge this as a "tea bag" chai and not something one might make from loose tea or have in a restaurant.<br /><br />I have sampled Higgins & Burke's Chai Black Tea both in its normal setting with milk as well as with honey.  In both cases it had a pleasant aroma and a soothing taste.  It is not as strong as I might like it but it certainly was not weak and compared to comparable teabags it is a definite winner.  I have enjoyed it as an evening counterpoint to the morning coffee and it is both relaxing and refreshing.  The flavor is solid without being overwhelming and there was no noticable aftertaste.<br /><br />While they say you can't please everyone, this should please most.  It may not be perfect but this is not a perfect world.

review/summary: good flavor profile, weak tea
review/text: I think that this Chai Tea has a very good flavor.  All of the spices mesh well without the tea coming out with an overtly cinnamon flavor.  That being said, it's a very weak tea.  I've steeped it for 5 minutes and it is still really weak in flavor.  If you like a strong Chai Tea, this won't be for you!
