review/summary: New Packaging for an old favorite
review/text: These are the same graham crackers that have been around forever - if you made smores, they were probably on these graham crackers.  If you bought graham crackers and told your kids they were cookies, they were probably these graham crackers.<br /><br />I mean really, graham crackers are an awesome snack for little ones, and aren't so bad for us grownups to snack on either (at least in comparison to some of the other stuff we jam our faces with)<br /><br />So what's so new?  Um... well now the crackers are stacked up and wrapped into different stacks so you only have to open one stack at a time... this keeps the rest of them fresh I guess.  I don't know that it's worthy of a huge marketing campaign or a higher price, but it IS nice to have fresh graham crackers.

review/summary: A new update for an old favorite....
review/text: What's the nicest thing you can say about a cookie?  It's crisp? It's not too sweet?  It's made with graham flour?  It's a Honey Maid graham cracker?<br /><br />Just when I thought they couldn't be improved on, someone thought of small packets to retain freshness.<br /><br />I confess:  I too often eat grahams and milk at night and this is ideal.  Of course others may have better eating habits, but for those on the go or lunch boxes, or midnight sneaking, er, snacks, this new packaging of an old favorite works for me.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Five stars.  It's a great packaging idea for an old favorite; it should please those who love graham crackers.

review/summary: Love the new packaging
review/text: Our family has always enjoyed the Honey Maid Graham Crackers, but would never eat a whole stack at one time. This usually meant that many of them would go stale and ended up in the trash. This new packaging is just the right size. No waste. Even if the pricing for this is a little higher, it means much less waste so is still more economical.

review/summary: YUM
review/text: Ok. These are good - really good. Even better, the small packages keep the remaining ones fresh after you gobble down an entire package. The smaller packages have less calories than the bigger packages in the standard product. What a clever diet idea. This way we secret snackers have the satisfaction of destroying a whole pack, and the smug feeling that comes from fooling yourself into eating less.  They make excellent lunch snacks for the kiddies - just the right size.

review/summary: Great for Portion Control
review/text: When I open up a new bag of Honey Maid Graham Crackers, before I know it, the bag is completely empty.  These Fresh Stacks gives you the same Honey Maid taste in smaller packages, basically a original size split in half, which makes it easier to curtail the amount you eat in one sitting.  There are six sheets in six packages in every box.  One complaint is the original flavor is a little bland and I wish Honey Maid would release the smaller size for their cinnamon cracker product, which I prefer, too.

review/summary: Graham Cracker Goodness
review/text: If you're a fan of graham crackers and also have kids or a need to take snacks with you, this is a good way to go.  The crackers themselves are half the size of the normal (2 pieces vs 4) and then are packaged in smaller packs as well.  The smaller packs are a good size for easy on the go snacking.  That's the only difference between these and the originals.  So basically, you're getting more packaging inside the box.  I won't speak to whether or not that's good for the environment but it's definitely convenient.

review/text: You don't have to twist my arm to eat graham crackers. Some are better than others; Honey Maid are pretty near the top of the pile. This edition, which separates single servings into neat packets, is convenient and handy. I took one packet a night to work and was pleased that they were quick to hand. Sure, you can package your own; but as a time-saver, I appreciated these. I'll be looking for them to be produced in Cinnamon next.

review/summary: Same great graham cracker taste packaged for freshness
review/text: The Fresh Stacks are half-sized graham crackers packaged eight half-sized crackers to a stack. This new way of packaging them will presumably keep them fresher because you have fewer crackers in each package so they will sit in the opened package for less time before they're eaten. The taste is the same yummy Honey Maid graham cracker taste as the traditionally sized longer rectangle graham crackers. Interestingly, I checked a package of the traditional long Honey Maid graham crackers and high fructose corn syrup is listed as one of the ingredients but it is not one of the ingredients for the Fresh Stack graham crackers. If you are concerned about limiting HFCS in your diet, the Fresh Stacks are the way to go.

review/summary: a really Smart Choice. 'nuf said. :)
review/text: Some people may not realize that carrying around large bulky packages of your favorite snack is so last century!<br /><br />Honey Maid Fresh Stacks is modern, convenient and less wasteful ( as in, most throw out stale or unused product -- except my neighbor, but that's another review. ).  Honey Maid Fresh Stacks still have that crispy Honey Graham goodness and the scent wafting from the newly opened product can still invoke fond  memories of a very happy childhood -- it's just been down sized, a bit, to fit a modern lifestyle.<br /><br />Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are just a really smart choice. 'nuf said.  Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2011

review/text: I have to say I really like what they did with these graham crackers. It's such a simple thing that works very well for me. I'm use to graham crackers being very long and a lot of times I don't want to eat the whole graham cracker, but once I take it out I have to eat it, because I don't want to put a partial graham cracker back into the box. Well, with these graham crackers, they are sized to the perfect size when I just want a small portion. But I do have to say that it seems to taste slightly different and my friend noticed, too, but it's still good.

review/text: I love the Honey Maid Fresh Stacks!  Being a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA15GI">Ritz Crackers, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, I couldn't wait to try the Honey Maid version!  I was not disappointed.  We like to take graham crackers with us on trips to the zoo, the park, and other places where healthy treats are hard to come by.  I can keep a Fresh Stack in my tote bag, and not have to worry!  There's just enough in there for a snack for myself, my daughter, and a friend so I'm not wasting half a sleeve of crackers by them going stale before we need another snack on the go.<br /><br />Each cracker tastes as fresh as the first one, even if you're like us and it takes 6 weeks for you to finish an entire box.

review/summary: Yummy crackers, perfect size, for two people!
review/text: These crackers are a perfect size-the larger ones crack, and you sometimes end up with uneven pieces. They are great for snacks (we had some with Cinnamon Swirl Peanut butter,and the cracker complimented it perfectly!). Since they are in smaller packages,they are not likely to become stale as quickly as the larger packages. For crusts, these smaller packages are probably not suited, as it may take a while to unwrap them, as opposed to larger packages. The small packages also allow for convenient snacking on the go. The flavor and texture are perfect!

review/summary: Fresh Stacks - Where Have You Been My Entire Graham-Cracker-Eating Life?
review/text: I grew up eating Honey Maid Graham Crackers as an after dinner dessert snack.  My parents convinced me that it was even better than cake and to this day, I still crave a tall glass of milk and some Honey Maid Graham Crackers (never found another brand that was quite as yummy.)  They're still delicious, and as far as I can tell, the taste is exactly the same, but this packaging solves most of my biggest peeves with the crackers before.<br /><br />I no longer have to figure out how to break the thing in half perfectly along the lines to get it to fit into my glass of milk so that I don't lose half of the soggy goodness in the bottom of my cup.  These are the perfect size for dipping in milk and even better for Smores!  No more fumbling to break a cracker into the perfect Smore sized square while holding a flaming marshmallow!  Lastly, the stacks are individually sealed, so you can eat an entire stack without having the rest of the box go stale before you can finish the rest.  If there was one improvement I would suggest it would be to have the "serving size" be the same as a single "fresh stack" but since this isn't marketed as a calorie counting type of product, it doesn't really matter.  I'm hooked on these and since the Honey Maid graham crackers are still a treat for me, I'll be buying these instead of the normal rectangular crackers from now on. Yum!

review/text: 3-stars for the packaging. The crackers are, of course, excellent. Someone was on to something by putting these in snack size packages. However, usually when you eat something on the go you will eat a little now and a little later. What you need is resealable packaging. These "fresh stack" packs come in the regular old brown glued plastic wrap. You still have to provide the zip-lock bag yourself. At least these fit in a zip-lock bag easier than the full size stacks.

They're a great size for that kind of thing.

I can't tell you how many times different crackers or cookies have gone stale on me because they were not closed properly. This will not happen with this product.  They have several packs inside  with just the right amount of crackers to enjoy at one sitting, or they are perfect to pop in your purse and take along with you. The flavor and texture were great. They were very fresh and none of them were stale. That is such a major factor in my opinion. I will definitely look for these in my local store. A very good product in all ways that I gladly recommend.

review/summary: Great concept but a terrible waste of packaging
review/text: First off the crackers are very, very fresh. So that being the intent, they were wonderful. There's six little packs in a box and each of the individual packages is about enough for an 8 year old or a 6 year old to enjoy during snack time. The 6 year old had a bit of a problem with opening the packaging, but the 8 year old was fine.<br /><br />Also helpful to note, it's the perfect size for a midnight snack for the 37-year-old.<br /><br />The crackers are tightly packed and we didn't have a single broken cracker in the bunch, and did I mention how fresh they were?<br /><br />I had to dock one star because of waste though. While I like the idea of throwing these in the kid's lunches as a snack pack, they are a bit big for their lunch kits, and frankly there's a lot of excess garbage that is created from a box of these.<br /><br />That coupled with the price, it's just a better deal to buy regular graham crackers and put those in lunches. So my environment-guilt precludes me from stocking up on these for kids lunches.<br /><br />But I see where they're going with it and I like the idea of it - it just feels wasteful.

review/text: I have long been a fan of Honey Maid graham crackers.  They are just about my favorite snack food for me and the kids.  In the past, I would break them into halves so that they could fit conveniently in whatever bag I was using for lunches or outings.  On top of that, I would have to remove them from their sealed bags into a Ziploc bag, which always seemed redundant.  Now, I can just move them from the box into whatever bag I am using and it is super fast and convenient--the perfect snack to grab quickly when heading out the door.

review/summary: Same Cracker, Different Package
review/text: Everything about these Honey Maid graham crackers are identical to the ones you're used to.  There's nothing different aside from the fact that they're just divided in half.  They have yet to come up with a way for the crackers to not crumble inside the packaging.  In fact, the brown plastic packaging is still the same.  I thought the crackers were going to come in clear cellophane packs how they're represented on the box, but they're not.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I love these graham crackers and have since I was a kid.  Nothing will change the fact that I love the taste and the childhood memories that go along with them.  The reason for the three stars is due to the lack of innovation.  You can still buy the old school packs and break them in half and you have virtually the same product.

review/summary: Packaging makes all the difference
review/text: The same great Honey Maid graham crackers that I grew up with have gotten even better.  While the same great graham cracker taste is there, it is no longer a brick of a package.<br /><br />The new Honey Maid graham cracker "Fresh Stacks" packaging makes these way easier to enjoy and leads to less waste.<br /><br />In the olden days of the graham cracker brick, you'd open the package, have a couple of their rectangles, maybe even snap them in half to make them squares, and then put the brick back...only to have the rest go stale.<br /><br />Or maybe you'd get a Ziploc baggie to hold the opened package of remaining crackers.  (More packaging needed!)<br /><br />With the new "Fresh Stacks," you're getting 6 graham squares in their own wrap.  6 squares...now that is a perfect snack.  Add a sealed cup of strawberries and this new dynamic duo can be thrown into your lunchbag for an afternoon snack.<br /><br />Going camping and want to make s'mores?  Throw a couple of individual packs, marshmallows, and chocolate into your camping bucket, and you are set.<br /><br />The same thing goes for if you need to break a couple of packs down to make a graham cracker crust.<br /><br />Simple, easy, and perfect to stash in my cupboard.  I am in love with the new "Fresh Stacks!"

review/summary: Why did it take so long?
review/text: Every box of graham crackers that has ever entered my house has ended up with many or most of the crackers broken.  The long crackers are just too hard to handle without breaking them.  Are we just too klutzy in my house?  Maybe, I dunno.  And what's the point?  Doesn't everybody break them from rectangles into squares to use them, anyway?<br /><br />What I do know is that these "Fresh Stacks" are the solution to our breakage problem.  They taste just as good, very equal to every other graham crackers - nothing special, better or worse, there.  But they stay squares, without being broken!  It's a minor miracle!<br /><br />The squares are much more convenient to use.  Much easier for s'mores (we have a lot of bonfires in the backyard).  Much less breakage, much fewer crumbs or waste.<br /><br />These "Fresh Stacks" are a nice thing that make life just a touch easier and better at our house.

review/summary: everything a graham cracker should be
review/text: My kids munched through this box rather quickly, as they have discovered the joy of making marshmallow smores in the microwave. The crackers are packed in small waxed paper stacks, so if you don't eat the whole box in a week, as we did, the crackers in unopened packs will stay fresh longer.  The crackers do contain hydrogenated cottonseed oil, which we generally try to avoid, but otherwise we rate them very highly.  They are crunchy,sweet, and everything a graham cracker should be.  I like the handy small sized packages, which are a good size for 2-3 kids to share.

review/text: They're Honey Maid Graham Crackers. You've probably eaten them before. Slightly grahamy, delicious, and a huge mess since they're typically about 2x the size that any rational human wants to hold and eat.<br /><br />Thankfully, those marketing geniuses over at Nabisco heard your cries, and released Fresh Stacks. They're graham crackers pre broken in half. That's it. They come in smaller packs with enough crackers for a really hungry person, or two slightly less hungry people. I appreciate that, since they're not getting stale or gummy like the normal ones do when I can't eat 15 oz in one sitting.<br /><br />For normal people, you'll love them. If you're Andre the Giant sized, stick with the original.

review/summary: Crispy, Tastey Crackers on the Go!
review/text: I've always been a fan of graham crackers.  They're a light, tasty snack that I can stash in my desk drawer at work.  But keeping an entire box on-hand can be too much of a good thing.  As addicting as they are, it would be easy to eat one right after another until half the box is gone!.  These individually wrapped packages are the answer to that temptation.  Toss one (or two!) packages into your bag and head out the door. Carrying one package with you, you'll never eat more than 6 crackers, reducing the temptation to over-indulge! The crackers themselves are nice and crispy.  The individual packaging keeps the crackers fresh.  The only thing that would make these better would be if the package was resealable.  Altho most people will eat all 6 crackers in one sitting, I like to nibble on them throughout the evening (I actually didn't my package the first night and had to paper clip the package closed!)  These are also an excellent snack choice for moms on the go. Toss a package or two into your diaper bag or purse and you'll always have a snack on hand for your toddlers or children.  No more begging for a cookie or candy bar with Graham Crackers on hand!

review/text: I like to snack on crackers but the taste was altogether too subtle - more sweet than salty, which makes it less likely to pair well with cheese or some other kind of salty spread. The crackers were also fragile and crumbly - not that most crackers are hard as rocks,  but there is too much air in it. I guess they're meant to dunk in coffee or tea, rather than dipped in a spread. I was not that impressed and will go back to my Ritz crackers.

As a mom of two toddlers (2 years and 3 years respectively), graham crackers are a staple in all situations - particularly during car rides.  However in most cases, I don't need 8 full sheets of graham crackers to give to my kids - I'd probably only need about half of that.  This is where the brilliance of the Honey Maid Fresh Stacks come in: each pack contains 8 half sheets of graham crackers.  I don't have to spend any time opening a pack and putting half the crackers into a ziploc bag which will probably be forgotten in the back of the cupboard.  I don't have to worry about graham crackers going stale because my husband tossed some crackers in a ziploc for the kids, but didn't bother sealing the remaining crackers up before tossing them back into the cracker box.  I can put a pack of these crackers into my kid's travel backpack or in the car one day, and open it up weeks later when I actually need the crackers because the kids are starving.  Brilliant, I tell you.<br /><br />While I'll still buy the conventional 3 stacks per box type graham crackers (we can eat a lot of graham crackers), I think I'll be picking up the Fresh Stacks for our day trips - it's so convenient!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Convenient size for snacking
review/text: Graham crackers are always popular with our kids.  However the normal size packages often go stale before we finish them.  These smaller packages are great for our little kids.  The half-size crackers are a better size for them, and the smaller packages ensure that all the crackers are gone before they go stale.

review/summary: On old favorite, in new packaging
review/text: Truthfully these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GK">Honey Maid Fresh Stacks</a> couldn't have arrived at a better time.  Our two-year old Grandson was visiting recently and these became his favorite snack. Each and every time the pantry was opened we heard "Cracker, please?".  What I appreciated most besides it being the same graham cracker I remembered, was the new packaging. Many times I have opened a larger pack only to not finish them and end up finding stale crackers the next time. With these smaller packs we are more likely to finish a pack, but if we don't they easily fit into a ziploc sandwich bag. The are also PERFECT for smores; just grab a pack of crackers, some chocolate and a bag of marshmallows! You can even make them easy (and fun!) at home with this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001447LEE">Microwavable S'Mores Maker</a>.  The only negative about these would be the cost.  Being a new product here on Amazon, they are a bit higher priced than most would want to pay.  If they were to be included in Subscribe & Save, then it would be a bit more reasonable.  My suggestion for now would be to look locally, I found them in my local grocery store for about $1.15 less per box.

review/text: It's about time that we get an easier way to enjoy our Graham Crackers!<br /><br />These smaller packages with squares rather than rectangular crackers make both serving and storing easier.  One pack was enough for one day's snack for my kids and I didn't worry about the remaining ones becoming stale.  Yeah!  I also liked the smaller size which fits in a bowl when the bigger side did not.  Same great taste with more convenience which comes in handy when you're a mom of 3 kids and on the go.

review/summary: The Way It Should Have Always Been!!
review/text: These graham crackers have an extreme advantage! They are packaged better than any other. These little blocks of 8 square grahams (which equals 2 servings according to the Nutrition Facts label), stay fresh and unbroken, and are very easy to use. The packs are small enough for a lunch box, desk drawer, or purse, and have perfect portions for eating in one sitting without having to worry about what you will do with leftovers. For those of you who love peanut butter on grahams, you could take along one of the little Jif To-Go peanut butter cups and you have a perfect little meal/snack! This Honey Maid Grahams Fresh Stacks packaging is so long overdue for graham crackers. It's perfect all around, and it goes without saying that these grahams themselves are a tried & true classic that are always delicious!

review/summary: Stack-a-licious!
review/text: I grew up eating Honey Maid graham crackers. I've tried the other brands but, for me, none compare to Honey Maid. The idea behind the Honey Maid Fresh Stacks is clever! They are the perfect size for my lunch sack. Also, for mom's with small children they're fun sized!<br /><br />The only issue I found with these crackers is that they aren't the same consistency as the Honey Maid graham crackers I've eaten in the past. Maybe the batch I got was not so fresh? These were crumbly and dry. I'll use these with peanut butter to see if it can overcome the dryness of the product.<br /><br />Great idea and possibly better if bought via the grocery.

review/summary: Forgot how good these are!
review/text: Graham crackers are a staple on every camping trip, but for some reason I don't think of eating them in between trips.  The problem with graham crackers is that they are messy (lots of crumbs) and once I open a package, I can never eat them all before they go stale so it feels like a waste of money.<br /><br />This product at least solves the second half of my problem.  Each little package has two servings of crackers that are half the size of the "normal" crackers.  I don't mind that it's two servings in each bag.  I share, or save the second half for tomorrow, or eat the whole dang thing myself.<br /><br />That all being said, often the price of smaller serving bags is much higher than the normal product, which would not make it worthwhile for me.  If the price was somewhat comparable, especially considering I would probably throw half of a regular box away, I would absolutely buy these crackers on a regular basis.

review/text: Some products shouldn't need reviews because they just make so much sense.  Who doesn't love Graham Crackers?  Have you ever met a toddler whose eyes didn't light up when you handed him or her a honey graham?  My 3 year old loves them, and it's always been difficult to pack them: with the usual large packages, you have to put some in a ziplock baggie or something like that to prevent them from going stale. This new "fresh stacks" packaging has just about the perfect amount in one wrapper - throw one of these packages in your backpack, give a few to your kids, have one yourself, and nothing goes stale. It's the perfect packaging for a perfect snack. There's honestly not a single thing wrong with this product.

review/summary: Graham Crackers Cut in Half and Packaged in Smaller Packs
review/text: These are exactly the same Graham Crackers Nabisco sells in the traditional rectangular form, but cut in half. The smaller pack size is nice if you use them slowly as there is less chance for the unused crackers to get stall and soft. Other than that, they are just like the originals. I wouldn't pay more per ounce for these than for the traditional ones unless you frequently end up with stale, soggy graham crackers due to slow use rates.

Rarely do we go through an entire package of the regular sized cracker, which means I have to find a ziplock baggie, and make sure they get eaten before they turn from crispy to soft.<br />With these fresh stacks I get just the right amount, no worrying about them going stale, and they are so much easier to toss into the bag for on the go snacking. Plus, of course, the delicious honey maid taste. Yum!

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: Nabisco has always been one of my favorite brands, and these Honey Grahams are one of my favorite cookie/crackers. These still have the same fresh, crispy, and wonderful flavor, but the size and packaging is different.<br /><br />I like that these are packaged in 2"x4" individual packs. They are great for lunchboxes, office desk, or just a quick snack. I like them at work with a cup of hot tea, and sometimes when I don't have time for a real lunch, they are great with peanut butter or Nutella - just excellent!<br /><br />There are 6 "fresh stacks" per box, and each one is considered 2 servings, so that is the only thing one needs to be careful of. It is too easy to open and eat one entire snack pack, which is 250 calories, so be careful to watch how any you eat at once or just share a pack!

review/summary: Great Idea - Even for Non-Moms
review/text: There's nothing worse than a soggy, stale graham cracker.<br /><br />And there's nothing better than a fresh, crunchy graham cracker.<br /><br />That said, as one of the few "non-mom" reviewers, I think that the new Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are a brilliant idea for those of us who really don't feel the need to measure our every bite and count our calories but who enjoy a great treat and not have to dread the next time we dig into the box, only to be sorely disappointed by the lackluster of an aged, flaccid graham cracker that even peanut butter can't rescue.<br /><br />The new fresh stacks are exactly that: FRESH. Delicious and crunchy and Honey Maid is still the best graham cracker out there - accept no substitutions!<br /><br />I will buy this product just based on the fact that I have an option other than the longer "sheet" crackers which, unless you down an entire pack (this is where I WOULD count the calories), continue to disappoint.<br /><br />Indulge your Inner Kindergarten-er.<br /><br />Now, where's my peanut butter?

review/text: The Honey Maid Fresh Stacks package of 6 package of 12 crackers is a handy idea for moms on the go with toddlers, working folk who want a nutritious snack, and just about anyone who needs to keep small amounts of snack items handy.  A distinct advantage of this form of packaging would be redction of waste.  Have you ever eaten a stale graham cracker?  Once was enough for me!  My only concern was in regard to pricing for this new form of packaging; does the difference in price per unit justify itself?  It does for me.

review/summary: Leaving opened crackers in the box is a thing of the past!
review/text: I love graham crackers and I think this new packaging is a great idea. High five, Honey Maid! And while this packaging remains a great idea, there are both advantages and disadvantages.<br /><br />The advantages. Smaller portion-sized stacks for one. If you know of the "regular" Honey Maid boxes, in one of the stacks you get a bunch of crackers that you can't finish in one sitting, and often they're stale when you go back to them another day. Here, the crackers are halved and a hungry eater can easily finish a stack off in one sitting, so leaving opened crackers in the box is a thing of the past! Sometimes I'll even have two stacks. And they taste great fresh. These are also good to take on the go, so stuff 'em in your coat pocket or purse and a snack is just inches away at all times.<br /><br />The disadvantages. Graham crackers are brittle as we all know, so if they're shipped there's a good chance they might break or fall apart before arriving in your hungry arms. I'm going to look for them in stores instead of ordering online.

review/text: I always have graham crackers in the house because they make a great snack alone or spread with some peanut butter but inevitably I end up with some stale crackers before I can eat all the ones in the larger packs.  Problem solved with these fresh stacks!  Even if you don't eat the whole stack at once (which I don't recommend because although it's a small stack it's still pretty loaded with calories) The small size of the crackers make them easy to store in a zip lock bag.  They're the perfect size for tossing in my bag if I'm going to be out all day and want to have a snack with me.

review/summary: Wholesome and absolutely delicious
review/text: I've always liked graham crackers, but these really pump it up a notch!  The honey flavor makes them fairly sweet, and absolutely delicious.  They're great for satisfying a sweet tooth craving.  And as the only person in my house who eats graham crackers, I appreciate the "fresh stacks"-- little square packages of 8 squares of graham crackers (think half the size of a regular graham cracker).  This means less time for them to sit in an unsealed package before being eaten, so they stay fresher longer.<br /><br />  Because nutrition is also important to me, I took a quick glance at the ingredient list which revealed that they have used unbleached flour as well as whole grain wheat flour-- no bleach in sight, hooray!  I'm not thrilled that they did use partially hydrogenated oil, but I guess you can't have everything especially in something that tastes this good.<br /><br />  Overall this is an excellent product with great taste and mostly wholesome ingredients, in packaging that will keep it fresh.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Old Fashioned Flavor, Modern Packaging
review/text: These tasty graham crackers are crispy, not too sweet, and a serving of 4 squares has 130 calories.  They come packaged in 6 stack packs, and the calorie count for the whole pack (8 squares) is 250.<br /><br />The flavor brought back childhood memories of a glass of milk and a couple graham crackers after school, and then out to play. In other words, the flavor hasn't changed much in the MANY years since I was a kid :>)<br /><br />The new packaging makes them convenient to take along with you, either to work, or school, or wherever.  The only drawback I see to the packaging is that you might eat the entire stack, since the package isn't easily resealed.<br /><br />Some reviews have mentioned their fat (from cottonseed oil) and sugar content, and I will add here that they also contain a good amount of sodium (170mg for 4 squares, 340mg for 8 squares). But I think that, as with all snack foods, you have to read labels, not overdo, and make choices based on your individual dietary needs/restrictions.<br /><br />For me, these were a healthy enough choice for a delicious snack.

review/summary: Honey Maid Attacks Stale
review/text: Honey Maid graham crackers have been a family treat for decades.  However, one of the problems with graham crackers is what to do after eating several grahams, but the package is not completely empty.  In years past, the answer is that the grahams seem to absorb moisture and lose their crisp texture.<br /><br />Nabisco's answer to this problem is to reduce the amount and size of grahams in one package.  Now the grahams fit better into a lunch box or bag.  In addition, if you use half a package for one lunch, which is a single serving, the other half is ready for the next lunch or a snack.  If you forget to use the other four grahams in a package, then only four lose their crispness.<br /><br />Though I applaud Nabisco's attempt to increase packaging effectiveness, there are other options, admittedly involving a small amount of labor.  After opening a standard package of Honey Maid grahams at our house, the leftovers go into a sealable storage bag.  The sealable storage bag keeps the grahams from absorbing moisture for a lengthy period.  Though I have yet to do a price comparison, I suspect there is an additional cost for the convenience of the smaller graham squares.  We will probably keep using sandwich sized storage bags to keep leftover standard sized grahams fresh.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Honey Maid graham crackers, so ordered this product for review.  They are the same graham crackers we know and love, which traditionally have come in large wrapped stacks of cookies.  While I am entirely capable of eating one wrapped stack of cookies at a go, in principle one shouldn't, and they weren't convenient for packing for lunch.  These are wrapped in smaller, more lunch sized packets.  Each packet eight cookies, for a total of 250 calories; a box has six packets.

review/summary: The crackers are great, the package doesn't travel well
review/text: I was pretty excited to get a full box of these in the mail.  I rarely eat graham crackers anymore, but when I was a kid, I loved them.  These crackers are very good, easy to break apart, good crunchiness and texture, not too sugary, don't have that weird cinnamon stuff that comes off on your hands the old school grahams had and only have 250 calories in the whole fresh stack. I guess they also give calories for 1/2 a stack, maybe I should be doing that than eating a whole stack greedily.<br /><br />My only problem with the crackers is the packaging. It might be that they travelled in the mail, but they don't travel well.  Even in the separate stacks in the box, they crumble and leave a good amount of bits in the bottom of the pack.  Which isn't good if you need to open them, without scissors, on the run or out on the town.  I wouldn't be able to tactfully get these open without getting crumbs all over myself.  The bags have that sort of potato chip bag seal that if you open it the wrong way, all the contents spill out.  I open mine with scissors, but at that point, I might as well just buy a regular box of crackers instead of these.<br /><br />I don't have any kids to feed these to, so I can't tell you about that.  They make a fine snack for me...but then I eat pretty well and hardly ever snack.  I don't think eight crackers is too much, especially if you eat sensible meals during the day.  But I could see the problem in only wanting half the stack.  I haven't opened one of these with my hands yet, maybe I should in my scientific lab (my patio) to make sure if it breaks apart and crumbs fall out all over, some birds will pick them up and I won't have to clean up my kitchen.  I couldn't see being able to seal these well if I opened them by hand and can't because I use scissors to open them.  There would be no way to fold the flap down.

review/summary: Why didn't someone think of this before!
review/text: Graham crackers have always been packaged in larger stacks, which meant that you never used up the whole stack and had to tightly repackage the remaining crackers to prevent spoilage. This new, much more compact packaging avoids waste and has an even better quality: it makes them more portable--a very good thing for graham crackers, which are so soothing to the stomach and digestion.<br /><br />I remember that, when I was pregnant, I always had graham crackers in a drawer at work to settle my stomach. I always take them on trips, since I tend to get every type of travel sickness imaginable (air, sea, car--you name it!)and its something to have in the hotel room between meals or at night that is neither too sweet nor salty. I also use them to accompany medications that have to be taken with food--and this new smaller packaging is just what the doctor ordered.

review/summary: Sinfully good!
review/text: Way back in the 1800s, Reverend Sylvester Graham was on a crusade.  Disgusted by the "venereal excess" of the youngsters of his day, Graham created a special vegetarian diet with his very own modestly-named Graham bread at its core.  Graham bread, the progenitor of Graham crackers, was made from whole wheat flour...unlike that other, sinful bread.  Graham promised that following his diet would solve a wide variety of disorders, including indigestion, headache, spinal diseases, epilepsy, and insanity. The diet wasn't for everybody - virginity until age 30 was also a requirement.  Still, good old Graham wasn't too far off the mark. He advocated brushing teeth daily, drinking clean water, regular bathing, exercise, and (GASP!) a good night's rest.<br /><br />I feel healthy (and more virtuous!) every time I bite into one of these delightfully pure snacks. Especially when I sprinkle them over a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce with a dollop of whipped cream on top. It's sinfully good!

review/text: I have ALWAYS loved Honey Maid's Graham Crackers, so the taste would never be in question, hands down my favorite.<br /><br />I like the fresh stacks! Perfect!  I like being able to take a small package with me to work (with Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Cream Cheese- yum!) to snack on and know that I don't have to open up an entire package and worry about the rest going stale.  I have a 7 year old and these are perfect to throw in my purse and have ready for a snack at any time!

review/summary: Same great taste in a slightly smaller package
review/text: This is the same great product I've enjoyed for years.  The upside is that the stay fresh stacks are a good snack size, and I can just grab one and go.  The downside is that the whole box is somewhat smaller than the normal size grahm cracker box.

review/summary: Is smaller better?
review/text: I would have to say, for the most part, Honey Maid graham crackers are the epitome of graham crackers.  Are they the best tasting graham crackers out there? Probably not.  Are they the most easily accessible? I would say yes.  In my mind, Honey Maid graham crackers are the ones I use as a frame of reference in my psyche.<br /><br />The graham crackers in this package don't taste any different than the standard honey grahams Honey Maid/Nabisco puts out.  The draw here is the packaging.  The packaging is called "fresh stacks", which translates to smaller size.  The goal here is to induce a longer level of "freshness".  Normally these graham crackers are long, well these crackers are half the size and are enclosed in tiny parcels.<br /><br />I will admit the idea is almost flawless, almost.  The major issue I have is this. A serving size, according to the box is 4 squares/crackers. However, each "fresh stack" package has about 8 squares/crackers in them.  So if you only eat half or a few crackers you are now flirting with your food going stale.  Since it is next to possible to close this "smaller package".  With all the focus and recognition going towards portion control in this country, one would imagine that food companies would adjust their packaging/marketing.  Oh well, the crackers are still very tasty and the concept of the packaging isn't bad.

review/summary: Always fresh
review/text: These graham crackers are packaged in individual servings which makes them very convenient to carry with us to sporting events for an on the go snack without getting crumbs all over the place.  The serving size allows us to open up a pack, eat it all and throw it away without having left overs that end up in crumbs at the bottom of the purse.  Very convenient.  The crackers themselves are delicious and stay fresh until opened.

review/summary: Ah...Graham Crackers
review/text: The new packaging of the graham crackers into smaller stacks is a great idea.  I always just broke the cracker into two for my son anyway and this saves me that step. Also, there are fewer crackers per package so they stay fresher longer which I also love.<br /><br />The graham cracker is...well...a graham cracker. You've had `em, they're tasty.<br /><br />So, these crackers are primarily about packaging and convenience. The change in packaging is nice (as explained above), but is the convenience fully worth it? Depends on the circumstances I suppose. But they are tasty.

review/text: The crackers are the same here as the typical/old boxes except halved.  Still delicious.  But the packaging is not an improvement.<br /><br />The "fresh stacks" are still wrapped in that brown plastic that is really hard to open without ripping it to bits.  Sure there are fewer crackers per package, but you still need to just happen to want exactly how many are in a package to avoid having to pull out a zipper bag for the leftovers.  Now if they had designed the old packages to be reclosable, that would have actually been helpful.

review/summary: too much packaging for me
review/text: These are pretty standard graham crackers.  They taste good and are moister than some brands that I've tried.  While I enjoyed the taste, I wasn't as fond of the size and packaging.  Rather than being the traditional sized rectangles like most graham crackers, these "fresh stacks" have been cut in half so that they form small squares.  There are eight crackers packaged together in plastic, and each box contains 6 little packs of the crackers.  To me, this doesn't really serve any purpose and accomplishes nothing other than increasing the packaging.  I didn't find the size any more convenient or easy to eat, and I'm really not happy with the extra packaging.  I'll be sticking with the old-fashioned graham crackers.

review/summary: Great snack size packs
review/text: Most of us have liked Graham crackers since we were kids. When you buy a regular box however, unless you finish them quickly, they can go stale. We've tried cookie tins, Tupperware containers, but eventually, the crackers absorb humidity and flavor, so the number one selling point of these crackers is the fact that 8 are wrapped in one stack, enough Nabisco says, for two servings. Well, maybe not, especially if you are making Smores. 4 squares equals about 1 of the old fashioned sized crackers.<br /><br />And I will admit there is a taste difference between these and store brand crackers. I'd recommend this for those with younger kids to pack a lunch, a relatively healthy snack; it's easy enough to toss one of these stacks into a backpack or glove compartment to curb your appetite.

review/summary: Crackers on the go!
review/text: The latest twist on Honey Graham Crackers by Nabisco is a nifty snack pack version. The 12.2oz box contains six packages of 8 graham crackers. The suggested serving size of 4 squares contains a mere 130 calories. The crackers are flavorful and tasty. For moms-on-the-go, these individually wrapped packages are ideal. For adults, the number of crackers in each package can be troublesome. Four crackers as a snack are plenty. What do you do with the other four if you are at the gym or work? Eat more than you really want, or try to wrap them up for later? Graham Crackers are crumbly. Also, for all those on Gluten-free diets, this snack isn't for you. Overall, I liked this product very much and would recommend buying it.

review/summary: Tasty but Crumbly
review/text: As a kid (long before many readers were born) these crackers were a staple with our household.  There was only one desert and that was Nabisco Graham Crackers with cold milk and that was the best combination.  Sure there were other brands but this was one we could afford along with the Nabisco Premium Saltines.  At 29 cents a package it was reasonable.  Fast forward to the present and low and behold the almost same formula for Nabisco Graham Crackers exists and in a similar package with a few exceptions.  Today's package is a pack of six with "about" 8 crackers in each package compared to the old package that had about the same number of crackers but each stack had a cracker that was twice the size of today's but the same or similar weight.  All told, little has changed in those 60 years or so except for the packaging.  It is the same wax type paper that is difficult to reseal and keep the crackers fresh.  The box is of similar cardboard quality that does little to protect the contents.  In spite of several requests to Nabisco to present the consumers with quality packaging that compares to its costs I have seen no attempts to correct this condition.  There is an annoying factor to me that causes me to reconsider brands when the contents are made up of many broken, cracked and crumbly pieces of product regardless of what king it might be.  Nabisco blames the condition on the stock clerks in the grocery stores even though the stock is placed on the shelves by Nabisco salesmen.  Then they blame anyone but the production or packaging at the source location.  That tirade is the reason these crackers did not get a 5 star.<br /><br />The packaging aside and we have a tasty cracker that has withstood the sands of time.  Gee, sands of time...  Sorry, but grocery stores have few products today that were around so long ago and fundamentally presenting a similar formula of product.  I guess it might be safe to say that Nabisco followed the rule of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it (including the packaging)" routine.  The one thing I like most of all about this package of Fresh Stacks is that they are not overly packed with sugar.  So when that graham cracker crust gets cut into the end result is one of near profection and largely due to Nabisco's crackers.  I hear the background musicians saying in one breath we have to hear about all the cracked crackers and now we have to hear that the crackers have to be cracked to make crust.  Weird reviewer.  All kidding aside.  Great crackers and will continue buying even when they are cracked.  Something that tastes this good is worth a few problems.

review/summary: Good For On The Go
review/text: The Things I Like About These Honey Maid Fresh Stack Crackers--  They are portable, perfect for a lunch box or a brief case or backpack.  The packing makes it easier.  It's compact, and the way the crackers are packed you don't really need to break the crackers apart, which results in alot of the times making a mess, and for different sized crackers.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like About These Honey Maid Fresh Stack Crackers--  I didn't really care for the taste.  The taste is very bland, but then I guess they are also suitable for a topping, which would definitely make them more palatable.  I've definitely tasted other graham crackers that I've enjoyed alot more than these.  I really don't taste much of a honey taste, more of a fake taste to me.<br /><br />Good in a pinch, but that is the best thing I can say about these.  Wouldn't purchase them myself.

review/summary: Same great grahams, not much improvement on packaging
review/text: First off, let me say that the grahams are the same great honey grahams that they've always been. Nothing has changed flavor-wise. What is different here is the packaging.<br /><br />I don't dislike the new packaging, but I don't think it's much of an improvement either, at least not for my family. We still don't finish one wrapped "package" of grahams in one sitting, so we still need to put the open package into a sandwich size ziploc bag and back in the box to keep it fresh. (I tried putting it into a smaller snack size bag, but it doesn't fit.)<br /><br />Whereas the old packaging gave you 3 wrapped "packages" of double grahams per box, the new packaging gives you 6 wrapped "packages" of half-grahams. There are 8 half-grahams per package (so you are getting the equivalent of 4 of the old longer graham crackers in each wrapped package).  According to the serving size on the box, this is 2 servings. For some people this is a definite benefit. If you are feeding 2-4 people at a time, you could easily finish off one of these newly sized packages, thus saving some from going stale or from having to use a ziploc to keep the remainder fresh. However, personally, in my family we don't usually eat that many grahams at one time, so we still can't finish of one of the new size packages in one sitting. No increased benefit for us, personally (but I can see how it could be for some people).<br /><br />One plus to these new graham packages might also be for those serving small children. The crackers are already in half, so you don't need to break them yourself. (The longer grahams were always too big for little ones, I think.) I don't know about other people, but half the time when I'd try to break them, they would not break right down the middle, so this alleviates that issue.<br /><br />What would have made this new packaging perfect, would be if each individual package had a ziploc built into it so you could reseal it.  Or, they could have changed the packaging completely, getting rid of the box and packaging it more like Chips Ahoy where the cookies are not wrapped in individual packages but lined up in one large package that seals closed after you open it.<br /><br />Overall, I don't have a problem with the new package but I can't rave about it either.  It's more or less as functional as before.  Still great grahams though!

review/summary: I prefer this to the one made by "Back to Nature"; packaging can still be improved
review/text: This cracker is made of simple ingredients and tastes very simple, too, but with a mild fragrance which seems to pair well with milk. As has been expressed by another reviewer, its texture crumbles easily (a characteristic of graham crackers, I assume), but it doesn't really break easily in the middle despite what the line on each cracker seems to suggest. The fact that these crackers come in 6 little bags of 8 crackers is a good idea (as other reviewers have pointed out), though it seems to me that they could have made the bag even easier to open. As it is, when you try tearing open the bag from the side, the crackers can crumble a little bit.

review/text: This is a simple review.  Excellent Honey Maid Fresh stacks in packaging that works for those of us who keep them in vacation homes strictly for making s'mores.  I can't tell you how many boxes of graham crackers I've fed to the squirrels and birds over the years because we only needed a few crackers out of a box, and then the humidity at the lake house ruins the rest--even after double bagging in ziplock bags.<br />What a great idea.  yes, it is more expensive per cracker this way, and yes, it is not the best choice for simple packaging, but throwing out 3/4 of a box of regular packaged grahams isn't exactly good stewardship either!

review/summary: Old favourite in a S'mores-ready size
review/text: These are a winner.  As soon as I received these I called some friends and arranged a S'mores making party around their firepit.<br /><br />Being the same classic graham cracker that the kids knew and loved, there were no complaints on the flavour, no complaints on oats being on the cracker or on the cracker being "different".  Additionally, since the crackers are perfectly S'mores sized right out of the packet, there was less fuss about one kid having a more perfectly broken cracker than another, and fewer frazzled parents trying to juggle sticky burnt marshmallows while aiming for the perfect break along the serrated line for fussy kids.<br /><br />Another plus is that these are packaged in stacks of 8, which is both a perfect size for snacking and for toting around.<br /><br />This is frazzled parent and fussy kid approved. I will definitely be buying more for the summer camping trips.

review/summary: Same graham, better package
review/text: You probably already know exactly what the Honey Maid Graham cracker tastes like. Although, you might cover your grahams with chocolate and marshmallow. This is the same cracker, but half the size. Instead of 4 perforated sections, there are two.<br /><br />Each box comes with 6 "stacks" as they call them. Each stack is individually wrapped with 8 crackers. This would be the equivalent of 4 regular size grahams. I find that these stacks are reasonable sizes for single servings, so you don't end up with an opened wrapper with stale grahams. Like the originals, these stack wrappers are not resealable.<br /><br />I definetly prefer this packaging comapred to the standard packaging.

review/summary: Simple difference, great idea
review/text: These are normal Honey Maid graham crackers.  Who doesn't love them?  I found them as tasty as ever.<br /><br />The main difference in this product is a packaging difference.  While normal graham crackers come in two long packs with many crackers, this one comes with the crackers already broken down to squares.  Each small square pack of eight crackers comes in its own wrapper.<br /><br />This is a great, simple idea.  If you're a busy, on-the-go person, I think you'll find this product very convenient.  It would be great for packing a lunch for school or work in a hurry.  It would also be great for moms to throw in a purse or diaper bag to have a fast, easy snack for toddlers.  Also, in our family we find that we might only want to eat a couple of crackers, but once you open a pack you feel like you either have to eat them all or let them go to waste.  This product solves that problem.<br /><br />I would say that it depends on the price of the product if it really makes sense to buy these.  Ziplock bags are pretty cheap, and it doesn't take too terribly long to throw a few crackers in there.  Also if you have a large family that would consume an entire pack of graham crackers before these go stale, then this product adds no benefit, is harder to get into, and is worse for the environment.  All in all, though, I think this product has a place in the market.  If you're like me and find yourself trying to grab something quickly while you're always running late, this is a great choice.

review/text: I actually love the idea of smaller packages because, it never fails, the big ones get left open and get stale or smashed.  I also prefer the smaller size crackers.  They are just easier to use and save me from having to break the bigger ones in half, often resulting in a busted up cracker.  The taste is the same as ever and my family and I have always loved Honey Maid graham crackers.  So, why the four stars?  I feel that this new packaging is just a way to hide that they have reduced the amount of product in the box.  Standard graham crackers are 14.4 oz.  This one is 12.2 oz.  If they had made them the same size, I would have happily given five stars.

None were cracked in the one i received. I dont think it would be an issue anyways as they are nicely packed.<br /><br />The Texture: Lives up to its name of 'Fresh Stacks'. They are dry but not so dry that your mouth becomes parched and it becomes a chore to chew and swallow. After a little chewing it melts quite nicely in your mouth. Each cracker; you can think of as a slightly bigger square credit card in terms of the size.<br /><br />The Taste: It strikes a nice balance in terms sweetness. You definitely get a graham/cinnamon type taste; with the sweetness of honey. Works well with peanut butter as well as my personal favorite nutella.<br /><br />In case your interested here are some nutritional facts(note that this is for 1 pack,i.e, 8 crackers):<br />Calories: 250<br />Fat: 6 g<br />Total Carbs: 46g<br />Sugars: 16g

They are the usual, delicious Honey Maid graham crackers, only they are halved into squares which are packed into 6 separate servings of 6 squares. The point? To keep them fresh, which is much appreciated, and also to make them ready to pack for lunch or travel! Great idea! I've had graham crackers that have been in the fridge too long, and they're not so good. These are crisper than I'm even used to ever having. The individual packages are sometimes tough to open, but that is my only complaint here. Well, that and one other. Aren't you going to make Fresh Stacks of the chocolate grahams? Love those. And I know my mom loves the cinnamon ones. As yet though, I have only seen the Honey version in Fresh Stacks form.

review/text: These taste identical to the regular packages of Honey Maid honey grahams.  The difference is in the packaging.  Each plastic package holds 8 half-crackers.  This means each individual package is half the width and about 2/3 the height of the regular product.<br /><br />I try to avoid buying products with excessive packaging, and these actually don't have a whole lot more waste than the regular box. We are always putting our grahams in ziplocks to keep them fresh, but this new product makes it easier to grab a pack to go.<br /><br />Overall love the new format, especially for camping and traveling.  This is our kids #1 snack.

review/summary: Conveniently Portable Graham Cracker Snacks
review/text: I suspect that anyone in this country that is over three years old has tried graham crackers; they have been a snack item around our house for years. We go through phases of eating them frequently to eating them occasionally but we rarely go for too long a time without having them at snack time.<br /><br />The problem we have occasionally encountered is the problem of staying crisp; when they aren't consumed fairly quickly, especially in a humid climate, they can get soft and lose a lot of their charm. This is countered by packaging them in individual groups of crackers which can be opened sequentially.<br /><br />What Nabisco has done with these is to use that principle to package only eight crackers in an individually sealed package. The package can be partially resealed if one is not in the mood for all eight at once.<br /><br />According to the package a serving size is four squares which would apparently mean there are two servings per individual packet. The section on Nutrition Facts distinguishes between four squares and one fresh stack with all numbers rounded. As one would expect the values for the stack, which would be eight crackers is about twice the number for four which would be considered one serving. One serving is 130 calories, Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Potassium 50 mg, Dietary Fiber 1g, Sugars 8g, and Protein 2g.<br /><br />A fairly nutritious combination in a convenient carry-along package; a nice solution if you're on the go or looking for really crisp crackers at home. Personally I find them much tastier with peanut butter spread on them!

review/summary: Same great product, more convenient packaging
review/text: These are the same Nabisco graham crackers that have been around for decades, so I don't need to describe the product to you.  However, this new multi-insert packaging allows you to use fewer crackers at a time without exposing the rest of the crackers in the box to the air.  There are six smaller packages within each large box instead of the traditional two.  That means the unused packages retain their freshness seal rather than allowing the crackers to become stale like an open package would.  The crackers haven't changed, but the packaging has improved, so the next time you buy Nabisco grahams, make sure you get the "Fresh Stacks" packaging - a definite advantage over the other packages.

review/summary: S'mores!
review/text: We love Honey Maid's graham crackers in our family, especially having a toddler around they're practically a staple in our household. The Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are conveniently packaged, but still the same graham crackers we've loved. When I first saw the Fresh Stacks version the first thing I thought of was that these are perfect for s'mores! We will definitely be packing these for our next camping trip. (Or even our next trip to the mall, for that matter, my daughter will enjoy these anytime.) We're also a fan of making ice cream sandwiches with them, spreading Nutella on them, and adding them to desserts we make (s'mores brownies, anyone?)<br /><br />As a mom, I appreciate the simply ingredient list - it's not full of scary looking words that I can't pronounce. Honey grahams can be the perfect snack and now Honey Maid offers them in portable, perfectly portioned little packs. Great for the lunchbox, the diaper bag, the carry on bag, you get the idea...

The small packages also make it convenient to take a snack along on the road. I just toss a pack in the diaper bag and when the kids are hungry I break it out. These were a big hit in my house and make a great treat.

review/summary: I get it - same great crackers, better packaging
review/text: I have been eating Graham Crackers since I was a kid. 50 years ago, my mother spread peanut butter on a few and wrapped them in wax paper with my lunch. But she always broke up the double length crackers and I got used to eating them that way. We usually have a box or two (or three) around the house and I still break them up to relive the good old days. With today's new packaging, the crackers come pre-split and wrapped nicely to keep them fresh. Clever idea, I must say.<br /><br />I just have to figure a way to package some peanut butter so I can have them the old fashioned way during recess.

review/summary: crunchy filling graham-like cracker
review/text: These crackers remind me a lot of graham crackers. They have a similar taste, texture, and crunchiness. They do however seem a little denser and more filling. Much like graham crackers, they're delicious with peanut butter.<br /><br />They also come nicely packed in 6 individual plastic packages of crackers. The extra packages keep them fresh longer because you don't have to open them all at once. It also makes them more portable as each package is a square instead of a long rectangle which makes them a lot better for packing in lunches or anything else portable.

review/summary: Handy convenient packaging
review/text: Honey Maid graham crackers are naturally good and rank high on my list when it comes to buying graham crackers.  So this reveiw is for the packaging and not the product.  The crackers come in 12.2 ounce box with six half stacks.  These make for ease in adding to lunches, picnics or any on-the-go activity.  That basically means that two of these stacks make up one standard size stack.  Price makes these more expensive, around $4.50, than the regular package but much more convenient for travel.  If you are buying graham crakers for cheese cake or pie crusts buy the regular package, but for carrying convenience this is the way to go.  Well worth having on hand.

review/summary: These really are fresher.
review/text: I LOVE graham crackers, and Honey Maid is my favorite brand.  Always has been, and probably always will.<br /><br />I expected the main benefit of these Fresh Stacks crackers to be that they would stay fresher longer -- the reason being each "stack" only contains two servings (4 squares per serving).  They did succeed in this way.  However, I noticed, upon opening a Fresh Stack, that they also started out tasting fresher than the standard Honey Maid grahams.  They also had a fresh "snap" to them upon biting a piece off a cracker.  I'm not sure why, and it's certainly something I didn't expect.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about these crackers is that they don't easily break in half the way the standard Honey Maid does.  They do have the typical "score" mark that graham crackers usually have, but the score is not as deep, so they don't break cleanly  in half.  This probably won't be a big deal for children or adults, but I really do prefer breaking them in half for older babies and toddlers.

review/summary: New packaging fits better with modern life
review/text: Chocolate bar-check! Ginormous marshmallows-check! Big box o' graham crackers-check! Make one, two, three s'mores. Wow, that's really way too sweet to deal with more than once a year.<br />So, the rest of the chocolate bar is gone before the evening is out. A couple of the marshmallows get thrown into cocoa before they become puffy rocks and they get tossed or the dog snags the bag.<br />But the crackers? They get put back into the box and go back up on the shelf by the high fiber stick cereal you really should eat instead of swiping the kid's sugar pellets. On a quest for snacks 3 months later  you find the sad, super stale remains falling out of the inadequate wax paper wrap and opt for a bowl of crispy twigs instead.<br />Not any longer! Honey Maid has changed up the way they package graham crackers to better mesh with life today. The smaller packs fit easily in purses, diaper bags, or the outside pocket of the gym bag.<br />It's a great size for sharing. The opaque plastic wrap you've known and loved from Premium Saltines now protects the slightly sweet wholesomeness of eight 2 3/8-inch  square Honey Maid crackers.<br />When opened, you get to experience the aroma of super fresh crackers. And two weeks later when you open another package -- they're still super fresh and crispy. Great idea Nabisco!<br />Nom, nom, nom!

review/summary: Just the right amount!
review/text: Graham crackers are a great snack, but the problem is when the package is opened, they usually get stale before you eat them all out of the packets in the box.  This new smaller packaging will prevent that problem. The crackers are the same as usual, but the packaging is much more convenient. The box comes with individual packets with 1/2 the usual amount per packet, so you can probably eat them all up before they go stale. There are 8 crackers per packet, but they are half crackers, so it is really like 4 of the usual size ones. The packs are perfect for toting around for kids, or in the desk drawer at work, I even keep a packet in the car incase of emergency hunger pangs. I will never buy the big packs again, this smaller size makes so much more sense. Try them, you will probalby like the smaller size packaging too.

review/summary: I like the convenience
review/text: Okay, so I love graham crackers; ever since I was a kid. I suppose everyone does. But I want to address the new packaging, which is what is really at stake here. It is funny that I "just happened" (serendipitously) to get tired of the music on the radio and pop it over to AM today in time to hear some right-wing guy foaming at the mouth over this exact product! It was amazing. My timing could not have been better. First off, whoever it was, was hilarious. he really was going off about how you pay the same amount for less graham cracker (goodness &lt;--my word).<br /><br />Well, I don't quite see it that way. Look, I am certain graham crackers will still come in the industrial size, but the idea of the new packaging is to keep them fresher longer. The BIG problem with graham crackers (other than the fact that they don't all come topped with double-cinnamon and sugar of course) is that you eat a few and say "yum!" and then you put the box away. When you come back for more, usually a week or two later, they are a bit mushy. They never quite taste as good as they do when you first open that brown wax papery wrapper. Actually I am crunching the wrapper now. is that cellophane? well you can use a ziploc baggie (if you have one handy) but it is a bit of a hassle and not 100%. But with the new packaging each "stack" (each little package is about -- wait,let me count the one's I haven't eaten yet and do some math here . . .) looks like about 8 "half crackers" (remember traditional graham crackers are doubles and you have to break them in half).<br /><br />That is a large "single serving" for me. It is about enough for you and your girlfriend to share (give her the larger half (she gets 5 and you get 3 if you want to a happy marriage in the future) with a romantic glass of milk(?) or hot chocolate by a fire. If you have kids you could toss them each a pre-wrapped "stack" and nobody argues about sharing or getting less.<br /><br />There is a downside to this though. It seems most of my graham crackers are broken. This really annoys me. Perhaps it was just this box I am reviewing, but I like my graham crackers unbroken and pristine (and if at all possible coated with cinnamon and sugar--but they never quite give you enough c&s). These are still crunchy and tasty; I am having some now with some hot chocolate, just to ensure accuracy, but this broken thing really gets me.<br /><br />Now as a disclaimer: I did get these through the Vine program, so they have been mailed, but it seems to me that ALL graham crackers are mailed, or trucked, or planed . . . It may be the packaging on this. So, the result is that they are super convenient. You know how many graham crackers you are eating and you can EASILY stop at one stack and know you haven't binged on "most of the box." That part is nice. The smaller wrapper serves as a nice "holder" while you are eating your graham crackers, so you don't need a plate, and if you don;t tear it open all the way it catches the crumbs from broken crackers. You simply toss it away when you are done. I am not sure what the recycle factor there is on this brown plasticy-paper stuff.<br /><br />I can strongly recommend this for convenience. You should check the prices locally to make sure you are not paying a lot more per ounce of course. But it really does make sure that every time you want some graham crackers they are fresh and tasty, and just the right amount. This was a great idea.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for reading.

review/text: They've taken a familiar product and changed the packaging and I love it!  I remember the days when my graham crackers used to get dried out because the box and the wrapper had been opened and there was no easy way to save the rest of the package in an airtight fashion.  This new packaging takes the smaller squares and puts fewer of them in the familiar waxy-like wrapping paper.  This makes it very easy to take a small package with you and put it in your purse or add it to a lunch box.  You don't have to worry about the rest of the package drying out.  I simply love this idea and will be buying this product more often in the future as a result.

review/summary: Honey graham cracker goodness!
review/text: I've always loved graham crackers, they are one of my childhood comfort foods that I used to spread with peanut butter or made into S'mores.  I don't buy graham crackers often (not sure why), so I was excited for the oppportunity to try this product, Honey Maid Fresh Stacks Honey Grahams.  The crackers themselves were as I remembered, super crispy and tasty.  What I do like that's different(and is the point of this specific product) are the smaller, 2" by 2" wax paper cubes ("stacks") that hold eight square crackers.  Graham crackers typically have been packaged in much larger wax paper bricks, and once opened the uneaten crackers needed to be eaten at that time or put into airtight containers soon thereafter.  Graham crackers seem to practically act like desiccants in absorbing moisture from the air, so if they're not eaten soon, they will get soft.  These smaller wax packages are a nice solution to this issue of having too many crackers unwrapped at a time.<br /><br />Each 12.2 ounce box has six cubes (or "stacks"), and each stack has eight crackers which, according to the box, is two servings of four crackers each.  I think in all honesty one stack is, for most of us, one serving.  &lt;g>  These grahams are low fat, relatively low sugar, and each stack (8 square crackers) provides 12% daily recommendation of fiber and 10% of iron.  Certainly better than a lot of other snack options.  I will be getting this product again.

review/summary: Simple, but tasty & S'mores-ready
review/text: So, I'm usually a Keebler guy, and even then it's the Cinnamon Grahams.  That said, I don't eat a lot of any sort of graham on a regular basis regardless ... my household would (most days) test graham-negative across the board (for you microbiologists out there ;), so this is sort of a minor detour from the norm for me.  Still, nothing wrong with a little Honey Maid from time to time.<br /><br />Anyway, the packaging is about right for two people to share a packet (2 -not 4- individual, regular rectangular crackers each, stacked 8 high).  This is a departure from the old 4 per sheet packaging, and it's a huge deal, and here's why.  To finish off one of the old (standard/larger) packets of graham crackers (4X the amount per packet, roughly), you have to be both voracious and consistent in your crumbly graham consumption.  If not, your crackers are likely to go stale before the open packet is gone, necessitating waste and the opening of another big packet.  These "Fresh Stacks" packets are a day or two's worth of breakfast snack, then you open a new/fresh pack w/o wasting the old one.  Yes, it's more packaging and smaller, but seriously, haven't you ever had the size/spoilage issue?  Savings via bulk aren't savings until you consume everything you bought.  Barring that, you need a new calculation factoring in only price per quantity used...just sayin.<br /><br />More importantly, who's ever made S'mores and had to 1) hold a piece of chocolate 2) hold a fire-stick with a flaming marshmallow on the end while 3) trying to break a graham-cracker slab into roughly equal halves ... all the while holding off inquisitive, insistent and "helpful" little fingers and a frenzied dog (who also seems to think chocolate is the cure for cancer, adding to the furor) amid a chorus of verbal coaching on how to "do it right" ... ?  Am I the only one?  So, I hate it when the slab breaks unevenly, thus these Honey Maid Fresh Stacks eliminate the challenging operation of bisecting a graham cracker slab while both of my hands are partially otherwise engaged.  Not that it's a giant, groundbreaking innovation, but I usually judge inventions and updates to products based on how many times I've said, "Dang!" in reference to the situation said innovation addresses.  I've said "Dang!" to stale, half-gone packs of grahams, and I've said, "Dang!" to botched S'mores, so these cut the mustard in my book.  Like with the spaghetti pot on TV that has holes in the lid for easily draining your noodles, I found myself wondering why nobody came up with this sooner...

review/summary: The REAL REASON They Changed the Packaging
review/text: I ate these crackers as a child, and from time to time as an adult.  It has been several years since I had them; they are still really tasty.  As I a kid, I liked to dunk them in milk: an afternoon snack that brings back a happy feeling from my childhood.<br /><br />They taste slightly different to me, probably because they reduced the amount or type of fat used to make them, or reduced the salt, to make them healthier by today's standards.  Anyway, I still like them.<br /><br />But the PACKAGING is different: these are "Fresh Stacks"; smaller packets, and more of them.  This is an "improvement": the crackers will stay fresher that way, or that's what they want you think.  But what they don't tell you is that you also get fewer crackers per box.<br /><br />I think the old package will disappear: this is the replacement.  Soon you won't have a choice between the older packaging and the new.  Why? I read about this in the New York Times, the same day I wrote this review.  (You can find the article at nytimes dot com slash 2011 slash 03 slash 29 slash business slash 29shrink.html.)<br /><br />"Kraft is introducing 'Fresh Stacks' packages for its Nabisco Premium saltines and Honey Maid graham crackers. Each has about 15 percent fewer crackers than the standard boxes, but the price has not changed. Kraft says that because the Fresh Stacks include more sleeves of crackers, they are more portable and "the packaging format offers the benefit of added freshness," said Basil T. Maglaris, a Kraft spokesman, in an e-mail."<br /><br />Since the article says it has 15% less, they must have reduced the package size before, because I remember the box as one pound, this package is 12.2 ounces.<br /><br />They reduced the quantity to keep the product at the same price point:<br /><br />"Consumers are generally more sensitive to changes in prices than to changes in quantity," John T. Gourville, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, said. "And companies try to do it in such a way that you don't notice, maybe keeping the height and width the same, but changing the depth so the silhouette of the package on the shelf looks the same. Or sometimes they add more air to the chips bag or a scoop in the bottom of the peanut butter jar so it looks the same size."<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with this approach, though it seems a little sneaky.  It happens all the time, probably always has; still, it is useful to know about it.  It does not take away from my opinion of the product.  After all, the alternative is that the product would cost more, because prices go up with time.

If you don't use them up quickly, maybe that's a good idea for you, but if you're going to be using the whole package to make a graham cracker crust, for example, this is simply wasteful.

review/summary: Fresh Crunchy Grahams Every Time!
review/text: I love graham crackers.  They're one of my all time favorite snacks but I don't like them after they lose their just opened crunch.  I immediately loved the idea of individual serving packs of grahams.  They're great for taking as a snack to work or putting in your lunch, and whenever you eat them, they're fresh, crunchy and perfect. I actually wish that the "fresh stacks" would have been made a little smaller because 8 square crackers is more than I can eat at one time so I still end up having to have sandwich bag or container to seal them up.  I think four graham squares would be the perfect size or the "fresh stacks" could be made resealable.

review/summary: same graham cracker in different packaging
review/text: This is a curious item.  The product itself is actually the same as Nabisco's graham crackers that come in larger sheets and larger packages.  I guess someone at Nabisco thought it made sense to repackage these graham crackers into smaller portions, but with all of the "100 calorie snack packs" that abound today I think Nabisco missed the mark here.  Each "stack" of these crackers is actually nearly two servings, which contain about 250 calories total.  The box itself gives the nutritional information for a full stack (7 squares) as well as for 4 squares, so it seems like Nabisco is acknowledging that the full stack is more than one should eat at one sitting.  I'm not sure why they packaged these crackers in this manner, then, since the crackers would stay more fresh if each individually wrapped packet contained only one serving.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I quite like graham crackers and enjoy these, but I prefer the kind with a cinnamon and sugar coating versus these more plain, honey graham crackers.<br /><br />Good with cold milk!

review/text: If you like to pack graham crackers for snacks in lunches and backpacks, these small stacks are a great way to keep portions under control. Instead of having to open a big stack of cracker sheets, and have them stale and limp a few days later, these small packs of squares stay crisp and crunchy.<br /><br />The box has six stacks of eight squares each. Nutritional information is provided for both a serving (four squares) or an entire stack (eight squares).<br /><br />These stacks make sense financially, you're not throwing away unused cracker sheets that went stale or paying for baggies to seal up leftovers.<br /><br />They make sense from a dietary perspective too, it is painless portion control.

Each box contains a total of 6 stacks and each stack has 8 cracker graham cracker squares. The total calories for an individual stack are 250 calories.<br /><br />These snacks are ideal if you are in a hurry and want to grab something and are great for throwing in lunch boxes. Another plus, is the smaller packaging does not compromise the freshness of the product.

review/summary: Keeping it Fresh
review/text: Most people would wonder what is so great or different about New Honey Maid Fresh Stacks Honey Grahams crackers. Well, it's not just the fresh taste of the crackers themselves that has me excited. It's the New packaging. You see, Honey Maid has taken their crispy, tasty crackers and put them in 6 individual packages that hold about 8 crackers each. and The crackers are not the larger ones that can be broken up into smaller pieces. These are big squares. (about 2 inches square)<br />This individual packaging is great for school lunches, portion control or when you just want a few crackers and dont want to leave a whole package open. The crackers remain fresher and crispy I think this is a wonderful idea and it makes the crackers taste that much better. I know I will be popping a package in my bag for a mid-day snack at work. Honey Maid took something I already love and made it better. Now THAT'S "Keeping it Fresh"

review/summary: My favorite graham crackers without the waste
review/text: My one beef with graham crackers is that they always seem to go stale within a day of opening the package (even when we transfer them to a ziplok bag).  Since my 3 year old and I are the only ones who eat graham crackers, we always end up throwing half of a usual packet away.  With these fresh stacks, we don't have the waste, which is wonderful.  Each little package has just the six squares, perfect for snacking for the two of us (pair with peanut butter or nutella for a real delight!).<br /><br />When you think of graham crackers, Honey Maid grahams are the traditional ones that come to mind.  The Keebler grahams are a little too sweet/cookie-ish and the store brand grahams are simply inedible.  I always get the Honey Maid for that nice graham taste, and love using them for s'mores.<br /><br />Great new packaging!

review/summary: Standard Graham Crackers; Better Packaging
review/text: Honey Maid Graham crackers have been around for years and they taste the same.  It's a dependable snack that isn't too high in sugar.  In fact, the nursing facility I work at allows graham crackers and milk as an approved snack for their diabetics.<br /><br />The packaging is ideal, and will probably result in less waste of crackers that aren't eaten immediately, as these crackers become stale overnight once opened.  You get 8 crackers in each individually wrapped snack, which, in my opinion is more than twice what one person should eat in one sitting.  Institutions are sold graham crackers packaged in two's, and that would be better, I think.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned: these crackers drop a lot of crumbs when broken apart.  Therefore, these snacks are better eaten outside, or directly over a plate.<br /><br />If I had to choose between purchasing graham crackers packaged in bigger portions, and these smaller packages, I'd pick the smaller.  While I am still wasting some crackers due to staleness, it's not nearly as many as before.

review/summary: Honey Maid Stacks
review/text: I never understood why graham crackers in such large sheets...like little sheets of plywood. :) These are the same graham crackers that you know but are packaged in a more travel friendly size.<br /><br />Whether making smores, packing for a lunch, or just grabbing a quick snack this size of cracker makes more sense then the large sheet of plywood that you would have to break into a more manageable size only to have them break in an uneven manner.<br /><br />Taste is great - they could win a grahammy!

review/summary: Same product, different box. On-the-go convenience!
review/text: It has been awhile since I had Honey Maid graham crackers, and my taste buds welcomed that classic graham cracker taste back when I opened these up for the first time!  They were a bit more dry and crunchy than I had remembered them, though.  Not the greatest by themselves in that state but crying out to be dipped in milk!<br /><br />A few things to point out:<br />1- the picture of the packaging here at amazon makes it look like maybe there's a cellophane see-through top on the box, but it's actually just the usual cardboard box, but with a photograph on top of what the contents are.  Nice to see a fair representation OUTside the box of what is INside, though, unlike many ('not actual size') products!<br /><br />2- the standard rectangular graham cracker size has been halved into two separate squares.<br /><br />3- the paper packages that contain stacks of graham crackers contain fewer squares than the 'regular' packaging.  I think there were 8 squares in each mini-package.  They are, however, just as awkward to tear open.  I remember the 'regular' packaging being wrapped much tighter around the crackers, too.  Seems like you're less likely to get stale crackers in this new package design.<br /><br />Why buy these instead of the 'regular' packaging?  Mostly because it's more convenient to take on the go.  I would argue that one mini-pack is almost too much of a snack for one grown-up, and definitely too much for one toddler!  But my 4-year-old and I together enjoyed one at the park the other day, so all is well!

review/summary: Better. Much better.
review/text: Moisture is their kryptonite so this works. Once you open a pack of graham crackers there's a clock on 'em... there seems to be no climate dry enough. These are full size crispy squares, a pack holds six crackers. (I'll take the side of cookie in the cookie-vs-cracker debate if you're in the mood to argue.) I'm unexpectedly grateful that I'll never ever have to eat another soft graham cracker. Sort of takes a load off.

review/summary: About time!!
review/text: Honey Maid graham crackers smaller portion packaging is  big win in our house. As a parent of five- three eight and under-- snacks and lunches are a daily struggle. When I open the traditional size package of graham crackers no matter how hard I plan there are always some leftover and I can't count how many half packs I've tossed because the crackers have become soft. Currently I purchase the bulk box warehouse option of Honey Maid Graham Crackers and while I will still continue to get this size I will also buy a few boxes of the fresh stacks to stick in lunches, to take to the park, stick in a backpack/diaper bag etc. This size will be for the kids (big and small) in our home who open the large packages, take out two crackers and never ever put the leftovers in airtight containers!!!
