review/summary: Great for Iced Tea
review/text: I am not a hot tea drinker.  But, having grown up in the south, I am very big on iced tea.  I like my iced tea to have a little flavor.  I know mint is common favorite, and my Mom used to make orange tea, but I found this to be my favorite.  You can make your iced tea in the 'fridge or you can make sun tea.  This is a great flavor!

review/summary: Smooth not Bitter
review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/summary: Tatsteh Tea
review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/summary: The freshest, fights edema!
review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

review/text: My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/text: I found Inka in a discount store.  I'd been using Pero, trying to get off coffee.  Pero was OK, but tasted a little like burnt cereal.  And also, tasted somewhat like I was drinking gruel.  Only gruel tastes better.  So I picked up this can for half price to try it, and I really like it much better.  I see it used to have 2 other ingredients, but since I never tried that formula, I can't judge if it was better or worse.  I do like it with just barley and rye.  Pero has the same ingredients, but either different proportions or different processing, because it does not taste as good to me.  So I looked up Inka to see where I could get it when the discount store is out of it!  I vote for it.  Very good flavor, very pleasant and smooth.

review/text: We love all kinds of tea and with cooler weather, particularly chai and cardamom tea. We purchase the Tetley offering due to the value compared to the others available, even though we have enjoyed Sadaf brand. Now I wish we had ordered Sadaf again, as it has a better flavor and is not sharp like Tetley's. Live and learn . . .

review/summary: The Best Earl Grey By Far
review/text: Bergamot is the name of both a North American herb, and an oily extract of a specific variety of Seville oranges.  It is this orange peel extract that is used in perfumes, and also in flavoring Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />Twinings is the best Earl Grey of any of the many brands that we've tried.  Aromatic and fine, the scent of bergamot is apparent as soon as you break the cellophane wrapper.  If you prefer Twining's loose tea in the tin, that is just as good.  A little sugar and milk bring out the complex flavors.  (With boiling water, of course!  None of that bath water that's been sitting in a coffee urn for two hours.)<br /><br />We buy the six-box package, on the six-month automatic refill plan, and like that a lot.  The tea stays nice and fresh in the sealed boxes until we open them.

review/summary: Let down by an old friend....
review/text: I have loved this tea since my college days - 20+ years ago.  Now it just isn't the same.  I have been drinking another brand and find it much better - fuller flavor.  On the label I notice that Twining's uses bergamont flavoring.  My other brand uses bergamont oil which is the classic source of the distinctive flavor.  I am leary of "flavoring" as it is often used when a company is to cheap to use the real ingredient. I wrote Twinings asking if they use bergamont oil.  There answer was "no".  I guess that it why it is inferior to the other brand I am drinking.  Note - I am not comparing a specialty shop blend but another large tea brand at the same price point.

review/summary: I'm glad I picked the Twining's Brand
review/text: I've found there is a quality difference between Twining's and other brands.  I hadn't noticed that much of a difference until I happened to buy another brand of Earl Grey from a local grocery store, and found the oil content of the flower (burgamet) from Italy that is used to give the tea that distinctive flavor was too strong.  In the other brand (I will not disparage the other brand name), the oil content was so high as to occasionally upset my stomach.  With Twining's the content is perfect and I do not have the problem, even after consuming several cups of the morning.<br /><br />It still has the distinctive flavor, but just not as strong.

review/summary: "Earl Grey, not so hot!"
review/text: Apparently, Earl Grey is not my cup of tea. I've been drinkin' tea, mostly black, since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Also, I love oranges, especially Mandarin. So, I thought: "Hey...why not try Earl Grey...let's see what all the hoopla is about?" To be fair, this tea gives off a very pleasant scent, especially before brewing. I guess it's no accident that they put orange oil in many perfumes. Bergamot, an essential oil from the Mediterranean orange, is the main flavoring agent in this tea. I guess I'm just not a fan of perfume [no offense, Jean-Luc] or citrus in my tea. So much for my excursion into hoity-toity land, I'm right back to my ol' standby, nickel-a-cup, Tetley Tea and my ultimate fav, Bigelow's Raspberry Royale from the good ol' USA.

review/summary: Among the best Earl Grey tea available
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/summary: The most taste-less Earl Grey ever
review/text: I love drinking tea, and Earl Grey has been my choice everywhere I go.  I enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves, a habit that I have given up for the ease of tea bags.  Twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from Amazon.  Earl Grey totally lost its poignancy.  Even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea.<br /><br />At first I thought it was the recent degradation of Earl Grey tea as a result of climate change etc.  Then I tasted other brand's Earl Grey and found acceptable.  I went to the length and bought another pack of Twining Earl Grey tea from a grocery store, and I tasted alright.  So I can only conclude the tastelessness of Twinings Earl Grey is associated with packages I bought from Amazon.<br /><br />I found this to be true with Amazon's Darjeeling tea as well.

review/summary: Mouthwatering marinade
review/text: This is by far the best marinade I've ever used.  In fact, I haven't used anything else since trying it.  Even my wife, who isn't a big steak eater, said the last few steaks I've made were the best she'd ever had off of a backyard grill.  No other seasoning (including regular A1) or salt is required for a mouthwatering steak, nor must you buy the finest cuts.  You don't even have to marinade your meats for long; only a half hour.  Of course letting it marinade longer only adds to the flavor.  I joined Amazon's subscription service, receiving another six bottles every six months knowing I couldn't go wrong and to save another few dollars.  This stuff goes for $4+ in my local stores and they don't always have it in stock.  I've tried A1's Chicago and it isn't bad either, but the New York is my go to.

FIRST PROBLEM: it is supposedly low in carb but it takes a stick of butter and a mountain of heavy cream to make it.  Huh? Low carb but heart attack fat?  YUK.  SECOND PROBLEM: it is very difficult to make - it has three different bags, needs three bowls, lots of measuring, lots of utensils, lots of work.  It would have been less work to create from scratch.  THIRD PROBLEM: it did not create a "jelly roll" type item - it created a big gloppy sticky mess that was difficult to work with.  FOURTH PROBLEM:  It did not come out like a roll; it came out like a biscuit or a scone.  Just a baked glob.  FIFTH PROBLEM:  it tasted LOUSY.  Just plain lousy.  Not even the pecan topping tasted good.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this mess.  This is the second one of the Dixie Low Carb items I've made and each one is worse than the next.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, not all that exotic, though...
review/text: I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid "bite."  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one.

review/summary: Gluten free, high protein, and delicious
review/text: I'm on a gluten-free, high-protein, low-sugar regimen, and The Simply Bars beat out all other competition in these categories. I've tried - and liked - several of The Simply Bars, but the taste of this one makes it my favorite.

review/summary: I was warned by the reviews..
review/text: As warned by other reviews, I received the WRONG product! Thank goodness i dont mind the coffee chocolate flavor too much, but i had tried the raspberry, preferred it, and ORDERED it! If this was a restaurant i'd get an apology from the waiter and my dish would very likely be complimentary considering i'd eat after my friends' food would be done (or COLD!).

review/summary: French adult chocolate energy bar  LOVE it!
review/text: Finally a grown up  energy bar that isn't like over sweet kid stuff.<br /><br />Took the Cocoa Raspberry bar and broke off 1/4 of it and added it to the cup of homemade yogurt I had as part of breakfast.  Was a nice change from the fresh fruit I usually add. Again a very grown up energy bar, sans the heavy sweetness, which I really appreciate. Now....because this isnt a Hershey chocolate sweet sweet sweet bar, some may not appreciate it as much as we did.  It's what we call a French energy bar for adults.<br /><br />Also love that the wrapper is clean and crisp in design and notes Protein,calories,sugar,fiber as well as natural, vegan,etc. Easy as I dislike having to search a wrapper for the basic information I am looking for.  Have evolved into a veganish lifestyle and need and want foods that are healthy. As a rule I don't buy pre made foods, but The Simply Bar is an item that I am going to allow for weekly treats.

review/summary: I'm addicted
review/text: Right flavor arrived and our whole family LOVED it, including kids.  We prefer this one so much more than the lemon.  I had to change my subscription to once/month instead of every three months.  Both the chocolate and the tart raspberry flavors are present, but it is not sickeningly sweet like most bars.  It's a great snack to throw in the lunch box or to take along in the car when you feel munchy.

review/summary: Wrong flavor
review/text: These might be good, or maybe not... I don't know. They sent Cocoa Coffee flavor instead of the Raspberry I ordered. Typical Amazon.com service.

review/summary: They sent the wrong flavor
review/text: I ordered a box of raspberry flavored bars and they sent me the coffee flavor instead. This bar is truly amazing but I only like the raspberry and peanut butter flavor. The coffee flavor tastes like soap and I am very disappointed that for the price I paid, I did not get what I wanted.

review/summary: The Simply Inedible Bar!
review/text: I agree with the person who termed these "inedible".  I was sent the wrong flavor and ended up with a box of cocoa-coffee instead of the cocoa raspberry I had ordered.  The bar was bitter and terrible.  I worked on the assumption that perhaps another flavor would be better.  I tried the lemon bar, and although it wasn't bitter, it had basically no flavor and was a lot like what you'd imagine a bar made of birdseed would be.  Do not waste your money on these.

review/summary: Recommend
review/text: Recommend this product- I chose it because it is gluten free and dairy free.  It is a good protein source and does not irritate my stomach.  I keep them in my bag for a quick snack- it will satisfy my hunger until mealtime.  I like that I can actually pronounce the ingredients as well.

review/summary: Completely Inedible
review/text: I've been buying all kinds of energy bars for a while now, and honestly I've never stumbled upon an "inedible"  bar before... every brand tasted great to me. I especially like the Luna and Larabars, but other brands like Clif are also find. But this bar was just completely inedible... the caloric content was impressive, but what's the point if I can't even swallow a piece? Flavor was horrible as well. I still have 14 bars left in the package... in case anyone wants those.
