review/summary: Chocolate connoisseurs and Adults rejoice!
review/text: Having grown up on chocolate in the 60's and 70's and not only the commerical stuff from the US, but imported stuff from south of the Border, I have a very picky chocolate taste bud (much like my Coffee taste bud).  Biting into a piece of Green & Blacks will bring back memories of how you remember chocolate used to taste, earthy, rich and yummy!<br />Sadly, eating a piece of anything else, is much like a Chocolate FLAVORED gooy, additive laced, piece of fat.  From time to time i still try eating the others, and none can COMPARE!

review/summary: Tastes Like Dirt
review/text: I wandered into a Whole Foods (the favorite store of our snobby Socialist president!) to get some cash through a debit purchase, saw the Green & Black's chocolate and figured what the heck. I came at the situation with no preconceptions and actually expected it to be a good chocolate bar.<br /><br />But in reality, it tastes like dirt. Dirt with almonds in it.<br /><br />The best chocolate out there is still Ghirardelli. Failing that, go for Cadbury. But don't fall for the hippie message and pseudo-gourmet pricing & availability. Green & Black's is inedible.

review/summary: Does salt need to have flakes?
review/text: I thought it would be better when seasoning meats and such but I would go with the grey salt instead. Reason for that is the grey salt melts better into the meats. I would still recommend this product but it's more for show than for use. It is good quality so no complaints there.<br /><br />I would still recommend.

review/text: I looked up some recipes on the company's site and then invented my own. I add coconut at the beginning of cooking (the organic coconut is drier than then such products as angel flakes which has metabisulfite--very very bad for you). I also make it with coconut milk and keep thinking I want to get some coconut extract to finish it off although vanilla is ok. It can become any flavor you want it to. I add some extra tapioca starch (about 1 TB) to help it thicken.

review/summary: Not as expected
review/text: I have ordered Flossies several times.  First few times they were great and well worth the money.  Lasted a long time.  I have an 11 pound Bichon who loves to chew. I order 20 at a time.  This last time, they were much different.  Very skinny and seemed to be stretched much more.  My dog finished it in about an hour. Usually she works on her flossie for days.<br /><br />Amazon Communication Center wrote: We do not sort flossies and because they are natural one box can be<br />thiner then another. we sell over 100 box a week, so it is quite possible.<br />I am very sorry you got a bad batch.<br /><br />I have ordered them from another source and hopefully, if I get a bad batch, they will stand behind their product.  It seems impossible that all 20 could be so thin.  They come loose and not pre-packaged.<br /><br />Good luck to anyone who orders Flossies from Amazon.

review/summary: Big dogs devour these
review/text: as the other reviewer says.  I have 3 dogs (2 large Bouviers and 1 Bichon). They loved these.  The small dog was able to spend some time chewing these (I have to lock her in her crate away from the big dogs, though). These weren't individually wrapped, but they weren't smelly or yucky to handle.  They were stretched out as in the picture and stiff.  I didn't worry about choking.  They came in a big box with other items in the order (and so I wish they would have been prepackaged in a large bag to separate them from the other items).  These are a US product and have nothing added to them that I know of so I felt safe in giving them to the dogs. I have ordered from Entirely Pets before and they are quick to ship, but when they miss something they will quickly send out the missing items.  I bought these at $2.29 each which is probably the sale price, but I wish I could find them for less sometime.  DHL delivered them to me.

review/summary: Does not taste like dates
review/text: I love dates.  I eat them when I want something sweet and I bake with them.  I have bought other brands of chopped dates countless times.<br />I bought a 4 pack of these and I do not like them.  I like many of the products this manf makes.  With prechopped dates normally the first flavor is sweet, then the date taste kicks in.  With these the first flavor is oat, they are hardley sweet and have almost no date flavor.  The limited flavor they will add are not worth the extra calories (dates are high in sugar so 1/3 cup has 130 calories).<br />These chopped dates are coated in oat flour so they do not stick.  Other manf use some sort of sugar.  The oat seemed like a great idea. I planned on baking cookies and muffins with these so the oat taste would have been okay if there also was a sweet date taste.<br />The very small amount of oat flour did not change the consistancy.<br />Maybe I just got a bad batch of no-flavor dates but I would expect the manf quality control to prevent something like this.<br />Before wasting money on 4 of these I suggest you buy a single bag to see if you like them.<br />The 4 bags are well packed in a nice color printed carton.

review/text: I am a fan of Bob's Red Mill's products and have been eating the date PIECES for years and love them. I decided to give the "Crumbles" a try since I use dates in baking and thought the smaller bits would be good for that as well as in my cereal.<br /><br />I received the item and the freshness date is good until at least a year- excellent. I always check that first.<br /><br />The packaging was intact- also important.<br /><br />I opened a bag and put a handful of the Crumbles on my cereal. Instead of little bits of the usual date sweetness I've had with the Pieces what I tasted was bitterness! I thought maybe I just had eaten a "bad" few so I ate some directly from the bag and they had the same bitter and unpleasant taste. Very disappointing and unexpected.

review/summary: Don't know about the cakes, but the customer service sucks
review/text: I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15. As of January 5, they still did not receive the card noticing them of the gift. When I called flying noodle, they gave me the brush off, saying that they could resend a notice to me (not doing me any good being 3000 miles away) or could resend them the card for a $5 fee. I told them that was unacceptable and had to actually ask for a manager to get anything straightened out. It almost doesn't matter how good the cakes or other products are if the company is unreliable.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: I was given six months of cakes for Christmas this year.  I've gotten two of them and they were very good!  When I opened the first I was afraid I wasn't going to like it very much - pumpkin cake - but it was lovely, dense, moist and yummy.  The cakes travel well, keep nicely, and are not filled with artificial ingredients.  My first choice would have been six months of wedding cakes but, in light of the impracticality of that, these cakes have been surprisingly good.

This is something they look forward to getting every month and I can't tell you how much all of them brag about how delicious the cakes are and how happy they are to know they will be getting a fine desert for an entire 6 months.

review/summary: Tangy-rich citrus flavor!
review/text: This is one of the more sucessful of Celestial Seasonings Zinger genre. In this case the flavor of rose hips and hibiscus does not overpower the other flavors (unless you brew longer than 4 minutes). The aroma of this ruby potion is deliciously citrus and full bodied. The flavor of the tea is sweet red grapefruit and orange. Very tasty! I imagine this would make an excellent ice tea. Also, it is caffeine free and has added vitamin C--45 mg.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Be in readiness for favorable winds." Chinese Proverb.

review/text: I gave up the fizz of soda, even diet soda a while back. That was a good thing to do. Crystal Light Tea Mixes were recommended to me and they have turned out to be a perfect substitute. The decaf allows me to drink as much as I want without getting "all cafffed up." It tastes really good, mixes easily and you can carry a pack or two on a trip and make you own instead of drinking sodas.

review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/summary: DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT Eeeeew
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again.

review/summary: Good, but had too many fatty pieces
review/text: Mostly, this was good stuff. I haven't had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some.<br /><br />Most of the jerky was good, but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat. I wish I would've gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff, but it is good.<br /><br />They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff, or I might have to go to a different brand.

review/summary: Good jerky
review/text: Me and the missus went through this pretty quick... It's sweet, peppery, tasty.<br /><br />This was enough to satisfy my craving for jerky for awhile... I think the sugar, salt, and MSG are the main turn-offs for me although I do realize some of this may be required for jerky.<br /><br />It's almost like I want either a more wholesome jerky snack or a straight-up rod of faux-meat.<br /><br />Still, this is worth checking out to see if it's your thing.

review/text: This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

review/text: I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

review/text: I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don't have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link's original.  Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

review/summary: Spoiled long before "Best By" date
review/text: One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!
