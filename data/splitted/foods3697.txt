review/summary: Fried? Eggplant~
review/text: As far as I can tell, this eggplant product is not fried at all.  I was very disappointed to open up an oily can of mushed-up eggplant.  After I diligently poured/swabbed off as much oil as possible, I then warmed up the contents to discover that the aroma and flavor is very appealing and tasty--just not the fried product that the can label depicts.  Also, the bottoms of the cans of the case that I received were forming rust spots in many areas. It makes me wonder where this case was stored.  Had I realized that the contents were this mushy, I never would have bought a case of it.  However, it will make nice addition to my home-style pasta sauces and other tomato-based stews.

review/summary: Okay, but nothing special, given the (higher) price.
review/text: This Yummy Spoonfuls baby food is organic and fresh-tasting, almost like homemade baby food.  And my baby loves it.  However, there's not really much of a difference between this brand and the shelf-stable organic baby food in pouches.  In fact, the latter are much more convenient because, unlike the Yummy Spoonfuls brand, the pouched baby food can be easily transported without refrigeration, e.g., in a diaper bag.  In addition, there's not much of a difference between these "Mushy Yummy" meals and the "Creamy Yummy" baby foods.  The "Mushy" baby food is more of a coarse puree than actual textured food.  Therefore, this may not be the ideal baby food for helping your baby learn to eat textured solid foods.  Perhaps this "Mushy Yummy" food may prove useful as in "in-between" step if your little-one is having trouble transitioning from smooth purees to textured baby food.  Otherwise, you might was well save yourself the money, time and trouble involved in purchasing, storing and heating up frozen "live" baby food, and go with a shelf-stable, organic brand like Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen or Happy Baby.<br /><br />A final, albeit minor point.  For all the expense involved, I expected the product (packaging) to look at least somewhat professional.  The product I received had labels that looked like they'd been printed on someone's home computer/printer.  And the labels stated that the tubs of baby food were 6 ounces each, when it was clear that they were no more than 4 ounces a piece.

review/text: For many years for Christmas and birthdays our family would buy a box of Queen Ann Cherries.<br />I don't know how it started but our children would buy a box for daddy every year and for almost any reason.<br />He just loved them, they were filled with a nice liquid center and hardly every crystalized, that happened a few times but for the most part the centers were nice and  juicy.  The kids used to watch dad get all gooey (on purpose to make them laugh)  then when our children grew up the little grand kiddies would take on the roll of candy givers.<br />Sadly grandpa is gone now but we still buy each other Queen Anne cordial cherries in his memory.  It has become part of our lives and it would not be Christmas without that red box under the tree or on a pile of birthday gifts.

This is one of only two products available that meets their needs.  No stool problems!  In addition, these 100% real chicken treats are small enough not to have to break apart for dogs on a restricted calorie count.  One treat will do it.  Lastly, since they are round they don't break apart into sharp pieces while the dogs are chewing them.  It is dangerous for a dog to try to swallow a hard, sharp piece of food!  This was a major problem even with my large dog and the flat 100% chicken treats on the market.  This is a great product!

review/text: I've named these "chicken balls" and my Puggle is fully aware of what I mean when I utter those words. She RUNS to her treat jar and pokes at it with her nose with reckless impatience as I hurry along behind her. I love that they're simple with no additives, just dehydrated chicken and rice. They smell just like chicken and rice if you put them right up to your nose. So they're inoffensive for those with sensitive noses. They're bite size and super crunchy. These may be too large or too hard for Shih Tzu and smaller dogs. I say this because when I babysit an adult Shih Tzu, she attempts to eat it but can't. I've broken them into smaller pieces for her and she'll eat them. These do not stain the teeth like those other chewy treats with color additives. They're safe to keep at room temperature and they keep for a very long time since they're dehydrated, although they never last more than a couple of weeks in my house!<br /><br />I highly recommend them.

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/text: Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious.

review/summary: Timothys Donut Shop
review/text: I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

review/text: I ordered the bratwurst (german style orginals) for a gift for my husband.  He has been a quest for "good bratwurst" for sometime now.  Personally, I have never cared for bratwurst and the sampling we did only confirmed to me that I didn't care for it.  My husband kept telling me it was because I have never had "good brats".  Well....now I have.  Your bratwurst is excellent.  Not too salty or over done on the spices and fillers.  Husband is very very pleased with the product and has pronounced that yours is "good brats".<br />Will have to try some of your other products in the future.<br />Sincerely,<br />Sherry Bullard-Blanchard<br />Coeur d Alene Idaho

review/text: Slow Food Italy has declared the Saffron from Navelli a rare treasure to be protected.<br />"Production of DOP Navelli saffron demands an extraordinary degree of attention and dedication. This is immediately obvious when you consider that both harvesting and production, as undertaken by the Altopiano Cooperative of Navelli, is done by hand. It takes around two hundred thousand flowers to yield about two pounds  of saffron stamens.<br />The saffron is obtained and then the stigmas from the flower of the Crocus Sativus are dired. This plant is traditionally grown on the  Navelli plateau (wedged between the parks of the Gran Sasso and the Velino Sirente) and Subequana Valley, where the ideal habitat of dry and windy climate and with soil that is very permeable (excessive moisture would rot the plant).<br /><br />Harvesting is done manually in the early hours of the morning, when the corolla is still closed. Cut flowers are collected in wicker baskets and open with  fingernails one by one, separating the stigmas from the stylus.  Afterwards they place the pistils in a sieve that hangs on the hot ashes of the fireplace. The roasting must be slow and uneven. Then it is  enclosed in bags and when dry, in small jars."

review/summary: like a tropical ice wine
review/text: I made this at an sg starting at 1.064 allowing for about an a 6%-8% abv at the end. I didnt add sweetener, but just made it to about 5 1/4 gal to start, ending w about a 5 gal carboy and a liter left over after 2 total rackings and final addition of the f-pack. The stuff fermented and crystal-cleared, in NO kidding, 8 days total- box to bottle.... dunno what that was about, but talk about fast!!! I was shocked- coulda been the two Tbsp yeast nutrient after the first day? At any rate, this has a dessert wine sweetness but the coconut essence is complex, not cloying at all. Maybe it was the concentrated 5 vs 6 gal i did, but the heft and impression is just like ice wine. I love ice wine (and importantly, i love coconut), so for me this is a great thing. I brought some to my co-worker who told me he had expected to try 1/2 a glass and throw the rest away (nice confidence level!!), but that he drank the whole bottle by himself in that one sitting. He wanted more. My husband, who doesnt drink much, has been drinking a glass every night, and also asking for me to make more. This stuff is surprisingly good, and at the three week mark, is, in my husband's words, "exceptional." I figure he's actually mocking me in my attempts at homebrewing, but he is drinking it, after all! I'm pretty much patting myself on the back and thinking about the 13 bottles remaining, w repeated requests for more from friends and family, not being nearly enough.  :) im going to try this company's other wines. Awesome.<br /><br />Update: some people who only like dry, "serious" wines do not like this wine, and some have said that it can't even be considered wine. I say, enjoy life more! Heh- but it's pretty much love or hate. One big detractor told me he thought it tasted like suntan lotion smells. And this is...bad? I Love a Big inky deep cab just like the next gal, but that's apples and ...coconuts -- think--easy drinking like a wine cocktail or Sangria. This wine is fab for mixing with fruits or seltzer, although i like it neat. :)

This K-cup has a flavor unlike any other k-cup.  Try it if you like Bailey's and are looking for a unique coffee.

review/summary: Nice flavor
review/text: I love the flavor of this coffee. The only drawback is that you can't set it for the largest cup if you want a good strong flavored coffee because it will taste "watered-down." Still, I have purchased this flavor more than once so I really do enjoy the flavor.

review/summary: Best Irish Cream I've Tried
review/text: I think this is the most accurate "Irish Cream" flavor available. I imagine it tastes chemically and bitter without cream and/or sweeteners, but that's how most flavored coffees are. My guess is they were trying to compensate for that alcohol zing, so people expecting something like a french vanilla sweetness are going to be disappointed. Adding Bailey's to your coffee instantly makes it creamy and sweet - if you're looking for that experience, it's not gonna happen with black coffee. I brew my coffee on the largest keurig setting, this is a fairly strong flavor/brew even then, so it may be a bit much on a smaller cup setting. We went through it fairly quick and I'm ordering more now.

review/summary: Timothy's Irish Creme K-Cups
review/text: First off, I Love Timothy's Coffees. Especially the Kona Blend & the Colombian. I drink my coffees black so the Irish Creme is a little too weak for me. I like to brew my coffees on the largest size setting for cost effectiveness. When it's brewed on the middle size setting it's fine. It does have a nice flavor, just not a favorite.

review/text: First, let me say that this is one of my wife's favorite coffees.  That having been said, I cannot begin to understand why.  I can't even stand the smell of it brewing, and I like Irish Cream flavored coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line, I guess you'll just have to try it for yourself.  I would suggest trying to find a smaller amount somewhere before you commit to 50 cups.<br /><br />If Gloria Jean ever starts selling Irish Creme K-cups again, Timothy's version will die off very quickly, because it can't begin to compare with Gloria's.

My husband had the brilliant idea of mixing it with a Hot Cocoa k-cup and it tasted like an irish cream mocha from a coffee house.<br />So great if you mix with a hot chocolate k-cup, not so great on its own.

review/summary: Nice aroma, but weak, watery coffee - Not so bad after all!
review/text: 8/21/10 I'd like to update my review of late last year.  I found out that the weak coffee  wasn't the fault of the K-cups after all, but a malfunction at the time with my Keurig.  Tried it again after that issue was solved, and, I do like it after all.  Might even re-order it. :)  I like the aroma, not convinced that it really has an Irish Creme "taste".  Changing from 1 to 3 stars.  Will update you later.<br /><br />Earlier review: Nice aroma, but weak, watery coffee.<br />This flavor Not recommended.  BTW, I do love the Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry and some other Timothy's flavors, but not this one. Very disappointed, and, unfortunately grocery products not returnable.

review/text: Coffee is absolutely delicious!  And what a bargain these K-cups are compared to the prices in stores.  The subscription series to it is great--you don't have to use gas to get to a store that sells K-cups (in my case, it's about a 20 mile round trip to the nearest store that sells K-cups)--the coffee just comes to you.  The convenience of changing the subscription to match plans (such as vacations or whatever) is great.  Highly recommended for anyone who has a Keurig machine.

I am now trying Gloria Jean, Emeril and Caribou, looking for a pleasant morning cup.  I may consider opening up the K-cups to see if I can dump the contents into a toddy maker, I hate to toss these, but find them unpleasantly harsh.

review/text: I come to amazon for the cheap price - buying this from the coffee websites costs more.  Timothy's is my mom's favorite so I bought one of each twin-25 pack.  She loves all of them so I guess these are good.  We like Green Mountain (better than tim's) but there was a nice deal of 10 off if u spend 40+.  I dont know if it is still going on but if it is, it makes the k-cups ridiculously cheaper than anywhere else.  Hope this helps!!  P.S. we do sweeten this with coordinating creamers from international delight and coffee-mate.  :)

review/summary: Best coating mix I've found
review/text: Picked up a box of Fryin' Magic at my local Kroger store for less than $2.00 and found it to be an incredible value.<br /><br />I've only tried this on chicken tenders so far, but I suspect it will also be a great choice for catfish nuggets.<br /><br />I like cornmeal breading and the mixture of cornmeal with multiple varieties of flour combines for a very pleasing texture and a coating that adheres well to the meat being fried. The mix of seasonings contained in the product is nearly spot-on perfect for my tastes, too, although the second time I used it I tried adding a touch of cajun seasoning and some fresh-ground black pepper to give it just a tiny bit more kick.<br /><br />If you enjoy McCormick's fried chicken seasoning, this product has a similar flavor (although not quite as strong).<br /><br />The only downside to this product is it does contain monosodium glutamate, so you may want to avoid it if you're sensitive to MSG or suspect you may be. MSG is an excellent flavor-enhancer contained in many products, though, and nutritional expert Dr. Andrew Weil says it's fine to consume in standard/limited quantities if you don't have allergy issues.<br /><br />I previously used Zatarain's Fish Fry for all my breading needs, but Fryin' Magic will now replace it in my pantry.<br /><br />UPDATE: This breading mix pairs much better with chicken than with catfish. It wasn't horrible on the catfish, but it wasn't nearly as tasty as it was on the chicken.

review/text: We used to buy Ener-G's Tapioca Loaf, but after trying this one we've switched.  We've been gluten-free, casein-free and egg-free for almost 2 years and it's hard to find a bread that tastes like the real thing.  This bread looks and tastes more like a light wheat bread.  It's not as dry as the tapioca bread and has a better, nuttier flavor.  My son likes it a lot and he's an extremely picky eater.  We ordered it in bulk with the 6 loaves and had no problem with mold like a previous reviewer reported.  Very happy customers!!!

review/text: I've been gluten-free for over 7 years and the bread is getting better. This type tended to crumble in the package more than tapioca or brown rice bread.  The packaging is the most mold-resistant I've found. I keep the bread in the cupboard until it is opened then put it in the refrigerator. I haven't had any problems.  The nutritional information listed for the bread on the Amazon website is wrong.  I think someone used the same nutritional facts for most Ener G products.

review/summary: Great for Cancer Patients that need a delicious meal.
review/text: As a store manager, I was always interested when a customer would purchase alot of an item.  When I had a customer  purchase a 1000 lbs of sugar they said they were making alot of Jelly (or moonshine?)  When a customer came in monthly and bought every package of McLib's Southern Dumplings, I had to ask why.  It turned out that her mom was undergoing Chemo for cancer and McLib's was the only thing she could eat.  This knowledge spread and I began to keep extra cases of dumplings in the back so these special customers wouldn't be disappointed.  I am very glad that AMAZON has started carrying the dumplings and I hope that anyone who loves a great bowl of Chicken and Dumplings or Peach Cobbler will give these a try. There is a wonderful recipe for Lasagna using McLibs on the back of the box.

review/text: I purchased many boxes of McLibs when I was visiting my sister up in NC. When I returned home with them everyone loved them but we don't have anywhere locally to get them. I was on the McLib website to try and order them but saw the Amazon link and ordered them thru Amazon at a better price than I had paid in the supermarket up in NC. The taste is the same but the pack I cooked the other night the dumplins seemed to be very much thinner than the ones I had bought two years ago. They are still good but I would now consider then a noodle and not a heavier dumpling. In any case I am just happy I can order them online now.

review/text: I bought these McLib's Southern Dumplings a month ago. Amazon had them for a good price and I was intrigued by these southern dumplings. They got very good ratings from other reviewers.<br /><br />I'm in Buffalo, NY. I've never visited the South, so I've never had McLibs before. I've never eaten southern dumplings!<br /><br />So, tonight it's cold and lightly snowing. I'm still in my pajamas at 5pm. I'm contemplating what I'm going to make for dinner. Of course, I forgot to defrost something. Spaghetti again? Kraft Mac & Cheese? I had half of a leftover rotisserie chicken in the fridge.<br /><br />Then I remembered that I had those boxes of McLib's Dumplings in the pantry. I figured that I could use the leftover chicken and try out that chicken and dumpling recipe that's printed on the dumpling box. The recipe needed canned chicken broth, canned cream of chicken soup, onions, garlic, peas, carrots and chicken. I didn't have any garlic or onions so I left that out.<br /><br />It was delicious! Within 20 minutes, I had a gorgeous dinner. The kids went crazy. My son said I should make this 2 or 3 times a week! It tasted like I spent the entire day cooking it. I've got to stock up on these tasty dumplings. It's a wonderful dinner to make on a cold snowy night.

review/text: I am a southern cook, by nature of where I live, of my heritage, and mostly because southern food is comfort food which I love to cook and eat.<br />The #1 comfort food I know is hand made dumplings, which I mix by hand, roll out by hand, and cut by hand.  My dumplings are a favorite for Sunday meals, food delivies to sick aunts, and pot luck dinners. Making dumplings was always a chore for me.  A labor of love to be sure, but time consuming.<br />Imagine my delight when I found McLib's dumplings while on vacation in Charleston, SC.  Of course, I was a bit skeptical that anything premade could match my hand made dumplings.  Bless your heart McLib's, they were just as delicious and saved me hours of work in the kitchen.  Now I keep McLib's Southern Dumplings in my pantry as a secret ingredient. I only share this secret with my best friends after they are sworn to secrecy.  I don't want my family to know as I can use dumplings as a motivator to get lots of work done around the house.<br />Amazon, please keep these in stock!  McLib's are the ultimate comfort food made easy for the time deprived cooks of the world.  I highly recommend McLib's!!!

review/summary: Best Dumplings ever!
review/text: I grew up in SC and chicken and dumplings are a weekly meal for us.  I found these at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store and have been buying them ever since.  They are the best dumplings on the market.  Way better than the frozen ones.  We recently moved to Alaska with the military and I was devastated to not be able to buy these anymore.  Then I saw on the McLib's website that they are available on amazon now.  I am so exctied!  I will be ordering tons of these!

review/summary: I can eat a hamburger again!
review/text: After almost three years of avoiding any type of hamburger bun due to celiac disease, I was really thrilled to be able to eat a real hamburger on a bun!  I wrapped it in a moist paper towel and nuked it for 15 seconds and it softened up enough to compare favorably with a normal hamburger bun.  The fact that they can be stored without refrigeration until opened for a long period of time is a big plus!  I have not tried toasting one yet as I would have to use the family toaster-oven to do it and do not want to take a chance on contamination with real bread crumbs, etc.  I would recommend this product to any one.

review/summary: This deserves a 4-star rating!
review/text: But I give it 5 stars to upgrade the previous rating so people won't be discouraged from ordering them.  I agree totally with the content of the other review, though.  To be able to eat a hamburger again is wonderful!  Other products crumble and don't contain leakage.  These buns hold up very well with a juicy hamburger with all the trimmings.  Room temperature storage until package opening is a real plus.  The buns do need microwaving for 20 seconds or so to be edibly soft so they probably wouldn't work for a cold sandwich.  The flavor is the same as my memory of wheat buns.

review/summary: Hamburger Buns
review/text: I purchased these for my husband because he never gets a hamburger bun when<br />we grill burgers.  I was pretty confident they would be good as he loves the<br />bread I get him from Ener-G foods & we weren't disappointed.  I highly recommend<br />these for anyone in your household that is gluten intolerant especially with<br />summer comming and it seems that's when everyone wants to have a BBQ.

review/text: Delicious replacement for wheat flour buns. Taste best when lightly toasted. My Celiac kids love them and use them for "sub" sandwiches as well as burgers.

review/summary: odd taste
review/text: I have been on a GF diet for ten years. I've used these buns several times over the years and still can't get used to the odd smell and taste. As soon as I open the package I put the remaining buns in the freezer so I know they're "fresh" (maybe if I let them get freezer burn it'd kill the taste?). So why do I continue to buy them? Like the others I'm desperate to have burgers.<br /><br />I agree with another review in that homemade buns (and bread) are a lot better (but they are so much trouble to make!).
