review/summary: Awesome tea!
review/text: This tea not only tastes great it makes me feel great! I can't say that there's any scientific evidence behind it but I love this tea. My boyfriend and I bought it on a whim at our local health food store and finished the entire box in a week. Highly recommend Tulsi teas are great!

review/summary: Nice value
review/text: Very good price.<br /><br />A hint of smoky taste, less "grassy" than green teas I'm used to. Pleasant.<br /><br />Seems to require a pretty hefty measure to get a decently strong brew, as the dried leaves are bulky.  I've been reusing leaves 2-3 times along with fresh leaves, and this does add to the richness.<br /><br />I'll likely buy it again.

review/summary: Very good value
review/text: I was hesitant to buy so much tea but the price was right (especially with the "subscribe and save" feature), so I decided to take a chance.<br />The tea arrived today and it was a very big bag.  I wanted to try it right away and brewed a pot using 2 teaspoons per cup (no brewing directions were given). The result was a dark liquid looking more like an oolong, but the taste was what I had hoped for - definitely a white tea taste, with a pleasant sweet after taste.<br />I have a food saver system  so I will be able to store this tea in an<br />air tight canister (2 needed actually) to preserve the freshness.  It's so much tea that I don't know if it would be practical without some way to keep it fresh.<br />I'm happy with this purchase.

review/summary: My new favorite tea
review/text: Delicious and great quality organic white tea that I can afford to drink daily. I use 2 tablespoons per cup and steep the leaves 3-4 times. The reviewer who gave this tea 1 star must have received a different bag of tea than I did. He/she complained of dried fruit in the mix of tea leaves. I can assure you there is no fruit in the 1 lb of tea I received, just a whole lot of white tea leaves. Was planning on trying the Numi brand loose leaf white tea next, but I will probably myself the extra money as I am very pleased with this tea. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Falsely described item. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY!
review/text: We bought this tea thinking it is pure white loose leaf tea which is what was stated in the description. However it turned out that that most of the contents were not white tea leaves but heavy dried fruit pieces which added to the bulk of the weight of this "1 lb tea leaves". Also the tea was mixed with unknown herbs that caused it to have an unpleasant taste. Obviously none of these additives are stated to be included in the description. The item could not be returned per Amazon's policy of not accepting returns on Grocery items. We are very disappointed with the purchase and will recommend not to buy.

review/summary: Exhorbitant price for fraudulent service
review/text: This food product is a prepared meal, and the storefront says they charge their ridiculous price for shipping because they ship it overnight for freshness. So, here it is, " $12.99 + $35.00 shipping", and, all of a sudden my shipping window is "August 27, 2012 - August 30, 2012". And, when I send them email with amazon as intermediary, I get no reply, only the statement on my web site that the item was shipped and that no shipping information is available. Something is seriously wrong with these people, and with Amazon for letting them get away with this. If you get better treatment from them, it is probably because they are covering up for their crazy and fraudulent behavior.

review/summary: like fine take out for cats!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have a raw fed 9 month old kitty but every now and then for a treat I give him a little of the Tiki Cat brand cat food. One reason I make the exception for this brand because when you open the can, you can identify what it is your cat is actually eating. No "mystery meat", no paying for or having him ingest sketchy fillers - no questioning "what *EXACTLY* is a BY PRODUCT !?! - *shudder*......"<br /><br />This Tuna in Crab Surimi Consomme flavor is one of his favorites. Inside the can you'll find what looks like a tiny restaurant takeout container for kitties - layered nicely, chunks of real seafood, looks and smells good!<br /><br />Ingredients: Tuna, Water sufficient for processing, Crab surimi, sunflower seed oil, calcium phoshate, Choline chloride, Taurine, Vitamin E suppplement, Zinc sulfate heptahydrate, ferrous sulfate monohydrate (iron supplement), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1) , nicotinic acid (vitamin B3), calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate monohydrate, vitamin A supplement, potassium  iodide, copper sulfate pentahydrate, vitamin D3 supplement, riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), pyridoxine hydrocholride, folic acic, vitamin B12 supplement.<br /><br />Pleased with this product an highly recommended!

They're little Tiki addicts! The TikiCat has a line with rice that's very obviously noted on the labels which makes it very easy to avoid. The TikiCat doesn't affect my diabetic cats blood sugar at all. Highly recommend for all cats, diabetic or not.

His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!

review/summary: Yet another quality ale from Belgium...
review/text: Today is Lammas Day (a.k.a. Lughnasadh).  What better way to celebrate the "first harvest" that's with a nice farmhouse Saison ale?  HENNEPIN SAISON ALE is a quality summertime Belgian brew:  It has a nice golden color and lingering head, a good hoppy flavor, and a veritable 7.7% ABV.  Additionally, in terms of value, this is one of the more cost effective Belgian ales on the market today.<br />I consider myself to be a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Belgian ales; I can honestly say, with all sincerity, that this is a good Belgian ale at a reasonable price.  This one will be part of my regular rotation.

review/summary: Best flavor, texture and results!
review/text: This is the best peanut flour I've tried! It has a smooth, deep, roasted flavor that just kicks everything you put it in.<br />I've used it to make a cooked frosting (really!), and various LC bread/pancake items. It's also a great 'flouring' agent for asian-inspired pork and chicken dishes; it gives a delicious crisp coating with an amazing depth of flavor! (Especially if you are serving with a coconut, curry, or peanut sauce)<br />No one will know it's the secret ingredient and they will be surprised when you tell them. It makes a great 'breading' if you mix it with natural almond meal/flour and bake or fry your items.<br /><br />This is top-notch quality peanut flour and worth the cost. If you've ever had lesser quality peanut flour and it left a strange taste in your mouth or smelled rancid or 'not quite right' when you opened it, you have to try this! It will make a believer out of you in a real hurry!

Although I  haven't had too much luck  baking with it (probably because I make all of my own recipes), I'm still going to keep buying it.  It tends to produce a dense baked good (I made delicious peanut flour brownies with this) so make sure to use leavening, such as baking powder or eggs.

review/summary: Great Design, Excellent sound, Good Battery life
review/text: I've tried a number of various brands Bluetooth; each has some kind of problem, the fit, the weight, sound quality or battery life. This one, in comparison, is the best.<br />First, the earpiece fits well and very light, the sound quality is good on both sides of the conversation, and battery life is not bad at all. Unlike the common one-piece head sets, which require one to hang the entire device from their ear, this ear bud is much lighter, because the clip-on piece has the microphone, the rechargeable battery, and everything else that make it work. In addition, you don't have to leave it in your ear all the time, the clip piece has a built in ringer, so you can wear the ear bud only when you answer a call.<br />Pairing was very fast easy, same goes for turning on/off, or changing the volume.<br />  Two minor cons: the power button on the ear bud needs some use-to, and the charger is not the universal mini USB, it has an unusual extra small rounded plug, which means you have to bring it with you if you want to use the headset, plus a car charger in addition to your phone's chargers. One star off for these cons.<br />Over all, this is a good product and better than any one-piece Bluetooth I've ever tried.

review/summary: Good visible mute
review/text: I primarily use my Cardo S640 to do teleconferences during my commute. I spend most of my meeting time on mute, so it was important to me to have an easy to operate mute button. The mute is set by holding down the volume button for a couple seconds. This is a little awkward. (I would prefer to have a separate button.) But while it's on mute, there is a mute indicator light, which is wonderful.<br />I usually attach it to my seatbelt, which works well. But I find that it doesn't work too well to wear it if you have a buttonless shirt. It clips okay, but because it is vertical, you can't clip the earbud in the microphone piece.<br />It's nice and compact -- when I'm not using it, I just stuff it in my jeans pocket.

This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/text: I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

review/text: As my title says,my cats LOVED all of the gravy-they lapped it up before eating the pieces of chicken. However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

review/text: While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/text: This shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed Whiskas Purrfectly chicken he won't consider anything else.  He prepares to eat if I offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he's sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away.  He won't eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive. The pouch is not convenient but the fact that I know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Cats seem to prefer this brand
review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

review/summary: Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food
review/text: We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: Pleasing Molly
review/text: Molly wakes me up early telling me it is time for her "breakfast".  She really loves the Sardine and Mackerel Entree.  I have to rely on her reaction, as I have not tasted it.  I give her half a pack in the morning and half at night.  I rescued her from the Humane Society, so I do not know what she ate before.  She is five years old.<br /><br />  Thank you for sending it once a month and I do not have to go shopping for it.  Eleanor Martin

review/summary: very good
review/text: I have a very old cat which has lost teeth and her appetite and it seems that this food is one that she will always eat. She was my granddaughters cat but I have had her for 3-4 years she is 14 and though thin is active and healthy .

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

review/summary: cat rejected one variety
review/text: I like the convenience of always having cat food on hand, but had to change the order because my cat would not eat the sardine and mackerel combination (can't blame him for that!) So I changed to an all-tuna shipment.

review/text: Exactly what I needed, new/sealed and delivered quickly. Variety pack is cheaper per pouch, but my cats like only one flavor, and I wind up throwing out too much uneaten food. This way, with the single variety box, I have no waste, and the one-flavor boxes are hard to find.

review/summary: My Cat Loves Whiskas chicken and duck
review/text: Cats can be very finicky when they want to be, my cat will not eat 9 lives, friskies and only a few flavors of Fancy Feast so I have one spoiled cat!! But it seems to love Whiskas Chicken and Duck. Cats are very smart and have good hearing when he heard the UPS truck and saw me bring in this big box he knew his favorite Chicken and Duck was in the box. When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean. So instead of wasting money on food he does not like I am sticking with his Chicken and Duck.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NIJ4A">Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Duck in Natural Juices Food for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Unwanted Ingredients
review/text: I was interested in this food and so was my cat until she got ill from two magical ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />They do absolutely nothing for your cat but can cause health issues. She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

review/summary: My Cats Just Love This
review/text: My Cats truly love Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Variety Pack. They love the variety. I serve food to my Cats at about the same times each day. When I began serving Wiskas Purrfectly Fish, and another Wiskas Variety Pack, the began to follow me into the Kitchen with great expectation when it was time for their Wiskas. They watch me prepare each of their dishes with great interest. They follow me as I place their dishes out for them, and then dive in with great gusto. They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that. My Cats enjoy good health, abundant energy, and a happy spirit. I am glad that I am able to serve them food that they enjoy and provides nutritional benefits they need.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow!
review/text: I had the hardest time trying to find a cat food my cats would eat. Every time I got one they would sniff it and then act as if burying it so I could tell they hated it. Finally, I found this food. My cats will not even eat the same flavor even from another brand. I was so upset when Target put the individuals on sale and stopped selling them. Needles to say, when I found this on Amazon I was very happy. Reasonably priced for the amount and my cats are completely satisfied. Will also be ordering from here!

review/summary: Weaned my Kittens!
review/text: Not only do my full sized cats gobble this up but this was the only food that our 5 week old kittens would eat in order to go to new homes.  We were getting down to the wire and the kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away. I tried several kittens formulas and KMR-  and they wouldn't eat anything because they preferred nursing.  However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

review/summary: My cats love this.
review/text: My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/summary: Great if your cats love variety
review/text: Unfortunately, my cats are not fans of the sardine and mackerel pack. The sardine & mackerel has actual chunks of fish, but it seems the cats prefer the flaked tuna and the tuna and whitefish. Amazon sells a tuna-only version of this item, so I decided to stick to what my cats like and keep the tuna-only dinner.<br /><br />The price is comparable to what you will find at your local Wal-Mart. With the added convenience of home delivery with Subscribe and Save, this is a good deal if your cats like the sardine/mackerel dinner.

review/summary: Good food for the fish line
review/text: The only downside about this food is that it contains BHA/BHT. As long as you don't overload your cats with this every single day you should be fine, but be cautious of the purrfectly chicken/turkey variety because it does contain BY-products.

review/summary: Two enthusiastic paws up
review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/summary: Cats love it; I hate the pouches.
review/text: Whiskas came up with a winner as far as my cats are concerned; they love all three of the "Purrfectly Chicken" varieties.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in, however, has to be a cost-saving thing because it is totally terrible. It is messy, and the only way to get all the food out is to dig it out with a spoon, and dig some more, and dig some more.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars for the food, and 1 star for the package. I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that.

review/summary: My cats favorite food
review/text: I use to get this product at my local Petsmart until they no longer carried it other than in a variety pack.  The Mackeral is their favoite and my cats were soooo upset when I couldn't get it. So I turned to Amazon to find it and now order it online in large quantities just to have it.  They're happy once again.
