review/text: This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time.

review/summary: Great as a creamer or added chocolate flavoring
review/text: I haven't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee...I'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.

review/summary: The "Replicator" of our time.
review/text: We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic "replicators", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station.

review/summary: Why, oh why, add fake sugar?
review/text: Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.

review/text: I ordered this specifically b/c they said "dark chocolate" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!

review/summary: Not Good
review/text: I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct "plasticy" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.

review/summary: Very acceptable K Cup Hot Chocolate
review/text: Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only.

All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly, I think they're a little bit better than the other brands we've had.

In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!<br /><br />Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation.

review/text: Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor
review/text: When I got my Keurig brewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other brand does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again.

review/summary: Best K-cup cocoa
review/text: I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.

But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.

review/text: As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Nice tasting cocoa
review/text: The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.

review/text: I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

review/summary: The Perfect Bloody Mary Mix
review/text: Whether you drink it plain or with vodka and a celery stick this is the perfect Bloody Mary mix, just like the one on air flights. Hard to find this convenient size in stores. Just pop the top, add ice and vodka, and you are good to go. Great for Sunday brunch at home. Nice knowing I have a case in the pantry for emergencies.

review/summary: They call this baby food!?!?
review/text: My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, "ok, it's just too thick". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!

review/text: My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal.

review/summary: Watery, flavorless, sour
review/text: Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves.

review/text: We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box, we tried again to no avail. Next, we  tried to feed it to the cat because she seemed interested when I opened the pouches. My cat won't even eat it. I recommend getting a small quantity to see if your baby likes it before ordering a whole box.

review/text: This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra "stuff" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!

review/summary: Just Love this Combo!
review/text: One of the things I just love about HAPPYBABY organic baby food is the unique combination of ingredients they offer.  I mean, how many companies utilize quinoa as the primary grain in their baby food?  I love that HAPPYBABY thinks outside the box to come up with an innovative mix of super healthy foods for our babies.  The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.  Did I mention how much I love the portability of these pouches?!  I only wish they had been around when my older daughter was a baby!

review/summary: dried texture and crappy blend for baby food
review/text: I have tried many different flavors from many different brands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product.

Plus it has other super foods such as lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots! But all this goodness is only good if baby will eat it and she gobbled it right up!!

review/text: We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.

review/text: This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado, my son reached for it. So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time! It's also a go-to meal when we are having spicy grown-up food and I'm too lazy to cook him up something else. It also helps him "go" regularly.

review/summary: Try Before You Buy in Bulk
review/text: My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!

review/text: My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This brand has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey.

I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

review/summary: yay! NOT SWEET , finally!!
review/text: I love the happy baby and similar brands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes- most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else.

Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor - help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully...
