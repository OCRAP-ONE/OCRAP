review/text: Used to spend tons of money at the Nordstrom Expresso Bar on their chai lattes until I found this product.  If you warm your milk and put the milk and mix in the blender then it creates a great foam on the top that's just as good or even better than the coffee stores.  Try it!

review/summary: BEST vanilla chai I EVER HAD!!!!!!
review/text: My fist time I had Big Train chai tea latte was at a community college I use to attend. Even after 4 years of graduating, Id stop by to get a large cup a day & the college is far from my house. I have tried other vanilla chai flavors; starbucks, its a grind & even trader joe's carry other brands & id have to say very dissapointing. They all taste too gross & minty. I am so happy amazon carries BIG TRAIN, it is the best blended for summer & warm for winter, I HIGHLY recommend it!!

review/summary: My favorite chai mix
review/text: I have searched far and wide for the perfect Chai tea mix --- and I found it in Big Train!!  I first discovered it at a tea shop in a yuppie neighborhood about 10 miles away from my home.  I would make the drive just for this tea whenever I could.  The tea house eventually (foolishly?) advertised the brand name in the window!  I haven't been back since I received Big Train from Amazon.com.  Tip:  make with half skim milk/half water; add about the half of the suggested Chai mix to start; then add more to taste. Enjoy!

review/summary: Great Taste, So So Nutrition
review/text: Snickers Marathon Chocolate Nut Burst Protein Bars are a middle of the road protein/energy bar. I really like the taste of these, and their 22g of protein is the highest content of any of the protein bars that I regularly eat - Cliff Builder, Kashi, and Promax being the others.  They are also fairly high in electrolytes with 360mg of Sodium and 260mg of Potassium, and these are important to those who train hard and need the extra minerals.  The one downside to these is that their sugar content (at least in part) comes from corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup.  The other products that I mentioned avoid this by using more natural sources such as evaporated cane juice.  Because of the sweetener, I do not use any of the Snickers products as my primary protein bars.  I use them more as a change of pace to keep from burning out on the others.  For the more nutritious conscious, I would recommend products from Cliff, Kashi, or Promax.  While these are better than a regular candy bar, you can still do better.

review/text: A friend of mine told me to try one of these. I've always been skeptical of these bars because of the Snickers name attached. Not that Snickers bars taste bad, but it's just not a name you associate with "lean and muscular."<br /><br />I checked out the nutritional info and it compares pretty favorably with comparable bars. 14% daily fat, 15% sat fat, 13% carbs, 44% fiber, 21 g of protein, 280 calories.<br />It tastes a lot better than your average meal-replacement bar, too. I don't know if I'd go with these regularly, but for a change of pace, they're pretty good.

review/summary: Good, very mild flavor.
review/text: I bought a bag of this coffee (whole bean) at Target yesterday.  It was on sale.  The bag says that it's "organic" and "fair trade", and for the price I was quite suspicious.  I'm enjoying it, though; it's interesting that so many reviews mention a "burnt" flavor, because I can't detect that at all.<br /><br />I used more beans than I usually would, since I hadn't tried this coffee before.  I use a drip coffee-maker.  The beans looked good, were very oily looking, and smelled good.  I drank the coffee with milk, and was glad I'd added extra beans -- the flavor is still very mild.<br /><br />From the other reviews I wonder if they have trouble with consistency between batches: certainly one person will taste a different flavor than another, but some of these reviews sound as if they're for another coffee entirely!

The after taste is just a smooth coffee flavor.<br /><br />It's my personal favorite and I try coffees all the time.<br /><br />Normally I brew a full pot of coffee and drink a couple of cups and maybe drink another cup in the evening. With this coffee I end up drinking the whole pot before noon. I'm addicted to it. :D<br /><br />This will be my daily coffee for now.<br /><br />Try it!

review/text: I bought this one today at Target, package looks great; organic, single origin, from Mexico, great! let me try. I bought the small trial packet (thanks God!) and brewed it after breakfast. I do like strong full flavored "Colombian" type coffee, but this one tastes like drinking fireplace ashes. Tastes bitter, no noticeable flavor at all just burnt. Heck, I can make this better on my own, just get me some beans.<br />Overall, I don't recommend this coffee, in fact, it was possibly the worst coffee I ever had.

review/summary: Fits Senseo but pods broken in bag
review/text: I too have been searching for Senseo pods for months and finally decided to try another brand. I think the Senseo pods are now coming back in stock btw.  These do fit the senseo and the taste is good. However, out of the 3 packages, 2 had pods that had broken inside and spilled grounds all over the other pods.  This is inconvenient and messy.  I did order another set to see if this was a fluke but lots of other reviewers have experienced the same thing. If I get more broken pods, I will switch back to the Senseos now that they seem to be available in limited selections.

review/summary: LOVE the coffee but....
review/text: The packaging in the pods is terrible and at least half of the bags have ruptured pods.  This leaves loose grounds in the package and contaminates the remaining pods so they are unusable.  The loose coffee will eventually clog the filter basket and backup a pod machine.  I have complained about this several times and can't seem to get anyone to take notice.

review/summary: Higher Cost than the Packaged Pods
review/text: These pods are 7.8 grams each, and the same coffee pods that are individually package are 10 grams each, which at this time means the 10 gram individually packaged pods are a lower cost per gram than these non-individually packaged pods.  Even the package that contain the pods is not resealable.  I've opened two bags of pods, and 3 pods were broken inside.  Good coffee; but will go back to the individually packaged pods for more freshness and lower cost.

review/summary: Great coffee, bad pods
review/text: The Good:<br />This has been the best coffee I've had for my Senseo, by far.  I like strong coffee, and this fits the bill.  I've never had a problem with the size of the pod, as others have mentioned, and it works fine in the single cup tray.  This makes a great cup!<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I've ordered six bags of pods, now, and each bag has had at least one pod that was not sealed correctly and leaked all over the bag.  You can tell that it's a manufacturing defect when looking at it, and not a problem in shipping.  In several years of buying the Senseo brand pods, I'd never had this problem.  In the latest bag, one pod had an inch along the edge that just hadn't been sealed.  I sent Baronet an email and never heard back from them.  Therefore, I think this may be my last Baronet purchase.  If not for the leaking pods, this would've been a 5-star review.

review/summary: Best Replacement for Senseo
review/text: I have found these pods to be the best-tasting pods for the Senseo coffee pod machine.  Most other pods (except Senseo Dark Roast) aren't strong enough for me.  I add milk, so the coffee needs to be strong.  I only gave 4 stars because the pods are a little bigger and have excess paper around them, so I have to squeeze them into the pod holder.

review/summary: Great coffee, but bag that rips off consumers
review/text: This is a totally enjoyable dark roast coffee, but Baronet has chosen to sell it in a "fair trade" bag that contains 8 unprotected pods and drastically shortens the shelf life of the coffee once you open the bag.  If you drink 3+ cups of coffee a day and only drink this variety, this is fine because you'll use up all the coffee pods in less than 3 days.  But if you like to choose from several varieties of coffee pods, and drink only 1-2 cups a day,it's a definate minus and totally anti-consumer.  One of the most important advantages of single-pod packed coffee is the freshness and aroma that's assured when you tear open the bag.  This form of packaging is the equivilent of using your mother's Maxwell House coffee in a 1-pound can that often stayed around the house for months.<br /><br />At least give the customer a choice of packagings!<br /><br />SUGGESTION FOR CONSUMERS:  DON'T BUY ANY COFFEE SOLD IN THESE BAGS!!!<br />SUGGESTION FOR AMAZON:  DON'T SELL ANY POD COFFEE THAT'S NOT PACKAGED IN SEAL INDIVIDUAL SERVINGS!!!

No lie, the combination is<br />unbelievable, and needs no seasoning.<br /><br />By itself, these green beens are too soft, over cooked, and in short supply in<br />this can cause its mostly liquid. What a gyp! On the first bite I knew this<br />stuff needed something, so I pulled down a can of Pintos and now I have a new<br />favorite dish. The synergy is amazing, and I've never mixed these two veggies<br />before in my life. Great stuff, but like I said, dont bother trying to serve<br />this by itself. If you must have green beans get some Allen's or Margaret Holmes.

review/summary: Something I Look Forward to After Each Workout
review/text: I'm writing this review as I sip the Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea.<br />It has a subtle honey flavor throughout and I also taste the lemongrass flavor especially in the beginning (you would smell the nice lemon scent as well). I taste green tea flavor also but its flavor becomes more definite during the aftertaste. If you like herbal teas, I think you would like this tea as well.<br /><br />Like other Yogi tea, I like that the tea never gets bitter even if I brew it longer than I suppose to (3 minutes). One tea bags make at least two cups of tea.<br /><br />As far as muscle recovery effects goes, I "think" I'm feeling a difference. I have been working out 5 times a week, and when I drink Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea, I do not have prolonging muscle aches longer than a day. However, I have to point out that it might be because I am getting used to my work out routine and need to push myself a little further to start feeling the "pain" again :-P Anyhow, this is okay as I'm not expecting a complete muscle recovery from a one herbal tea bag. What I like most about this tea so far is that its gentle scent and flavor definitely helps me to relax after each workout. I like to think and visualize that my muscle are growing as I sip this tea and it's a plus psychologically :-)<br /><br />I initially found this tea at local Whole Foods market.<br />Purchasing this tea (pack of 6) from Amazon is cheaper than buying it individually from Whole Foods, and probably many other natural food stores. I hope Amazon will start having the Subscribe & Save option for this product like other Yogi teas.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oct 12, 2011]<br />Amazon now offers Subscribe & Save option! :-)<br /><br />I extracted description/effects of the top 3 ingredients (Green Tea Leaf, Lemongrass, and Blackberry Leaf) that contains the most in each tea bag as well as some other ingredients that Yogi Tea claims to play an important role in this product.<br /><br />Green Tea Leaf:<br />- contains the most antioxidant polyphenols, which are responsible for its many health benefits.<br />- is a more potent antioxidant than broccoli, carrots, spinach or strawberries.<br />- enhances immunity and benefit oral health.<br />- balance total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, and to support a healthy ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.<br /><br />Lemongrass:<br />- supports mucous membrane function, and it is used to promote sweating.<br />- is a warming herb that speeds digestion and reduces gas and nausea.<br /><br />Blackberry Leaf:<br />- its vitamin C and tannins in the leaves helps boost immunity and heal wounds.<br />- contains ellagic acid, which is a powerful cell protector and antioxidant.<br />- is a source of mild astringent compounds (tannins), which tighten up and dry out loose, soggy tissue (so blackberry leaf has been used traditionally to ease minor sore throat, diarrhea and skin rashes).<br /><br />Devil's Claw Root Extract:<br />- Native to southern Africa<br />- is a shrub that has lush foliage and red flowers (The plant gets its name from its fruits, which look like a hooked, gnarled claw).<br />- Historically, African people have employed the root for a wide range of conditions; from digestive function to joint support.<br />- Since its introduction to Europe in the early 1900s, the use of devil's claw root has spread throughout the world, and continues to be used primarily for joint support.<br /><br />Yucca Root-Herbs:<br />- A desert plant that grows in the Southwestern part of the United States and in Mexico.<br />- is a Native American remedy used to soothe irritation of all sorts, and to support healthy joints and skin.<br />- The main nutritional agents are saponins, which have a soapy consistency. Native Americans used yucca as soap due to its lathering effect and also as a blood cleanser.<br /><br />Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract:<br />- is not a true ginseng, but a cousin of Asian ginseng.<br />- has gained that nickname due to the fact that Siberian natives use it as a broad spectrum health enhancer, much the way ginseng is used.<br />- has a long-term stamina enhancing effect.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS (as it appears on the product package):<br />Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Lemongrass, Organic Blackberry Leaf, Natural Lotus Flower Flavor, Rose Petal, Organic Skullcap Leaf, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Organic Turmeric Root, Yucca Root Extract, Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosu), Stevia Leaf, Cat's Claw Bark Extract (Uncaria tomentosa, Phenols 15%, Alkaloids 3%), Devil's Claw Root Extract.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br />Stay active with a cup of Green Tea Muscle Recovery(tm). Our satisfying blend starts with gently stimulating and antioxidant-rich organic green tea and combines it with traditional soothing herbs such as organic turmeric root, one of the most widely used herbs in India. We then add devil's claw root and yucca root--herbs from indigenous herbal traditions--to help decrease recovery time from the minor aches and pains that may result from exercise. What's more, ginseng-eleuthero extract helps you reenergize.* So get invigorated, be energized, and stay active with Green Tea Muscle Recovery!<br /><br />[Above information extracted from Yogi Website: [...]]<br /><br />[Edit: It seems I can not post Yogi web address on Amazon review.

review/summary: My current Favorite!
review/text: I love this tea and drink it almost daily!  Like a previous reviewer said, it doesn't get bitter when brewed hotter or when the tea bag is left in.  So, I brew and out the door I go enjoying my wonderful lemon-grass, green-tea and herbal concoction.  As a fitness instructor with a full class load, not only do I love the inclusion of turmeric for muscle recovery (although you don't taste it) but also the fact that it tastes so good that I'll actually drink it.  I just ordered the pack of 6 on Amazon as a regular delivery item to arrive every 6 months and saved about $3 more!  I'd get it every 4 or 5 months but that wasn't an option.  I might need to change to a more frequent delivery schedule?  But, I can always get a box or two from Swansons when I order my vitamins, for around $2.80. Don't let the very clinical sounding name fool you, it's really yummy!

They are still finding benefits to drinking green tea so I figure it can't hurt.  The taste is great, it's green tea, with a very subtle lemon taste.

He never fully recovered during the week, but he fared much better than his classmates.

review/summary: Watered Down Juice -horrible
review/text: First to let you know where I am coming from:<br /> I am not a big drinker and currently not drinking at all as I am trying to get pregnant. It's not unusual for me to make nonalcoholic drinks just to be "festive" (i.e. mix soda water, OJ with lime) when my husband drinks. However, thought it may be nice to have a glass of nonalcoholic wine once in awhile. So coming from this point of view - my expectations aren't too high for a decent nonalcoholic drink.<br /><br />After reviewing Ariel's website - there was a pretty big sell on their Award winning wines, how they have actually beat alcoholic wines, how it is not grape juice but made for those who like fermented taste of grapes...with that information, I figured I may as well try it.<br /><br />What a mistake. While the Cabernet has a deep purple color, the taste is significantly watered down grape juice that leaves a bad taste in your mouth (in more ways then one). I tried to like it & even tried to chill the bottle. Whether you drink warm or chilled, this bottle is just not pleasant. You could create the same taste with 1/4 grape juice and 3/4 water. I wish there was a satisfaction guarantee do I could get my $7+ back!

I'm just going to skip right to the chase and say this blech smells literally like when someone has been wearing their socks for too long a hasn't washed their feet and tasted worse. Like some of the other contributors here my girlfriend got this wine because she's pregnant and was sick of drinking water (is there really any good things for pregnant women to drink-we have yet to find anything). She had an immediate distaste for it and I barely got past the smell. $10 literally down the toilet (maybe it would work for a toilet cleaner). Not worth a star.

review/summary: Unbelievably good
review/text: There are a million different snack bars out there. The ones from Divinely D'lish are unique and in a class by themselves. I discovered them at the farmer's market in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. One taste and I was hooked for life.<br /><br />Since then, they have found their way into local shops here on the peninsula in the Bay Area. But now that they are available online at Amazon, anyone anywhere can enjoy them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is simple, straightforward, healthy and impressive. No GMO, no trans fats, unsulphered dried fruit, an emphasis on organic. They look like someone took tons of different kinds of grains (but they're wheat-free), seeds and nuts and mashed them together with dates, raisins, syrup, coconut. You can see every seed - nothing is pulverized and there's no flour filler. They're soft, but the nuts and seeds give them an oh-so-satisfying crunch.<br /><br />I heat them up very slightly and they taste like the most heavenly fresh baked cookies imaginable. My husband's favorite is the Cheeky Cherry Chocolate but since I try and steer clear of chocolate, my favorite is the Haute Diggity Date. He packs them on long business trips to help him over jet lag. I pack them as gifts for my east coast friends instead of the See's candy I used to bring. People seem to really appreciate something good to eat they don't have to feel guilty about.<br /><br />The only negative - and it's a big one - is it's almost impossible to exercise moderation with these things. Even if you can buy them locally here in the Bay Area, you might as well buy them online by the box. They'll be gone in a flash.

review/text: I bought this from [...] when they had their sale. Amazon is cheaper on normal price though. It's pure awesomeness! best granola bar I've ever tasted. good organic ingredients. chewey, buttery, chocolatey, fruity awesomeness!!!!<br /><br />sure the calorie is a little higher than I'd like it to be. something like 230 calories. and I usually only eat half of these granola bars, but this one was so good that I finished the entire thing.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! it tastes like you are eating chewy oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.

review/summary: WONDERFUL TREAT!!!
review/text: Okay, these bars could really put me on the path of a health nut.  LOL  They are WONDERFUL!!!  The best I've ever had of this type of snack.  Soft, moist, and of the highest quality ingredients.  The Cheeky Cherry Chocolate is my favorite, the Haute Diggity Date the next.  We purchased the Nibble a Sultana ones, but they didn't seem to be quite as nice.  Haven't tried the cherry/fig ones yet, but we're hoping to get them soon.  You just can't miss with this product, especially if you need to be gluten free.

review/summary: DELICIOUS GRANOLA BAR!!
review/text: Bought a box of the Cheeky Cherry Chocolate.  They are wonderful!  They are a hard chewy granola bar that is made with organic chocolate & cranberries.  Very good for hiking since the bar actually stays together when you unwrap it.  A lot of granola bars crumble apart when you handle them.  They taste natural - not too sweet.  I am ordering another box, so I highly recommend these delicious bars!

They taste like they should be a reward like dessert, not a granola bar.  Yum!  I'd give them 10 stars if I could...

review/summary: Very great and healthy milk
review/text: Organic Valley is known as one of the more reputable organic milk companies. I was very happy to find the product here on Amazon as it is very hit or miss finding this in my local grocery stores. The price is also cheaper here than in my local store. There servings are a great size, just right for a children's snack. The chocolate is my favorite as well as one of my little ones. I love that when I need a "chocolate fix" I can grab one of these and not feel guilty. The taste and quality are great. The shelf life is around 4 months in the ones I have received. I love that I can get them delivered regularly through the subscribe and save program. We purchase all 4 flavors and my kids drink them all. The box of 12 does not take up a lot of shelf space, which is really good. While they taste best when cold, they can remain in the pantry, on the shelf, etc. with no problem. Its nice that I can have a healthy drink for my kids when we are on the go (although they should not be kept in the hot sun).<br />Just a really great product that is relatively healthy, taste very good, has good sturdy packaging, and the company is repuatable and honest with their labeling (something that isn't true for many "organic" companies).

review/summary: love it!
review/text: Chocolate milk is one of my special treats that I don't usually buy very often.  I saw these on an Amazon special and decided to pick them up partly because I love chocolate milk and partly because my friend's parents own a dairy farm that is part of the Organic Valley co-op.  I like knowing that my purchase is helping the family owned farms in our country--and specifically that I know one of those families.<br /><br />The milk is awesome!  It is sweet, but not overly sweet.  I've also tried Horizon, which I find to be a little too sweet compared to OV.  The expiration date was 3-4 months in the future on the box I received, so it was fresh.  I now have it on Subscribe & Save along with the plain 1% milk from OV.  They are nice to have when I need a quick pick-me-up and I'm also pregnant and in need of plenty of calcium, so these work great.

review/text: The chocolate drink has great flavor and not too sweet.  The best part is no refrigiration needed, especially for little kids' lunch drink during summer or winter!  Once in awhile, it's ok to drink these lowfat chocolate milk, but the sugar content per box is 6 tsp of sugar - OUCH!  The least sugar is the lowfat milk of all the 4 flavors, has 3 tsp sugar!  Fast delivery, too!  I would still recommend these drinks as lunch drink at school (alternate with milk), better than the cafeteria ones :)  5 star for fast service & good price, 3 star for sugar content.
