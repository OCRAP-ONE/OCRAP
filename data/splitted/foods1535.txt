review/summary: Wellness to the Core
review/text: I give this food five stars because it is the best food for my Yorkshire Terrier. He was a very picky eater before I discovered this food but he's never picky with this food. I give him half a can of the small can in the morning and another half in the afternoon. Yorkies are prone to diabetes (everyone is) so to avoid his blood sugar from dropping, I feed him twice a day with a few healthy snacks in between and make sure that he gets exercise. This food is grain free so he looks lean and strong.

review/summary: Not the favorite, but still a good choice.
review/text: This is the canned food that my dog(miniature schnauzer) has eaten the longest.  I began mixing it with the Core dry food, and it did well for some months.  Gradually, she lost interest, and I had to try other flavors.  I still present it about once a week, and can get her to eat it with some persuasion.  It seems to be one of the better foods for her, but not as readily accepted.

review/summary: Expensive, but good food
review/text: I switched to this food when my cocker spaniel was having stomach problems and vomiting often. I found that the Nutro Ultra had gluten in it and other foods we had tried had a lot of grain. She is thriving on this food and has no problems anymore. She is a high energy 3 year old and her coat is beautiful since we switched. I do not give this food to our 10 year old cocker. I think that the protein level and calories are too much for an older dog, although your vet would be better able to help you make that choice.

They've made big<br />improvements with this in their diet, plus the dry food made by Wellness.<br />The cans show up without any major dents, and the food itself actually<br />smells relatively appetizing (for dog food).

review/summary: Happy Dogs
review/text: I have a 3 year old that can eat pretty much anything, but I have a 15 year old that has a very sensitive system.  I was feeding them Neuman's Organic Turkey and brown rice and realized that my old guy was having issues pretty often.  So, I have been mixing this in to transition them to just this grain free food and they LOVE it and he has had no issues at all so far.  It has been well over a month, and all is swell.  I am glad I made the switch.  And ... I just remembered, the reason I bought this was because a friend's dog was staying with us and that Golden is super allergic to grains, but was not really eating her food.  I mixed in a small amount of this with her regular dry food and she gobbled it all up.  I could not have her lose weight under my care.  I told her family and I believe they bought it to mix in her food now.  I am glad we switched!

review/summary: Good for picky dogs
review/text: I've tried many different dry foods with my chihuahua mix. She does okay with them for a little while, but then won't touch them. Even when she'll eat them, she takes her time and is not enthused at all. I decided to try a canned food to see if it might be more appealing to her, and since I like Wellness I tried this first. I started by mixing it with her dry food, but she went straight for the wet food, picking around the dry. She would eat some of the dry food at the end if I stood there and watched her. I kept this up for a couple weeks, then switched her over completely to the canned food, since my cat was eating her dry leftovers. She still gobbles it down after about a month, and still licks the bowl clean every night. I was concerned about switching her over to a completely canned diet, as I've heard not feeding dry food can cause problems with the teeth and gums, but I think brushing her teeth and giving her dental treats will be sufficient. It's nice that now she eats her whole meal within a couple of minutes, so I don't have to watch the bowl and make sure the cat doesn't eat it for her. I'm sticking with the turkey recipe for now, but if she starts getting picky again, I'll try the fish recipe.

review/text: My picky dog has never taken to a wet food so readily as Wellness Core. She really springs to breakfast with this stuff. We have put her on about a quarter-can a day of this along with a grain-free kibble. We're getting all grain-free in an attempt to address her flatulence. Yeah, it's worked like a charm. No more barley in my pup's diet!<br /><br />A couple cans were dented. I hope Amazon picks up direct selling of this item so I don't have to deal with Marketplace vendors next time.

review/text: Wellness foods, in general, seem to be as fine a quality as you can give your pet short of a completely homemade diet. A grain free diet is helpful to my golden retrievers (food allergies) and Wellness Core offers several protein options in a grain free formula. I think its important to feed canned along with kibble (and some fresh veggies - usually green beans - as well). There are many fine ways to feed dogs and cats, but this works for mine. Wellness Core is a consistently excellent product and the doggies love it.

review/summary: Artificial Sweetener Warning
review/text: I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty. If you use the recommended 8oz setting, it has a full enough flavor. My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener. It leaves that horrible chemical aftertaste that diet sodas do. If you don't have a problem with Splenda and you like spiced chai, this is the K-cup for you! If you are like me though, and have an aversion to artificial sweeteners, it looks like we are still stuck with brewing the tea (such as Celestial's India Spice Chai) and adding our own milk and sugar.

The other thing is that when it came, a couple of the cups did not have loose powder in them.  The powder in the cup was stuck together and hard.  The last time I used a k-cup that had hard stuck together powder...my machine overflowed from the top because the water couldn't make it through the k-cup.<br /><br />I love the chai latte k-cups but I paid to much for 12 k-cups and I can't use a couple of them because they have the hard powder.

review/text: This is the best chai latte available for k-cups but it is still a step back from getting a chai at a coffee shop. I think it's the powdered milk or the sweetener used that I taste differently, but the spice mix is spot on if you use the small cup setting. The big cup setting can dilute the flavor a bit and make it taste weak.<br /><br />If I'm headed into work and I want a chai, I'll still stop at starbucks and get one because the gap is big enough that it's worth the extra money to get a freshly made chai.

review/summary: A great little snack
review/text: At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this company's products, and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.

review/summary: Incredible!
review/text: These almonds are nothing short of incredible- they are so delicious! If you are trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle (for dietary reasons or weight loss) and need a 'sweet fix' after meals, then this is a wonderful option - only 6 g. Net carbs! And the taste is so yummy! They are just sweet enough! I'm so glad that amazon sells them in bulk, because I could easily go through one container in a week!

review/summary: Healthy and delicious!
review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/summary: Too Much Sugar!
review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

Buying them in a 6-pack is more cost-effective for me, especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors, but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack.

review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

review/text: These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box, but the price looks odd - over $50?  Too bad Amazon doesn't stock this, so no Free Shipping.

review/summary: Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good, but hi-carb
review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/summary: back to Nature 100% Natural 9 oz. cookies
review/text: I saw these cookies at my whole food market several years ago and I purchased several varieties:  peanut butter, choc. chip, oreo, ginger, lemon, vanilla, etc.<br /><br />These are very pricey cookies that cost $3.99 per box, but they are worth the money.  Sometimes you can get them on sale at 2/$5.<br /><br />They are delicious and I am officially addicted to them.  However, not all the flavors are my preference.  I prefer the ginger, peanut butter, & vanilla.  You might prefer another flavor.<br /><br />The cookies have no artificial preservatives, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup.  They are made of whole grain wheat flour, and other natural flavors.<br /><br />The box contains approximately 45 cookies at 9 oz.  They are typically 170 calories and 10 g of sugar depending on the variety.  The product contains unprocessed cane sugar.<br /><br />Five cookies equal one serving size, and the product typically has 3 g of fat with about 21 g of carbs  The product contains dietary fiber ~3 g and 0 g trans fat.<br /><br />I like their slogan...simple ingredients, simply delicious, simply good.  Since the cookies use wholesome ingredients and techniques, they have robust flavors much like days gone bye.<br /><br />So many people, including myself, have gotten so accustomed to artificial flavors and the like that real flavors can be alarming at first, but this is what whole foods hopes to accomplish--getting back to the real thing.<br /><br />This product is made in Canada.

review/text: These are much better then I thought they would taste.  They have a good crunch and are true to graham flavor with a hint of saltiness.  My son really likes to snack on these, and I think they are better then the Earth's Best graham sticks I used to buy for him.  I stole a bag of these from our pantry and tried dipping them in nutella on the ends.  Heaven!

review/summary: Like a healthier Nutter Butter
review/text: We normally buy Back to Nature Chocolate Chip Cookies and decided to try the other varieties for our boys' lunches. We've tried the Madagascar Vanilla, California Lemon, and now the Peanut Butter Creme. While the Vanilla and Lemon cookies are very, very crunchy and have a strong, wheat-y aftertaste, the Peanut Butter Creme cookies are just as good as the Chocolate Chip. These cookies taste like a healthier (note that I didn't say "healthy") version of Nutter Butters! The filling is not as sweet as other peanut butter sandwich cookies, but it is definitely rich. I don't mind my kids having a processed treat once in a while, and when they do I like to make sure that the ingredients are acceptable. Back to Nature is a nice alternative to other processed cookies with chemical additives and coloring.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This item was featured on Dr Oz show as he was spotlighting healthier snack alternatives.  The chocolate chunk are the only ones available on amazon right now so that's the one I tried.  They are crazy good!  My mistake was giving some out at work and now I have to order more.<br /><br />The reviews for all the products are being lumped together in the ratings.  The Honey Graham Sticks doesn't taste like graham at all.  It's more like an animal cracker with a little more flavor.  The vanilla wafers are very good and taste much like Nilla wafers.  The madagascar vanilla have a buttery taste and are very crisp.  I've liked all but the graham sticks so far.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I really like these as a snack for both myself and my children. First off.. they are really good. They taste great, are all natural and the bags are the perfect size. I like the honey graham flavor. There are 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat in one bag. None of this two servings in one bag. I often find that many "individual" bags contain more than one serving and are too much for one child. I don't want my child eating two or three servings of cookies! And trust me mine would if allowed. So they are perfect for school lunches or as a snack or treat during the day. I will be buying these again. And how can you beat 15% off with subscribe and save delivered to your door!  It amazes me how much I buy on the internet now. Practically everything and I love it!

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.  I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now.

review/summary: changed more than the packaging
review/text: they changed their packaging and stuff in the last year and it appears they've tweaked the recipe as well. They used to be sweeter, very cardboard like now. Great for small kids who don't know any better but I cannot imagine anyone older than 12 willingly choking these down. Texture and flavor not what it once was.

review/summary: Burnt Cookies!
review/text: I have ordered these cookies numerous times.  This last order though was horrible.  The cookies were all burnt little crisps.  I wrote to the company about this issue and got no response.  Won't be ordering these again.  Buy at your own risk.

review/summary: Didn't really enjoy them
review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so "happy". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!

review/summary: No HFCS, soy, or processed sugar!
review/text: My DD is allergic to a long list of foods, including high fructose corn syrup, processed sugars, and soy.  Try finding a tasty snack that doesn't have at least one of those ingredients in it!  These taste great and both of my older kids love them.  (Baby hasn't tried them yet ;) ).  I'm happy to be able to give them a healthy alternative to a childhood favorite, and the individual packaging makes them easy to throw in the lunchbox for a school snack.  Convenient, delicious, and no allergies = a big hit in my house!  Subscribe and Save makes them even cheaper!!  Love it!

review/summary: Girl Scout What?
review/text: Forget about waiting for that certain time of year to be able to purchase Girl Scout cookies!! These are just as good and without some of those unnecessary additives that aren't good for our bodies, I honestly probably couldn't tell the difference on taste. Also, these are a better price!! I'm sold on Back To Nature products!!! You won't be disappointed in these. I love the Chocolate Delight Granola and the Chocolate Mint Sandwich Cookies as well (an exact flavor match to GS Thin Mints).

review/summary: Yummy Little Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: I purchased these for my children, to pack a sweet yet relatively healthful snack in their lunch sacks.  I am giving 5 stars by the recommendation of myself & three sons (age 7, 5 & 3).  When I tasted these, my first thought was that they were going to be gone FAST.  My children and I love these little cookies ... Crunchy little gems without all the trans-fats & preservatives, that I try to keep out of my children's diets as much as I can.  These will definitely remain on my grocery list.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: I thought these cookies were awful - I couldn't even eat them, they went to the squirrels. After reading all the other reviews I was very disappointed. It seems like they were overbaked, but even if not they weren't even close to some other healthy cc cookies I buy, such as  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHLS8W">Kashi TLC Cookies, Oatmeal Dark Chocolate, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: Yummy little cookies, nice small portions
review/text: These tasted just like the little Famous Amos cookies, and I was glad to see they were made out of actual food & not a bunch of chemicals (not that the Famous Amos cookies are necessarily fake food--I don't know offhand). I do like that the portion size was small, though the packaging is a little excessive for what you're getting--but individual portions always are. But you can always recycle the Mylar bags & feel less guilty about using excess packaging to curb your gluttony.

review/summary: So good I could eat en entire box in one sitting
review/text: and I have eaten an entire box in one sitting.  Not good I know!  But if I am ever going to be depressed and eat an entire box of anything, I certainly would rather it be these than a box of highly processed animal lard filled oreo's!  When our friends come over (and they are not health nuts like myself and my hubby) they always ask for these.
