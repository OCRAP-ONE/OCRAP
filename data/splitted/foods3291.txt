review/summary: lovely decoration
review/text: Unlike the first reviewer, I did not find a plastic center in the middle of the SILVER dragees I just purchased. Maybe the multi-colored ones are made differently for whatever reason... At first, I was sad that the bottle says "for decoration only", but after going to the India Tree FAQ page, I found out why:<br /><br />20. Why does the label say "For Decoration Only" on the Silver Dragees? What is in them?<br /><br />Dragees are a very old European tradition and have been used in Europe and the United States for years to decorate wedding cakes and other fine pastries. The FDA in its Compliance Policy Guide 7117-03 classifies silver dragees in the following way: "When small silver balls known as 'silver dragees' are sold exclusively for decorating cakes and are used under conditions which preclude their consumption as confectionery, they are not considered to be in the category of food or confectionery."<br /><br />Because they are not categorized for food or confectionery, the FDA does not want the manufacturer to list the ingredients. However, it may be helpful to know that they are made mostly of sugar. They may also contain small amounts of gum Arabic, wheat flour, artificial coloring, and/or a very thin coating of silver.<br /><br />The European Union recognizes silver as a legitimate color additive and states that "small amounts of it consumed on special occasions are not harmful." Silver appears in medicines, cough drops and tooth fillings as well as in our water supply in controlled amounts. It is used to purify city drinking and swimming pool water. It occurs naturally in the soil in which produce is grown, and thus finds its way into the vegetables that we eat.<br /><br />You may wish to access the FDA ruling cited above on the web. You may also wish to visit the website of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR CAS #7440-22-4) for more information on the effect of small amounts of silver on health.

review/text: These silver Dragees added just the right touch to our holiday cookies. We made mitten cut-out cookes and Christmas tree cut-out cookies. They added sparkle to the mitten cuffs and added beautiful silver ornaments to our trees.  They were eaten by my family and nothing happened.  I remember eating these as a kid...though the jar says not to eat them...not sure why...wish they would explain.

review/summary: Great for Indoor Cats on a Budget
review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

review/summary: Verifiably Vet Approved
review/text: It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel. The information in that review is incorrect. This product is healthy for cats. Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food.

review/text: My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week. He was wasting away. When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food, and regained all the lost weight and muscles he had lost. I believe this food saved his life.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/summary: Not the best, but better than most
review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/text: I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

review/summary: Corn?? Really??
review/text: My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: amazing!!
review/text: I never write reviews for things I purchase.. but this product is definately something I'll never go without for my babies! I switched my 3 cats to this approx 10months ago, not only has my cat lost weight (he was weighing in at 23lbs while eating meow mix, he now weighs 17) all the cats have better breath and are much more playful.  I purchase this at walmart at only pay about $14, which is only $2 more than what i was paying for meow mix. My babies love this food, and its obviously a lot better for them.. looks like we've found a food of choice!!<br /><br />Spook 17bs, 3yo<br />Twinkie 8.5lbs, 6yo<br />Betelguese 7lbs, 1yo

review/text: I got this so that my girls could have some variety in their meals. The nutritional value is great and they really scarf it up! They "helped" me open up the Amazon box when I brought it in the door. Since this is such a hit with them, it will be on their menu quite often.It is the first time I tried this brand. I usually feed them Iams, but wanted to try a little variety for a change.

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

review/summary: Absolute garbage....  get a clue folks...
review/text: Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

review/summary: Cat Killer!
review/text: I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!

review/summary: Very interesting and unique flavor--one of my favorite spices
review/text: I bought a jar of this while on a roadtrip one weekend (so not from Amazon) along with a few other new spices (including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K6G90A">Morton & Basset Chinese 5 Spice, 1.9-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a> which is fantastic beyond words) and immediately got hooked. I think that it is the bright little taste of lavender that gets to me so much, but overall this is just a really great spice, a terrific mix of flavors that is completely unexpected. I hate to use the word "unique" because it's such a vague word, but this flavor is just that: a world unto itself. Oddly enough it's one of the few spice flavors that I can conjure up in my memory just by thinking of it--isn't that funny? If I just picture the jar in my head I can recall the flavor (and that's not as easy as it sounds!). Anyway, love the spice and I have to say that, as a previous reviewer said, this is the ultimate flavoring for an omelette: you put this on eggs once and you're hooked. I've yet to meet a Morton & Basset herb that I didn't like and I like the jars so much that I save them when empty and reuse them.

I love the prominent lavender aroma and flavor.  I use this all the time when I cook and especially love it on poultry.  I even sprinkle it on sliced turkey kielbasa as it's cooking in the skillet and it's fantastic!<br /><br />I also used to find this at my local grocery store, but now have to order online and am so glad I found it on Amazon.  Will have to try some other blends, like the previously mentioned 5-spice.

review/summary: Really Really Sweet!
review/text: I was fairly skeptical when trying these, thinking they'd probably have little to no affect on me. I was way off. The tablets themselves are actually pretty nasty, like sucking on a vitamin, they take some time to dissolve so you've really got to be willing to put up with having these fairly unpleasant things in your mouth for at least 3-5 minutes. I recommend rolling them around all over the top of your tongue as you do, and trying not to swallow too often so you can really let your tongue absorb as much as it can. Another tip is that if you plan on trying this with liquids, do so after you've tried it with more solid foods as liquids will dissipate the effects much quicker.<br /><br />I gave it the old lemon test and I was shocked at just how sweet and delicious they were. Really, it made lemons taste like delicious lemon candy, not at all like those artificially flavored lemon drops. Natural applesauce was a bit much, but apples are already sweet so I sort of expected it. I also tried cheese, carrots, peanut butter, and while the peanut butter seemed a bit sweeter, the others didn't seem to show any affect at all.<br /><br />What impressed me the most, however, was tea. I poured myself a tall glass of unsweetened Lipton and it wasn't at all what I expected. Rather than making it taste sweet, it just removed the bitterness. Again, it's hard to articulate the sensation, but I can say that if you've ever wondered what tea tastes like without being overpowered by sweeteners or the natural bitterness found in most teas, try it with these tablets. The effect will wear off after a few minutes when you drink, but the taste you get is so uniquely pure. In all honesty, you haven't experienced tea until you've had a cup with one of these.<br /><br />I've read that wine is also good, so I may try that sometime in the future, along with other bitter fruits. I'm also curious how tomatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and bell peppers will taste. Whatever I decide, I really feel these things have opened up a whole new world of flavor experiences, and I'm really looking forward to trying them all.<br /><br />I totally recommend these tabs just for the experience, but as an alternative to sugar, they're way too expensive at this point.<br /><br />Happy Tasting!

review/text: The boxes are a lot smaller than they look in the picture.  In fact, the enlarged picture is almost actual size. However, the product itself is fun.  Inside the box are 10 individually sealed little red pills about the size of the iPhone (&iPod touch) home button and 3mm thick.  You let it dissolve on your tongue for a minute and then sour things taste sweet.  I found it most effective with limes and other citrus.  Lemons and limes still acid-burned my tongue, cheeks, and lips but they tasted very sweet.  Sour warhead candies and salt & vinegar Kettle potato chips tasted sweet too.  Beer tasted very different under the effect of miracle fruit, not sure if it tasted sweeter, but the flavor changed.  The effect wore off after about 30-45 minutes.<br />Only gripe: price could be better.  How is it possible that $12/box (10 pills) is the cheapest price on the internet?

review/text: I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Sugar, Sugar, and More Sugar.
review/text: This used to be my favorite beverage.  Until recently, I drank Ocean Spray Cranapple juice at least twice a day, and on the weekends I guzzled a glass every breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Then I gained 15 lbs over the summer and wondered how that happened despite sticking to a moderate-to-low fat diet and a rigorous workout regimen.  A cup of Ocean Spray has at least 30 grams of sugar, and that's approximately the same amount in a Snickers candy bar. And not only is it sugar, it's high-fructose corn syrup: very bad if you're health conscious and even worse if you're trying to control your sugar intake. Would YOU eat a Snickers candy bar three to four times a day?  Most wouldn't, but that's the amount of sugar I was consuming on a daily basis.  When I learned how this affected my waistline and fitness goals, I immediately switched over from fruit juices to water and I lost 10 lbs in less than a month.  The truth is, fruit juices are so high in sugar and calories, that they're not that good for you, whether they're vitamin-fortified or not.  You're better off drinking them either in moderation or eliminating them from your diet altogether.

review/text: Yes, it has sugar in it but cranapple juice is DELICIOUS. And you will not gain weight from drinking cranapple juice there's not enough sugar in it for that. Plus, sugar doesn't make you gain weight unless you already are eating too fat and calories. I've drank it for months and have not gained any weight.

review/text: Okay, for all you coffee lovers out there who do NOT do the instant coffee thing, I am going to burst your little discriminating bubble today.  I received a sample pack of this Nescafe Taster's Choice brand coffee from the company by mail.  I am actually surprised how  good it is.  I didn't think that I would like the whole freeze-dried coffee thing, because I too discriminated against this type of coffee.  Have always been a ground-fresh-cofee-bean person.  Well, just opened the packet and tasted the Nescafe Taster's Choice VANILLA flavored packet.  IT's GOOD! My daughter liked it too and now she is mixing the HAZLENUT w/hot water as I type this out.  Yes, I am gonna order more.  We are a family that stocks up in bulk for the year in our family, so we will probabaly order a case or more of this coffee.  Go ahead and try it - it tastes good!

review/text: After reading all the glowing 5 star reviews, I must say I am VERY disappointed.  I had to temper myself to give the bars 3 stars because, they really are not BAD, but its just that I was expecting something quite a lot better due to all the reviews.  I assumed that since coconut is in the name, that I would taste the flavor of coconut in the bar.  I had to concentrate on the flavor to try to taste any coconut...pretty pathetic considering its name. Chewy granola bars, average flavor at best, in my opinion. I like Fiber One bars MUCH better, and they don't claim to taste like coconut, so I'm not disappointed :)

review/summary: Santa Fe Bean Company Culinary Refried Beans -- a good find
review/text: This product contains only beans.  I like the mild cereal/bean flavor, which does not overpower other ingredients I may add, such as yogurt and a packaged Indian eggplant, tomato, and onion dish.  The product doesn't contain added salt, and I don't miss it.<br /><br />The product rehydrates rapidly in a microwave oven; I heat to only a bit higher than body temperature.<br /><br />The bag looks like a sturdy coffee bag.  The bag has a double-ridge zipper seal.  If I start sealing from side of the bag, the zipper works fine.  If I start sealing from the middle of the bag, the ridges can get "cross-threaded."<br />The bag is completely sealed until I cut the top off with scissors.  However, the ends of the zipper seals are not quite long enough to be fused into both sides of the bag, so I think that an extremely small and energetic insect could get inside.  I keep opened bags in my refrigerator; if not, I would keep them in large zipper-lock bags.  Again, this issue does not arise until the seal at the top of the bag is cut open.<br /><br />I had been using the Santa Fe Bean Company instant fat-free vegetarian refried beans (which I reviewed), but I prefer the lack of salt and the price of these culinary refried beans.

I use 60g of beans to 150ml water (about 1:2.5) and 1/8 teaspoon (about 3 grams) salt.  The difference between these and the smaller packages though is that you have to add the salt.

review/summary: Better than Canned!
review/text: I wanted to try dehydrated beans for the cost factor, as we use a lot of cans.  I looked at this company's "seasoned" varieties, but I noticed all but one had beans, salt, oil as the ingredients.  This one is totally plain, just beans, but much cheaper.  If all they are adding is salt and oil, I thought, well I can do that.  So, I decided to give these a try.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised.  There is no dog food smell, like the canned beans.  Instead you are greeted with an earthy grain aroma.  I just added some baco bits, salt, and dried onions, and yum, these were great and ready in 5 minutes!  I will be ordering these again in the future.  I just wish they offered the same scenario with the "culinary" style (i.e. totally plain bean) in black beans and lentils, etc., as the price is better than the seasoned varieties.<br /><br />They come in a dark plastic package that has a zip-lock top, so you can reseal the bag between uses.  I imagine this would be a good emergency food item, as it looks like it will store very well.<br /><br />Anyways, for others on the fence, like me, I say, give it a try.  They taste great.

review/summary: It's Delicious!
review/text: I've been addicted to these veggie crackers for over three years now, and my favorite flavor is the green onion and sea weed one. The normal soda cracker plain doesn't have much taste to it. Anyway, I can eat the whole container in one sitting (I know, I'm a fatty.) Hahah~ I usually eat these when my stomach ulcer flares up and it does it's job of keeping my tummy better.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this cracker to everyone. One bite and you will be hooked!

review/summary: Great Deal!
review/text: I was super thrilled to see that amazon was selling these for such a great price. I know its not Halloween yet, but I'm just excited for the variety pack of chocolates. They're great to have in my dorm, but they seem to be going fast. My friends and roommate have already helped me plow through a bag.<br /><br />One thing though, amazon packages these in a heavy styrofoam box with ice packs inside of another box so they don't melt. I guess its nice for quality control, but it was super bulky.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I purchased this at $10, so given that you receive 2 bags resulting in each being only $5 I found it to be a good deal. Especially because shipping, when combined with another $10 candy item was still only $1.99.

review/text: I paid like $17+ to get it here by Halloween.  The candy was in good condition.  The total candy count including both bags was:<br /><br />Hershey's Milk Chocolate: 30 bars<br />Reese's Pumpkins: 42<br />Hershey's Cookies & Cream: 27<br /><br />Total of 99 bars ... so they shorted me by one.  :)

review/summary: Great and Very Fresh
review/text: This is a really tasty collection.  I wasn't sure about the cookies and cream, but the white chocolate has a lot of flavor.  The Peanut butter pumpkins are amazingly fresh, and much tastier than the mixed assortment of 100 I got earlier.  The regular chocolate tastes like the way old Hershey bars used to taste.  Better than the Kisses.  Highly recommend this addictive assortment.
