review/summary: A very good albacore tuna.
review/text: Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water<br /><br />This is an exceptionally good tuna.... good texture and taste. Up until buying this, I bought Walmart's store brand Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water, which is also wild caught. The primary difference between the two brands is price.<br /><br />The Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water costs $0.42 per once without coupon or subscribe discount.... $0.35 per once with $10 per 24 can discount.<br /><br />Walmart's everyday price is $0.23 per once.<br /><br />Needless to say, when my stock of Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water runs out, I'll go back to the Walmart store brand.<br /><br />If the price difference wasn't so great, I would have given 5 stars instead of 3.

review/summary: Not too sweet, right size for little ones
review/text: Unlike some other brands (and some of Kinnikinnick's own cookies), these chocolate animal GF cookies are not overly sweet but tastes chocolate-y enough for my chocoholic son.  The animal shapes are easy to decipher.  Small enough for little hands to hold, and for mommies and daddies not to feel guilty for giving the kids 5 or 6 different shapes (or more!).  I have only bought them at retail stores, and invariably and perhaps inevitably some of the cookies are broken when I open the package, but that has happened with all animal cookies I have bought, GF or not.  The crumbs make a great cheese cake crust :-)

Tastes better than the other major brand (I wont say their name).  :)

review/summary: We have a winner!
review/text: Doc suggested reducing the gluten in my diet as another weapon against some mild psoriasis on my fingertips.<br /><br />I can't really speak to the efficacy of that but I was looking for an alternative to my normal cracker/crunch routine (Saltines, Ritz, Doritos). These Crunchmasters are great candidates!<br /><br />I've had them plain; with cheese/salami; with guacamole. But my favorite so far is as a crouton replacement! I crumble them up and once they get doused with some salad dressing, they work out perfectly for me.<br /><br />This all being said, I'm not really a salt guy (says the guy who eats Saltines) and they are a little salty for my tastes until I re-realized "duh, I ordered Sea Salt Flavor" so what did I expect. This 6-pack is a good amount of crackers for one crunch-lover but when I do get through them and onto ordering another batch, I'll try a different flavor.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Cracker!
review/text: After being diagnosed with celiac disease, I was doubtful that I could find a cracker that I would like as much as my usual whole grain crackers.  My mom suggested these, and I was skeptical (what would I do with 6 bags if I didn't like them?)  They are fantastic!  They are crunchy, slightly salty, and a great gluten free cracker for any use.  Many gluten free crackers, and GF products in general, use mostly rice flour and are very low in whole grains and fiber, as well as being higher in calories than their whole wheat counterparts.  These crackers have 3 grams of fiber and 120 kcal per 16 cracker serving, which is great.  I would highly reccomend these crackers to anyone even if you do not need to follow a gluten free diet.

review/summary: "All Natural"???...contains GMO corn, confirmed by a phone call to Crunchmaster
review/text: Eating gluten-free or wheat-free is becoming far less challenging than it once was.  Unfortunately, eating GMO-free is still like navigating a labyrinth with a blindfold.<br /><br />We can thank food manufacturers like Crunchmaster for that difficulty.  With the following proudly printed across the front of the package: "Certified Gluten Free!", "All Natural", "0g Trans Fat", "Cholesterol Free", one might be tempted to think this is a fairly "clean" product.  Not so.  A call to the customer service number on the back of the bag (1-888-574-7737, in case you're interested) to ask whether this "all natural" product is also natural enough to be GMO-free, elicited the following comment from a customer service rep "it has corn in it, so it's not...".<br /><br />"Not GMO-free?" I queried to make sure I was understanding.  "Not GMO-free" came the reply.<br /><br />So there you have it.  With recent studies coming out even more strongly questioning the safety and long-term health effects of GMO foods, why would anyone want to eat this?  Do you?<br /><br />Pass on this product and support those gluten-free products that are also committed to providing GMO-free as well as gluten-free.  There are alternatives out there that do both.

review/summary: Crunchmaster gluten-free crackers are exceptionally delicious
review/text: Crunchmaster has perfected the art and science of baking crackers that are gluten-free so that the crackers taste and feel at least as delectable as those that are non-gluten-free.  People who do not need to eliminate gluten from their diet enjoy these crackers as much as people who must eat gluten-free.  Their high quality is exceptional in the gluten-free products industry; so many of those products are very expensive and not worth consuming.  Crunchmaster crackers are deliciously worth every cent.  The pack of 6 bags of crackers gives us an opportunity to bring a bag to share when we're invited to where they're serving a cheese plate as an appetizer.  Everyone comments on how good they are and asks about them.

review/text: After trying many gluten-free products, with great disappointment, I was dubious about the glowing reviews for these crackers.  However, the gluten-free world is not a delicious place, so the reviews convinced me to try them.  I found only the white cheddar flavor at my local heath food store.  I must admit they are delicious. Without a doubt, the best gluten-free product I have had.  I agree with the other reviews, the crackers are crunchy and flavorful.  Since my local store only carries the one flavor, I look forward to ordering the others from Amazon.  I wish other gluten-free products could be this good.

review/summary: My favorite flavor of this brand is Bangkok Curry!
review/text: Absolutely delicious, light, gluten-free, low calorie, inexpensive lunch! I am on a perpetual diet, and nothing has made me happier than this soup. I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ. All of which is bad for me. Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. And I like the fact that they put two flavor packets, one is the soup mix and the other is the spicy oil, so if your kids don't like hot spicy, they don't have to add the spicy oil packet. Great, right?<br /><br />The price works out best if you get the box of 72 from Amazon. This package of 12 actually works out to be a little more expensive than the supermarket, but still worth it if your supermarket doesn't carry it.

We were enjoying this as a  standard convenience food. It's quick, easy, and gluten free. That being said, it's not the best for you. It has Maltodextrin listed at least twice in the ingredients. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but I try to keep MSG out of my diet. If I had had a clear list of the ingredients prior to ordering this item I would not have purchased it.

I'm glad I did, they're my go-to guilty pleasure. Tasty, easy, flexible and a healthier choice than soda for me. I purchased both the Passion Orange Guava and Strawberry Sensation. I love them in my protein shakes, smoothies, or even a splash in a tall glass of crushed ice (homemade snow cone).<br /> o Passion Orange Guava - a yummy reminder of vacations I've taken and the tropical punches and umbrella drinks.<br /> o Strawberry Passion - my favorite, conjures up memories of summery homemade strawberry treats.

review/text: I was a little hessatent to order beef jerky from a web site, but I took a chance.  This jerky is true unseasoned beef jerky.  It appears to be hung jerky.  It tastes ok, but not as flavorful as some of the other brands.  This package comes with huge pieces, so it's a little difficult to eat in small portions.  Also, make sure you eat it fast.  It only had a shelf life of 5 days after I opened it beofre it started to mold.

review/text: WE discovered these on our trip to Eastern Europe this summer. I was thrilled to find I could order them off the internet in the USA! They are delicious, having the perfect mix of coffee, sweetener,( sugar I think) and some type of dried milk. Perfect for an  after dinner treat. I am hooked and will ask for some for Christmas!

review/summary: For Jeremy
review/text: I like this product, because it is grain free.  It is a bit softer than other canned dog foods probably because there are no fillers.  Jeremy loves it.  I have always mixed salt free green beans with his food as a filler so it does make the consistency a bit firmer.  Green beans are virtually fat free so my vet said to add them and cut down on the canned food as Jeremy tends to weigh a bit more than he should.  Jeremy is a Papillon and although fairly active he doesn't get long walks here in Florida in the summer so have to watch feeding amounts. Sometimes I mix a little bit of dry food with it to give it a firmer consistency.  He gets 1/2 can in the morning with greens beans and 1/2 in the evening the same way.  He is satisfied and content without over-feeding.Jeremy wolf's it down in either case.

review/summary: Smoooth!
review/text: We are coffee people, and I mean coffee people. I've tried many, many types and always go back to Italian (although German comes very close). This one however, is one of the best I've ever come across in organics.  It's extremely smooth. It's not overly nutty and has a sweet finish on the palate without hitting the back of the tongue with an overwhelming acidity=bitterness. My husband usually likes a more acidic coffee, but really enjoys this one.<br /><br />We also found that it's much easier on the stomach with a lower acid level, but not because of the chemical process. A naturally occurring lower acid level means it's a true dark roast. A good company that is truly organic should never use the chemical processes, and instead know how to actually roast the coffee properly. A slower roast allowing the oils (which contain the acid) to be roasted out of the coffee without over roasting, versus treating them chemically is the key in other words. You get the caffeine, just not the heart burn. And that is ideal for coffee drinkers like us.<br /><br />I think I've found the one. With all that said, it really does depend on your palate. I do believe however, that this has a nice overall compatibility with what most are wanting in a good coffee, especially first thing in the morning. A good deep flavor without knocking you back. Perfect for what we're wanting.<br /><br />It's also grown and roasted right here in the USA!!

review/summary: Chunky "Nectar and Ambrosia"
review/text: I'm a meat and potatoes type of person (although I do eat lots of veggies because they make a difference in the way I feel).<br /><br />And I LOVE this Chunky Soup!!! I could OD on it.<br /><br />It has NICE meaty chewy chunks of tender beef, swimming in a thick gravy, surrounded by BIG chunks of taters and carrots and veggies, oh my! -- and frankly, it tastes JUST as good eaten out of the can as it does warmed up (for those adults who would like an even heartier taste, add a little -- 2 or 3 tablespoons of -- beer to it when heating up). I suppose you could also add some cooked s'ghettis to this soup-- but why..?? It's beautiful just as it is.<br /><br />I also LIKE VERY MUCH the Low Sodium version of this soup -- because I could NOT eat the "regular" (Higher Sodium) version of this Chunky Sirloin Burger soup, without getting sick (dizzy), and I don't have any medical issues that would be affected by a higher sodium intake.<br /><br />I buy this by the carton. I love it.

review/text: I switched to Happy Baby after learning that Earth's Best and Gerber have bpa in their baby food lids.  These pouches are bpa free.  My daughter loves them.  I usually mix the mango in with oatmeal to sweeten the oatmeal naturally.  My daughter doesn't like to eat oatmeal plain.  I usually use one package over two or three days this way.  They are also great on the run.  I can throw a couple pouches in the diaper bag and take it out when needed.  She has eaten pouches on the subway, park benches, buses, etc.  She just sucks them up with no mess.

review/text: I agree with other posters -- I taste all of my baby's food and this is my favorite :)  More importantly, of course, my baby likes it.  We started giving it to him at 6months and plan to continue even though he's on to Stage 2 foods now.  I don't have a whole lot of time to make my own baby food, but using this helps me get him some more variety.  It's pretty thin, so I can use it to blend with either avocado or spinach+banana.  It's also really sweet so it makes a pretty yummy combination!

review/summary: Best price for organic pouched pears
review/text: If you need the convenience of this kind of pouch packaging (lightweight, not breakable glass) for "on the go" situations, the Amazon price for these is the best anywhere.  Less than $1 per 3.5 oz pouch.  At the time I'm writing this review, the per ounce price is less than Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen and Sprouts.  I also prefer this packaging over Sprouts because you don't need a spoon to feed baby, just squeeze directly in the mouth.<br /><br />However, if I'm feeding at home, the best bargain is with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER1D5U">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Pears, (6 months & up), 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.  Even if you don't do Subscribe and Save, it's a great deal, compared to the pouch style competitors.

I don't understand why that is even necessary. Our son has very sensitive skin and breaks out around his mouth and chest whenever certain foods come in contact with his skin - and I bet that the lemon juice could be the culprit here.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't so hard to find a product that had only what it says it has on the front packaging. The Amazon description didn't even say it.<br /><br />Word of warning for parents of kids with citrus allergies/sensitivities.

review/text: Too expensive for us to purchase at full price but got a great deal so bought two cases. Intended to use as baby food but our child wont eat purees very much so preschooler likes these in the car.<br /><br />While fresh fruit is best, these make a great substitute and are great in kitchen. Make an organic sauce for chicken. Put orange juice in pan (strong, closer to concentrate is best), add cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pouch of this puree. Another option is finely diced apples and applejuice. Makes a great, simple chutney. Just don't tell the family or your guests you served then "baby food" until after they rave about the meal!

We also live in an area where mangos are not prevelant, so this is a great option.

review/summary: Love
review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

I wish Amazon carried a wider variety at the subscribe and save price.<br /><br />Just a note that these are a little liquidy.  They work nicely to mix with oatmeal or cereal for breakfast.

review/summary: Spoils quickly - much earlier than stated due date
review/text: I bought the 16-pack in May 2011 and the date on the label says "best by" May 2012.  Baby & I spent some time away from home this summer and when we returned in August, I opened one of these packs and the smell was of over-ripe spoiled mangos (with that wine smell).  They were fine when I purchased in May and baby loved it, but now I have 10+ packs that I need to throw away and Amazon won't let me return these.  Seems unfair when the label clearly states they are ok until next year.

review/summary: Fresh?
review/text: I bought a single pack of this first to try to see how this can possibly be called 'fresh mango' when it is sitting on a back shelf of a small corner grocery store in our area for i don't know how long. I opened it and tried it and unless we got a dud, real 'Fresh' mango when peeled cut into chunks and pureed will be a bright yellow or bright orange color, not a brownish color which is what this 'fresh' mango puree was. I am a real mango lover and personally feel this color and taste is what an over ripened mango that is going bad will look and taste like. After reading all the reviews i was disappointed, and my baby only had a teaspoon and didn't know any different since it was her first fruit. Also can you really classify something as 'fresh' when it can sit in it's packaging for a whole year? IMO the lure of this and similarly packaged products is basically the design of the packaging and the products easy accessability. As others say you can eat it on the go, while traveling and anywhere basically and the child can hold it, it doesn't create a mess, bpa free packaging easy all around. Other then that once opened it's only good for a day or 2 like a real fresh cut mango is anyway, only its not really 'fresh'..but since here on the northeast mangos only come around a few months out of the year and since most people don't have the time to puree their own fruits and veggies, these types of products are the only alternative, otherwise cubing and pureeing your own mango..now that's fresh mango! Hopefully i can find the time to start pureeing soon. Edit: tried another pouch and it wasn't brown it was more like a bright orange as a mango should be and it did taste good. Convenient to mix as it's texture is smooth but still will try and puree my own when mango season comes around.

review/summary: an extremely pleasant surprise
review/text: So, I started a gluten-free diet about two months ago. I have baked gluten-free bread, but other than that, haven't really tried to replace other wheat products. This was my first try of a gluten-free pasta. I've had quinoa before and really liked it so it seemed like a good bet.<br /><br />Even so, I wasn't expecting a miracle. Even as it cooked and I was tasting for doneness, I was noticing grainy textures that weren't that great. But I kept tasting, and right around the suggested cook time, it smoothed out. I drained immediately and dressed with a really light sauce. There is no noticeable "off" flavor to the pasta and it has a great "al dente" texture. I am confident I could serve this to someone who didn't know it was regular pasta and they'd never think anything of it.

review/summary: Good alternative to brown rice pasta
review/text: I agree with the last reviewer that quinoa pasta must be watched and doesn't store well. It loses structural integrity rather quickly, so add a splash of olive oil to boiling water before adding the pasta, and then stir frequently--the trick is not to let it stick together or it will form a big mass of glue. It's not great for soups and stews because if overcooked, it begins to dissolve. However, in light of all that, I really, really like all the Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas. They are far tastier and have a more pleasing texture than any rice-based pasta.

review/text: It tastes pretty good with lots of sauce - but you have to keep an eye on it when cooking so it doesn't break apart, the elbows don't hold its shape. Also, if you stir in sauce too much, it will definitely break and it doesn't store well in the fridge because when you reheat it, it'll break some more. Otherwise, it's a good alternative to wheat/gluten.

review/summary: Best GF pasta
review/text: My son's celiac so we know a lot about gluten free products in my house.  We've tried many gf pastas and this one is BY FAR the best.  We go through a few cases of these a year.<br /><br />I really can't think of anything bad to say about them except that you need to be careful that you don't overcook them -- the window of acceptable "doneness" when boiling these is around two minutes long.  But when you cook it right it's great.  I've even made baked pasta dishes with these and they're excellent.  This is much better (and more nutritious) than any brown rice pastas out there.

review/summary: Excellent Pasta, please read before reading the negative reviews
review/text: I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the product has corn in it and that they felt mislead when buying it because they thought it was all quinoa. Quinoa itself can't be made into a stong pasta. It's too bad people are giving this product a bad review just because they didn't take the time to read the description. It says its a blended pasta right on the box and the product description says "Now you can enjoy the rich, nutty flavor of Ancient Harvest Quinoa combined with a natural blend of corn flours in this delicious, highly nutritious pasta." This pasta is the best I have ever had though, way better than rice blends, which have a high glycemic index. The corn is organic and the combination of both quinoa and corn make it quite awesome. This is a step up from the all-corn pasta I have been getting from Walmart. For someone who can't have gluten, I greatly appreciate this product and would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />A few tips on cooking: Make sure to not overcook it, like any pasta it will lose its structure and fall apart a little when over cooked. Check it frequently and taste test it before draining it. The cooking time on the box is pretty accurate, but only if you have put the pasta into boiling water initially. Don't ever throw the pasta into water that hasn't started boiling yet and expect it to cook in the time stated on the box. Make sure to rinse the pasta for a few seconds after straining to stop the cooking process. This pasta holds it shape if cooked right and can even be reheated the next day with no issues. Most of you probably already know this, but the few negative nellys out their appear to have not learned these tips yet. It really is fantastic. I'm salivating just thinking about it right now. :)

review/text: These are great, so much better than your average pasta.  Depending on just what you desire in a food, also consider Barilla Plus pastas, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UCHS6">Barilla Rotini Plus, 14.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> ,because they are a bit higher in fiber and much higher in protein.  Note that Barilla Plus is not wheat free, in fact it contains wheat gluten as a ingredient.  So, if you are avoiding gluten, then Ancient Harvest is great.  Make sure to try Ancient Harvest's plain quinoa grain  -- wonderful as a side dish or cooked into a variety of recipes like Mexican foods, puddings, etc.

It is a pain having to purchase so many boxes at once, but the price is worth it. I would have to pay twice as much per box in the store. And to find something that tastes this good and still be gluten free, awesome!
