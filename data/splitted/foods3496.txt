review/summary: Who needs salsa when chips taste this good?
review/text: These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy.

review/text: These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++

review/text: thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips.

review/summary: So Faboo: Dangerous for those prone to Chips Binges!!!
review/text: I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

review/text: I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.

review/text: I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.

I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!

The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.

review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing "No MSG" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.

review/summary: Black Beans Never Tasted So Good!!!
review/text: These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)

review/summary: Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE
review/text: Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of "Yeast Extract".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/text: High quality, low-fat dog food.  Uses far better ingredients that most of the canned food you can find in stores.  We use several of the lower-fat varieties of Weruva mixed with some homemade ingredients for our dog with hyperlipidemia, and straight Weruva for our second dog.  The Weruva website lists ingredients and nutrition information for each variety, including fat content.

review/text: For some of us who cannot drink coffee or do not wish to ingest caffeine this healthy drink is the answer.  The powder  version is very good, but I prefer the crystals.  This beverage can be prepared black or milk/cream/Half andHalf added.  Also can be prepared as a cold drink.  When I decided to stop drinking coffee for health reasons, I was looking for a product that would satisfy me.  I tried other brands of coffee substitute but Cafix did the job.I highly recomended.

review/summary: Overpowering spices
review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first.

review/text: To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from "the best hot chocolate ever" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with.

review/summary: delicious, full-flavored cocoa mix
review/text: This is probably the best-tasting cocoa I've ever had at home.  A friend gave me a small tin of it years ago as a holiday gift.  We enjoyed every bit of it but had trouble finding more until it turned up on Amazon.  Smells great, tastes great, and is made with real ingredients (not artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals).  Really fantastic stuff.  It's also great in brownies and cakes - adds some spices above and beyond what most people expect.  Tastes like fall, in the best way possible.  Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.  Drink it right away.  Filling, lots of vitamins, and naturally sweet.  I know people who swear by it as their daily breakfast.  Yum!

review/summary: Tasty Iced Spiced Chocolate
review/text: I got the 3lb bag and the recipes on the bag call for "scoops." A scoop was not provided in my bag, but they say that 2 scoops is equivalent to about 8 tbsp. However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or "scoop." I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops/8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g/3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.<br /><br />Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it. My husband does not care much for cinnamon but he also likes it, and my children like it too. We have only tried it cold so far and are looking forward to trying it hot!

review/summary: Wonderful Hot Chocolate + another use
review/text: My husband is not a coffee drinker and the nippy mornings left him a little jealous of my warm cup of coffee.  Having just returned from a trip to Santa Fe where I had purchased it originally, I introduced him to the pleasures of morning hot chocolate.  He was hooked!!  Now for the other use, today , the day after Thanksgiving clean up we were at breakfast without any milk in the house, but an abundance of leftover decaf coffee from the celebration, his long face was brightened when I spooned in a bit of MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate into a cup of decaf.  WOW! a new taste and he loved it!<br /><br />What else can I say, it's a hit around our house.

review/summary: Gluten Free & Dairy Free Excellence!
review/text: As a family living with Celiac Disease (Gluten Intolerance) as well as Dairy/Lactose Intolerance, finding tasty hot chocolate mix that doesn't taste like tree bark and dirt (my children's descriptions for other brands we've tried)  is a challenge, until now. THIS chocolate is amazing- we mix this with hot Silk (tm) Brand Almond Milk and WOW! Even our non-Celiac friends and family love it- it is smooth, creamy, rich and delicately spiced. Just amazing and well worth the price! We LOVE it! ADDICTIVE!

review/summary: The best pre-mixed spiced hot chocolate ever!
review/text: I first tried it about seven years. Trader Joe's use to sell it in their stores and at the best price ever!  I am a hot cocoa fanatic AND I'm Mexican.  Per my qualifications, I say this is a great blend.  The ingredients are fresher than Abuelita and the sugar isn't as gritty.  I only wish I could find it wholesale.  Price is a bit steep at Amazon...<br />16 oz. (3-pack) - 34 cents/oz<br />14 oz. (4-pack) - 43 cents/oz.<br /><br />The 3-pack is the best deal (just over $1.00 per 8 oz. serving).  You can get 69 servings for $32.67.<br /><br />I have yet found a better prepared Mexican hot cocoa, seven years later.

review/summary: Yumminess.
review/text: This product is, in fact, a spiced, chocolate drink.<br /><br />It is yummy.<br /><br />It is not super-chocolatety, but it does have enough chocolate flavor to warrant it being labeled a chocolate drink.  It *is* very sugary, but what reasonable person believes that a chocolate drink should be anything other than a treat?<br /><br />I give it four stars because while very yummy, it does not send my consciousness into the higher stratosphere of the realm of pure, abstract deliciousness.  It is, however, a product I will purchase again.<br /><br />It tastes sweet, cinnamony, and chocolatey and has some other flavors I cannot identify.  I recommend it if you like or are curious about such things.

review/summary: not my cup of tea, so to speak
review/text: This product is great if you like the particular spices used in the mix.  Unfortunately, although I am drinking it, I am not enjoying it as the flavors just don't jive with my palate.  If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.

review/summary: MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate
review/text: The MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a very interesting drink. Not knowing what to expect [I speculated that the hot chocolate would have a touch of heat], I made a cup as soon as it was delivered. To my surprise, it has a strong cinnamon [and probably nutmeg] flavor - it is a good hot chocolate.<br /><br />I mix the chocolate powder with steamed/frothed milk from my espresso maker - I find this makes the drink much better. It takes a couple of cups to really make an opinion, but I think it is a good hot chocolate to drink every day.

review/summary: The best Mexican mocha powder
review/text: We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.

review/summary: Love the cocoa, not the packaging.
review/text: I found this cocoa at Bristol Farms while looking for a healthier cocoa without the partially hydrogenated oils in most of them.  I love the spiciness of this cocoa and put half a scoop in my coffee every morning.  I don't drink straight coffee so I carry this powder with me when I travel too.<br />I was thrilled to find this item on amazon after Bristol Farms ran out for a while.  I have received a few of the 25 lb boxes with no problems, but my last $113 box is in the trash after I cut the plastic tie and found baby silverfish in it.  These bags are not sealed, just have a plastic tie aroung the bag opening so lots of tiny things can crawl in.  I know we have silverfish here at my husband's house, but now that I have just thrown $100 in the trash I wonder why they can't seal these bags?  I'm going to have to start buying a smaller quantity and just pay more per ounce so this doesn't happen again.  Unless a few people are drinking this or you only have one serving a day you need to plan for storage of this powder for quite a while.

review/summary: Convenient, Good Nutrition, Good Taste
review/text: I have been using regularly the Quaker Oats "Lower Sugar" line for several years and loved the convenience and taste, but was not thrilled with the nutritional characteristics of the product.  A few months ago I became aware of the "Weight Control" line, and gave it a try.  Initially, I was uncertain about the different texture -- it is stickier probably due to the addition of whey to boost the protein content -- but after 3 or so days the texture didn't bother me.  I really like the better nutritional underpinning of this product, i.e. very little sugar, more fiber, and a lot more protein, which means it satisfies my appetite through the morning until lunch time!  My personal preference is for the Banana Bread flavor over the others.  Often I will take a small baggie of berries or even sliced bananas to mix in with the oatmeal after I've completed microwaving it.  I enjoy this every morning at the office, and occasionally at home on the weekends.

review/summary: Please bring it back!  Call or Write to Quaker Oats
review/text: Like several others, I was devastated when I no longer could find the original Banana Bread Instant Oatmeal. I cannot believe that it was not selling well. How much do you have to sell to call it a success?  Quaker had a product that was so much healthier than the sugared cereals that too many parents buy their kids, and they take away a very healthful cereal - one that a person will almost surely like immediately.  You could also add healthy fruits to it and make it an even better product for breakfast, for kids and adults.<br /><br />From someone who cannot eat cinnamon, just think of how many other cereals from Quaker have cinnamon in them!  I have a serious illness and this is one of the very few things I can eat. I need this cereal.  I hate buying a variety pack and thowing away most of it, but I have been doing that to get the 2 packets of Banana Bread cereal. I'll have to stop that however, since it is too expensive to continue buying it that way. EDITED on SEPTEMBER 16 2011- I have stopped buying the variety pack, or anything else Quaker if I can avoid it at all. I still have so much touble finding something I can eat that is healthy for me, that tastes good and that is easily digestible.<br /><br />Also, have you noticed that those two packets of Banana Bread Instant Oatmeal do not taste like the original?  They are not very good at all. Quaker changed the ingredients somehow, and either thought we could not tell the difference, or didn't care what we thought. But it is definitely different from the original, when it comes to taste. There is also less of it, since I used the same bowl for the original and for these wth the two packets, and I can tell by the amount it makes. What a ripoff they are pulling on the customer!<br /><br />I ask all of you who want this cereal to be returned to the grocery shelves, in its own box and not 2 in a variety pack, to call Quaker Oats and request this.  The number is "toll free at 1-800-FOR-OATS (1-800-367-6287)"<br /><br />EDIT on July 24, 2012.  Someone told me, in a reply to this note, that I should not waste food and should donate the packets I didn't like. I just wanted to say that I NEVER waste food- and that the packets I didn't like were given to my son and his roommate. I hope the person who must have been trying to educate me would now agree with MY choice of what to do with food I don't like.

They were available all over up until a few years ago and they suddenly disappeared.  I decided to write to Quaker and they actually responded and told me all the local supermarkets that sold the single-box banana bread flavor in the past month.  Turns out there is ONE supermarket (a Price Chopper) in my entire county that has it.  I have since stock-piled 6 boxes in my house.  Try contacting the company.  Don't pay the ridiculous price asked for on Amazon!!

review/summary: disappointed in shipping procedures
review/text: I was disappointed that eight packages of oatmeal were removed from their original sealed box and shipped loose.  I chose to pay more on Amazon as opposed to EBAY which was dramatically cheaper, because EBAY sellers specified that they removed the oatmeal packages from their original sealed box for shipping purposes. (makes the package lighter, smaller and cheaper to mail).  When it comes to purchasing food thru the mail, I prefer it in it's original sealed box.  Quality has been fine, though.
