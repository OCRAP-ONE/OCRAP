review/summary: My new favorite snack!!
review/text: I have been snacking on the crackers from this line, for a long time now, and someone suggested that I try these Sticks & Twigs. I love everything about them! I love the crunch and the texture of them, and, of course, I love the taste of them, especially with the curry flavor! They are not only delicious, but they are also very nutricious, with lots of protein and fiber in them. They make the PERFECT snack!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy snack
review/text: Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter.

review/text: I was extremely impressed with the single serve Pecan Pies. I expected a middle of the road product, thought I'd give them a try.<br />  The ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect. Pie has a rich home baked flavor, and the size is wonderful. 2-Ounces is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet. It's satisfying without being overly sweet.<br />  I will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after Thanksgiving Dinner.

review/summary: New Holiday Tradition!
review/text: My father lives 3,000 miles from me, and I used to order a pecan pie from Swiss Colony and have it shipped to him for Christmas each year. But when the item was discontinued a few years ago, I had trouble finding another company that could deliver a delicious, homemade pie that was guaranteed to be fresh when it arrived.  I gave Nell Davis a shot last Christmas, and could not have been more pleased.  I missed the deadline to guarantee the order would arrive by Christmas, but sure enough, my father was quite surprised when he got not one, but six mini-pies on Christmas Eve morning. He said they were wonderful and he gobbled down all six in one sitting! I've definitely found my new holiday pie company, thank you Nell Davis!

The crust melts in you mouth and the filling is perfect and delicious and scrumptious, The filling is not chintzy yet not too sweet. I used to make them when I was a kid with my mother for Christmas but they never came out like these.  I bet there is not one comment that is less than 5. They taste just like they look. They are beyond delicious and I  allow myself one or two a day.  If you're hesitating about how good they are, one bite and you'll know yuuuuuuuuuuum!!!!!

review/text: Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again.

review/summary: You must try this popcorn
review/text: I purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn, and it's a healthy snack.<br /><br />I 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn, having no idea what I was doing, and I have to say that no other popcorn compares. We went through the entire container. When I re-ordered, I decided to try the regular yellow popcorn, and it just wasn't the same. If I could describe the difference, I would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison. The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)<br /><br />I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.<br /><br />For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!<br /><br />NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter.

review/text: For my daughter's birthday I ordered her a Stir Crazy popcorn maker.  I was busy and knew I didn't have time to run to the grocery store.  I ordered the popcorn on line too.  We made the popcorn using organic coconut oil.  We were shocked to see almost every kernel popped.  1/2 cup and the popper was full.  The popcorn was big and fluffy.  The flavor was good.  The first time we put butter and salt on it.  The second time just salt and it was great!  We placed it in baggies and took it to the movies.  Okay - so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh, tasty, and healthy as compared to the movie theater popcorn.

review/summary: My New Favorite Popcorn
review/text: This popcorn pops up light, fluffy, and crunchy.  I have been using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn, but this is slightly less expensive and very tasty and fresh.  My popcorn method is as follows:<br />Use a Westbend Stir Crazy 6 Qt. popper.  It is the best because it gets hot quickly without smoking or burning the corn.<br />Then use 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, Flavacol to taste (I use about a teaspoon).  Put the oil and Flavacol in the popper and plug it in.  Add approximately 3/4 cup of Snappy White Popcorn.  When the popping stops enjoy a large batch of great popcorn with very little fat, and what fat there is will be monosaturated.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8LT10">Gold Medal Prod. 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt 35oz.</a>

Well the Snappy white popcorn arrived first so I tried it immediately.  I actually measured (I usually just eye-ball it) 3 T canola oil, 1/3 cup Snappy popcorn and 1/3 tsp Flavacol flavored salt.  I put the oil and Flavacol in my trusty Whirly-pop popper and swirled to distribute the Flavacol.  I then added the popcorn.  It popped REALLY quickly, snowy white and fluffy.  It was divine.  Tender, not greasy or chewy and so flavorful.  I will update this post when I try the other brands I ordered to let you know how it stacks up.  Oh, and I had ONE kernel that didn't pop!

I was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle.  Surprisingly though I had no issues with humidity effecting the corn (maybe because I'm in a dryer climate?).

review/text: I ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection-two brands.  One of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels.  No taste.<br /><br />I mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls.  I noticed that 1/3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands I have tried.  It kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine.  When using microwave poppers, you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn.  The snappy burnt kernels didn't taste as bad as other brands.<br /><br />This white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil.

review/text: These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.<br /><br />I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.<br /><br />I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good.

review/summary: quick glucose boost with no sticky pockets!
review/text: This packaging is awesome - my main annoyance with regular Jolly Ranchers is that if you keep them in your pocket, they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket. Not delicious. This packaging completely fixes all that - it's the size of a pack of gum, and the candies don't stick to anything!<br /><br />Clearly not the healthiest thing to eat, but if you're on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for 8+hours, these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and wobbly and hypoglycemic.<br /><br />Totally no nutrition in these, but they are GREAT for when you need a bit of glucose boost.

review/summary: Took some getting used to, but I love them now.
review/text: These crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they aren't like your usual chip or cracker.  Some people I've shared them with don't care for them at all, but some loved them.  I am on a raw food diet, and I use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips.  Raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you're really hungry, these will fill you up fast!  Just make sure you drink a lot of water and don't eat too many at once.  I personally liked all the flavors.  The onion was just a bit strong for some, but I thought it was ok.  Will definitely be buying again.

I am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non-food items for entertainment only. I love crunchy foods and this is great. The flavors are all good except don't like the sweet maple and cinn. flavor as much.<br />My family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet, immature taste buds is all I can say at this point. Start your babies off early and you won't have to erase habits of eating NON food for fun.

review/summary: Good for low-carbing, nice strong flavors
review/text: I got these because I'm on a low-carb, high-fat diet and was wanting something high-fiber that also packed a bunch of omega 3s. These fit the bill pretty perfectly! The flavors aren't all winners, but they're all really strongly flavored which is fantastic for a crispy snack. I like the flavors of these more than I like the flavors of potato chips, honestly.<br /><br />They don't strike me as slimy when you chew them, but your mileage may vary - I mean, yeah, the texture is a bit odd (imagine chewing a bunch of sesame seeds, similar kind of texture) and they do get stuck in your teeth, but hey - that's flax seeds for you. If you don't like (or tolerate) the texture of flaxseeds, there's nothing these crackers can really do for you.<br /><br />The flavors: My favorite is the Mexican flavor, hands-down. A close second is the hemp (rosemary! nom nom!) and the cinnamon maple (higher-carb, but only barely. Really cinnamony). I'm not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian... I love garlic, but it's just too much. The original flavor is icky, it just tastes like soy sauce and flax. Meh. I like soy sauce, but it's not really an ideal flavor for crackers! If you like Japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor.<br /><br />I think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut butters on (chocolate almond butter, almond butter, peanut butter, whatever).

review/text: I do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating, but I can't bring myself to enjoy them. I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just aren't setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. I'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend's family that are gluten free.

review/summary: Love mustard but this flavor is too mild for my taste
review/text: I loved the Foods Alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers.  When I finished my entire order of 6 bags, I decided to try the Mustard flavor since I love all mustards on almost everything.  Well...I just finished my first bag of it last night and it's ok - Organic, Crisp & fresh for sure.  But doesn't compare to the strong & powerful garlic & onion flavor.  Maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate.  But I just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you like a mild mustard & always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients & no fillers or chemicals, then this flavor is for you and I would recommend that you try it.

review/text: I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.

review/summary: Almost perfect!
review/text: This is a dual review, as it has to be.  The first part covers the delicious, needs-nothing-else China Mist iced tea varieties included in this box.  Each of 24 packets contains four ounces of the world's choicest tea leaves, with stellar flavorings mixed in (dried, crushed mango; dried, crushed passion fruit; dried, crushed raspberry; pure, strong tea).<br /><br />My first experience with it was at a restaurant where our daughter works.  She said, Order the iced tea, Dad, you won't need to put any sugar or lemon or anything into it (always looking out for my diabetes).  It was fantastic, nearly the highlight of my meal, which itself was outstanding.  I asked the manager if he could share the tea secret:  Well, we use the industry's best, China Mist!  Everybody says it's the best they've had!  Indeed.<br /><br />The flavor was, if you'll pardon me, complex and could be rated as you would a nice wine--action, hints of this or that, a new rush at the end of your taste cycle.  It made me think what I'd been missing; this tasted like what the British must drink, the full-bodied teas they enjoy.  Apparently Americans add as much extra water to our tea as we do to our coffee (What the French hear when we order a java over there:  I'll have coffee, with a cup of water on top).<br /><br />The second part of the review concerns our Hamilton Beach iced tea machine.  We add the recommend water and ice cubes, and the brewing cycle indeed does take only 10 minutes.  The tea is already ice cold.  It may be the difference between a home-level heat limit, or maybe the fact that the water is not "pressured" over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine, or maybe the commercial machines are much better insulated around the steeping container.  Our Hamilton Beach unit made a weaker tea than I would have liked; we'll reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does.  In fairness, the Bamilton Beach Iced Tea make was $22.49; commercial models are $600 or more, but they brew their stronger teas in only 8 (versus 10) minutes.  A wildly expensive two minutes.

review/summary: Great taste...pain to strain
review/text: You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you  are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.

At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale.

On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the "bad" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil.

review/summary: Have a spot of tea !
review/text: I seem to have entered my green tea "wave".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner.

review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

This product and seller gave me a good alternative. It is a fantastic product and she loves it. We use it with lemon or other infused olive oils on salad or what have you. NICE!

review/text: I am not a coffee purist...but I am addicted.  I've dabbled in the flavorings & coffee-wannabe's, and this is by far my favorite.  I usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of Vanilla Caramel Latte, just so I have an extra afternoon shot of energy.  Extra bonus - when you pour the hot water over the mixture, it hisses & purrs :)

review/text: Highly recommend this brand of coffee for the beginner and seasoned coffee drinker. I dont know how they do it, but these pre-packaged sacks can actually make 2 pots of 8-cup coffee. The flavor is slightly bold, but smooth as ever. I actually dont even like to use cream or sugar with this flavor. You can taste the flavors of butter, rum, coconut right in the cup. Smells incredible as its brewing. However, I personally use a coffee press and the flavor comes through even stronger!! Again, highly recommended, no cons, you will definitely enjoy this over the $6 tourist coffee. Plus this saves you money. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT!!!<br /><br />P.S. I also highly recommend the Almond Amaretto, Caramel Kiss, and Butter Pecan. ENJOY!

review/text: If you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted, seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value...or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam. Fortunately, neither description applies to these. They are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating. No added salt or other nuisance chemicals - just delicious and nutritious snack. Mix with raisins and/or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc/other vital nutrition or use with breads, cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe.

review/summary: Very good flavor;  extremely nutritious; worth the price
review/text: These raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which I assume indicates that they are fresh, unlike the store bought (H-E-B) raw kernels that were pretty bland. They are also extremely nutritious: high in iron, protein and fiber. Actually, pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about 25% more protein than beef per 100 gram. The price produces somewhat of a sticker shock, though, at over seven bucks per pound; however, considering all of the fiber and nutrients, I believe they are well worth the price. Bob's Red Mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site. I highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and, as you can from the facts below, are at the top of the nutrition chart.<br /><br />USDA nutrition content, Seeds, pumpkin and squash seed kernels, dried<br />Protein 33.97%<br />Fiber, total dietary 15.79%<br />Folate, food 18.13%<br />Niacin 41.56%<br />Vitamin B-6 10.21%<br />Riboflavin 13.91%<br />Thiamin 27.30%<br />Vitamin C, total ascorbic acid 2.53%<br />Vitamin A, RAE 0.16%<br />Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 18.17%<br />Calcium, Ca 5.75%<br />Iron, Fe 147.00%<br />Phosphorus, P 212.59%<br />Magnesium, Mg 169.14%<br />Copper, Cu 0.19%<br />Selenium, Se 20.89%<br />Zinc, Zn 83.09%

review/text: I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.<br /><br />I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds, and they arrived in less than 48 hours.<br />Four sealed bags were also in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box.<br /><br />I just opened one bag of the seeds to try them. They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk. These seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off-taste.<br />These have a slight pumpkin taste, which they should have. This variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties I've had, which I like (no pointy ends to stab me as I'm munching them down).<br />All in all, a great buy!<br /><br />Seeds = 5 stars<br />Grown in the USA = 5 stars<br />Total = 10 stars!
