review/text: Found some good sounding coffee and flavors but did not find the Rain Forest Nut made by Green Mountain. Was a little upset because that was one of the reasons i got this sample pack. All im saying is that the seller should take that off the list because it is discontinued. I was hoping that this seller had some left but guess not. All in all the rest of the sample is good!!!

review/text: While the coffees supplied were good, I was hoping to get a cinnamon roll coffee and got none, oh well. My only gripe is that I bought one to give as a gift and it arrived in a brown paper bag with a printed sticker label on it.  Not very good presentation for a gift. Had I known, I would have ordered something else. I thought, for the price, it should have been packaged appropriately.

review/summary: Not as advertised! Extremely Disappointed!
review/text: I ordered this sampler because it is titled Flavored K-Cup Sampler. I ended up with only 6 out of the 24 are "flavored". The rest are a limited variety of brews and roasts. To be exact, I got 3 gm pumpkin spice, 2 gm spicy eggnog, 1 van houtte french vanilla, 3 caribou blend, 3 gm columbian fair trade select, 3 gm nantucket blend, 3 newman's own special blend, 3 folgers lively columbian, and 3 gm decaf breakfast blend.  Not what I was expecting at all. I should have listened to the other negative reviews and not bought from this seller even after reading the seller's response to some of the negative feedback with promises to revise the way they fill orders. And if you are looking to give this as a gift, the cups come in a zip-loc bag, not that it mattered to me because I am using them in a gift basket. The only positive was the prompt shipping, I expected it tomorrow and it showed up a day early.

review/text: I believe that most reviewers usually balance out a product, with the naysayers usually spouting out more negative things that those happy campers.  I was a happy camper with this bag of coffee cups.  All in perfect condition.  Nice selection, some of which I never would have bought (like the Green Mountain wild blueberry, which turned out to be delightfully refreshing cup of coffee).  A lot of Green Mountain, and for me, I really like GM, so that was good.  Only positive constructive criticism, is less hazelnut (although I like it, there was an unproportional lot of them) and more of the oddball flavors, as in not just one of them, make it two or three.

review/text: I didn't notice how widely distributed the reviews for this were until I received my box. I had several varieties and flavors of coffee so judging from the most negative reviews, the seller either changed their sorting methods or I got lucky. Since this is a random assortment, you should probably expect some differences.<br /><br />If you're particular about your coffee flavors, this may not be the best option. However, if you're looking to try several brands/flavors/styles of coffee, this is a great way to do it without buying 100s of K-cups at the same time! I enjoy waking up to a different flavor of coffee every morning, so this is perfect for me and I'll continue to buy from this seller.

review/text: I was excited to try a variety of new flavors before committing to an entire box of flavored K-cups I might not like. Needless to say I'm disappointed. I should have read the reviews but neglected to do so. When they arrived, The K-Cups were in a beat-up Ziplock bag. I got two flavored coffees - one Golden French Toast, one Pumpkin spice. The rest were Columbian blends or Caribou coffee, and half of what was there was decaf. Nowhere on the description does it mention normal blends or decaf coffee. Several of the K-cups seals had been broken, so more than likely the coffee would be stale. Returning this for a refund.

I got them and they don't expire for 6-7 months! That's plenty of time to drink all of that coffee.<br />Also the packaging that is came in was good, no damaged cups.<br /><br />This package may be a little expensive, but the person who is putting all of this together needs to earn a little money for their trouble! Also, what if you spent $14-$15 on a pack of 24 of some flavor you didn't like? This sampler allows you to try ones so that the other 23 don't go to waste.<br /><br />I love this so much, I am probably going to have to order another one!

Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this "item" again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good.

review/text: I was really wary about ordering this item because of the mixed and substantially negative reviews.  I ordered anyway because it was a great price and thought I would take my chances.  What a wonderful surprise!!!  There were negative reviews concerning the packaging.  The item comes loose in a brown paper bag that has been properly packaged and boxed.  I don't see the problem.  Others posted that the selection was minimal.  That may have been their experience, but not mine.  I ordered 2 of this item (48 K-cups total) and had 21 different flavors, all name brands.  Can't imagine it getting better!!!!  I will say that what induced me to take a chance on the product was the price.  It was substantially lower than the competition.  When I received my shipment, I went back to Amazon to order 4 more and the price has more than tripled!  It is still competitive, but the urgency was eliminated with the price increase.

Of 34 k-cups, 21 were last years Holiday flavors from Green Mountain.  11 were Gingerbread, 8 Pumpkin Spice and 2 Spicy Eggnog.. Tried these flavors before and HATE all of them.  Seriously... 11 Gingerbread?? This is June...  Plus this is not a "sample" of Gingerbread... that's a box of it.  Coffee was only from Gloria Jean and Green Mountain, when I was supposed to get a "sampler pack"?

review/text: I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider "flavored" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).<br /><br />So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!<br /><br />After re-reading the product description that says "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.<br /><br />JoAn

review/summary: Disappointing, little selection, coffee wasn't great
review/text: I was disappointed with the selection here - "24 count" sampler made me think I'd be getting 24 flavors to try.  Instead it was only around 9 or 10, with a few of each.  Seemed like someone just dumped them randomly in a box.  I didn't like most of these, and the donut house coffees of "chocolate glazed donut" and "cinnamon roll" didn't taste like they were named.  If you want to try out a bunch of different coffees, I wouldn't recommend this selection.

review/summary: Okay selection...but expiring soon...
review/text: I got a pretty good selection in the box that I received...unlike others that have reviewed about theirs.<br /><br />Like others, the k-cups were just thrown in the box with only a small piece of cardboard in the there.<br /><br />The one thing that kills me is that printed on the box in bold letter is expires December 2011.  If I had known this before ordering, I probably wouldn't have gotten it. It's a little disappointing but I did get a good price on the k-cups.<br /><br />I've been able to get through quite a few of the flavors in there (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GAVAZY">Wolfgang Puck Caramel Creme</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFKGM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Vanilla Francaise</a> were quite delicious) but I feel like I'm rushing through the box to make sure I get through them all before the end of the month.<br /><br />It looks like Amazon is almost out of the boxes so hopefully if they restock this the expiration date won't be for sometime.

review/summary: Tempting treasures for coffee lovers!
review/text: I bought a Cuisinart K-cup brewer for my husband to save for his Christmas present. Unfortunately it came very quickly and the box was undisguised, arriving on one of the rare occasions when he was home and I was out! So we opened it very early and have been enjoying it for a couple of weeks. I also bought both Solofil and Ekobrew refillable cups, because  standard K-cups are both expensive and non-earth friendly. I still wanted to keep a few K-cups for emergencies and company, and was very saddened to find no real variety packs in the store. One of the Keurig "variety" packs has 4 blends inside, but they are all plain coffee, e.g. "Sumatra", "Arabica", etc, etc.<br /><br />My husband really hates flavored coffee, and I really love it, so this package was a godsend. Neither of us sweetens our coffee, so sticky-sweet creams are no good to us. Our order came in no time (sole complaint, the box was HUGE, the actual coffee package is about the size of the lunch bag)and the assortment is wonderful. I intended to save it for those special occasions or guests, but I don't think I have the willpower.<br /><br />One of the flavors was blueberry. I never would have been even tempted to purchase a blueberry-flavored coffee, but it was wonderful! I still have yet to try all the standard cinnamon, hazelnut and chocolate varieties I have, and I can only hope against hope that there is any left when-or-if company arrives!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TSHIOA">Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers ,Two Pack</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>

review/text: The box arrived ahead of schedule (overnight!). I had the product mailed to my parents on the other side of the country as a surprise. In the first 5 hours they had tried four different flavors. They divided the cups up randomly and are now trading them--"I'll give you my blueberry for your cinnamon pastry."<br /><br />My mother pointed out that these are better than having six flavors of creamer cluttering up the fridge that will expire before they're used up. The flavors were well-divided and intact when they arrived.<br /><br />I will use this company again.

review/text: I was excited when I recieved my mixed bag of coffees, pulling out many different and exciting flavors that I've never seen before like "Cherry Chip Swirl" or "Wild Mountain Blueberry". I really love the fact that you get different brands of k-cups and there was only 2 of each flavor, so I truly got an assortment rather than some of the other samplers out there that give you 4 or 8 or the same flavor. I'll surely be ordering again to see what exciting new flavors will be in my bag.

Okay, so I can see adding some decaf ones, but do the math so far, that leaves 12 Kcups left.  Of the 12 left - 6 of them were the same flavored cappacino cups. What the heck?  I get 6 flavored coffees?  I won't order Kcups again from Amazon - I don't think they get it!

I suppose that would be fine were I ordering during the winter/holiday time, but not in the middle of the summer.  The rest were pretty repeated, as well.  I wish I had counted, but I didn't - I would estimate I only got 6 DIFFERENT samples.  It was pretty disappointing and I would never order again.  As far as it coming in a paper bag: yes, it does.

review/text: Disappointing. My Wife and I picked this up hoping to sample a variety of coffee with our new Keurig, and find the flavors we liked. Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called "sampler" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors.

review/text: Yes, the description says that some of flavors may be substituted without warning due to product availability. That being said, you are still led to believe that you'll be getting a wild assortment of 34 different flavors. Instead, I got 6 butter toffees (which I already knew I don't like), 5 pumpkin spice (which are just ok from past experience), and a bunch of other 5s and 4s. Only got maybe 2-3 unique flavors in the entire box. Otherwise, it was all repeats. The posting is totally misleading, so don't order from them if you actually think you're going to get a lot of different flavors and roasts to try. If this company were above-board, they'd fix this for their dissatisfied customers and do better in the future than just raiding and repackaging Costco boxes.

review/summary: Wow- Extremely Poor Selection, 100% Green Mountain :(
review/text: In a nutshell- save yourself the upset and buy your K-cup samplers from someone else. I read reviews before ordering so I expected to get a few duplicates, but WOW. Out of all the reviews I've read I think I've gotten the shortest stick so far. ALL of the coffees in the brown paper bag were from Green Mountain, ALL of them, and of those more than half were from the Christmas and Fall 2011 samplers. It's mid May 2012 and I just got sent an order filled with multiple pumpkin spice, spicy eggnog, gingerbread coffees, Really. They also all expire in the next 30 - 60 days, and even though I buy these for my office its a hard sell that any of these guys are going to want to drink "spicy eggnog" in June in Florida- so with that said more than half of these are going to wind up in the trash. Huge let down. Luckily there are other k-cup sellers I've bought from in the past that I have been satisfied with.

Other companies who mix K Cup assortments will do a caffeinated and decaf option, you should consider this and assure your customers are receiving what you are trying to sell.<br /><br />I did, although, receive only 1 of each flavor (which was very good in terms of variety).<br /><br />***UPDATE- I e-mailed Amazon customer service to let them know of the decaf issue and they were very quick to addressing my concerns.

review/summary: I hate to say "Me, too", but...
review/text: I recently purchased my first Keurig machine, the B60 model (which is wonderful, by the way), and my machine was one of those "bonus packages" that came with a small variety sampler pack (12 k-cups). Having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already, I decided to order a variety assortment from Amazon. I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good). I hate to whine, but my morning cup is a very important part of my day! Too bad... if you like French Vanilla with a few surprises thrown in, then this assortment is for you, but not if you are looking for a true variety.

review/text: Ordered the 34 count and it was Extremely disappointing.  I expected to get at least one-two of every flavor shown on the 34 count sampler.  I would say about 24 are either Hazelnut or Vanilla.  Which are last I need since I buy Hazelnut by the 80 pack carton at BJs.  No Mudslide, no Butter Toffee, No Donut House Cinnamon Roll, No Hawaiian, No Limited Edition. No Khalua, No Cappucino, No Timothy's coffee.  This is a farce and I am so disappointed in Amazon.  I have never had a problem before but this was really a "bait and switch" as far as I am concerned.

Mine came in a small brown bag so I didnt think there was actually 24 in there, but there was! I would recommend this product to anyone!

review/summary: Not really a sampler with much variety
review/text: I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker. When I came across the "flavored Coffee Sampler" on the Amazon site, I thought it was a great way to try different brands/flavors without having to by a whole box. This was through "Deals On Call LLC. I just received the "Sampler." I am very disappointed. Don't waste your money. I got multiples of the same brand/flavor.<br />It seems like they are just getting rid of the products that don't sell. I received 2 Spicy Eggnog - in February.<br />The  K-cups I received:<br />8 Donut House (5 Chocolate Glazed Donut, 3 Cinnamon Roll)<br />9 Gloria Jeans (3 flavors)<br />6 Green Mountain and 1 Timothy's<br />I did not receive ANY Van Houtte or Wolfgang Puck<br />If I wanted mostly Vanilla, I would have ordered it. I will not be using this site again.

review/text: I like the price... but not the "variety" I got. I just got my Keurig and wanted to try a whole lot of coffees to see if there was a brand that I would like to buy in larger quantities. Unless I just LOVE Green Mountain coffee then this plan didn't quite work out. See my photo above for the actual 24 k-cups that I received. They were tossed into a brown paper bag and sealed with a sticker. They were placed into a cardboard box. None were damaged and it got here quickly.

review/summary: Ordered 24, received 23
review/text: Orders have always arrived on time. I've ordered the 24-count "variety pack" a few times now. I was a bit suspect the first time when they arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled at the top, with a printed bar code on it. I don't know why, but that was more acceptable to me than the 1-gallon ziplock bag of K-cups I received this time - this time with only 23 K-cups in it, not the 24 I paid for. I suppose you could say that the ziplock will keep the coffee "fresher", but even the manufacturers ship K-cups in cardboard boxes since cups are already sealed. I realize this company/person probably purchased many individual flavors of coffee and is creating a hand-made mix of all of them to create the variety pack that doesn't really exist. But after this last purchase I think I'm done. I actually care less about receiving 23 instead of 24 cups, although nobody likes to get less than they paid for. It's the minimalist packaging and "made in my basement" look of the packaging that has done it for me.

review/text: I love the idea of being able to buy different flavors from different companies.  However, this mix was more expensive than those purchased with bed bath and beyond coupon and my box included a lot of holiday flavors which are on sale now anyway.  I would not have purchased the mix if I knew they were included as I could have bought a sampler box of these flavors from my local store.  I hope the company adds more variety without using sampler mixes.

If I can figure out how to post pictures, I will.<br /><br />All of the petit fours with white coating taste the same.  All of the chocolate ones taste the same, too, but slightly different from the white ones.

They were very helpful and detailed in telling me what I needed to do to receive a replacement.  Unfortunately, when the replacement plant arrived, my niece said that it was in worse shape than the first one!!!!  She said that there were three leaves that were yellow; one was about to fall off.  She tried to nurse it back to health, however, after she told me the condition it was in, I immediately contacted Amazon for a refund.  Why spend money to buy a sick plant!!!

review/text: I ordered the 7 stalk curly bamboo arrangement as a get well present for my father in the hospital. I am very disapointed in this product. It didnt look anything like the picutre! It was considerably smaller than what is pictured and the bamboo stalks were misshapen and yellowed. The Stalks are all clumped together and lean heavy to one side. The roots (what little roots there were)were bound so tightly i had to soak away wet paper(that looked like wet toilet paper) that they used to keep the roots moist. I doubt the poor little thing will live. It was packed in packing peanuts but shifted during transit and crushed all of the leaves on one side, even ripped a few off. The two pieces of curly bamboo look terrible, and are intertwined so tightly with each other it just looks like one stalk. This looks nothing like what i expected from the picture. I paid 30 bucks for this! what a waste.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I wanted to make a playable Angry Birds cake for my son's birthday.  After hours of surfing the net to find figurines, not finding them, and then surfing for fondant to make them myself, I decided to try fondarific and couldn't have been happier with my choice.  Here is my review of the product after making the figurines.  (I posted pictures of them as a customer image so you could see the results.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />* This stuff tastes great!  The vanilla tastes like a homemade marshmallow fondant (you can find recipes on the web) but is much easier to work with.  I also bought some of the Melon flavor to make the pigs and it tastes just like honeydew melons, well, just like a honeydew flavored Jelly Belly would taste.<br />* Amazingly easy to work with.  It is hard out of the tub, so I used a semi-sharp knife to cut off a chunk.  Then just fold and squish a few times and it is as pliable as fresh Playdough.  If it gets to soft, just stick it in the fridge for a while to harden.<br />* Takes color well.  I used Ateco gel food colors, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1C6">Ateco 1112 12-Color Food Coloring Kit</a>, and got great results, even with the black.<br />* Holds its shape.  I wanted to be sure I could pull this off, so I made one pig three weeks ago.  Then I let it just sit there for three weeks.  It still looked great.  Held its color and shape and even stayed glossy.  I would have included a picture of it, buy my 1-year-old found it on the counter and smushed it today.<br />* Doesn't go bad.  Three weeks sitting out and I could still reshape and use fondarific (not that I'd eat it after letting it sit out in the open for that long).  When the company says it's good for a year after purchase, I believe it.  I had a bunch left over.  I'll probably end up using it on next year's birthday cake.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Fondarific will not harden if you leave it out to dry.  You have to add tylose powder to get hard figurines.  I didn't add tylose because, well, they are angry birds.  I figured I was better of if they stayed a little soft since there is a high likely-hood my son's will end up throwing these birds at each other, or at me. :)<br />* Fondarific is a bit pricier than making it yourself...but not much.  By the time you've purchased a pound of marshmallows, two pounds of powdered sugar, and some shortening, I think the added expense for fondarific is worth it.  I know, this is supposed to be a con. I'll admit I'm biased at this point.<br /><br />Note:<br />Not that anyone would think it, but I'm not a professional cake decorator or figurine maker.  The angry birds figurines I made were my FIRST attempt at making fondant figurines.  I did watch some instructional videos on the web, but it's essentially like sculpturing with Play Dough.  I did try to make marshmallow fondant for last years birthday cake, and I would never have been able to make figurines out of that stuff.<br /><br />So, there you have it, my honest opinion of fondarific.  I would definitely purchase this again (not that I plan on making another Angry Birds cake any time soon).
