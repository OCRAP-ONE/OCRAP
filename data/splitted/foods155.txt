review/summary: Recipe changed with no warning - packaging pictured is out of date
review/text: My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.

review/summary: Yucky!
review/text: My son loves all of the Happy Baby meals he's tried except for this one. He literally gagged. I think it was the use of peppers in the recipe, as he's not been exposed to peppers yet. He is clearly not a fan so be careful if your child hasn't tried peppers yet...they may not like this one.

review/summary: Original Recipe was better.....baby no longer likes
review/text: Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!

review/summary: Thumbs down for the new ingredient
review/text: I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!

review/summary: kid LOVES these things!
review/text: My baby is 7 months old and maybe wasn't as ready for these biscuits as I imagined. He's got 2 bottom teeth and is very able to get chunks off these biscuits! The pieces take a long time to dissolve/break down in his mouth, but he handles it better than I would expect and he can't wait to dive in for more. He has tasted a wide variety of foods and I've never seen him get so excited about any of them. He LOVES Belle's Blueberry teething biscuits - especially after they've been in the freezer for a bit. Even though I have to watch him closely, they're exactly the cure for little man's teething pains!

review/text: If you are looking for something with spice that kids will like, this one is it. Mine never eat spicy food, but they liked this. It is easy to prepare, just follow the box. And stir every few minutes so the bottom doesn't get stuck or burnt. A pound of chicken sounded like alot, but it is needed to balance out the seasoning. I tried it with less chicken but it was not as good.<br /><br />Just add your own chicken and water. I skipped the butter as the chicken had just enough of its own fat.

review/summary: Great Tasting Black Raspberry Preserves
review/text: This is one of the best tasting black raspberry preserves that actually  have seeds. it is so hard to find real black raspberry preserves that have not been stripped down to a watery seedless jam that seems to be so prevalent nowadays. even some of the so called preserves that state whole fruit on amazon site are seedless and do not state it. Preserves have the whole fruit and seeds in general. otherwise it is a jam or jelly. so if your looking for the real taste of how black raspberry preserves should taste with seeds in it. this is a great tasty product. If you want seedless I recommend Clearbrook Farms on Amazon. But the best is Blue Ridge or St. Dalfour all available on amazon.

review/summary: We really couldn't be happier and now our Cusinart is in retirement...
review/text: My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website.

review/summary: Good machine but kind of  a rip off.
review/text: This is a great Coffee/Tea/Hot Water Maker. It Heats the water very quickly, brews very quickly, and its very easy to clean. The only problem I have with it is the price of the "K-Cups". At Sams Club you can buy them in packs of 80 for $36.  This is a great deal compared to Walmart (Which was a pack of 16 for $12.)but that's still $0.45 per cup. If you were to drink 1 cup of coffee every day, for a year, it would cost you about $165. On the other hand, the same amount of Folgers canned coffee would cost you about $10.6 per year at $0.2 per 6 ounce serving. And of course that would be even less if you went with an off brand coffee. So overall the Keurig is a good machine, and a good deal if you use the reusable filter. This is what I will be using most of the time because of the price of k-cups. Until they sell 1800 k -cups for $36 (the price of 80 cups at sam's) they just aren't worth it. So If you decide to buy this machine I DEFINITELY recommend the reusable k cup.

review/text: It came adequately packaged. Lots of padding to protect it during shipping. Getting it out of the box and setting it up for first time use was not a problem.<br /><br />I've been wanting to get of these since I used one at a doctors lounge. It's very convenient and makes very good coffee.<br /><br />I thought of getting the CBTL Contata or Kaldi because they had a 220 volt version but they are both "plasticky" compared to this. The selection of capsules was limited compared to the number of K-cups.<br /><br />If you're buying it for overseas use, please make sure you get a stepdown transformer appropriate for 2000 to 3000 watts even though the unit is rated at 1400 watts.<br /><br />This is easy to clean, requires minimal maintenance and is easy to learn how to use. I have 2 of these, one in the office and at home.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's just me but I think the reservoir needs to be a bit bigger. I've been refilling it quite often.

The product it brews is standard and is always good.<br /><br />It just seems a little bit wasteful to have to throw away a k-cup after every use.  Sure, there are refillable k-cups, but all of the packaging/plastic from the standard k-cups seems silly.  Does it really take that much less time than it takes to brew a standard pot of coffee?

review/summary: Not for adults!  This Keurig is the B-44 Classic for those of you wondering.
review/text: My wife's shop has a Keurig in her shop and she loved it.  She wanted to buy one and only went off visuals.  (It's black and had two cup sizes)  So to my happiness I found it on Amazon.  A taken aback was I after two weeks of backorder I finaly use at home.  In the instructions it says this is Keurig Classic B44.  Brews two cup sizes  SMALL AND SMALLER.  7.25 oz and 5.25 oz respectively.  So, it is great if you want to have tea with your imaginary friends and plastic Barbie china ware.  Not so great if you need it for your morning cup of Jose. Heck fire, it will not even fill up a normal sized travel mug / coffee cup.  I WOULD RECOMEND THE KEURIG ELITE B40 FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO HAVE THEIR COFFEE CLOSER TO AMERICAN PROPORTIONS.  The B40 will brew 10.25 oz.<br /><br />This Classic B44 is a waste of K Cups; I will not reccomend to anyone other than for tea conasewers.  At least Amazon steeped up to the plate and gave me a gift card refund so I can purchase the correct one.  Thanks Amazon!  Boo Keurig Classic (thumbs down).

review/text: I bought this Keurig after I had coffee at my sister's house. The coffee maker I was using at home was your standard traditional one but I found that I kept wasting coffee and then the grounds would go stale. It wasn't a right fit maker for me. So, I bought this Keurig. The machine seems to take a longer time than my sister's (whose was more expensive) but it's fine. The reservoir on the left is handy because it means you don't have to fill up water every time you make a cup. I find that I need two Keurig cups for a full large mug full of coffee but I knew that going in. All in all, if you drink the occasional cup, or want a variety of flavors, I would recommend this one to you.

review/summary: QUALITY COMPANY
review/text: My hubby wanted a Keurig because they had the nice big industrial ones in Iraq, I asked him who bought it, he told me that Keurig sent them a ton of free Keurigs, and they sent them a bunch of boxes of coffee, enough to cover hundreds of soldiers at a fob for 2 rotations, to many fobs. With so many crap companies, with crap customer support, most of them don't stand behind their own products, and this company does more than that, just thought this might make a difference to some people debating buying one of these.

review/summary: Don't buy this one!
review/text: I bought this brewer because we have one at work that is awesome.  This one doesn't brew a large enough cup of coffee.  It fills your cup up about to the 1/2 or less mark.  The K Cups are too expensive to just get 1/2 cup of coffee!  The taste of the coffee in this one is kind of a chemical taste.  Not a good cup of coffee at all.  Very dissapointed.  Now they tell me this is an item that can't be returned either.  Ughhh!!

review/summary: Only works properly for about 3 weeks
review/text: I was excited to receive this coffee maker as a Christmas gift.  But after three weeks of use (1-2 cups per day), it started brewing partial cups.  I followed the troubleshooting instructions to get it working again, but now I find that after 4-5 cups brewed, it will brew a partial cup (about 4 oz), and quit with an error. This is very disappointing, not to mention the waste of a number of K-Cups.<br /><br />Based on other low ratings and comments, it looks like this model line has design problems.

review/summary: VERY DISAPPOINTING
review/text: We have this model about a year now.  It hasn't worked right from the beginning.  We often had trouble closing the top.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.

review/summary: Yeah for Keurig, Square Trade, and Green Mountain.com
review/text: My first Keurig was purchased in January 2011 from Macy's.  It died on 4/29/12.  It worked that morning but later in the day the power light was out and nothing we did to try and revive it worked.  I was disappointed that the unit died after only 15 months, but it was on 16 hours or more per day and had worked perfectly up until its sudden demise. I never had any problems with the prime as some people have reported and can only hope my next unit will work as well.<br /><br />Because I had heard of Keurigs failing just after the warranty, I had purchased a 3 year warranty for it from Square Trade.  It's an online company that provides reasonably priced warranties for a wide variety of products.  I contacted them the day the unit failed and received an email with an Amazon gift card number within 24 hours of my contact.  The card included a 5% promotional credit from their partnership with Amazon so it was actually a little more than I paid for the first unit.  My next Keurig will arrive 5/3/12. (Note:  I did have to ship them the burned out unit but they provide the shipping costs via a UPS shipping label.  The hard part was getting a big enough box and enough packing materials so that cost me a little over $5. Next time I'll keep the box.)<br /><br />I have read good things about Keurig customer service and their replacing brewers out of warranty due to priming problems, but since I already had this warranty and it wasn't a priming problem, I didn't contact Keurig.  They might have been helpful too - I don't know.<br /><br />Before I knew Square Trade would come through so quickly, we went to the store and bought a Mr. Coffee brewer for $79.00.  Our intent is just to use it until the new Keurig comes and then put it in our travel trailer for weekend trips (instead of taking the Keurig with us).  While the Mr. Coffee is quieter, it takes much longer to heat the water and we have yet to get rid of an odd after taste from it.  I'm going to run vinegar through it to see if that helps but so far it is rather disappointing.<br /><br />Another side note:  I buy my coffee from Green Mountain.com online.  If you join their club you get a pretty decent discount and they sell 24 pack product, not the 18 that you buy in the store.  If you join the club (automatic shipments) and order 4 or more at a time they pay the shipping. You can set the interval at the number of weeks that is right for you and it's easy to change if your circumstances change.  Recently they included free samples (a full 24 cup box) of their hot apple cider.  That wouldn't happen at the grocery store.<br /><br />In summary, I love my Keurig.  Being without it for a few days has really made me realize how much I love it.  Is it more expensive than a pot of brewed coffee - yes.  But to me it is well worth it.  I will buy another Square Trade warranty though - just to be safe.<br /><br />Addendum 5/3/12.  My new unit came today.  I had ordered the Classic (B44) because I could get Prime Shipping.  I mistakenly thought it was the same as the Elite (B40).  It's not.  The cup sizes are smaller.  You have two choices, but the larger one is only 7.25 oz, not 9.25 like the Elite.  That was a huge disappointment.  They don't show the cup sizes in either of the write-ups on Amazon and it's not easy to find in writing anyplace.  Because I can't return it, we're going to put this one in the trailer, return the Mr. Coffee to the store (still tastes funny after 3 days including a white vinegar cleaning) and get the Elite 40 for home use.  Live and learn.

review/summary: Mid-Line Keurig Model
review/text: Even though the product description states that this machine has three cup sizes, it has only two, and the largest is not as large as the mug-size on the top-of-the-line Keurig models.  This model fits right in the middle of Keurig machines:  it has the reservoir that the Mini Brewer lacks and yet is not as expensive as the top of the line machines.<br /><br />Since we also have the B60 model (I bought this for my daughter to use), I can tell you that the difference between the two models is small but significant:<br /><br />1. This one only brews the smallest and the mid-size cups.  If you want the large size, you can brew a mid-size cup, lift the arm, put it back down, and brew a small size through the same pod.  (It's about the same amount of water that goes through a single pod when brewing the largest size on the B60.)<br /><br />2. The construction isn't as heavy-duty as the B60's, although it's good enough, in my opinion.<br /><br />3. It doesn't look quite as nice as the B60 because it lacks the stainless drip grate and the silver accents.<br /><br />4. It takes a little longer to heat the water.<br /><br />In general, this is just a stripped down version of the B60 which makes it more affordable.  The coffee is just as good.  Because we bought a Keurig Mini Brewer for my husband's office, I realized that the reservoir is an important feature to have because otherwise it takes a lot longer to brew a single cup.  This machine has some of the strengths found in the best of the Keurig machines but at a more moderate price.  When comparing prices, keep in mind that some models found in stores offer extras such as a coffee sample pack or filter.  This one -- at least as I bought it -- contains nothing extra.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

I just do not understand the 6 oz and 8 oz cups because the coffee does not come out to the full amount.  This is a problem and I do not understand why this is happening?  If I put it on the 8 oz it comes to a half a cup not the full size.

review/summary: Happy with it, but remember to DESCALE the unit!
review/text: I have had this model for a little over a year and am quite happy with it.  It functions well and like any Keurig product is easy to use.  I purchased the ecobrew filters since I prefer to grind my own coffee and it is far less expensive.  Recently however I was getting very little water despite pushing the button for the larger cup.  I had not descaled my machine as I only use water that has come through the Zero Water filter system and the fact that the descale light never came on.  I decided to descale anyway and after I did it is back to its normal performance level.  Lesson learned - DESCALE AS RECOMMENDED EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON!

For the holidays, it was so perfect - my daughter's made espresso for their lattes, my husband his Breakfast Brew, my teens made hot chocolate, and I had several cups of decaf hazelnut. It's so quick and easy, the whole family loves it!  It's great for making tea too!  Two small cups make a full mug, and one large cup leaves just enough room to add Bailey's. :)

review/summary: Hot, Perfect Tea, Anyone?
review/text: I ordered this lovely machine for myself for Christmas after getting very tired of endless teabags sitting in cups all over my house. I thought, wow, wouldn't it be great to have a wonderful, strong cup of tea without fishing out tea bags all the time, and getting some strong, some weak cups of tea? With the Keurig, I have perfect hot tea, herbal and black and green, on-demand and at a perfect, strong strength.<br /><br />I have to admit, I knew Keurig did great coffee, but tea? I thought that, normally having to brew longer, tea might not be all that great in this kind of machine. I was happily proven wrong.<br /><br />One trick to getting the most out of your tea K-cup? It won't tell you this in the directions, but each cup fill-up is triggered by lifting the handle up and then down. So, I pop my tea cup in there, get the first large, strong cup, then I lift the handle (same cup in there) and lower it, then press the smaller cup and fill up my mug more. And I even tried getting another cup out of the same K-cup! Tea seems to go really far.<br /><br />For coffee, I tried one large then one small out of the same K-cup. Works great and I get a larger amount for my giant latte-sized mugs.<br /><br />I can also make a great, fast cup of low-cal hot chocolate by popping my powdered mix into the mug, leaving out a K-cup, and just using the machine to put out hot water on-demand. Sure beats having to mess with a microwave or traditional teapot.<br /><br />I also got the EKObrew manually refillable K-cup, so I can use loose tea and coffee when I want.<br /><br />The machine itself it quick to warm up, heat the water, and stay in the ready mode. I know people who leave their "power" button on 24/7, but I think this might wear the machine out faster, plus waste electricity. I turn mine off when I'm done because it really doesn't take but a few seconds to get the water hot and ready to go again.<br /><br />This particular model is fairly large on the counter due to the generous water reservoir, so allow some room for its depth. Fits great under the standard height cupboard space due to the smart handle design not needing much vertical room to open up.<br /><br />Noise includes normal water-heating and filling sounds, so nothing surprising there.<br /><br />All in all, a great, convenient, time-saving machine.

review/summary: Reliable, but maybe not so versatile
review/text: I use this only for coffee. It works great -- reasonably fast. It isn't cheap per cup, but since I'm the only person in the house who drinks coffee, it's a reasonable solution.<br /><br />However, having used it for coffee a few times, I then tried one of the tea packets that came with it. It tasted like ... coffee.<br /><br />I've tried cleaning the brewing unit thoroughly -- flakes of coffee end up in all sorts of nooks and crannies -- and running plain water through it over and over. Didn't help; still a definite coffee taste to the tea.<br /><br />I suspect that attacking it with an even deeper cleaning would help, but I can't see doing that every time I want to try it for tea -- and I certainly wouldn't want to try it with the other packets available, like cider.<br /><br />So, if you just want to use it for one type of drink, it's great.

review/summary: Quality is going down
review/text: I'm on my third one, the price has dropped over the years but I also fear the quality has too. Must be made in China.  I bought this new one only 3 months ago and while it was cheaper than the past 2 I owned it is now failing. I think the "Microprocessor Controlled Technology" that "maintains water at the perfect brewing temperature " has failed? Who knows? it works 1/2 the time now, the other half it won't deliver any water. Next week I'll bet I'll be looking for a new one. Bottom line: If you only make 1 cup of coffee a day I'm sure they will last forever but apparently they are not built strong enough to withstand heavy use.

Trust me, I tried.<br /><br />Other than the small sizes I like my Keurig.  So I can't blame the machine because it is what it is.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: Decided to buy one after using at my uncle's house. Absolutely love it except for the cup size. The larger mug option doesn't fill up a travel cup. I have to brew one cup of the larger and then one cup of the smaller for the travel cup to fill up. I use the same k cup and the coffee to water ratio is perfect for me. I also bought the reusable cups for the machine but find that they don't work very well and tend to waste coffee. It doesn't brew a strong enough cup. Maybe I have not perfected the grinds. I'll stick to my press for the weekend and k cups for the weekday. I love how quickly it brews and the temperature is perfect.  I do wish the resevoir was larger though. It is a pain in the butt having to refill constantly. You do have to run it a few times when first using as the other reviews say. There is a strong plastic smell that took about 5 brews to get rid of.

I have tried several Kcups, and you can find the one thats right for you with so many options on the market. I will say this: When you first buy it, it will smell funny after you turn it on. The heating element takes a little time and gives off that smell. The book states to run one cup water through before using. I did it several times throught a couple hr period, and the smell went away. I wouldnt brew until the smell was gone, after my friend said hers tasted funny in the first few cups. I did not!

This particular model JUST fits under my cabinets in my kitchen.  It's so convenient and quick.  I don't like being so wasteful with the k-cups, so I bought an Eco Cup that works well.  My only complaint is that even the large size doesn't fill an entire coffee mug, and I sometimes wish it dispensed more coffee.  That being said, it really is so easy to use, and I don't regret buying this for a second.

review/summary: Love this coffee maker!
review/text: My husband bought this for us for an early Christmas. We have been using it for about a month and we love it. It makes a strong, hot cup every time, which is a huge improvement over our standard pot of coffee maker. I was a little worried about the cost of each cup, but if you shop around and check the price per cup you can save a lot of money. Costco seems to be the best deal, but you need to buy 80 cups at a time. This is not an issue for us because we drink a lot of coffee. We bought a sampler box at Sears and that gave us an idea of what we like. I also bought 2 EkoBrew reusable k-cups (the reviews on the Keurig reusable cups were not good) so that we have the option of using up our bulk coffee. The water is easy to refill, no spills. I empty the leftover coffee from each k-cup into a container and then use that as fertilizer in my plants. We also just discovered k-cups at Costco from the SF Bay company which don't have the plastic bottom, just  the filter which reduces the plastic going into landfill. Plus they were only $25.99 for 80 cups (.37 per cup!). Great company, tasty coffee. Highly recommend this coffee maker!

I thought single serve would be better than it is. I like the concept of a diverse coffee selection just for you, when you want it. I was disappointed with the plastic after taste and smell as well as watery flavor. the k cups do not have instruction of cup size. Not a good experience for me. keurig has discussed on their site that they are working on an alternate packaging that would also be recyclable. Until then I'll make it in the pot.

review/summary: Great product, great cup of coffee, everytime!
review/text: I first used the Keurig machine at work and quickly became hooked.  When leaving my last job I was given a home brewer as a parting gift by my co-workers.  I was thrilled to have one at home as I usually drink coffee at home only on weekends. Before I was always brewing a larger pot than I needed and throwing a lot out, or drinking more than I really wanted so as not to waste it.  Even though the K-cups are more expensive, just knowing I can make one cup of great coffee anytime the mood strikes is great! Sometimes I want one cup after dinner and this is perfect!  I've read some of these reviews talking about the cup sizes; if I select the large cup serving, it almost runs out of a regular/medium cup,especially if I pre-add a little half & half.  I feel the taste is always consistent.  I like the Donut Shop for mornings and the Tully's Kona Blend for the evenings.  I just purchased the Ekobrew and am anxious to try it this weekend.  I'll have to go back to the store and buy beans again!!

review/summary: Very poorly made  bad design
review/text: Nothing else matters, the engineering on this thing will fail, and soon.  No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew.<br />Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere.<br />Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed.

review/summary: HUGE savings if you don't use K-cups
review/text: My family uses the refillable baskets to make coffee in our Keurig Home Brewer. I found the K-cups weak and expensive and suspect most of them use dye to make the product look more like coffee.<br /><br />After about a year of heavy use, my $99.00 Keurig Home Brewer died and we decided it was crap. In the week since returning to our old drip pot methods, my family has gone through almost three times the coffee we were using with the home Keurig. I also miss the flavor of the machine's coffee. It turns out that steaming pressure gets more out of the beans than traditional coffee makers.<br /><br />At $10.00 a pound (we live in the Caribbean) for coffee, I reckon a new Keurig will pay for itself in TWO MONTHS.<br /><br />This morning's early trip to the store because we're no longer used to buying so much coffee prompted me to do the math and decide that I'll just keep ordering these coffeemakers and hope that soon, a more reliable model comes along.

review/summary: Good brewer...still a little bit pricey...
review/text: Good value and features for the price.<br /><br />Quickly warms up and has an auto turn off option after 2 hours.<br /><br />Tank is big enough that you can brew several cups of coffee before refilling.<br /><br />Only gives 2 brew sizes, but you can add water to your cup if you want to make larger brews.  Water is very hot, so some room temp water does not make a difference in the taste.<br /><br />Quiet when brewing and the removable tray makes it easy to use tall cups with their ice brew teas.<br /><br />Would be five stars if had more brew size options...which you can get if you spend more $$$$.<br /><br />..and...the K Cup patent runs out this September, so the cost of coffee per cup should drop this year!

review/summary: What a great gift idea.
review/text: I received this as a gift for Mother's Day. Had been looking at them but hadn't decided to purchase yet. I highly recommend this coffee maker. You can do two sizes and with the assortment of different K-cups available you could make a different type of coffee everyday. It is faster than I could have expected and the coffee is very good too. It was the perfect gift and I will enjoy it for years to come I am sure.

review/summary: When you're not in the mood for a full pot
review/text: Single cup brewers seem to be the wave of the home coffee making future. And nobody seems to do it better than Keurig. This machine is simple to operate, requires very little cleaning, and just brews a very good cup of coffee. And with the plethora of K-Cup options out there (teas, hot chocolates, etc.) your hot beverages options are next to limitless. This unit doesn't include any K-cups, so just make sure to order some along with it, or look at the EkoBrew reusable K-Cup as an option (see my other reviews).

review/text: I expected a quality product and got it. I also purchased an adapter that allows me to use loose coffee and tea, I have even used coffee pods in the adapter that I had on hand from my previous brewer. Having this ability adds both flexibility and a lower cost alternative to the more expensive prefilled cups. I use both and am happy with the results.

review/summary: Wonderful machine.
review/text: The Keurig brews excellent coffee, is economical, and saves energy at the same time because one is not making a pot of coffee in order to get one or two cups of coffee.  I would make 4 cups of coffee and often wind up throwing away half.  Now I have two cups of caffeinated coffee, a couple cups of decaffeinated,  a cup or two of tea (either made with a pod or a tea bag--yes you can get just a cup of piping hot water for your tea), and hot chocolate.  It takes less than a minute to brew a cup of coffee; just enough time to go to the fridge and get the cream or milk.  We have started to use the 'eKobrew' pods, which makes it possible to make our own  blends and we do not have a little plastic pod to throw away.

review/summary: Good for the Basic Coffee Drinkers
review/text: I got this Keurig for my mom as a christmas gift. I picked it initially because it was one of the more affordable, nicer ones. From what I can see its, great! it makes coffee almost instantly. The only thing I noticed is this Keurig is made cheaper than the more expensive ones, for example I own the 179.99 Keurig and the handle and base are made out of metal while this one's handle and base are made out of plastic. Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it. Basically what i'm trying to say is for someone like me whose a mild coffee drinker its great! But for someone who drinks coffee more often you might want to spring for one of the more expensive ones that allow you to be specific on different settings such as cup size and temperature.

review/text: We purchased this Keurig for our daughter-in-law.  We have owned our Keurig for about 4 years.  It has been great up until the past few weeks.  Our pump is acting very funny, sometimes pumping out a full cup and other times just a half cup.  We have used ours hard for about 4 years i.e. 10 cups per day average.  I guess we will have to invest in another Keurig.  I have had Mr. Coffees for years without any problem, but love the ease of brewing one cup at a time and never wasting a whole pot.

This Special Edition features chrome accents, a blue-backlit LCD and three brew size options. Programmable features include a digital clock, adjustable temperature, and auto on/off. The 48-oz. removable water reservoir holds up to eight cups before refilling, and the removable drip tray allows for easy cleaning and the use of travel mugs. # Convenient single-cup brewing # Includes 12-count K-Cup variety pack # Fast and easy with no mess # 3 cup-size options (6, 8, and 10 ounces) # Removable 48-oz. reservoir # Programmable LCD message center # Blue backlit LCD and reservoir # Stylish chrome accents"<br /><br />I'm not sure if anyone else picked up on this but the description is for the "better quality" Keurig model. No chrome, no backlit LCD, no programmable features and it only has two brew sizes not one. When I ordered this I knew which product I was getting based on the picture but others might be a bit disappointed. Something you might want to fix Amazon!<br /><br />I can't review the actual product as I haven't tried it yet. Update soon.

review/summary: Update: Don't love it so much anymore
review/text: Exactly what I wanted. My parents have an upgraded version, but I'm perfectly content with this mid-range unit.<br /><br />One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use - it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.<br /><br />I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!<br /><br />UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their "fix.") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded "half cup" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better - like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am.

review/summary: Short-cupping due to faulty design-
review/text: These machines are prone to not pumping water and "short-cupping" (delivering too little water into the cup. Keurig likes to tell people they need to descale because that means its a user problem and not a design problem. But using distilled water won't prevent the problem. If it did, a lot of us would be happier--not thrilled but happier. You need to read thru all the comments to understand the prob. Keurig has changed the pumps in their design at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps; it's the valves.<br /><br />The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a goo whack on the bottom. Really this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for.<br /><br />More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal. I can believe they are overwhelmed with returns, but that's the cost of business when you sell a bad design, keep selling it, keep insisting it's just scale build-up, keep refusing to continue selling the product. They should have had full recall or refund for its customers.

review/summary: Great coffee machine, wish it had more sizes
review/text: This is the first coffee machine that I've owned and wasn't dragged over by a family member.  I do enjoy it and have been using it since I got it without any of the issues that I've seen in the reviews here like the scaling problem.  I do pretty much only use water run through a filter in it, I felt the need to say that.  The unit works like a charm, my only complaint is that I wish this model gave you more control over the size of the cup, instead of the strength.  It makes about 3/4 a cup or just under, and it's always a crapshoot if I'm filling a travel mug.  Other than that, I love it and would recommend this as an entry level coffee maker.

review/text: I've had my Keurig for about 8 months now.  I've loved having it every day.  My husband gave up coffee, so coffee for one in a traditional coffee maker made for a lot of waste.  OR, I would drink way too much of it!  I love how the coffee turns out, I have variety in the house and can choose which flavor fits my mood.  Mine has never needed to be  descaled, but I try and put filtered water in the reservoir so I don't have to descale it.  It says it needs 4 minutes of priming before brewing, but I've found it's much quicker.  In less than 4 minutes I've got a piping hot cup of coffee, and all I needed to do was push two buttons and insert the coffee pack.  Easy peasy!  I would recommend this Keurig to everyone!  It's durable and efficient!

I'm so satisfied I think I will buy a Keurig Mini to use at work!!<br /><br />If I had something negative to say, it would be the choice of cup sizes. If I want to fill a travel mug, I have to brew two cups, one large and one small cup. But otherwise, I'm completely sold to this product. Sure, I would like the k-cups to be less expensive, but if you buy them on the internet instead of the grocery store, you can save a lot. Also, you can buy a reusable plastic k-cup to brew your own coffee. I would recommend this machine to any coffee lover :)

review/summary: Keurig Coffee brewer
review/text: Have only had this product for a month, but so far am very happy with it.  It appears to be very durable and is fast.  I wish it had a setting for a larger cup but it is fast enough to brew one of their mug settings followed by one cup setting.

review/summary: Quick coffee by Keurig
review/text: A friend offered us a cup of decaf after we had been out to dinner with him and his wife.  We accepted and enjoyed the coffee made with a Keurig very much.  My wife said to me "your birthday is coming up, would you like one of those"?<br />I looked the product up on the Amazon website and placed the order in just a couple of days.<br />I received an early birthday present and we really like it.<br />Today, I received a K-Cup reusable coffee filter from another Amazon order that I placed just about two days ago.

review/summary: great tasting coffee and great for single coffee drinker households
review/text: First, I found this product for about $80-90 through dealnews.com (I think I bought it at newegg.com) and I've seen it for similar prices when on sale and even less than what I purchased it for at the time.  I love this unit.  It is soooo much better than coffee maker coffee and very easy and fool-proof.  It is expensive to buy k-cups, but cheaper than buying coffee at DD or somewhere else (saves on time too).  Plus I am going to try to get the reusable k-cups to make it cheaper and more friendly to the environment.  I do like how you can select either a small or large cup with this unit and I like how the water tank is dishwasher safe.  I wouldn't get anything smaller than this unit because you will be filling up the water tank constantly even with a single user household like mine.  I would say I get about 4-5 cups from this unit until having to refill.

review/summary: Amazing coffee maker!
review/text: I have a different Keurig model at home and I absolutely love it. I would always make myself a cup of coffee first thing in in the morning and bring it with me to work.<br /><br />When I saw this model in a store, on sale for $80 I could not resist the temptation to buy one. I have kept this model at my desk for about a year and have zero regrets. Makes the perfect cup of coffee every time, and I get it fresh no matter when I want it.

review/summary: My favorite appliance
review/text: I love this coffee maker with all my heart. It's fast, convenient, neat, and it makes a pretty decent cup. I do recommend buying the more robust flavors for brewing on the large size--especially if you take milk or cream with your coffee. Also, about 6 months after purchase, I started having trouble with the hinges sticking whenever I tried to open or close it to put a new K-cup in. But I coated the hinges with some food-grade lubricant and have not had a problem since.<br /><br />Yes, it's pricey, and yes, the coffee doesn't come cheap, but my caffeine-addicted family has eliminated leftover waste completely. It's been great for having company over, too. Instead of brewing multiple pots for caf, de-caf, flavored, etc., I now take orders from guests.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I purchased the B40 model and after using it for about 3 days, I must say I am loving this machine. I was a bit weary with the two cup settings and the strength of the coffee, but honestly, there's been no real issue. Some k-cups will brew lighter than others and should not be used with the 10 oz setting. However, I have found that the extra bold flavors work well with the 10 oz setting, which is nice because I like my coffee strong.

review/text: Great product that brews a great cup of coffee fast and removable water resevoir is the way to go no more messy water refills with a pitcher or coffee pot.  Looks great with any kitchen decor and saves you money, with so many flavors now available in K cups you cannot go wrong.  Only downfall is that the pump is louder than I would have liked but for the savings over store bought coffee or wasting half a pot in a conventional brewer I can live with it.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: This has renewed my addiction to coffee, and tea. Once set up(~5 minutes) and warmed up(~2 minutes) you can have a hot cup of coffee, tea, cocoa, or a few other things in just a matter of seconds! This really has changed the game. Would you rather a fresh hot cup of coffee or that last cup from the bottom of the pot that's been on the burner for an hour? This allows you to have that fresh hot cup every time.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that talk about it making too much noise. I don't see what they are talking about. The only think I can imagine would be when the pump sucks the water into the heater. While noticeable, that sound is a dull hum at best. I can't see it being a reason not to get one of these.<br /><br />With so many great options for coffee and more this machine has been in constant use since it arrived. I'm trying out different types of coffee one cup at a time, and enjoying more tea than I've had in years. Thank you Keurig for making a product that is trouble free and simple to use.

review/summary: Great for us one cuppers...
review/text: I never drank coffee in my life because I only wanted one cup.  I guess you could call me a one cupper.  At work, I would drink one cup of coffee in the morning because it was there.  I found that that one cup really got me going in the morning, and also in the afternoons if I was feeling drowsy.  I started working from home and found that I missed that coffee.  I purchased this basic Keurig because it has everything a one cupper needs, nothing more.  I love it!  My only complaint is that it only lasted one year.  I attempted to dscale it, and it never worked right again.  I bought the same machine again and am hoping for a longer life.  I would recommend this product to all the one cuppers of the world.  Just be sure to descale on a regular basis.

review/summary: I Love My Keurig
review/text: I am surprised at all the negative reviews as I love this machine and have had it for over a year with very little problems.  I had to descale it once during that time but I usually use purified water for coffee so I wouldn't imagine I would have to do that again for another year.  There are two cup sizes.  One is a normal cup and one is a stronger cup.  If you are looking to fill up a mug, you can hit the smaller cup size twice.  I find that is perfect because I buy the stronger blend coffees.<br /><br />The only problem I have had was a couple of times I had to turn it off and on a few times to get the water to flow through the k cups.  All in all, not a hardship<br /><br />I am going to buy one for my son this year and am not sure which model to get.  This standard has worked great for me so I may just get the same.

review/text: By far, the best chocolate in the USA. Better than Godiva, I think, but others may disagree. I LOVE See's Candies, BUT the shipping cost is almost the same as the pound of truffles.  I know shipping chocolate may be difficult during hot or cold times, but geez, something has to be done about this..... Maybe buy multiple See's products for shipping discounts? we don't have See's stores in the East, just little stands in malls during the holiday season with few choices. I WANT MY SEE'S KEY LIME WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES.  Your best bet is to search amazon's grocery and gourmet food site and find discounts. During the winter holidays, I got terrific truffles at a deep discount, regularly $100 for $20 plus free shipping.

review/text: I have already communicated with the See's company about my disappointment in the item they sell as truffles.  My definition of Truffles and See's are not the same.  The candy they sent was delicious and I ate it all, but it was not what I expected i.e. round chocolates filled with various flavors of chocolate ganache.  The item See's sells as truffles was a box of assorted soft centered chocolates of various shapes.  I may buy other candy from See's in the future, but certainly not truffles.
