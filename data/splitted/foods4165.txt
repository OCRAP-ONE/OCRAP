review/summary: De la Estancia Orgaic Polenta
review/text: When I was little, my Mom used to make a polenta dish that was<br />not creamy, but thicker texture.  She'd layer it in a bowl with<br />spaghetti sauce and top it with pork chops cooked in the sauce.<br />This product has the texture, the taste of years gone by.  I rate<br />this a 5* and long-time in finding it.

review/text: These are great nutrition bars. I love dark chocolate and this satisfies my craving for chocolate  as a healthy alternative replacement meal. I feel they are also filling enough to prevent me from eating more. I will say I have found them cheaper at Giant Eagle grocery stores but the stores are a longer drive than I usually take to buy groceries. I was not the greatest mint fan but the mint taste is not overwhelming and goes well with the chocolate.

review/text: I don't eat a lot of processed foods, but every once in a while I'll grab a NuGo bar. For the first time yesterday I had a NuGo Dark mint chocolate chip bar. It was so darn delicious!!!! It reminded me of when Hershey's used to make those cookies n mint chocolate candy bars (back in the early 90's). It also reminded me of a crunchy thin mint wafer. Since I'm pretty much 99% raw foods (also dairy, gluten and meat free) the NuGo bars will be perfect for me to pack on our upcoming cruise. I want to make sure I have some snacks to munch on, since most of the food on the cruise ship won't be healthy/raw.<br /><br />I found these cheaper on soap.com. I got a 12 pack of these and 12 pack of the dark chocolate peanut butter cup for 34.00- that includes shipping! Check for on-line coupons..I saved 20% on my purchase by using a coupon! Amazon was going to be around 42.00 for both. I saved about .50 per bar buying them on-line as opposed to the health food store!

review/summary: Crunch, crunch, crunchy goodness
review/text: For years, my early-teen son and I have enjoyed these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IRA">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars</a> in the Maple Brown Sugar flavor, so we were pleased to find them for sale here. They've been a favorite for both of us for years... we call them our crunchy oatmeal, as the main ingredient is whole grain rolled oats.<br /><br />Each pack in the box has two slim bars that total 180 calories and total carbs of 29g, so they've not only been a decent candy bar alternative, but a good snack while cycling or walking. The crunchy bars are not too sweet, have a nice maple brown sugar flavor, and are well wrapped and sealed for carrying in all types of weather.<br /><br />Another variety that we enjoy are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFY4">Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars</a> in the Fruit & Nut flavor. These are nicely chewy, with a nice oat flavor, and can be gentler on the mouth the crunchier varieties. If you're counting carbs and calories, these are listed as having total carbohydrates of 25g and 140 calories. For our purposes, they're ideal for our frequent cycling activities.<br /><br />Either type of these granola bars is just filling enough to satisfy mild food cravings, and they're decent between meal snacks for kids or fairly active adults. Some say that teenagers and adults rarely concur on many things, but in our agreed opinion, these are a pretty even match in overall enjoyment. In our case, we usually get both.<br /><br />But crunchy or chewy, either is a good snack choice.

review/text: I've had to order off Amazon now because our local stores--Publix, WinnDixie, SweetBay, Target, and WalMart--no longer carry this flavor. Maple and Brown Sugar is the best flavor and I don't know why it isn't easily available.  The shelves at the store have two or three rows devoted to peanut butter, but nary a slot for the M&B flavor.  A pity, because it is the best of the crunchy bars.

review/text: Nature Valley Granola bars are one of the first arrivals in the venue of granola bars, and they have endured as one of the best, both taste wise and nutritionally, not succumbing to sugar coatings or chocolate chip additions. However, my family prefers some of the flavors that are, for some reason, not the most popular on our local supermarket shelves. When I ordered the case of Maple Brown Sugar bars from Amazon, the shipment came within the week and cost me about .50 a bar less than if I had purchased it in my local store. I should not say this because next time I bet I will see the price got jacked (ha ha, hope not!). But at any rate, it was a great find. In fact, we are just about ready for a repeat shipmment.

How could anything that is good for you TASTE so good. Usually health bars taste like sawdust, but these were wonderful. I could not find them in any local grocery store or Sam's wholesale, so I searched the web and found them on Amazon. Lo and behold, not only did I find them, but found them on sale!<br />I ordered two cases. (One for my brother and one for myself) I keep them at my office for days when I skip breakfast. Also they make a healthy crunchy sweet snack between meals. I will pack them when I take my kids camping. Maybe I will even try other NV flavors. Two thumbs up!

review/summary: Our twins love this one. With the subscription, the price is fair
review/text: Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/summary: Dessert to Them.  But is it Nutritional Enough?
review/text: My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/text: I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.

Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.

review/text: We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family.

review/summary: Too runny...
review/text: My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick.

review/summary: Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others
review/text: My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

review/summary: FOUND SHREDDED PLASTIC IN THE BABY FOOD!!!!
review/text: I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing.

review/text: We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.

review/summary: Our Baby's Favorite Dinner
review/text: The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.

review/summary: My daughter's favorite jarred food
review/text: My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!

review/summary: the only jarred baby food my son ate
review/text: From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.

review/text: My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors.

review/text: This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.

It had a gray/white coating all over it  which means it probably had been improperly stored and had "bloomed".  (I had to look that up in order to see if it was safe to eat).<br />On top of this it tasted very "off" or stale, and for me to say that it has to be pretty bad because I love this chocolate and buy it every couple of weeks (so I should know). Anyway, even I won't eat it so goodbye 23-1/2 bars.  Ah well, you get what you pay for but I am surprised Amazon would let vendors sell stale food.<br /><br />I won't send it back because someone else may get it and anyway it would the postage would not be worth it.

review/summary: Excellent dog food!
review/text: I have two Havanese dogs.  With my first one, I had such difficulty getting her to eat!  She was on Eukanuba (supposedly a higher end dog food) from the breeder but she hated it.  She would only eat it if she was starving (every 2-3 days) and if the food was left out for more than 24 hrs. and she ate it, she would get diarrhea!  I wasted so much food and my poor dog truly wasn't doing well.  In addition, she had to go for anal purging every few months because her stools were too soft, caused by poor dog food quality.<br /><br />I did a lot of research and found this product.  I noticed that it wasn't any more expensive than what I was paying for Eukanuba.  I learned that grain-free was better for dogs' digestion so I looked into them specifically.  I tried trial packages of at least 5 different brands dog foods (including Evo, Blue Buffalo, Nature's Variety), 2-3 types of each, and allowed my dog to choose.  She chose Earthborn.  She was on Primitive Natural (chicken-based) initially but I later found out she prefers Great Plains (bison and lamb-based).  She has been on it ever since.<br /><br />One and a half years later, she still loves the food.  I have NO problems getting her to eat (but she doesn't overeat) and her excretions are normal and solid.  Her coat is now so much softer and nicer than a year ago and everyone she meets is always amazed at her coat.  We have nicknamed her cotton ball.  This food is also appropriate for all stages and we have placed our puppy boy (currently 7 months) on it.  He -loves- it.  He is growing wonderfully, soft silky coat, normal stools, and a happy, healthy boy.  We are so happy we found this brand and this grain-free line!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Mmmmm. Delicious!
review/text: I recently visited my local warehouse store and picked up a two-pack (45 oz each) of KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce. It's much too much, of course, but this stuff has a long shelf life and we use it with all kinds of things. For example, when I got home I put a mini Crock Pot full of small meat balls and dowsed it with a generous amount of this sauce. When the pot was hot, we used it as the main dish of the evening meal. Mmmmm. Delicious! Very nice flavor. It's definitely one of the better "barbecue sauce in a bottle" products available. Handy stuff to have around too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I LOVE IT!!
review/text: Big Red used to be my all time favorite gum.  But, when I found out the aspartame was causing some negative side effects, I had to leave it, and any other product containing aspartame, alone.  I have searched several of the different gums in the store only to find they all contain aspartame.  So, I haven't had a good chewing gum in years...until now.  I received my order today and my oh my is it good!  Of all the things to get excited about, I'm excited about being able to chew gum with no side effects.  I gave up sugar about 10 days ago, so the Splenda Sweetener is more than welcome.  I taste no difference in the gum, maybe because I haven't had any in a long time.  And, there's a nice long lasting flavor!  It's just good!

The gingerbread is so hard when you go to break the specified piece it breaks other pieces, the structure is unstable so it makes it difficult to decorate, after all that then the engine ended up collapsing after sitting a few hours.  After contacting the company, they mentioned it was an issue they are working to resolve in their 2010 model.  I would avoid purchasing this.

review/summary: Too much work and the end result not great!
review/text: This set is far too much work and the end result is not all that great.  First, you need to make the royal icing from the power (1 dirty bowl) and use a hand mixer to mix it until it forms peaks (one dirty tool and one that some parents may not have).  Then, you need to take out about a cup of the icing and add in the red food coloring (2nd dirty bowl).  Finally, you need to take out another cup of icing and add in the green food coloring (3rd dirty bowl).  Since there is only 1 piping bag/tip for the kit, you would need to use your own Ziploc or piping bags to pipe the other two colors without color contamination (more mess and frustration).  By the time we finished these prep steps, the kids had already lost interest in the entire project!  So, the adults ended up doing the whole thing!  Even with meticulous attention to the directions, the final result is just so-so.  If you want martyrdom, this is it!<br /><br />Wouldn't it be be easier to have pre-mixed icing in plastic syringes so the joy is in decorating the gingerbread train rather than in struggling with making the icing????<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: Ideal is the best no cal sweetener!
review/text: I have an intense dislike for all fake sugars out there, and have tried every one I could get my hands on. Ideal Sweetener is the only one I like. It is perfect for baking and you use it cup-for-cup in recipes instead of sugar. Zero calories and has no funky aftertaste like most artificial sweeteners. I am so happy I will be able to order this on Amazon in the Baking Bag, as all the stores in my area only carry the small packs. Finally, I can make cookies and breads without all the calories!!<br /><br />EDIT: If you are using this for baking, it is not zero calories. I contacted Heartland Sweeteners to find out the calories-per-cup, and this was the response:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Heartland Sweeteners.  The FDA allows any food item with less than 5 calories per serving to be labeled as "zero calories". Ideal has 202 calories per cup versus over 770 calories in a cup of sugar.

review/text: I have been using sugar alternatives for many years. I have tried many of them. I loved Splenda(sucralose), but recently discovered that it is not properly digestible, with as much as 40% left for the body to process. I went back to stevia based sweeteners, but quickly grew tired of the bitter after taste. This product is also based in  plant-like, natural ingredients. The taste closely rivals table sugar! I am already on my second large order. I add it to my coffee and iced tea with a teaspoon just as if it was sugar.

review/summary: It has 202 cals and 53 carbs per cup. Great sweetener, but their marketing is misleading!
review/text: I like this sweetener a lot.  But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal.  So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon.  So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says.  They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag!  The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose.  It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.<br /><br />Rating breakdown:<br />Product claims = 1 star<br />Product taste = 5 stars<br />Overall: 3 stars<br /><br />Calorie and carb info from [...]

review/summary: Not what I was hoping for
review/text: Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods.

review/summary: It Certainly isn't Healthy
review/text: I have a problem with many reviews calling this a "healthy" sweetener for it is NOT healthy, just a better substitute than many others out there. Although not a "healthy" sweetener, it taste great and taste pretty much just like the organic Sucant sugar I usually use for baking.<br /><br />The first ingredient in Ideal is Xylitol (not very sweet by itself) which is iffy with health foodies (they say it is too processed just like white sugar) and then Ideal adds two other ingredients that are definitely unhealthy. Maltrodextrin is more often than not derived from corn (usually GMO corn) which is NOT healthy and the other ingredient is Sucralose which is Splenda which is NOT healthy because your body cant recognize it and doesnt know what to do with it therefore making it harder on your system than sugar and harder to digest.<br /><br />I'm huge into whole food holistic eating and buy stevia leaves or stevia powder which is truly zero calories and not bad on your system; yet, it does have a minor aftertaste you have to get used to. If you are looking for a sweetener that is not unhealthy turn to 100% stevia and is fine for diabetics. Again, this Ideal brand xylitol is mixed with corn sweetener and splenda and although not healthy, does taste great!

review/summary: Looks like Sugar, Taste like Sugar
review/text: This is probably one of the best brand of sweetener available right now.  There are many sweeteners at supermarkets & grocery stores: like Equal, Splenda, Truvia, Purevia, etc...  But Ideal is my favorite for two reasons: Taste & Consistency.<br /><br />Taste: It's the closest thing you will get to sugar without being sugar.  In "my opinion", it ALMOST leaves none of the aftertaste that you come to expect from sweeteners like Sweet-N-Low (saccharin), Nutrasweet (aspartame), or to an extent Splenda (sucralose). Truvia & Purevia do taste like sugar initially, but I find they have a bitter aftertaste.  Ideal (xylitol) has a slight hint of non-sugar initially, that eventually subside and disappear.<br /><br />Consistency: It looks like sugar!! It is not powdery or too off-white or too dark. It's crystally like sugar. Actually, you could mistake it with real sugar by just the look of it.  The only thing that gives it away is the feel of it on your spoon or your hand.  It feels lighter than real sugar, almost fluffy (light 'n airy).<br /><br />One of the best thing about Ideal is it dissolves equally well in hot AND cold beverages, unlike real sugar.  I have not tried it for baking or sweet recipes, but have added to savory dishes and it is a worthy substitute.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with Ideal is you can't find it at many grocery stores or supermarket.  You need to order it on Amazon or look on their website where they get distributed.<br /><br />Overall, A++

review/text: I've been able to use this sweetener in my recipes and things like coffee, tea, etc. It tastes like sugar - no bitterness or aftertaste. However, I find the "zero calorie" label misleading. They're allowed to say that the product has zero calories because each teaspoon has less than five, which is close enough for the FDA. However, if you're going to use it in baking, you will be adding some calories and carbohydrates. Each cup has 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs, according to their website. I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than sugar, but I think the packaging should give the statistics per cup instead of the rounded down "zeros" in a teaspoon.

review/summary: "Sugar" with positive dental benefits
review/text: I have purchased Ideal for about a year now but discovered that the product sold in the store was promotional and the big chains here in Massachusetts are not selling it.  Major Bummer.  I sent the Ideal folks an e-mail about the situation--they were the ones who told me about the distribution problems.<br /><br />Ideal contains as the first ingredient, Xylitol which is found in sugarless gum.  Xylitol has the benefit of being dentally positive (it actually promotes to a degree some dental benefits) whereas sugar as we all know is dentally negative (sugar is food for bacteria and the bacteria byproducts, poo as it is, causes dental caries).  That is the reason I use it. One only needs to calculate the cost of dental bills to decide to add Ideal to one's shopping list-- along with floss and fluoride rinse.<br /><br />I find the taste of Ideal to be better than sugar as there is no post sugar dryness in the mouth.  The pink, blue yellow and other fake sweetners have a horrible aftertaste which Ideal does not have (at least in coffee and ice tea). The only bummer is that the Ideal company is not doing a better job of promoting this product.  But such is life.<br /><br />I do agree with some writers that the Ideal folks should be upfront about calories.  Sadly the Ideal folks are following the letter of the law that allows companies to say no calorie when in fact there are calories.  The oil in the can spray products are a big offender here as they list their serving size to be 1/3 of a second but if one calculates the amount of fat calories in a small can it comes to about 1400 calories, all from fat.  Ideal should not take this route and should be upfront.  5 calories per teaspoon with diabetic and dental benefits is, in my book, a positive selling point.

Xylitol is already a sweetener<br /><br />Get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6852">Now Foods</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5T52">Emerald forest</a> instead. At least you're gettting 100% all Xylitol

review/text: I use this to bake with and it tastes as good as sugar. No aftertaste or anything. I feel better that I am eating less sugar, and this is supposed to be better for you that other sugar substitutes.

review/summary: Tastes just like sugar!
review/text: I am so glad to find Ideal sugar substitute. It is Xylitol, not a dangerous chemical. It tastes just like sugar. I understand that you can bake with it, but I haven't done that yet.

review/summary: Great product but Hi-way robbery!!!
review/text: This product is fantastic. Not quite as sweet as sugar so I add a tad of Truvia to it. And Ideal's powdered sugar is the best!!!<br /><br />The last 'source' provided this for $5.99 to $6.49(which I bought regularly from Amazon). When it went up to $8.99 I went to the Ideal website and found that a number of local groceries are carrying it now.  I found it at Frys, it's also available at Fred Meyers, any grocers that sell Kroger products & a few stores - for $4.99!

review/summary: Best Thing I Have Found Too
review/text: I ordered this Stuff just for funsies and thought I'd died and went to sugar heaven. I ate it almost exclusively on Oatmeal this whole winter I loved the crunch of it on my steaming hot morning meal.  I actually wimpered when I used the last of it. I'd kill for a couple of bags now that it's berry season.  I can't waste it on hot or cold tea, food that needs that crunchy sweet bite is what I'd save it for.  I even asked Splenda when they were going to get with it and make a crunchy formula, and they acted like I was from Mars. Just one lil question, when are ya gonna be in stores?? Whine whine whine! Lol, just kiddn but I can't use my credit card too much but I'd gladly buy this stuff by the armload in my own grocery store. Please get in stores in the south when youse guys can!! I will buy it like crazy!

review/summary: great but pricey
review/text: this is a wonderful product. it is sweet and no aftertaste. i don't mind an aftertaste to save calories but my mother is always bothered by it so doesn't like to eat the things i make if i make it with sucralose. i made a cake and some cookies and she thought they were made with sugar. so it passes her test :).<br /><br />two things i don't like about it is the "zero calorie" thing. it has about two hundred calories per cup so is misleading. basically all things that claim no calories are like this so they aren't the only ones but i still think it's false advertising.<br /><br />the other thing is that you only get four cups. sugar where i live costs less than half of this for a five pound bag. i have no problem spending money but buying this all the time would run anyone dry pretty quickly. i'll buy it again if it's on sale again but won't be a regular.<br /><br />anyone wanting to try this i suggest you do. it almost acts just like sugar. it just doesn't give as much volume as sugar does in recipes.
