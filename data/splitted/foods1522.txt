review/summary: Great cat treat, smaller treats, more to the bag!
review/text: Before I found these in bulk on Amazon, I found them at a Big Box store for about the same price.  The difference was that the ones from Amazon seemed a bit fresher and softer.  The cats love them.<br /><br />One of the great selling points to this treat to me is that there are more per bag then what we have normally given the cats <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NTQ1K">Whiskas Temptations Tasty Chicken Flavour Treats for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>.  Part of the "playing" process for our kitties is fetching them and running after them and finding them in hidden spots.  It's nicer to have a smaller treat to do this with.<br /><br />Our cats love them and so do we.

review/summary: Fabulous new treat!
review/text: My toothless male actually will sit next to the lazy Susan where I keep his food, hoping for a few of these things!  That's totally out of his realm - you come to him with his food, he's too good to search it out for himself!  I can't get enough of these down him, or fast enough, to suit him.  The guy can eat almost 1/2 a package in one sitting!  They're soft chewies and this is the only variety we can get right now.  But, he loves the things so I'm going to order the other varieties here on amazon.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Fantastic cat treat!!!
review/text: My 16 year-old cat has renal problems and is on a special vet diet, but has decided he does not want to eat it anymore... he was losing way too much weight and I just discovered this product.  I sprinkle about 5 or 6 of these small morsels atop his wet food and he scarfs them and the wet food down rather quickly.  If this gets him to eat heartily then I'm all for this diversion.

review/summary: Kitten LOVES these treats
review/text: My 6 month old kitten hasn't really taken to treats. I've bought her a few varieties and she usually just swats them around until they slide under the fridge or china cabinet. My father gave the kitten these treats for Christmas and she LOVES them. She loves them so much she doesn't swat them around even once. She hears the bag crinkling and comes running!  I've been trying to potty train her and these treats have really come in handy as a reward system!  I can not praise this item enough! As I'm writing this review this item is not currently available on Amazon so I can't comment on the pricing. I think this item is totally worth it. I love it, the kitten loves it, no crumbs left behind!

review/summary: Fruit & Cream is Delicious..
review/text: The Quaker Instant Oatmeal Fruit & Cream, Variety Pack 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 4) is a delicious way to start your day. You have a choice of four flavors to choose from, Strawberries & Cream, Blueberries & Cream, Peaches & Cream or Bananas & Cream, each with 130 calories per packet. For the flavor, they are all good choices. The dehydrated fruit tastes great after adding water and allowing it to rehydrate a couple of minutes. My only complaint with this product is that it's laden with sugar, between 9-12 grams per serving. Anyone with sugar.. beware.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/text: I was very dissappointed in this product. First, it was solidified like a rock in the jar. I suspect it had been<br /><br />sitting on a shelf for a very long time.<br /><br />I was expecting white cheddar. What I got was mostly salt & the flavor not so pleasing. Barely cheeselike.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Just buy the white cheddar popcorn premade in a bag at the store.<br /><br />It's a hundred times better. I bought a box of six jars. Even the box looked ancient.<br /><br />I threw it all in the trash.<br /><br />If 0 stars was available, I would have picked that instead of 1.

review/summary: very good, if you know how to mix it
review/text: I read all the reviews and decided I did not want to eat all the calories and fat in one setting (seriously, each package is so small i think I can finish it in 4 or 5 bites).  So I looked around the house for something I can mix this with, and then it hit me, oatmeal.  I had some McCann's steel cut oatmeal.  I mixed 1 and half cup of dry oatmeal, cooked it first for around half an hour.  When it's ready, I threw in the pudding.  The result was FANTASTIC, it was not overly sweet and had plenty of flavor, not to mention, the pudding just got 10 times healthier because the oatmeal is high fiber and low calories.  Perfect for breakfast.<br /><br />In addition to oatmeal, I can think of several other things that you might consider mixing this pudding with.  Cake mix (then bake the cake, of course), rice congee (add a variety of beans for even more flavor), and pumpkin pie.  Just be creative and dont eat this by itself, the flavor would so sweet and rich that it would make you sick.  For your reference, each package contains 2 servings, each serving has 51% of your daily fat intake (based on 2000 calorie diet), and 51 grams of sugar (20% of your carb intake), and 570 calories.

review/summary: Too sweet, gritty
review/text: This is definitely an indulgence item. I don't mind the calories (over 500 a serving) if the product is good, but I find this product way too sweet for my taste. I was overwhelmed by the sweetness and could not really get much of the pumpkin flavor or any flavor other than sweet. There was a grittiness to the texture that I did not enjoy. It is probably the sugar granules, but it would not dissolve or go away even when the product was heated. It felt like I was biting on sand pieces. When heated (particularly in the microwave), the oil will separate from the solid parts so you have to spend a couple of minutes mixing it back in, or you can try to pour it off and save on the calories a bit.

review/summary: Didn't Finish A Single Serving
review/text: I really like Kitchens of India's curries, I have a sweet tooth and I generally like recipes made with pumpkin so thought this "pudding" would be great.  I wish I could have tried it before buying a six pack.  It does have an appealing taste but it was far too sweet to finish, even though I am used to Indian "sweets."  Like other reviewers, I also found it to have lots of sugar "grit" and an excessive amount of oil that separates when heated.  It was so rich and oily that I didn't even want to finish it.  Each pouch actually has two servings and each serving has 570 calories, over 50% of the daily recommended value of fat and 61g of carbohydrates... in one 1/2 cup serving!  I think I will just stick with Kitchens of India curries and look for dessert elsewhere.

review/summary: Poor Pumpkin... Overwhelmed by Oil and Sugar
review/text: I know that Indian desserts are traditionally very sweet (I've eaten my share of them), but this is a case where Kitchens of India could have and should have opted for less traditional.  The pumpkin in this dessert is good, but it's so hard to actually sense the flavor because of the overwhelming oil and sugar (so dense that it's gritty still).  I can't really recommend this product to others except for curiosity -- you could very easily make your own pumpkin "pudding" dessert that is much more palatable and satisfying.<br /><br />And my gosh, the calories & fat content - ouch!  It's so hard to imagine those numbers are real, but the nutrition you see listed here on Amazon is exactly the same as on the individual packages.  The only hope is to mix it in with something else that is very light (in calories & fat) to make a much larger dessert.

review/summary: If Jif Made Almond Butter
review/text: Maranatha "All Natural" No Stir, Crunchy, Almond Butter<br /><br />This is a delicious product, with just enough crunch.<br /><br />Ingredients: Dry Roasted Almonds, Organic Unrefined Cane Sugar, Palm Oil, Sea Salt.<br /><br />Some comments:<br /><br />I believe "All Natural" is what Maranatha calls their slightly cheaper nut-butters whose ingredients don't all meet the Organic standard (if you care strongly about that).<br /><br />From the label: "... Our unique process also means that you can spread our almond butter right after opening--no need to stir. ..."<br /><br />Actually, I believe the palm oil is just as important as the "unique process" in keeping the product homogeneous. The palm oil gives this version of Maranatha Almond Butter a creamy texture similar to regular peanut butters with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. This "no stir" version may be a good choice for people who aren't willing to deal with nut-butters having an inch of separated nut oil on top. I took off a star in part because I don't believe people are expecting palm oil, which is very rich and not in the standard home kitchen, in a Maranatha product.<br /><br />That said, I bought a single jar in a retail shop. It did benefit from knife-stirring, as a bit of oil was visible on top ("use by" date was 7 months away). No big deal.<br /><br />You have to love almond butter. I ate a jar in a week, and went back for more. I attribute this product's deliciousness to the added sugar & salt, roasted (not raw) almonds (it smells so good!), and the added palm oil. And the just-right crunchiness, of course.

review/summary: Cheap price, cheap taste
review/text: This is the second try I've given this particular brand and I still do not like it. MaraNatha brand almond butter has replaced the store shelf space where other brands that I liked used to be and it is much cheaper at the store - the cheapest - of all almond butters I've seen so far. It's like buying peanut butter - you get what you pay for. I think the problem I have with it is that it doesn't taste like it's made from fresh almonds. It tastes stale or on the verge of being rancid. It could be the oil used or the almonds I have no idea. I just bought it and tasted it without letting it sit around for awhile. I like to spread it on apple slices for a healthy snack. I wanted to like it but after having other brands I loved, I will not ever purchase this brand again. If you are picky about peanut butter then you might be picky about almond butter too. I keep hoping the stores will bring back the other brands to the shelf but right now they aren't giving any choice at the regular (non-specialty) supermarkets. My favorite was organic raw almond butter but now that is becoming impossible to find in the supermarkets thanks to Maranatha.

review/summary: Heat PLUS Flavor!
review/text: Discovered this sauce on a trip to Belize. It was on every table at the resort restaurant and with good reason. As opposed to many sauces that simply add heat to a dish, Marie Sharp's Belizean Heat adds a great flavor. There are many products in her line, but Belizean Heat has become a staple on our table at home. There are hotter products available, but none combine the all the aspects as well.

review/text: I love Whoppers, but the chocolate part is just too much.  All I really want is the malted milk ball part.  So I found these and they're very tasty.  They're exactly what they say they are.<br /><br />My only concern is that there is no nutritional information provided (beyond an ingredients list)...is that legal?  I've eaten about half the bag in the past week and I assume that's probably a lot of calories and maybe fat, but I don't really know.  I'd like to have an idea of the damage at least!

Crunchy and crisp and delightfully malt-y, I keep trying to think of ways I could use these, but really, eating them by the handful seems as good as anything! Just plain delicious.

review/summary: Not Pure Juice
review/text: When looking for pink grapefruit juice, I wanted 100% juice with no added sweetners.  This product seemed to fit the bill, since it is listed as Florida's Natural Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice.  While it does not have added sugar, it is loaded with high fructose corn syrup.  There is a little blurb on the upper right hand side of the label that states the product is Pink Grapefruit Juice Cocktail.  I am selling this product to a friend and feel that this product was mis-represented by Amazon.com.

review/summary: I have the perfect solution to Kitchens of India Desserts!
review/text: I used to agree with most who state that Kitchens of India should stay OUT of the dessert kitchen---and keep their feet planted firmly on the savory side. However, I cannot seem to resist both the Yellow Lentil Pudding, as well as the White Pumpkin and Milk variety.  While not perfect on their own, just take a few moments to combine with one magical ingredient and VOILA---divine desserts! The secret? WHIPPED HEAVY CREAM!!! Mix the lentil variety with about one cup of VERY lightly sweetened whipped heavy cream that has also been made with the scrapings of 1/2 of a vanilla bean. Mix the pumpkin variety with about one cup of COMPLETELY unsweetened whipped heavy cream without the vanilla.  And in both cases.....well, it's just very special! Indian in flavor, taste, color and aroma. And THAT certainly hits the spot, for us after a meal of roast lamb or tandori style chicken. Oh yes I almost forgot---I choose to cook these by boiling the bags exclusively--have tried it other ways and I find that it messes with the texture. And I always "pour off" any residual oil (lentil variety) or butter (pumpkin)~~but I don't obssess about it~~this is definitely a once-in-a-while type of selection, so no need to worry about calories!  I encourage you to give this a go!!

But you may enjoy it as part of your regular diet since all the work has been done for you.

review/summary: Real White Tea
review/text: White tea is not for everyone. Not because some will find the flavor objectionable, but because it's expensive, particularly if its genuine, and the flavor is mild and very subtle.  This is a meditative tea, not something to be used as an everyday drink to accompany food.  Not that is can't be consumed that way, but the subtle flavors of white tea will be like so much hot water if all it is doing is washing down food.<br /><br />Some will find it to be almost without taste while others will delight in a series of flavor notes that will not smack you over the head but can be pretty wonderful.<br /><br />White tea is made from very select tea leaf tips and might be described as "beyond green." Indeed, if you're turned off by green tea's vegetative taste you may love white tea.<br /><br />If you're going to spend money on white tea you should make sure that you buy the real thing and Dilmah is one of my trusted suppliers.  I've loved their Ceylon teas for years, originally ordering them direct from Sri Lanka before they were available for direct sale in the U.S.<br /><br />Experiment with the balance between water and tea and with steeping times to get what you like.  It's worth the price and effort for serious tea drinkers.

review/summary: Great product line but my dog's allergic to this one food
review/text: I bought Acana Wild Prairie for Dogs almost two months ago, having used Acana's Grasslands with great success for my 9-year-old Maltese.<br />  I received Wild Prairie from Whole Healthy Pet within two days -- much earlier than expected -- and their customer service turns out to be excellent.<br />  However, my Maltese began licking her paws the day she started eating Wild Prairie. Since it was fall, and I wasn't sure but what mold or leaf mold or grasses could have contributed to her sudden allergy, I worked on eliminating her exposure to everything else that could be causing it. But she continued to lick her paws.<br />  So I ordered Acana's Grasslands, again sent from Whole Healthy Pet, and, as before, it arrived immediately. Within two days of switching back to Grasslands, her paw-licking ceased.<br />  Acana has a great product line -- and I will continue to use Acana's Grasslands, and Whole Healthy Pet -- but about 10 pounds of the 15.4 pounds of Wild Prairie has been given to a neighbor with a non-allergic dog.

I've ordered the K-cups from Amazon three times now and just placed my fourth order, the second with this company.

But from the first cup to the last little bit in the mug it has proven to be worth the gamble.  In my opinion it is a very smooth coffee.  Perfect for those Saturday or Sunday Mornings sitting on the porch.  It has a nice flavor with a nice hint of pecan but not overpowering. Doesn't seem to leave a unpleasant aftertaste just a craving for another cup.  If you are on the fence and not sure, just jump off and give it a shot.  Worth the money.

review/summary: Love the smell & like the flavor
review/text: I gave this four stars based on the flavor (according to my own taste preference of course) but I would give ten stars to the aroma!  It fills the kitchen with such a wonderful scent.  Back to the flavor though, it's a gentle pecan taste with a just under medium roast flavor.  So to many I believe it would be considered weak.  You could brew a smaller cup or more likely if you like your coffee strong, you probably are not looking at this product anyway!  If you are looking for strong order a variety that is bold or extra bold.  I like to have a variety of K cups without paying the sampler pack prices and this fits the bill for my home.  I have started with a 50 pack of a known favorite and then 24 packs of other flavors that I think I would like to try and have to offer to company.<br /><br />UPDATE: After running through a number of varieties I can tell you we ran out of the Pecan pretty quick.  I still love the aroma and like the flavor and it's definitely one I would order again.

review/summary: Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan, for Keurig Brewers
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee "Southern Pecan", for Keurig Brewers is an excellent medium brewed coffee.  I enjoy the "Southern Pecan" flavor that compliments a variety of foods and is a treat on its own.  Unlike some flavored coffees that claim to have flavor...I have found that "Green Mountain" pulls of the balance of richness, aroma, good taste and flavor.

review/summary: Great Coffee for a Flavored Coffee
review/text: This is a medium roasted coffee, those that call it a light roast must be used to a heavier tasting cup of coffee. When first brewed, it has a very pleasant nutty aroma that fills the room and gets your expectations going. I have the Keurig with 3 cup sizes, if you brew it on the smallest setting, it's like a little shot of nutty espresso (on the milder side)...on the second setting it's a more intense flavor that Starbucks people could probably relate to...on the largest setting it is ready for you to add what you desire and still get a very good, subtle nutty tasting, rich coffee. I add a bit of sugar while drinking it black and it's a delight...when you are in the mood for something different. I find I don't like it as much as my first cup of the day...but every once in a while I like a cup in the afternoon and this is where I find it stands out. Not a heavy, burnt tasting roast...milder than that heavy stuff and flavorful WITHOUT knocking you out with an added fake flavor that doesn't belong there...it seems to really go together, pecan & coffee. Let's just say it's a nice cup of coffee with a bit of a nutty tone...PS: I'm not a real lover of flavored coffees but this one is done right...on the lines of Island Coconut, who would think that coconut & coffee flavors would go pleasantly together?...but they do!

For tea drinkers who don't like BIG tea's, this is an excellent choice.  It's light, flavorful, delightful to drink and is a real leaf tea.  You'll know what I mean after you brew a cup.

review/summary: A Thoughtful Experience
review/text: I love to try new experiences like a new restaurant, a new wine or a tea that I've never tasted before.  While this can be delightful, it can also be a disappointment at times.<br />My first taste of Ran Watte was not delightful.  Then I realized the problem was not the tea.  Being unfamiliar with this larger leaf, I had used to much tea & brewed it to strong.  The second try was perfect for my taste.<br />This tea reminds me of a very light Jasmine tea.  It is wonderful to sip without amendments but a touch of honey would make a great compliment, also.  Most teas this light seem to have little taste which leaves me wondering at the attempt to market them.  This one shows an interesting character, lightly brisk & the slightest hint of salty aftertaste that is unusual but not at all unpleasant.  For my preference, this tea is a great 'afternoon with a good book' kind of tea.

Delighted to find it a clear, orangish color, smooth, with a pleasant 'wine' aroma, as well as smooth, light taste. No tannic aftertaste. The tin it comes in makes me equally happy, with a hinged lid and insert to help keep out air and light. Very lovely gift for yourself or someone special. Enjoy!

Nice packaging keeps tea ultra fresh; shrink wrapped, with hinged lid and inner lid, and to top it off the tea is sealed inside in a foil bag. Needs the full five minute steep time as recommended on bottom of package. The three pack is a pain; but just give one to a friend and keep the other two. This is a premium tea and a premium product.

review/text: On a tour of the Dilmah facilities in 2005 I learned a lot about tea. I was given the full tasting experience, and had the chance to sample all 36 basic types of tea. When we got to the Watte line, all of the hints and flavors became more pronounced.<br /><br />The Watte teas are from different elevations, and the Ran Watte come from the highest. Only a small number of acres produce this blend.<br /><br />It is the champagne of teas, light in color, but strong in its character; there is nothing sharp or demanding about this tea other than your difficulty finding more.<br /><br />The best tea I've ever had.

review/summary: Good Marketing, poor product
review/text: I keep several orthodox whole leaf teas around all the time, but like to have a decent quality ctc for those who can't appreciate my 3x as expensive teas. and occasionally I drink some ctc just to "repair" the budget.  When I saw that I could buy some "orthodox" high mountain Ceylon at such a reasonable price, I decided to give it a try. How bad could it be? First, not orthodox-it's ctc. Secondly, even with lowered expectations (Ceylon used to be my favorite tea before quality decreased over the last few years), this is disappointing. It is simply  a commercial product. It lacks any of the distinctive qualities of decent Ceylon. I couldn't coax a respectable cup of liquor from the leaves no matter how I brewed them. I'll use it to make a black tea mix for friends, but I won't calculate it's final cost vs quality. That way I won't have to add an antidepressant to my tea habit.<br /><br />I think generally speaking, Amazon is not the place to buy tea. This tea may be very old and may not have been handled properly. Tea is very susceptible to heat (warehouse). This was hot tot he touch when it arrived. There are other retailers who take great care in turning over inventory so as not to ship old tea. This is true even when purchasing inexpensive tea.

Had originally did light dusting on milk chocolate, but after a 2-3 hours, golden color was barely visible.  Even more so when you put chocolate into cellophane bag.  Do 2-3 layers (spray lightly over 2-3 times, instead of 1 very heavy application).  If you put too heavy of application, it runs and looks messy.  Overall, made favors look very nice, even though I felt it was a bit expensive for the can.

review/text: First of all, I can't understand why this is so expensive since it's less than $2 in the grocery store. But anyway, I bought a couple of these when they first came out and were buy one get one free. Made the cinnamon ones to take to church this morning. I didn't pay attention to the nutritional listing and didn't know that they only made SIX muffins! Who packages a muffin mix to only make 6? The container is tall so that you have room to shake (I realized after opening it) and it gives the illusion of having much more in there. So... to try and stretch it out to look like more, I made a  batch of minis for the small group that I meet with. The really bad part is that you can't scrape the batter with a spatula like you can when it's in a bowl. You can easily leave a whole mini-muffin in there! I have a skinny spatula that I had just bought, so I was able to get most of it but it was terribly awkward and I still left some batter. It makes me wonder if these things are tested out in a college dorm. After cooking I drizzled white icing and shook out a cinnamon/sugar mixture on top. That's the only thing that made them special, as they would have been pretty plain without the topping. Needless to say, I wouldn't buy again.

They are all dreamy sweet and smooth and taste delicious. One of the lollipops actually has coconut in it, so that is the only one I've noticed so far that had an interesting texture.
