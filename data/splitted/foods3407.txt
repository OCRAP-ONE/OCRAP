review/summary: Healthy-tasting; a bit bland
review/text: I purchased one bage of this product from my local health food store.  I am not a raw-foodist, but I am intrigued by the raw food lifestyle and have been curious about trying new raw food products.  I have not developed the patience to sprout and deyhydrate my own foods, so I bought this raw granola to see if it would be worth the investment.<br /><br />The taste is nothing spectacular, and the texture is dry and crunchy.  I do enjoy eating it plain, though it is not at all sweet, even with the addition of the raisins and dates.  The fruit pieces are quite hard and take a while to chew.  I normally eat the granola mixed into plain greek yogurt with fresh blueberries.  It seems that it is easy to digest and, despite the carb count, does not cause my energy level to drop rapidly like other cereals tend to do.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for anyone looking to a healthy alternative to regular granola.

review/summary: Healthy source of fiber and protein
review/text: Although I do not strictly follow a raw-food diet, I had the urge to try this granola to determine whether it was worth continuing to invest my money in the product. The granola does have a bland taste and I could not possibly eat it by itself. To eat the granola, I combine a quarter cup of oats, a quarter cup of my favorite Nature's Path granola (Pumpkin-Flax granola), and a quarter cup of the raw granola and I add to all these a cup of hot milk. Combining the raw granola with a naturally sweetened granola/cereal is the perfect way to consume this product and get its health benefits. Go Raw 100% Organic Live Granola Cereal is not the tastiest granola cereal, but it is very nutritious and healthy.

review/summary: avocado oil has a high smoke point, healthier for frying chips in
review/text: Of all the healthy oils, avocado oil has one of the highest smoke points. For me, that means there's less risk of consuming chips that are cooked over highly heated oils that are a risk to health. A high smoke point also means there's less of a chance that the nutritional properties of the oil degrades.<br /><br />of course, these chips taste awesome. Great crunch, like any good kettle chip. With a nutty flavor.<br /><br />If i had to eat chips, these would be the ones i would go for. so yummy & very guilt-free<br />would recommend to everyone!

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/summary: Anglina's Oat Groats
review/text: The oats arrived on time and in great condition.  I am going to freeze half of them to keep them out of harm's way while we eat the rest.  If anyone is interested, I put a cup of oats, 4 cups of water, a pinch of salt and a pinch of cinnamon in an over safe casserole.  I place this into the oven at 350' for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.I sometimes add a little more water, if I feel it is too thick.  When it is cooled I put the container into the refrigerator.  Both my husband and I eat oatmeal for breakfast.  When he is hungry for his, he scoops out one cup of oatmeal and warms it up in the microwave. He likes to add raisins and brown sugar.  I like mine plain. There is no need to stand over the pot of oatmeal stirring on the stove!  This is a wonderful way to eat healthy and delicious steel cut oats!

review/summary: Best Kept Secret for Steel Cut Oats Fans
review/text: Angelina's Gourmet Steel Cut Oats 25# is a great find.  Here are my observations:<br />1.  The oats taste fresher than comparable Steel Cut Quaker Oats found in supermarkets.  Just the plain cooked oats (before adding anything else) have a stronger, nuttier flavor.<br />2.  The oats look fresher.  Angelina's have a nice light brown/tan color.  Quaker Oats in a side by side comparison look grey.<br />3.  Buying in bulk is 1/4 the cost vs. buying a 1.5# container in a supermarket.<br />4.  Angelina's seem to take a little longer to cook to a comparable level of softness to Steel Cut Quaker Oats.<br />5.  My favorite/easiest way to cook these oats is to pour boiling water in my all stainless steel, wide mouth Stanley thermos and add oats the night before (~9 pm).  By 6 am the oats are at the right eating temperature and cooked.  If I add unheated ingredients like bananas, I take a cup of the oats in a coffee cup and heat it for a minute in a microwave and re-add to to the thermos.  Perfect eating temperature for me.<br />6.  Two Hefty 2.5 gallon jumbo storage bags are perfect for storing the oats.  Each bag can easily hold 12.5#.<br /><br />If you are a steel cut oats fan, don't pass this up!!

While the products that are made in the USA cost more, I certainly don't mind paying more. I was disappointed that this product wasn't described on the website as made in China. Chinese manufactured dog food is not inspected with the same scrutiny as American products. And needless to say, they've travelled quite a bit to get to my door. Please, Amazon, include place of manufacture. The dog seems to like the taste though.

review/text: I bought this thinking that it would be a great deal. While for most people I'm sure it would be but amazon missed some very important information on the label. This is manufactured on shared equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs, and wheat. So if you can't have those items purchase with caution.

review/text: I use Red Robin Seasoning to season fries mostly. But I also use it on occasion for burgers and such. If you've ever been to Red Robin and love it I'd highly suggest you buy some of their seasoning! The price is a little high for seasoning... I typically wouldn't pay that much but after tasting it I realized that it was definitely worth the price!

My initial impression is that I'll probably have to give these ones away because I can't stand the cigarette smoke taste (I'd prefer my chocolate to taste like chocolate, and my coffee to taste like coffee).  Once again Amazon just threw the 5-pound plastic bag into a cardboard box and it got ripped open a bit during shipment (but this time it didn't melt since it was shipped in the winter).

review/text: To begin, I love chocolate covered espresso beans.  Previously I've purchased them from a company in Hawaii and from Trader Joe's but I figured I could get these in bulk and delivered through Amazon, so why not.  Unfortunately, the burned, almost cigarette-like flavor mentioned by a previous review is real.  While this brand isn't horrible, it's definitely not my favorite and I will not purchase them again.

review/text: All I can say is these are great!  I'm a chocolate lover and can't drink coffee straight and these are terrific.  You will need to pick small bits of the bean out of your teeth, but that could be a bonus.  Pop a couple of them and you'll feel the caffeine shortly.  Five pounds may seem like a lot, but at around 45 cents/ounce, this is a great price.

review/summary: Not bad.
review/text: The product itself is a decent quality chocolate covered coffee bean.  I don't mean "decent" to be derogatory more so than I mean it to convey a sense of "what do you expect at such a good price?"<br /><br />I did not buy these for a community jar, or what have you, I bought these for my own personal consumption and they fit the bill perfectly.  They are a great snack in the morning on the way to school, or when I'm up bright and early to go fishing, or when I'm merely sitting on the computer reading the morning news (gotta love technology).<br /><br />I do have to disagree with the "cigarette smoke" aftertaste; I did not get that at all.<br /><br />Again, if you have specific tastes for your coffee beans, you probably ought to skip these.  However, if you want bulk and consider 'a coffee bean a coffee bean' then you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing, if you ship any sort of chocolate in the summer months, it has the distinct possibility of melting, no matter the lengths the distributor goes to prevent it.  These distributors gave fair warning about this and gave me the opportunity to cancel.  I took a chance and, although my item did in fact melt, it was not that bad and I consider this a good buy.

review/summary: Good taste and texture, not much of an energy boost
review/text: I've tried chocolate-covered espresso beans from several different companies over the years.  Usually, two "beans" is all it takes for a mild energy boost that doesn't jangle the nerves.  My favorite supplier sold their business and stopped selling them, and so I decided to try Koppers.  Although it has a pleasant taste, good texture, and is a high quality product, Koppers doesn't have any effect otherwise.  If you're looking for something to replace a cup of coffee to keep you alert or increase your energy level temporarily, this isn't it, unless perhaps you're willing to eat five to seven of them at a time.

review/summary: Didn't last 6 minutes
review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/text: I was extremely happy with the freshness and packaging of these cookies the last time I ordered. Another reviewer stated that they were extremely disapointed with the cookies, arriving broken. To that I ask, why didn't they contact the company for a replacement?  Granted, it's disappointing to have paid for your item and then find it arrived damaged, but stuff happens in transit and I'm sure the company would have been happy to make up for that and make good on their quality product.<br /><br />In the past Biscoff was more expensive through their site, biscoff.com. Now they're offering this Family Pack (256 cookies) also on their site for $23.95.  If you're just looking to get the biscuit cookied, this is the best deal, whether you buy on Amazon or Biscoff.com.  That's just 9 cents per cookie. If you do the math the other cookie items range from 11 to 30 cents per cookie, ouch! So buy the "Family Pack" if you're looking to get the basic Biscoff cookies for as cheaply as you can. They won't last long enough to get stale anyway!

review/summary: light, crisp, elegant, slightly ginger, not too sweet belgium cookies
review/text: I saw the reviews for it while I was looking for some international snacks on Amazon and everyone really liked it so I ordered it and it was well worth the wait.  They're elegantly made, being flattened but slightly curvy, light in weight and texture but definitely crispy when you bite into them. They're like thin biscotti in that they're crispy and light and they're better to eat when you dunk them in your coffee or tea and they're not too sweet and they have slightly  gingery/cinnamon (but not overpowering) taste.  They're like elegant gourmet lightly made ginger cookies - I can see why everyone loves them!  I buy them regularly for my mom.  Fortunately, I've found that our local Walgreen's has them all the time - they're that popular!!  Giving them to a friend would be like giving your friend a very special treat.  I would definitely buy them again!!

review/text: Wonderful cookies!!  Was planning to ghive some way for gifts.  Decided not to.  They will not last long anyway.  It is hard not to eat a pack in a say or 2.  These are alittle smaller than the ones you get on Delta Airlines.

review/summary: Great freshness.. great taste
review/text: I was first introduced to Speculoos during a business trip to France. The Biscoff family pack provided me with every thing I dreamed about Speculoos and more. My wife and I use them almost every morning with espresso or latte. I prefer them with espresso. It has great taste, very fresh and crispy and it is a great deal. Shipping and delivery was extremely fast and efficient. Yes, I will order it again.

review/summary: The Best Cookies Ever - See Shipping Note!
review/text: Continental Airlines has served these cookies for many years.  I, too, got my first taste on a business flight and was immediately hooked.  I just wanted to mention that the shipping is a flat $5 if you order directly from biscoff.com , rather than the $9.45 price listed on the item here.  I believe the flat rate is rather new, but it will be especially welcome during the holiday season as the cookies make great stocking stuffers!

review/text: Product was delivered with none broken. Quality item with a consistent taste. Only thing is these are cheaper to by directly from Lotus Bakery than Amazon and this particular size is not the jumbo size given out on the airline. Next time will by them directly from Lotus Bakery - they have greater variety and are a little cheaper.

review/summary: Biscoff cookies rock
review/text: I've been a big fan of Biscoff cookies since a long time. They are from Belgium and they are delicious crispy caramelized cookies with a hint of cinnamon. They go great with coffee. The good thing is that they are not too sweet, you never get fed up with them! I always buy 5-6 packages of the family size Biscoffs and keep them in my kitchen pantry for anytime. Found out that they are available in Safeway and in Walgreens too!!! Life is short, have a Biscoff!!!!

review/summary: Airplane cookies! YUM!
review/text: These cookies are so good. I love them. I first had them on our round-trip Delta flight to Hawaii last fall. I asked for extra. I recently discovered them at a national chain drugstore and here they are on amazon, too! They are so delicious but it's hard to stop eating them once you start...or so I hear...haha. I am not sure about any packaging/shipping issues that may be a problem. Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious Cookies - Not so great packaging/shipping
review/text: This was my 2nd order of these fantastically delicious cookies. Like most others, I discovered them while traveling on Delta Flights.  Well my last trip I asked for more and when the "stingy" FA didn't soothe my palet to my liking...I vowed to look them up and by my own! The 1st shipment I ordered 2 family pack cases. Good thing too cause I insisted my wife try them and now have her hooked! So for my next order I ordered 3 cases. The first shipment arrived w/o damage - no cookie damage, cracks, crumbs etc when opening a pkg. For the second shipment of three packs, we've been through about 3 or 4 packs and this time we have crumbs and cracks...cookie looks fine and breaks when you grab it out the pack.  Unfortunate for such great tasting cookies! I only hope it's limited to a few packs. They should at least label the box fragile to curb some of the rough handling, tossing, and stacking. But that's a ding on S/H...the product is GREAT!!!

review/text: My wife picked up a couple of packages of these cookies from the local grocer (Kroger). They were on sale, 2/$5, much cheaper then what they sell for on here. Anyway, a wonderful cookie that is like a crisp ginger cookie. They go great with coffee. Try your local grocer in the imported food section and if you don't see them, ask them to start stocking them, you will be hooked on these little pieces of heaven.

review/summary: favorite cookies
review/text: I stumbled upon these in my local grocery store last year and decided to give them a try as they looked similar to my favorite cookies that I used to buy in Germany (Speculatius).  Love Love Love these!  They're not quite as thin as the German ones, but they're the same rich consistency and fabulous with a cup of tea.  By the way, the ones I buy at the store are often broken as well ... I think it's an issue with the way the distributor packs the boxes.  Even broken, they're great!

review/summary: Tasted burnt, but company sent new pack!
review/text: I was so excited to get these, but the taste was nothing like I remembered!  The cookies tasted burnt, and the color was a lot darker than pictured.  When I contacted the company, they blamed it on the packaging, saying they hear this complaint a lot with the family pack.  The person I talked to said I'd have more luck with the individually wrapped ones, so she sent me a free box of those.  I'm not quite sure how the recipe/cooking process would be different based on how the cookie is packaged--makes no sense to me!--but the company did redeem themselves by offering a new pack.  And they do indeed taste a little better.

review/summary: Packaging Problem
review/text: I first tried the biscoff cookies on my way to New Orleans. AirTran was serving these as snacks for the travelers. I liked it so much that I decided to order a family size from the Biscoff company. Unfortunately, when they arrived I noticed that most of the cookies were cracked, chipped, essentially crumbled into pieces. Why wouldn't it be when the cookies were just packed in a weak wrapper/packaging box and had been tossed around during the period of shipment?<br /><br />I'm fairly disappointed that I wasted my money on a bunch of destroyed cookies.

Part of what I had to do was to<br /><br />clean up after arriving flights as people departed the planes.  Luckily<br /><br />the sloppy passengers left a few packages of Biscoff for me to gobble up<br /><br />as I did my rounds.  I was addicted instantly to these tasty morsels.<br /><br />Thankfully I have escaped this demeaning and demoralizing work where the rich passengers treat you with contempt.  Now I can enjoy my Biscoff and<br /><br />curse the miscreants who populate the sky today.

review/summary: Awesome good stuff!
review/text: Twenty-something years ago my husband and I and our two kids went to St. Lucia.  While there, we visited the Baron's factory because my husband is very into hot sauces.  This one, Baron's West Indian Hot Sauce, a mustard-based sauce, became his very favorite.  For those twenty years I have ordered it from a distributor in Indiana, but recently when I went to do so, their website was gone. AAAGH! I was thrilled to discover I could get it on Amazon and ordered two big bottles.  He says it's "smooth; I love it not being vinegar-based, and it brings back the islands in my mind.  Just hot enough".

review/text: I found this hot sauce the very first time in Los Angeles at the farmer's market at the grove. I fell in love. I was going through the small 14oz bottles in about 2 weeks and they were expensive,  so I was so excited to find these HUGE bottles on amazon for the great price. The shipping is almost as expensive as the hot sauce, so I tend to order about 3 bottles at a time so they can last me a few months. This is some HOT sauce, with an incredible flavor. Its wonderful in indian food, and mixed with ketchup or ranch but I pretty much put it on all my foods. I highly recommend it!

review/text: I am very much into hot sauces and came across this one by accident. Wow, this stuff is amazing and gets the full 5 stars from me. It carries enough heat and is loaded with flavor. It should carry a warning on the label to advise people that it is highly addictive. After using it about 6 times, your body gets the craving for it. I have plenty stocked up and under locked doors.
