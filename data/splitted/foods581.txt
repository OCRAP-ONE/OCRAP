review/summary: That's Some Spicy Sauce!
review/text: My husband and I used the Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce on some steak fajitas we made a few evenings ago. We were out of picante sauce so we decided to use the Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce. It was spicy with a strange twang. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. In a way, it was good. On the other hand, the taste was too different for my tame tastebuds.<br />I imagine that people who frequent Taco Bell will be excited to be able to purchase this sauce. I believe the taste will grow on me, but for now, I am sticking to picante.

review/summary: Good chipotle flavor for your tacos
review/text: Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is the third of the Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy line we have tried at home, and it is our favorite.  Both my wife and I liked this one the best out of the three.  The other two were the Jalapeno sauce and the spicy ranchero sauce.  We liked all three, but we liked this one a bit more.<br /><br />We actually make tacos at home quite often, and that is when we used this sauce.  However, it could be good on other things too.  It has a good flavor, and if you are like me and order chipotle items off of menus when you are out, you most likely would like this sauce at home as I do.<br /><br />There are 110 calories per 2 Tbsp.  100 of those calories come from the 11g of fat. (Soybean oil is the main ingredient  So this is not a diet condiment, but how many are?  No different than most mayo you get.  If you want less fat, you should use salsa type toppings on your tacos.<br /><br />If you like chipotle flavor, this is a good sauce for your tacos and other foods.  I like it and will get it again.

review/summary: Bold and Creamy Chipotle
review/text: This sauce really was yummy - it does have a little kick to it, though. I prefer it to the other flavors that Taco Bell also offers. My only complaint is that it was expired the day it arrived. We ate it with our fajitas that night, but I had to throw the rest of it away.

review/summary: Good sauces...
review/text: I tried two of the Taco Bell sauces: the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle. Both are tasty and reminiscent of the Southwest Sauce served in Subway stores. (A personal favorite.)<br /><br />I tried the Chipotle in a beef taco and the Ranchero with chicken. In neither case was the flavor overpowering. They were just nice flavor additions, a little extra zing, to an otherwise good meal.<br /><br />Of the two sauces, though, I gotta say I like the Chipotle best. The spiciness lingers longer. But not in a "get me some water now!" way. Just a nice added zing.<br />Overall, I think they are both flavorful. Worth having around for the occasional Mexican treat.

review/summary: Not for us....
review/text: On rare occasion, we do stop off at Taco Bell. That was why I decided to give this Chipotle Sauce a try. We tried it on sliced cucumber -- not so good. We tried it on some roast beef -- not so good.<br /><br />I am sure that this sauce will be loved in another home, but not mine. That "smoke" flavor was overpowering, and the taste was just heavy in an unpleasant way.<br /><br />Sorry bo be so critical, but our reaction was negative. We did consider mixing it with mayo or sour cream, but realized that we were only trying to dilute something we already didn't like.

He spread a little bit on the sandwich he was in the middle of eating.  He says it's good!  Not super hot but has a good pepper flavor.

review/summary: Not my favorite - perhaps best used in beef dishes.
review/text: I had the opportunity to sample and evaluate 3 different flavors of Taco Bell's bottled sauces. These were the Jalapeno, Chipotle and Spicey Ranchero flavors. Of the 3, I personally liked the Jalapeno flavor the most with the Spicey Ranchero coming in a close second. The flavors are bold so a little sauce goes a long way.<br /><br />I approached this evaluation from the standpoint that these sauces are condiments, like ketchup or mustard, and not just sauces that you might put on your tacos and burritos. That said, I tasted each flavor on fish sticks with pleasant results. The only sauce I did NOT like on them was the Chipotle sauce, which I feel might be better suited to dishes that include beef. The Jalapeno and Spicy Ranchero both work really well with fish (and would be great for fish tacos) as well as chicken. Used as a condiment, these sauces can add a new flavor experience to everything from deli sandwiches to casseroles. I added about 2 tbsp of the Spicey Ranchero to a batch of left over rice along with some cheese and a bit of sour cream to make a great side dish. A lot of recipes that call for mayo might be livened up or rejuvenated with a measure of your favorite sauce.

review/summary: Heat Up Your Fall!
review/text: It's no secret that I like spicy food. When I reviewed Taco Bell's Home Originals Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce a little while back, I noticed two little words on the label that really got me hopeful: Home Originals. Will there be more flavors in this line?<br />Yes! Bold and Creamy Chipotle sauce is even more flavorful. Chipotle peppers are fiery chili pepper made by smoking jalapeno peppers. The smokiness adds a depth that's just hard to beat. If you like creamy hot sauces, you will love this on all those fall meals: tail gate parties, hot dogs, fries, rice and grilled veggies. It's zippy with out being overwhelming and tasty without being  tongue numbing. As always, it's great on all you Mexican food faves. I know this will be a stock item in my fridge.

review/summary: Not much to say
review/text: Clearly, this sauce provides an alternative to traditional non-franchised sauces.  It's a runny salad dressing that has some tang and a lot of calories. Whereas adults will find the taste, color, and texture largely unappealing, children may like it based on their experiences with Taco Bell.  This sauce is not "hot" by any measure and not even close to any real Mexican sauces. I consider myself a fan of real Mexican food having lived in San Diego for 13 years.  This sauce is garbage compared to what any small restaurant or even street vendor on the border can produce.<br /><br />As with any processed food, the nutritional value is horrible and I doubt I will use it again.  In 2 TBSP, which is not a lot, you will consume 110 calories, 300mg sodium, and 11g of fat.  Who eats this stuff? These nutritional facts do not seem apparent on the Amazon product page.<br /><br />Bottom line- if you your eating habits are garbage, this sauce fits right in.  If you try and eat healthy, stay away. You will find very little return in terms of taste versus nutrition.

review/summary: Great flavor -- something new
review/text: I was sort of looking for a product like this and luckily for me, this one became available.<br /><br />The actual Taco Bell Restaurants used to have a taco salad that I liked and, unexplainably, they discontinued it -- but by incorporating the ingredients that they formerly used and by topping the salad with this dressing, it tastes much the same to me.<br /><br />Over and above that, if you're tired of the same old Italian or Ranch dressing on your green salad this will bump it up a notch. It's especially good if you include sliced boiled eggs in your salads. You can also use this dressing (a small amount) to infuse an entirely new flavor into your home-made coleslaw.<br /><br />Everyone in the household who tried this product liked it so you're not going to be stuck with something unwanted if you give it a try.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Much better than their spicy ranchero sauce
review/text: Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce is much better than their ranchero sauce which had a burnt taste that I didn't like at all.  This sauce hits the taste buds with a sharp creamy pepper, vinegar, and smokey barbecue taste, and leaves a smooth barbecue and vegetable aftertaste with it.  I know the thought of vinegar and barbecue sauce on mexican foods sounds strange but it actually compliments tacos quite well.  It's a little too strong for dishes with plenty of flavor already like fajitas, and it might also be too much for a dipping sauce, but it adds a nice kick to tacos, nachos, burritos, and even cheese pizza.<br /><br />If you don't like the kick of vinegar or prefer milder salsas or sour cream flavors, this is not the complimentary sauce for you, but in the ranks of chipotle in general, its definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Good Once in a While
review/text: Taco Bell has always been a tasty treat, but not a very healthy snack choice. The Chipotle Sauce by Taco Bell is definitley tasty. I tried it on a homemade taco and it was great. I also tried it on a turkey sandwich and it added a much-needed zing. However it also added about 11g fat and 110 calories. That's like adding half a McDonald's Quarter Pounder to your taco in terms of fat content. [...]<br /><br />That being said, I wouldn't eat this sauce every day. I would try it once in a while on an otherwise bland food choice, and probably on a workout day. It's truly bursting with flavor, so if you're not on a diet it's a nice change of pace.

review/text: This sauce is ok.  It is no where near as good as the other Taco Bell sauces.  It has a mild taste and is quite ok on whatever you want to put it on.  If I could have tried this one before the other two I might have given it a higher rating.  That being said, if you like a mild Chipotle taste you will like this sauce.  It is pretty good on french fries.  I have tried it on several things and once again it does add a decent taste, there just isn't a zing there.  One thing as with the other Taco Bell sauces, a little goes a long way.

review/summary: not the newest craze
review/text: This chipotle sauce is nothing too exciting to write home about. It doesn't taste bad, it just isn't anything super special, I "have to have" kind of sauce.<br />I enjoy it; the sauce is creamy - not as creamy as the Jalepe&ntilde;o, whose flavour I enjoy more - and it is flavourful. I use it on sandwiches, wraps, and pita pockets.<br />I have nothing bad to say, but I don't want to seem like I'm trying to spice up my review or give a false impression that I'd go out and buy this as often as I can.<br />I may or may not buy it again, but then again, I'm not the biggest chipotle fan; I just wanted to try it and see how it tasted. Not bad, but again: I prefer the jalepe&ntilde;o,<br />probably 'cause I love the taste of jalepe&ntilde;o a lot. I've tasted at least one other chipotle sauce, and this one isn't quite as good as that one, but, again, it's not bad, just not "the best."

review/summary: Adding A Nice Zing To A Meal
review/text: I'm not a huge Mexican food buff; if I find myself in a Mexican restaurant with someone else, I can find something appealing, and if I'm in the home of someone who's serving Mexican food I can enjoy it, but never in my life have I requested a Mexican meal or a visit to a Mexican restaurant.  The only exception is if I want fast food at a VERY low price and I'm tired of the same old burger-and-fries routine; then Taco Bell might come into the running, if I'm going to be passing one anyway.<br /><br />The reason I bring this up is that I used this Taco Bell chipotle sauce on foods that might not necessarily be what you'd have in mind: a variety of sandwiches (it goes especially well with turkey and chicken) as well as bacon and eggs, meals which would not pack much of a kick without this sauce.  With that you might think that the sauce would overpower the rest of the food, but it didn't.  It was really a perfect complement: spicy, but not with enough of a kick to dominate the meal or make my eyes burn and mouth water, and with that smoky chipotle flavor, rich and full-bodied.<br /><br />This is how it tastes on foods that pack minimal spicy kick on their own.  I guess it might end up getting lost in a meal with other spices and peppers and whatnot.  It may well work fine in such a dish, or it may not.  For my purposes I was very pleased with this product.

review/summary: Taste is great but Nutrition Facts prove hazzardous
review/text: I like Taco Bell. That may explain why I really like the taste of this Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce. It is good right from the bottle, two drips per chip, as a corn chip dip. Make nachos with a plate of chips, ladled with ground beef and onion mix, then pour on the Chipotle Sauce. What an appetizer; but unfortunately at the same calorie, fat, sodium, levels as most fancy restaurant dishes, or those huge multi-meat bacon cheese burgers. So for those who do not have to count calories or healthy nutrition, it's tasty. Spicy and flavorful without being HOT, at least to my liking, as I enjoy a bit of heat.<br /><br />If you're not a Mexican fast-food fan, you might find this product a bit unsophisticated. In that case, if the supreme high-priced Tex-Mex restaurants are your cup of tea, then skip this product. But if you want to spice up the celery, carrots and green peppers on your ball game night snack food tray, this may be as good as Taco Bell delivering to your door.<br /><br />Good also as a high calorie taco salad dressing. Unfortunately, I can't tell you if it is good on a taco because I ran the bottle dry before I got to trying it on a real taco.<br />If only they could reproduce the taste with heart healthy nutrition levels.<br />Oh well, I'll bet it's good on a cheeseburger.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: This Chipotle Sauce is very tasty, and it can be used with many different things. However I loved it the most with vegetarian meat (I'm a vegetarian, living healthy and all *grins*), and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich, or with cooked vegetarian meat. However this sauce is very fattening, hence why I took one star out, it contains 11 grams of fat in 2 tbsp. So one needs to be careful to have it in very small portions, or make sure to have a good workout session after indulging in a good hearty meal containing this sauce.<br /><br />Overall I love this Chipotle sauce, very tasty.

review/summary: No mi quiero Taco Bell
review/text: I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, "Flavored mayonnaise".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, "Yo no quiero Taco Bell".<br /><br />Not recommended.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I've tried using this on chicken and hamburgers and really liked it. It's a nice change from ketchup and BBQ sauces. The Chipotle has a spicy tang but it's overwhelming. It's probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual Taco Bell restaurant. It actually has a slightly sweet taste. It is a bit salty and creamy for those who are health conscious, but I find that even a small bit provides a lot of flavor and can be spread quite far over your meal. The bottle seems a bit smaller than you might expect, but other than that I'd recommend this.

review/summary: All right, but not extraordinary
review/text: I'm going to resist the urge to say it's not hot enough, because I don't care; some things are very hot, and good or bad, and some things are milder, and good or bad. It's not all that hot, but if that were the primary criterion, I'd go eat a pepper. If the basic flavor is all right, you can always add peppers with no harm done.<br /><br />I had tried the Taco Bell Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce and liked it quite a bit, more as an ingredient than straight. I do not think this is as good. It does have a bit of smoke flavor, and that's pleasant, but I find it has a noticeable artificial taste that was missing from the jalape&ntilde;o sauce. It's almost a rubber-like taste (not texture--that's fine), and I'm not sure how much it would have to be diluted to make it go away. We tried it straight on tacos, and while my husband said it was good enough, it still tasted a bit like a tire to me. I'm not sure whether this means I am a delicate and sensitive flower, or that he is an oblivious lout with no sense of nuance. I will allow that I might have been looking for it after taking a taste directly from the bottle--not the best idea I've ever had.<br /><br />I'll work with it some more to see if I can find a dish it goes with well; it's not a total loss, and we'll finish the bottle--eventually.

review/summary: Excellent but Too Salty
review/text: This product is very good.  The connection with Taco Bell adds a familiarity.  The packaging is excellent as is the color of the product.  The color and the taste are consistent, which is good.  The flavor is very balanced in body, mouth feel, acidity and spiciness.  It has a genuine peppery flavor with just enough temperature but not too hot.  The only thing that needs to be changed is that it is way too salty.  I added a little to way under seasoned food and it was just right.  Otherwise, adding it to food of normal degree of seasoning would be too salty.  It is a shame because the taste is so good.  You want to use a fair amount but that would make the food too salty.  Less salt will let the nice flavors come off better.  Salt helps to bring up flavor except if there is too much.  Then it obscures and overpowers the intrinsic flavor of the product itself and ultimately the dish that it is being added to.

review/text: This Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is pretty good, especially if you're a huge taco Bell fan and want to recreate the taste at home.<br /><br />The Chipotle flavor is pretty mild as chipotle goes, but it does have a little kick to it. This flavor is definitely spicer than the Jalapeno Taco Bell sauce flavor. We liked it on (another fast food chain's!) chicken pieces!<br /><br />It's also good as a taco salad topping instead of dressing. We love to make our own taco salads, and none of us are fans of most bottled dressing, and this was actually nice.<br /><br />Also try the milder Taco Bell Jalapeno sauce.

review/summary: A delicious, spicy sauce
review/text: Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is fabulous on tacos and burritos.  It's wonderful on sandwiches and salads, too.  Anywhere you'd enjoy a little bit of "kick" with your meal, a pour of Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is the answer.<br /><br />You can even mix it into other sauces for a bolder flavor.  Maybe adding it to bechamel when making macaroni and cheese or to alfredo sauce over pasta would be a mouth-watering adventure.  The uses for this sauce is limited only by your imagination.

review/summary: Smoky with a bit of a kick ...
review/text: I jumped at the opportunity to try out this sauce -- I'm a big fan of Taco Bell and I love chipotle mustard on sandwiches, so I figured this would be some good stuff.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.  It has that distinctive chipotle taste in a sauce that is slightly thicker than creamy ranch dressing.  So far, I've used it on southwest chicken salad (romaine topped with grilled chicken, black beans, corn, diced red bell pepper, jack cheese, and some chopped fresh tomato).  It compliments those flavors well.  Because it's so thick, you don't need to use a lot to get the flavor spread around.  I've also used it on sandwiches (turkey with provolone, roast beef with cheddar, ham with swiss), and it's very nice.  Adds a slightly spicy touch without being overpowering.<br /><br />Will I purchase again?  I think so.  Not sure I'd be able to use 6 bottles of the stuff, but a bottle or so once in awhile seems probable.

review/text: I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got this, but I was pleasantly surprised. I made some taco salads and these worked great. Tastes good and pours well. Has a nice open and close top which makes it convenient.<br /><br />Probably the only downside is the limited use of the product. What can one use Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce on?<br /><br />Will I buy it again? Probably, but only if my budget allows it, as it seems cheaper to just mix salsa and sour cream together to make the same thing.

review/summary: Taco Bell done good
review/text: Overall, we were very pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste of this stuff. This chipoltle is mixed in a creamy rather distinctive Red pepper and Paprika base and while that would have been enough sweetness for my palate, they do unfortunately add sugar. At least there is no corn syrup which is an absolute no-no.<br /><br />It's great on burgers, cheese steak hoagies, etc, as the smoky undertone with the zip of roasted jalapeno works well with meat and some cheeses.<br /><br />We are yet to see it on any store shelves around here but if we do we will definitely buy a bottle from time to time to snazz things up when the mood strikes.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: Taco Bell has outdone themselves this time.  This chipotle sauce is just right.  The sauce itself resembles French dressing, but milder.  The pureed chipotle pepper is a mild but pleasant chile, so they blend perfectly.  The oil used is soybean oil.  There's just a tinge of garlic flavor, as well as red bell pepper, to even things out.<br /><br />It contains 110 calories per serving size (two tablespoons), 300 mg. sodium, and the daily value of vitamin A is four percent.<br /><br />This sauce would be great on a salad or a sandwich.  It is also recommended for tacos, but I require more of a tomato-based salsa on my tacos.  To each his own.<br /><br />Yes, I will make this a permanent staple in my home.  Not too hot, not too intrusive.  Yet not dull.  Pleasantly pleasing would be the words to best describe it.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: To start off the review, I'm going to admit that I've eaten at Taco Bell only a handful of times in my life. Because of that, I'm not sure if this sauce is supposed to replicate a sauce that the restaurants use. Also, I don't know what chipotle sauce is supposed to taste like.<br /><br />Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, the back of the bottle suggests that it's "a perfect finishing touch for your tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps". I tried this sauce with frozen burritos and I also tried it as a dipping sauce for french fries.<br /><br />Overall, I think it tastes pretty good. Another reviewer said that it's mild but I'd say it definitely has a kick to it. If I had to try to explain the taste, I'd say that it reminds me of ranch dressing with some spice added to it. If you're looking to try a "new" sauce for your tacos, I would check this one out.

review/text: About what you might expect from Taco Bell sauce. It's middle-of-the-road in terms of spice and texture. Not too spicy - which was fine for me. The texture was very creamy which might not appeal to everyone. It was workable but nothing terribly exciting. In other words, it got the job done by adding some flavor without getting in the way. It you like your sauces with a bit more bite and more texture, you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this won't disappoint.

review/summary: I'm From New Jersey, what do I know about Chipotle?
review/text: I'm from New Jersey, so I have no idea what authentic Chipotle is supposed to taste like. I have had Chipotle sauce on my sandwich at Subway and I like it better than Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce. I find that the Taco Bell sauce has  a bit of a strong smoke flavor, while the Subway sauce has more of a kick to it. I have also had the Kraft Sandwich shop Chipotle Mayo and have found that to have an artificial chemical taste, the Taco Bell sauce does not have as much of a chemical taste (it does have some) as it does a smokey taste. It is almost like adding a bacon flavor to whatever you put it on. In fact someone tried it on their tacos that I served (just like the picture on the label suggests), and that was exactly what they said, it tasted like bacon on their tacos. Now, I guess bacon on tacos isn't a bad taste, but some may not prefer the flavor. I have been using the sauce on my turkey sandwiches at lunch and it is not bad for that. The sauce has a consistency of Ranch dressing and in fact is in the same shaped bottle as salad dressing. I often get it mixed up with the other dressings in the refrigerator, that may be something that the manufacturer may want to do is change the bottle to something more unique so that it stands out a bit more and is not overlooked with the salad dressings, especially Thousand Island. I agree with the label, the taste is "Bold & Creamy". It is also slightly sour and acidic, though not overly. I do not find it to have much heat, though it does have some. Those who tend to like hot foods will find this sauce to be incredibly disappointing in that respect. I guess Taco Bell had to appeal to the common denominator, which is ok. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the healthiest sauce, it adds fat and calories. I don't have the bottle in front of me, but I remember 2 tablespoons of sauce had more calories than a full glass of Coke and a pretty hefty amount of fat, so use this sauce sparingly. Overall, I think this sauce is quite average, it tastes like a mainstream commercially prepared sauce, it is prepared with common ingredients found in in many other products, it contains preservatives, and there is really nothing unique about it.

review/summary: Delicious at home Taco Bell
review/text: After trying both the Chipotle as well as the Spicy Ranchero sauces I was very happy that Taco Bell decided to branch out their at home selection.<br /><br />When using this sauce with the Taco Belle taco seasoning you get a taco that is pretty close to the flavor that you would get if you went to the restaurant but it's not quite there.<br /><br />Honestly this can be much better though for a few reasons. First you can use your own fresh ingrediants, you don't have to leave the house (just order it here or get during your normal grocery shopping), and lastly, you don't have to deal with the fast food experience; lines, rude cashiers, people that don't wash their hands, and you can save a little money.<br /><br />All in all this is a great way to get a Taco Bell fix in your own kitchen. And if I had to choose one over the other I would easily pick the Chipotle sauce, Mmmm.

review/text: I have seriously been looking for a product JUST like this for a while now in the grocery store when I spotted it here on Amazon.  I wanted a spicy, creamy dipping sauce for fries or to put on chicken sandwiches, etc.  I actually made my own with mayo and taco seasoning...but it was NOWHERE as good as this stuff is!  It's just perfectly flavored -- spicy enough for me (if you don't like spicy food, you won't like this, but it's not extremely spicy).  Creamy and yummy.  The only drawback?  Pretty high in fat (similar to regular mayo or salad dressing).  I use pretty small amounts of it, so that's ok with me...but it would be awesome if they could make a light version.

I haven't tried it as a dressing for taco salad yet, and that may be a better way to use it as it has the texture of a salad dressing.<br /><br />For the price ($20 for 6 bottles??), if I felt I had to have another bottle I'd shop locally rather than order it.

For both flavors, the preference was to use it to spice up some chicken tacos or chicken sandwich. Between the two, if you are serving beef (ground or shredded or a hamburger) -- then this one, the Chipotle, is the better choice. The sauce is very creamy, so if you like mayonaise type sauces, you will probably like this. No one in my house found it very spicy, so you have no worries if you don't like spicy food.

review/summary: What You Would Expect From Taco Bell
review/text: Taco Bell has built their reputation as a Mexican fast food restraunt, that is as successful in the Mid West as it in California.  This means that they make a product that is no thrills and bland enough that everyone will like it.  If you want authentic Mexican food Taco Bell is not for you.  Most Mexican food is very spicy and often has a little kick, I have seen Mexicans that use Tapatio hot sauce on hamburgers, rice and soups and Tapatio packs a kick.  The Chipotle sauce is nice and bland which is how most people like their food but it really does not pack the kick that a typical authentic Chipotle sauce has.  I tried it on tacos which was not good at all and nachos which actually was pretty good.  If Taco Bell is your choice for burritos and tacos than you will like the Chipotle Sauce.

However, It isn't something that I think I'll be picking up on every shopping trip.  The container is a nice size that should be fine for a few family dinners before running out.  If you are looking for a new sauce, I suggest trying this one. Taste is so subjective a thing that you just might like it!

As for taste, if you had a Baja flavored chalupa from Taco Bell, imagine the Baja flavoring having a badass cousin who rides in on Vespa. One of my friends used it for a salad dressing for his taco salad, but I was more horrified than interested at that point. Like I said, it has the consistency of sour cream.<br /><br />In summation, I love it for my nachos, especially now for football season. However, the bottle is small and you're lucky to get 10 servings from a bottle.

review/summary: Slightly smoky and creamy is more like it
review/text: Taco Bell recently introduced a new line of three "Bold & Creamy" sauces for the home market. Each is based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. The Bold and Creamy Chipotle Sauce adds chipotle chile pepper puree, chipotle chili pepper, extractives of paprika, and natural smoke flavor to the basic recipe.<br /><br />As with the other two sauces, I tried the Chipotle Sauce first on regular Taco Bell tacos, both crunchy and soft. As with the others, I still prefer a traditional taco sauce on my tacos. It is also a fairly mild sauce to those of us who first experienced Mexican food before there were chain taco places. There is a slight-though-perceptible heat that lingers for maybe a minute if you don't drink or eat something else immediately. There is  a mild smoke flavor, which would be expected given the ingredients.<br /><br />I tried it with some plain tortilla chips. The chipotle and smoke flavors come through clearly when there is little in the way of competing tastes. Still, I'd rather have a traditional chunky salsa with my chips. I can't see myself using this sauce again on tacos, but I do think it might be good on a hamburger or as a dipping sauce for onion rings. I plan to try it on both after the current heat wave has passed. When it's this hot (95� - 105�), I try to avoid any cooking that adds to the heat load the air conditioning is managing. I'll update this review after I've tried these items with the Bold and Creamy Chipotle Sauce.<br /><br />One note: the "Best if Used By" date on the bottle I received was only about six weeks after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a room temperature bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. Perhaps it was from an older lot, but it's something to bear in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale.

You only need a small amount to get a lot of flavor.<br /><br />I cooked 1/2 cup of Morningstar crumbles and 1/2 cup of Rotel tomatoes in a skillet till the liquid was cooked.  Then I removed from skillet, added 2 tblsp. chipotle sauce, added daiya non-dairy cheddar cheese and put in a tortilla wrap.<br /><br />Goes great with a side of refried beans, black beans, or Mexican corn.  Low in calorie, healthy, and filling.  I definitely recommend.  The only thing that would make it better is if the product were vegan.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Chipotle Sauce.  It is kind-of like a spicy mayonnaise.  I used this sauce in tuna salad, on sandwiches and as a salad dressing.<br /><br />Similar to mayo, almost all of the calories come from fat.  I think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice.  You can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn't leave your mouth burning.  It's a good balance of flavors.

review/summary: Not really bold
review/text: To give you an insight into how bold this sauce is, I recently bought some Kraft Chipotle Mayonnaise and the mayo was much spicier than this sauce. I like the taco sauce that you get in the restaurants and thought this would be similar, but it's a far cry from the packets. The smokiness is a little too fake and the aftertaste is off-putting. I know some may consider this a small thing to complain about, but the mouth of the bottle is the size of a salad dressing bottle, so you have to be careful when pouring or it gets all over. That is not something many people necessarily want, especially since the recommended two tablespoon serving size is 110 calories and 11 grams of fat.

review/summary: Its alright
review/text: I ordered this up because I often get the southwest chipotle sauce at a certain national sandwich shop. I thought it might be great to have this flavor at home. The Taco Bell version had the spice, but not the flavor I was looking for. In addition to trying the sauce on my favorite turkey sandwich I also tried it on a tossed salad which was good. At the end of the day, I'm glad I tried it and I certainly didn't think it was so bad I should throw away the unused quantity. That said, it just wasn't what I was hoping for and I'm not sure I'd order it again.

review/summary: BBQ sauce flavor overwhelms, Mexican spice minimal
review/text: From the look of it, Taco Bell's new "Bold and Creamy" Chipotle sauce looks like it may be a spicy-cheesy concoction fans of quick-serve Mexican food would enjoy. This is deceiving. The pastel orange color masks its true nature: it is essentially a remixed BBQ sauce. The BBQ-inspired taste is so strong that it actually drowns out the chili pepper, garlic, and other spices Taco Bell blended with its chipotle recipe.<br /><br />This product is made to be used with tacos hard and soft. That being said, the reviewer tried it with a ham and cheese sandwich as well as a taco. It made no difference either way. The BBQ flavor will make itself fans or critics based solely on how the consumer feels about the southern staple's fusion into Mexican food.<br /><br />The packaging is clean looking and attractive. The Taco Bell logo is at the top, with an appetizingly loaded hard taco taking up a good 60 percent of the label. My sole gripe is that while the name (chipotle) refers to smoke-dried jalapeno peppers, the sauce has no kick to it. Taco Bell ought to do more market research on consumer preferences for "bold" being synonymous with hotness in this style of cuisine. Fans of old school Mexican-American food should pass on the disappointingly one-dimensional Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6).

review/summary: Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce
review/text: I enjoyed this Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce.  Even though the Chipotle flavor wasn't very strong, I did enjoy the flavor and the moderate zip (not quite a real "hot") that it provided the tacos, burritos and nachos that I tried it on. Like the other Taco Bell sauces that I have tried (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98">Jalapeno Sauce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRO1S2">Ranchero Sauce</a>), I didn't enjoy it as a dip with tortilla chips and found it had a bit of an aftertaste.  However, I thought it complimented the mix of bean, meat, cheese and tomato etc. in other Mexican style foods very well.  It's not overly smokey like some chipotle products and the heat level is somewhere slightly below the average medium salsa.  It's a good replacement for sour cream in Mexican style foods if you want to try something different, and although I won't use it every time, I do plan on keeping some in the fridge.

It's a little high in fat at 11g. per serving.  But, if you're doing low carb there's only 3g. per serving.  My only problem is the serving size - 2 TBS.  There's no way I can just eat 2 TBS!

review/summary: Moderately Spicy Sandwich Spread
review/text: This spread has a decent smokey flavor of Chipotle, but it isn't super spicy. I really liked the flavor, actually. It advertises as something to use on wraps, tacos, and Mexican salads, but I wouldn't suggest it for a salad dressing. It is essentially a flavored mayo or sandwich spread, so the base is thick like a mayo. I think it would be excellent on a sandwich, wrap, or even a taco or burrito, but it would probably be too heavy for a salad dressing.<br /><br />Since this spread has enough spice on its own, I tried it on a prociutto and provolone wrap with sprouts. It gave it that great tang and zip without overpowering the sandwich. It was tasty and definitely added something to the sandwich. I am excited to try the other flavors put out by the Taco Bell line!

review/summary: Not What I Expected, But Good
review/text: I love the taste of chipotle, and have used the dried pepper most often in marinades, rubs, and chile. When I tried this sauce, it was different than I expected. Picture a creamy dressing like Ranch with the smoky taste of chipotle peppers and other seasonings.<br /><br />At first I couldn't figure out how to use it. The bottle depicts it being used on a taco, but I prefer fresh salsas for that purpose. But I've used it in several meals with great success: as a condiment for broiled meats; as a dressing on sandwiches; and to add an "adult" flavor to the chicken nuggets I was forced to eat when my kids wanted them for lunch! I think it would also make a good dipping sauce for fresh vegetables, chicken fingers, maybe fried zucchini...? It's the kind of sauce you'd want to use in small amounts on the side, rather than pouring it over a whole salad or even a whole taco.<br /><br />A worthwhile addition to your stock of condiments.

Regular taco sauce and sour cream both proved superior.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you're a real chipotle fan or just bored out of your gourd with traditional Mexican condiments.

Just get some lettuce, slice up a tomato, add some mexican cheese, black olives and pour some of this sauce on it and you got a taco bell-like salad!  It's pretty good on veggie burgers, too!<br /><br />If you like mexican and want to add some zest to mexican food, burgers, sandwich wraps or a salad, give it try for something different!

review/summary: Tricky to meld with my summertime harvest
review/text: This Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is a robust sauce with strong chipotle flavor and a creamy consistency. Ingredients include soybean oil, whey, vinegar, buttermilk, sugar and egg yolks, with less than 2 percent chipotle chile pepper puree.<br /><br />I had some confused idea based on the packaging that this was a chipotle sauce mainly for salads. It's a bit too flavored and strong with chipotle flavor to go well with my typical summer salads consisting of arugula, lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, anchovies and nuts, with the produce items hand-grown and picked. If I subtracted the anchovies, the sauce harmonized better, but still, this definitely is not an all-purpose flavoring. I think there may be too many warring ingredients for a theme to come through for this sauce.<br /><br />So I switched to adding it to homemade tacos consisting of queso fresco or Monterey jack cheese with chopped onions, homegrown grape tomatoes on fresh tortillas from the nearby tortilleria. Much better results. I'm a fan of strong flavors, but it's tricky to figure out the best use for a premade chipotle sauce.<br /><br />I notice Allrecipes has recommendations for enchiladas, turkey wraps, chicken in chipotle sauce and chipotle sweet potatoes, so these may be the best way to go.

I have to admit that I experiment a lot with dressings, sauces, spices, etc of different brands, and it's possible that the strength of "chipotle" flavored ingredients is simply not appealing to me. If you do try this, I'd use only a bit, to test the waters-the flavor and smell went right up my nose.

review/summary: A tasty, radioactive-orange colored condiment
review/text: "A perfect finishing touch for your, tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps." - from the label<br /><br />The Food Police will undoubtedly squeal when confronted by Taco Bell's "Home Originals" BOLD & CREAMY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. Is the home not sacred? Do the fast-food purveyors of unhealthy meals have to invade Man's last refuge? That provocation in itself makes the condiment endearing to me in addition to the fact that it's a striking radioactive-orange color (especially after being dispensed from the plastic squeeze bottle that will probably persist in a landfill until the Sun goes supernova - another endearing goad of the politically correct).<br /><br />For the chipotle experience, I've heretofore relied on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037505AK">Kraft Sandwich Shop Mayo Chipotle, 12-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>). Compared to this, the Taco Bell offering has a bit more intense smoky chipotle bite to it, and there's an undertone of cheese to the flavor perhaps imparted by the dried buttermilk in the ingredients. In any case, I've so far tried this sauce on chicken, beef, cheese sandwiches, eggs, and tater tots and licked drips off my fingers. To the extent used, I prefer it to the Kraft product and would preferentially buy it.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product contains (per 2 Tbsp serving) 110 calories, 11g total fat, 1.5g saturated fat, and 300mg sodium - all of which means that my health and nutrition-conscious wife will likely leave it all for me; I won't have to share.

review/summary: Pointless fat and calories
review/text: Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce is the texture of a weak ranch dressing. Possibly due to this texture, the flavor vaguely reminds me of ranch dressing with some Mexican spices added. It isn't very spicy hot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest thing I've eaten, I'd put this sauce around 3. It is about as spicy as a typical packaged taco seasoning from a kit.<br /><br />I tried the sauce seperately, on a bit of taco meat, and buried in a taco. I can't say that it ever tasted good, but it wasn't too bad when it was only providing a hint of flavor to the taco. I'd much rather have salsa or any of the great liquid hot sauces available online or at the supermarket.<br /><br />According to the label, it has 110 calories and 11g of fat in a 2-Tbsp serving. The top ingredient is soybean oil. It says "contain milk, egg" in the allergen section of the label.

I am not a big fan of heat, but I found myself reaching for the Tabasco when I made a burrito with this, but it worked just fine in a taco with a lot of lettuce and tomato.

review/summary: Cheesy and tasty!
review/text: I love chipotle.  And I love Mexican food.  What I have my doubts about sometimes is pre-fab food bought on the shelf (in other words, anything other than the basics....canned chilis, fresh salsa, and canned beans --or when I'm feeling especially motivated, dried beans I can prepare myself).  But the promise of chipotle flavor was enough to get me to give this a try.<br /><br />I like it!  I first tried it on Taco Bell's own food....a couple of Tacos Supreme.  But I've also used it with the best tortilla chips around.  The chipotle flavor is evident, but it's not overwhelming.  Which is good, because too much chipotle also can be way too hot.<br /><br />I personally would not use this everytime I craved either chipotle or cheese, because I like making my own stuff and because the 300 grams of sodium is too much for me (health wise, not taste wise).  But as a once-in-a-while, easy alternative, this is a condiment worth having on hand.

review/summary: Not as spicy as I expected.  Great taste bud sensation
review/text: I was intrigued with this product from Taco Bell.  So glad I tried it.  I used it on chips and any thing else I could find.  It just was so good to the taste buds.  Not too spicy.<br /><br />It offered a nice compliment to what snack chip I chose and to the ground beef as well.<br /><br />If you like this type of condiment and taste you can't go wrong.  And it's from Taco Bell.<br /><br />Your taste buds will savor it.

review/summary: Unique Taco Sauce
review/text: My family liked this taco sauce and said to give it 5 stars.  I made a hamburger dish with it, with hamburger, rice, this sauce, and crumbled corn chips.  It was quickly gobbled up.<br /><br />The picture on the bottle of this sauce, is that of a taco.  I guess that means it was intended for use on a taco.  However, I made a taco hamburger skillet dish.  I'm sure there are probably lots of recipes somewhere in which you could use this sauce, or you can just create you own, such as I did.  Mine was really simple indeed, but loved by my family.<br /><br />I am used to taco sauce being red, but this is a brownish-orangy, so I guess that makes it unique!  As long as my family liked it, and I didn't have to throw it out (which I didn't), I guess it is good.

review/summary: Not bad but not great
review/text: This creamy sauce is ok but not great.  It tasted oily, more like emulsified soybean oil with spices and chipotle flavor.  It does taste OK on tacos and taco salad though, but I don't recommend it as a dip, it doesn't blend well.  I have to point out that I received this sauce on Oct 4th and the bottle said: "Best if used by 29Sep2011".  Might be a reason why this sauce does not have the best flavor.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: This sauce tastes pretty good! It's creamy, spicy (but not overly so), and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other Mexican-style foods. That said, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is. The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye. So in summary, what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price. I would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack, to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you.

review/summary: Not what I was hoping for
review/text: I tried the Taco Bell Chipotle sauce on my tacos the other night and did not like the flavor at all.  Previously I had tried the Jalapeno sauce and enjoyed it for being different from my regular taco sauce.  Not something I would use a lot but maybe every once it a while.  The chipotle sauce, on the other hand, tasted like a ranch style dressing with a bit of smoke flavor added it.  I was hoping for more of a real chipotle flavor like I've tasted from other sauces like the Tabasco Chipotle sauce.  I doubt I will use this sauce again.

review/summary: Chipotle-flavored ranch dressing
review/text: I'm not a hot hot pepper addict (I can tolerate an 8 or 9 out of ten, but prefer somewhere around a 7), but I am pretty addicted to the flavor of hot sauces, and put them on almost everything. My favorites are chipotle Tabasco and sriracha, but years ago I fell in love with a sauce from a San Jose restaurant that looks a lot like this, so I had high hopes.<br /><br />My first impression was that this just tastes like mildly chipotle-flavored ranch dressing, and given that buttermilk is the first or one of the first ingredients, I guess that makes sense. It's about the same consistency as ranch dressing, too. I've had this over black eyed peas and on a burrito.<br /><br />The chipotle flavor is not strong, and not very spicy -- maybe a five -- so I'm still tempted to add some chipotle Tabasco to augment this. But really, if I'm going to do that, I might as well just mix some ranch dressing and Tabasco, since I'm already stocking those.<br /><br />And yes, as others have noted, this is mostly not a food product, but a chemical concoction you couldn't make at home. It tastes as much like artificial flavoring as it does like anything else. Buuuut, it does taste good, and if you (or your kids) like the chipotle flavor but aren't very heat tolerant, this could be a good option.

It has a tangy, bold flavor that good as an addition to tacos, burritos, nachos, as well as other non traditional items, such as salads and sandwiches. I would definitely recommend it and I look forward to trying it out on other items as well as trying other Taco Bell sauce flavors.

review/text: Yeah, Taco Bell isn't exactly associated with healthy living. While it may say Taco Bell on the label the sauces are actually manufactured by Kraft Foods. They pay Taco Bell to slap their name on the label and voila you get a more recognizable brand. The sauce is pretty typical. It's tangy, creamy with a little spice to it. Great for dipping. Try it out if your a fan of the flavor.

review/summary: Doesnt know what it wants to be
review/text: Well, honestly i didnt know what chipotle was before i got this. But i like sauces and so i just decided to give this a try...but unfortunately this product hasnt left a good impression of chipotle in me.<br />The flavor is some weird mix between spicy and sweet. Your initial taste is of sweetness and then your left with a spicy aftertaste. I had liked the mild sweetness initially. Its also got a smoky flavor in the spicy aftertaste similar to BBQ sauces. But the taste overall is just weak and undistinguishable (unless you put a big chunk in there).<br />On top of the weak taste, it gives you a fair amount fat/calories per serving(110 calories and 11g fat for 2 tablespoons) for a sauce. Personally, i say stay away from this.

review/summary: Bold, sassy flavor
review/text: I tried three of Taco Bell's sauces (creamy jalepeno, chipotle, spicy ranchero) and have reviewed them all on Amazon. This was my least favorite.  The flavor is very strong and overwhelmed food items like traditional beef tacos and fish tacos for me.  However, if you are a true lover of "chipotle flavor" you may have a different opinion.  I could taste the vinegar used in this sauce which is a flavor I do not enjoy which is why I do not like jarred salsas either.<br /><br />I did some further experimenting and baked some cheese enchiladas.  After they came out of the oven I drizzled some sauce over the final product and enjoyed the flavor combination.  I also think it would be good in a cheese ball as the smokiness and bold flavors would add a spark to the traditional cheese ball.

review/text: This sauce is okay, but nothing to write home about.  In the past, my experience with chipotle was on a sub at Subway, which I absolutely loved.  Ever since then, I've been trying to find a close match.  If I'm buying Chipotle sauce in the future, I'll try other brands to see if I can match Subway's perfection.  If there are no other brands, I'll probably pass on buying any type of chipotle sauce.

review/text: The taste reminded me of the salad dressing that fast food restaurants use for taco salads, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's not that great either. For the standard use on burritos, tacos, and misc Mexican food, I didn't care for the taste. However, it worked well w/ hamburgers and as a additional sauce on top of a sushi roll.<br /><br />It's definitely a product that will have varying opinions on the taste, so it's not something I would put on food automatically. I would just leave it on the side if anyone wanted.

review/text: This is one of the milder of the Taco Bell sauces which I have tried, so not too spice, but not completely wimpy either.  It has a great chipotle flavor and nice texture.  Not as thick as mayo, but more like a salad dressing.  Aside from the obvious uses with Mexican food, I have found this works best as a hamburger topping. It is also a nice sandwich spread (but it will tend to run off the sandwich).  This is my new hamburger topping of choice!

review/text: I love tacos.  I love chipotle sauce. I thought this would be the perfect combination of both.  While the sauce was good, it was spicier than I expected and it's creamier texture wasn't quite what I really like.  It was nice for a change in taste, but not something I would use all the time since I'm not a "spicy" person.  I personally will stick with my taco sauce, but if you like spicy and want a creamy texture on your next taco then you will enjoy this product by Taco Bell.

The sauce is more tangy than hot. It is fairly thick and after refrigerating the last quarter of the sauce doesn't flow out very easily even when the bottle is shaken.  The bottle will give you maybe 6 servings.<br /><br />If you like orange colored food and the taste of thousand island dressing you will like this sauce.

review/text: This is a very tasty (and by no means low fat or low calorie) sauce.  I've mostly used it as a dressing for salads (both green salads and things like taco salads), but I've also tried it on burritos and tacos.  A little goes a pretty long way in terms of adding enough flavor, but it's not too overpowering if you like to pour it on, as well.  It's a little bit spicy, giving a bit of a lingering tingle to my mouth, but not so spicy that it's painful (I'm a little bit of a spice wimp, so if you're super into very spicy foods, this is probably too mild for you).

review/summary: Chipotle Chipotle
review/text: Chipotle is one of my favorite flavors in the world.  I cook with them all the time, make chipotle sauces and marinades, and chipotle mustards.  Because I usually make my own sauces and dips, I had pretty low expectations regarding this "Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce."<br /><br />My low expectations were met.<br /><br />The chipotle flavor is stronger than I was expecting, and the taste wasn't bad at all.  Neither was it good.  It has a distinct fast food flavor. This is basically a bottled version of the sauce fast food restaurants might put on their "chipotle burgers" or maybe a "chipotle dip" to each with French fries.  Which is exactly what I used it for.<br /><br />If you are craving that fast food taste at home, then this might be right up your alley.  Me, I would rather just whip together a tin of canned chipotles and some mayonnaise to get roughly the same effect, and probably better.

Plus, it's good for dipping veggies and fries. I'll definitely be buying more of this when my bottle runs out.
