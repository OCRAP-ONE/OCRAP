review/summary: Beautiful
review/text: I purchased this bonsai about a year ago as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. It arrived exactly as pictured. The boyfriend has kept it both indoors and out, and it has thrived. After a year and a move to a significantly different climate, it is still alive and still beautiful, thanks to careful pruning. I would absolutely recommend it.

review/summary: Very Cute, Great for a Gift, the smaller bonsai died
review/text: I got this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws.  It arrived quickly, and in good shape.  They really liked it, and placed it in their living room between two lounge chairs (they live on the beach, so it gets a LOT of light).  The pot is nice, and doesn't look cheap.  The larger Jade tree is now, about 8 months later, in great shape and has grown quite a bit (we are looking in to how to/if to prune it).  The other little tree died a few weeks after they received it, and they just took it out and pushed the soil over the hole (it looks fine still, but this is why I gave it a 4 rather than a 5).<br /><br />UPDATE October 18, 2011.<br />The big bonsai is still alive, 3 years later, and doing well!  It now lives outside on the front porch steps.

review/summary: Looks good, not great
review/text: This is my first bonsai.  I will try to update this review periodically with more information.<br /><br />The plant arrived in good condition and well watered.  Mine does not look  like the picture.  It is definitely a lot more sparse and less "natural" looking.  I'm hoping that some pruning will fix that over time.  It also lost a few leaves on the first day, but seems to have really come alive after being watered and given sunlight.  I'm sure 3 days in a box can't be too healthy for it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, there are two holes at the bottom of the pot, so you'll need to figure out a way to deal with the water which leaks out.<br /><br />Update 9/23/2008:  I would bump this review up to 4 stars, but Amazon won't let me.  The plant still hasn't filled out much more and still does not look as good as the picture, but it has remained remarkably healthy with very little effort.  I've kept it at my desk at work where it receives little if any sunlight.  Watering it twice a week and occasionally moving it near a window for a weekend has kept it very healthy and green.  I've received lots of positive comments from co-workers.

review/summary: Nice Bonsai
review/text: This is a healthy jade bonsai tree that looks to be well established.  The only reason I have given it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because of the water pot.  This is the first time I purchased a bonsai with a water pot and I'm not quite sure why it has it because it does not catch the water overflow nor does it feed water to the bonsai as it needs water.  So it is just filled with water that gets dirty fast because of loose dirt that falls into that side of the pot.  Maybe it will help with humidity because Brussel's does not sell humidity trays for their inside bonsai trees.  And everyone knows that it is impossible to find matching ceramic humidity trays for bonsai pots.  I still like the tree even with the water pot and time will tell if it survives in my office that has open blinds and fluorescent lighting.  I will update my review if the tree dies.

review/summary: love it to death
review/text: It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail. It looks great in the picture with the little pond and all but whether you keep this plant indoors at any temperature, it is doomed. Amazon is very nice when it comes to these plants. They usually are very nice when a plant passes away by crediting your credit card but it took so long to die that I just couldn't call them to ask for a credit because of the long period of time between the time I bought it and the time it died. Oh well, I'll write it off on my taxes or something like that.

review/text: This little tree arrived very quickly - two days after placing the order.  There was white powdery gunk coating several of the leaves but after reading the manufacturer's info a little closer I realized it was just dissolved material from the cornstarch packing peanuts - it wiped off easily with a damp paper towel.  The tree was packaged securely and arrived safe and healthy, still damp from its last watering.

review/summary: Bonsai Jade Tree w/Blue Pot
review/text: I loved the customer service I was given by Amazon but I was upset with the details of this gift that I bought my daughter.  I know pictures don't always match what is sent and it was very true in this case.  I expected the pot that was in the picture.  My daughter sent me pictures and the pot was different.  If they had told me that there was a possibility of a different pot I think I wouldn't have ordered it because it was a combination of the pot and the plant that I liked.  Maybe I'm being picky but I expected a pretty blue pot that had design depth to it instead of the blue/black square dish that my daughter received.

review/text: What an awesome tree!  I forgot to give a c/o in the mailing address, since it was delivered to my place of employment, so it was in transit for an extended period of time.  I had heard that these trees were extremely fragile and susceptible to climate extremes, but this little guy was in the cold quite awhile awaiting delivery in New Hampshire in November and it came through unscathed!  A beautiful tree and very healthy upon delivery.  The leaves were a lush green color with no spots or marring on them.  I am very pleased.

This resulted<br /><br />in up to 50% of leaves rubbing off during transit and worked their way<br /><br />to the bottom of the carton. Also the 3 leafelets were wet and sticking<br /><br />together.

review/summary: Tough little plant
review/text: This delicate looking plant was sent to me as a gift. I am not sure I would have ever ordered it for myself. Not really a big fan of the idea of  Bonsai. The packing/shipping materials kept it safe and sound (may want to open the box with a large trash bag around the box-packing peanuts galore) It looked very healthy and happy. As some other reviews stated about a week after receiving the plant LOTS and LOTS of tiny black bugs showed up. I have other inside plants and lots of outside plants so of course didn't want the bugs to spread. I squirted watered down dish soap (just a drop or two to a spray bottle of water) a few times, let it sit outside when we had large rainstorms. It lost a good amount of leaves (could be the bugs or could be the soap). Bugs died/washed away. After a week, new leaves started growing back. I waited another week and left it outside in the shade (sunburns very easily), later repotted it in a large pot. It's doing great, even though it's been through the wringer. I hope this helps anyone who has any of these problems.

review/summary: Killing another innocent plant...
review/text: I purchased this Bonsai for my husband who has had a love of them for years. He has also been killing them for years, which is why for his one last chance I chose the Jade. According to other's reviews it seemed impossible to kill off. Well, let me assure you that it is possible to kill, if you have the mad skills we do.<br /><br />The pros: It arrived promptly, packaged beautifully, and it was gorgeous, just as it was in the stock photo!<br /><br />The cons: You truly do need a water tray for this, I now have a permanent stain on my sofa table due to not paying attention to that... While you're waiting for your plant to arrive, run to the store and pick one up.<br /><br />It has now been just over 3 months since we added this tree to our family and it is slowly shedding its leaves. The remaining leaves are no longer a deep shade of green as they once were but instead have morphed into a deep lime green. And the little grass tuft plant that noone can kill? Yes, well, mine is slowly  dying. It's rather a tedious and torturous process, each leaf is slowly browning at the tip, and gradually creeping up each frond, dying one by one.<br /><br />At first we watered it weekly, then I began twice a week. I just read a ditty on here that says every other day, so I'll give that a try. Why not? It will either revive it or put it out of its misery sooner. If it lives, I shall update this review, lest you be kept in suspense...

Also, this vendor used a shipping method that means they came by container ship not priority mail.  Suppose to arrive Feb 17th - Came March 6th.<br /><br />I really like this product because in the tropical heat I leach electrolytes and nuun doesn't have any calories and has what I need in it to keep from having to eat salt or chips.  Unfortunately it is hard to come by on Guam.

review/text: I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.

review/text: This is a fairly nice product.  However, the "STASH" sign is paper, and mine arrived bent--which isn't the end of the earth, but when you get something new, you like it to be in perfect condition.  Also, the design of the rack has the tea boxes sitting straight, and I think a slight tilt (top back and bottom forward) would assist in dispensing the tea.

review/summary: A gift for a foodie....
review/text: I purchased this La Piana Balsamic Vinegar for a fabulous French foodie-friend with a fiendish obsession for balsamic vinegar.  Now, I should tell you that, having grown up in Provence, my friend has impeccable taste and an extremely refined palette.  Since I have never tasted this brand of balsamic vinegar, I was a little nervous to order it.<br /><br />No worries.<br /><br />My friend is crazy about La Piana.  She tells me she is using it on everything - even ice cream.  She has declared this the best vinegar she has ever tasted.<br /><br />Note, The Balsamic Vinegar Cookbook by Meesha Halm is a great cookbook that offers tons of recipes.  I purchased this for my friend as well and she raves about it.  Here's a link:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0002251337

review/summary: Not the real thing
review/text: Folks, I ordered this based on reviews I had read here. I wish that Amazon would at least provide the information on the label so a consumer can make a educated choice. First and foremost, this is not real balsamic vinegar. It is Wine Vinegar & cooked grape must, with a acidity of 6%. True Balsamic Vinegar ingredients is: "is made from the Trebbiano grape. The rich brown color comes from being aged in wood casks, often for decades. Although it is made from grapes, balsamic vinegar isn't produced from wine (as are most vinegars). The authentic product may not contain any wine vinegars - the grape juice is simply reduced and then made directly into vinegar." and will have acidity of 4%.<br /><br />I made the mistake of opening my bottle and will see if Amazon will take it back.

I don't use it in cooking or marinating because it seems wasteful to me.<br />Try it - I think you'll enjoy it!<br />Ciao Tutti !!<br /><br />Update: 07/01/11<br />Unfortunately, I have not purchased the La Piana for several months now.

review/summary: Good aged balsamic, but not excellent
review/text: I have brought back better tasting aged balsamics from Italy for about the same price or slightly cheaper. This La Piana is worth trying, and it does taste good, but better can be had for similar prices. Check your local specialty shops, sometimes good deals can be had.<br /><br />In general, aged balsamic vinegars are a revelation. They really do get better with time! Don't get hung up on the 10, 12, 15, or 20 year aspect. There's more flavor variations from batch (or grower) to batch than strictly in length of time aged.<br /><br />As a buying note: There's a big price difference between official (consortium approved) balsamic and genuine balsamic vinegar that isn't sold via the consortium (often labeled as condimento balsamico, salsa balsamica, or salsa di mosto cotto). Amazon will delete the pricing, but for Carandini (an absolutely top vinegar) there's a factor of nine in price between the approved and non-approved vinegars. I haven't tasted them side by side (most because the approved stuff is SO expensive) but from memory they were certainly close.

review/text: This salsa has good consistency--not too chunky, not to runny.  However, I am not impressed by the taste.  I do not like cumin in my salsa, and the taste of it is very strong in this one.  I also feel that a good salso should bring out onion and cilantro flavors--these are very minimal in this (maybe because of the overpowering cumin taste).  I bought this item at Samsclub along with the On The Border tortilla chips which are very good.

review/text: I just received these today as a gift to myself. I admit I was extremely hesitant after reading some reviews but I have been dying to try real French macarons for some time and where I live there are not many bakeries that sell them (they're all Greek and Italian). The packaging is adorable and probably costs more than the actual cookies but the cookies themselves are amazing! So rich and flavorful, texture was light and luxurious (fresh obviously would have been better). I'm so glad I got them though. The only thing keeping me from purchasing them as gifts for all my friends and family is the price, which is a bit up there considering there's only  8 of them. Nonetheless, they are a beautiful and delicious splurge.

Perhaps if I use a LOT more tea per cup, or brew it longer or something I will stumble on the formula.  For now, it gives the entire room a marvelous aroma.  It is lovely in the cup.  And it has a very, very faint flavor.  If you want a full, hearty tea, this is not for you.  If you want a very, very delicate flavor, it might be just what you are looking for.

review/text: I just received 7 pounds of coffee directly from the Orleans Coffee Exchange, not knowing that Amazon carried it.  It's cheaper to go directly through the manufacturer (which is a rarity) - $8.99 per bag and 1 bag free with the purchase of 7.  The Bananas Foster doesn't let on to how good it is when you open the bag, but when brewed it is smooth as silk and the banana essence is not the artificial flavor you'd get from a cheap brand.  I immediately contacted the seller after my first cup to commend them on their product and promptly order 10 more bags of coffee.  GREAT COFFEE!!!!

review/text: I purchased this coffee straight from their website.  I bought the whole bean version.  When I first opened the package, what greeted me was an artificial banana smell.  Things didn't get much better after brewing a pot.  I have a new name brand coffee maker, good quality water and filters.  The result was an average cup of coffee with NO banana flavor whatsoever.  I emailed the company to let them know about this problem.  I got a response  saying that this is not their first complaint and maybe someone from their company should try the coffee.  Well, duh...I would think that for a product like this, there should be some kind of quality control.<br /><br />My advise--there are plenty of other great flavored coffees on Amazon.  Skip New Orleans Coffee Exchange.<br /><br />Update:  Never heard back from owner of the company.  Poor customer service.

review/summary: What a LOVELY Matcha Experience!
review/text: I love lavender, and I love Matcha, so it would seem like this would be a no-brainer for me.  However, I did worry because lavender is one of those things that if its overdone, it ends up tasting too soapy.  Fortunately, though, even though the lavender IS really strong here, it tastes really wonderful.  It is just right.<br /><br />It smells remarkable.  If you love the smell of lavender, this Matcha will blow you away ... the fragrance is so beautiful!<br /><br />This is a nice balance between Matcha and lavender ... and the lavender highlights some of the tones in the Matcha that are often missed or not experienced in other Matcha.  Instead of tasting "vegetative" this has more of a grassy kind of taste:  not a bitter grass, but a sweet, fresh spring grass, the new buds of grass kind of taste.  It's very sweet, no bitterness whatsoever, and the lavender offers a sharpness that is very refreshing to the palate.  I love the calm I feel as I sip this, and the way it still invigorates me.  Invigorating ... yet relaxing!<br /><br />Very nice!

review/summary: Nice lavender flavor...velvety matcha
review/text: Lavender Matcha!!  What could be better?  This matcha smells of soft lavender - reminding me of being out in a field of lavender.<br />My first impression of this matcha... I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I wanted to put this in a sachet under my pillow and have sweet lavender dreams.  I cannot get enough of that soothing lavender scent.  I had thought that this might be a good soothing matcha before bed.  I'm tempted to make a facial mask from it!<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with about 3/4 perfect teaspoon of matcha. I held back on adding a full teaspoon until I knew how strong it would be.  Once that was properly mixed I added a bit of sugar (sorry, can't do without a touch of it) and 7 oz of water.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water stayed the same, a robust lavender.  The quality of the actual matcha is very good.  This is definitely one you need to try for yourself.<br />I'm going to play around with this more.  A latte might not be the best route for lavender but iced might.<br />To try Lavender Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Tasty popcorn
review/text: I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILK9QG">Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning, Parmesan & Garlic, 2.85-Ounce Shakers (Pack of 6)</a>. Unfortunately, that flavor has never been available in my area for some reason, so I usually order it online or buy several shakers whenever I travel somewhere that does have it. When I saw this popcorn at a local grocery store, I bought a box in hopes that it would taste like the seasoning I like so much. It doesn't really, but it's still pretty good. It is much less salty tasting than the popcorn seasoning, which is a good thing, but the herbs definitely overwhelm the other flavors. If I were naming the product or designing the box, I'd have put "Italian herbs" first on the label rather than "Parmesan". It's still good, just puts the emphasis on an unexpected flavor.<br /><br />The popcorn pops nicely using my microwave's popcorn button and tastes very fresh. The flavoring always seems to coat the popcorn evenly, unlike some flavored popcorns I've had in the past where the flavoring only seems to be on one side of the bag, leaving some of the popcorn plain. I also like the fact that the box includes whole-bag nutritional information for the popcorn, unlike so many brands that require you to do several calculations to figure out what you're eating. At 360 calories a bag, this popcorn is a reasonable snack and healthier than many other options. I'll keep buying it from time to time even though it wasn't exactly what I was hoping it would be.

review/summary: First order had great natural, sweet flavor; 2nd tasted weird. Beware the smaller cans!
review/text: Please read my update at the end of this original review:<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut wataers since my previous beloved Zico went nasty (from concentrate, sour, sodium enhanced, yuck). I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco. Previously, I had tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling "coconut water taste tests" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. Second fave is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E.<br /><br />I can say this to coconu water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. I'm gonna order some more A&B CW very soon (I have 2.5 cases of Nature Factor's, and about 4 tetras left of the O.N.E., and I will drink those. I have 35 bottles left of the Zico (new formula) and I may just water my gardenia and hibiscus bushes with those.)<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can: 17.5 ounces. If you're really thirsty, this one is welcome. (I often drink two 10 ounce cans of Nature Factor's brand during supper, so having one can do the trick is handy).<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D  Because another reviewer called it "unnaturally sweet", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can:  31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />A&B is "flash pasteurized", which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google "Crossfit Adventure" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B.<br /><br />They use Thai coconuts. :)<br /><br />Addendum: For carb watchers-- The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce:<br /><br />Amy & Brian: 2.375<br />Nature Factor Organic: 1.6<br />O.N.E.: 1.33<br />New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07<br /><br />I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce.<br /><br />I wonder if, since the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be targeted to have higher carbs/more sweetness?<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order in the 10 oz cans tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's "jiggered" for consistency.) I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. Hope the update helps you in making a decision.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Yes, I ordered two more cases of large cans of this brand in the pulp version, and it's fantastic. So, it seems the "badness" is limited (so far as I can tell) to the smaller cans. I'm editing the header of this review accordingly. Every single large can/case I've ordered has been delicious and refreshing and coconutty. The small cans are candy water and suck.So, AVOID THE SMALL cans until that problem is resolved. But I trust the taste of the large cans to have placed an order for 7 cases during this month's super sale of A&B. HTH.

It is incredibly refreshing and clean tasting. The cans are large and durable. This is completely unsweetened and pulp free. The taste isn't very strong either, but it is incredibly refreshing. I have been able to give this product to everyone I know and have them enjoy it, give it a whirl.<br /><br />Be warned, the 10oz cans DO NOT taste the same as these tall boys.<br /><br />This stuff is the best.

review/summary: my favorite coconut water
review/text: I've grown to enjoy this coconut water even though I do not like coconuts. I used to be an active basketball player and wanted something to drink that was a healthy nutritional beverage. An associate kept pestering me about this coconut water saying it's the next super drink. He told me that they used coconut water to replace blood plasma in World War II. Eventually I succumbed and tried to stuff.  During strenuous activity I like the way it settles in my stomach before games and the energy it gave me.

review/summary: Poor quality control?  Good product but TOO MANY DENTED CANS!
review/text: The first box was great so ordered another one. The Amazon bubble wrap covered the whole thing just like the first time. So far so good.  When I removed the wrap, I found 10 dented cans out of 12! Some worse than the other.  I am not unreasonable.  If is was like 1-3 dented can, I would have said what the heck but 10 out of 12?  These damages are happening somewhere between the factory and the Amazon warehouse because the the bubble wrap protection for this could protect a delicate croissant from transit damage.  I gotta start looking for somewhere else to buy if this problem can't be corrected.  I really do like the product itself.  I even finished 1 of the 2 good cans while wiring this.<br /><br />Update 5/16/12 I came back from work and I was so glad to find replacement coconut juice till I opened them up.  Honestly I was expecting around 2-4 slightly crushed cans.  Talk about being wrong.  All 12 were crushed and 6 of them were pretty beat up.  Almost as if they picked out one of the the worse one since this was replacement box.  I am trying to figure out whether I am being unlucky and getting the messed up boxes 2 times in a row or this is how it is and I just got lucky the first time.  Either way very disappointed.  As of this point, if I had to rate the juice by itself I would give 4.5 stars, the quality control 1 star. Honestly who would buy these regularly if all the cans were dented even if it had good flavor? On the plus side Amazon CS gets 5 stars.

review/summary: Best I've tasted So Far
review/text: Since becoming pregnant, I've really had a hard time staying hydrated enough!  My skin & hair is dry, my lips split, it's been awful so, when a friend suggested I try drinking coconut water, I was all for it!  I ran to the grocery store & grabbed one of every brand/flavor & while it took some getting used to (I don't know if I was expecting it to be a pina colada or what!), none of them tasted terrible & I did notice a difference in my hydration after just a couple of days.<br />  After doing some more reading, I learned that the general opinion is that Thai coconuts are sweeter and so, when I found a case of Thai coconut water at a really good price at Cash & Carry, I scooped it up, even though the ingredients weren't listed on the case & I'd have to wait til I opened it.  Well, there was definitely added sugar & it gave the beverage a cloying, sickly-sweet flavor, almost as if it was spoiled.  PLUS, it had a very tinny aftertaste.  All in all, a waste.<br />  I was very leery of trying canned coconut water again, figuring I'd have to stick to the super-expensive boxed brands at the grocery store but, after reading all the positive reviews for Amy & Brian's, I figured it was worth a shot.  UPS just dropped it off and, since the can was very cold from being in the delivery truck, I cracked one open right away.  DELICIOUS!  It is very clean & light tasting with no chemical or tinny taste.  Fabulous product and I'm definitely going to up my subscribe & save quantity!<br /><br />-Sarah

review/summary: WARNING: Highly addictive!
review/text: I have tried MANY types of coconut water.  I have tried VitaCoco, ZICO, Taste Nirvana, Naked, among some others.  Honestly, my first sip of this made almost all coconut waters (besides Taste Nirvana) taste terrible afterwards.  It tastes wonderfully fresh, like directly from a coconut, and it has the perfect amount of sweetness.  Baby coconuts are the way to go!  Seriously though, I used to love VitaCoco, which is quite a bit cheaper, and I can no longer go back to it.  So don't even try it if you can't afford it! :)  Very delicious, authentic, and is seriously so refreshing and hydrating.<br /><br />I know some people think that coconut water is a bunch of rubbish, but I am someone that has problems with severe dehydration, and as a result I have health problems including excruciating leg cramps.  Ever since I've started drinking this regularly, I feel healthier, stronger, and my leg cramps have virtually gone away!  Packed with potassium and electrocytes, this is great for people who want to hydrate with some awesome tasting coconut water!

review/summary: Mild Non-Sweet Flavor. Limited Calories.
review/text: Way back when I was a little kid (perhaps 65 years ago) my Dad used to bring home a coconut on occasion. It was a family affair. He'd punch a hole in it and drain the juice and all five of us would have a little sip. Then he's break the shell with a hammer and we'd all have a bit of coconut meat. I remember it as a fun childhood experience. Well, I can't recall having coconut ever since, except as an ingredient in candy or cookies.<br /><br />Recently, I was visiting a local grocery store and I noticed Amy & Brian Coconut Juice In the beverage section. It was billed as a natural isotonic unsweetened beverage and was 100& coconut water. Hmmm. Just like the old days, but now it comes in a pop-top 17.5-ounce can. Well, I had to try it, of course. Well, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. It was an okay beverage, but I wouldn't put it among my  favorites. The flavor is mild and non-sweet. It goes down easily. The calories are limited (120 per can). It states that it's an isotonic beverage good before or after exercise and it states that it has potassium and magnesium, but doesn't list the amount. Be sure to drink it  chilled. I'd drink it again, but I'm not rushing out to get more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Three Batches of Bent Cans
review/text: I haven't written a review in a while, but this just had to be said. We first purchased this juice at the local health food store; it's tasty stuff. Coconut juice is a healthier "Gatorade", so I signed up for Amazon's monthly subscription. The first batch came with a few bent cans. Not a big deal. However, the last two cases have come terribly dented, and the packaging was not damaged a bit. The cans are being damaged at the plant. NOT COOL. This last case only had one decent can (one out of 12!). It can't be healthy to drink out of a bent can, I think you get bentinitis or something. I've cancelled my subscription and kissed my 15% off goodbye. I may still buy it locally, if I don't find another comparable deal on Amazon, my favorite place to shop.

review/text: This juice is fantastic.  I love getting it shipped directly to my house on a monthly basis so I know I have a constant supply.  It's expensive if bought individually, but Amazon has a great monthly shipment price.  If you haven't tried it, you won't be disappointed.  It's the best.

review/summary: A bit too sweet compared to One
review/text: I like the fact that this came in the 17oz size and the taste was good but might be a bit too sweet for some.  I wonder if the sweetness is attributed to these coconuts coming from Asia and not Brazil.  I know when I buy the young coconuts from Asian supermarkets, they tend to be sweeter compared to original Zico or ONE brand which were from Brazil.  Unfortunately, I have never had a chance to try a young coconut from Brazil to distinguish the two.<br /><br />I would rate this as a second option behind ONE due to this being a bit to sweet for my taste buds.

review/summary: So Good The Nutritional Facts HAVE To Be Lying
review/text: This coconut juice is so good! And it's about 150 calories per drink. When you taste it, there's a subtle sweetness and makes that 150 calories taste delicious! I am using this to replace my need for sports drinks and Izze for my need to replace Redbull.

review/summary: The best hydrator
review/text: I have been drinking Amy and Brians coco juice for years.  I just received a case and am ordering another right away.  I drink Coconut water every day.  I just find that I am too lazy to hack up a fresh one, so I use the packaged ones.  I have tried all of the brands out there.  I always keep coming back to Amy and Brian's.  You would think they would all be the same, but Amy & Brian's is consistently the best.  The taste is always fresh, almost sweet compared to the others.  I like this size can too, because it helps me get enough fluid in my system and it is so delicious, I drink the whole thing down very quickly.  The only down side to me is that they don't accept the cans at the recycling places here (SoCal desert).<br /><br />There is no reason to buy electrolyte drinks when you can enjoy delicious coconut water, which naturally has the perfect electrolyte balance.  Coconut is one of the healthiest foods available. (research it, there is so much info out there online). I have a dog with chylothorax, who can't have fat.  But I allow him to have coconut and he loves to drink Amy and Brian's!

review/summary: Refreshing, rejuvenating, and natural
review/text: You know when you are really thirsty and water is just not cutting it?<br /><br />-Juice is too sweet or thick<br />-Sport drinks are disgusting because who needs blue 1, yellow 5, and High Fructose Corn syrup when their thirsty?<br />-Soda just dehydrates you more<br />-All those flavored waters taste fake and too sweet<br /><br />You know the thirst I'm talking about- maybe you just got back from running, biking, hiking,<br />Or  worst you were out all night and have an awful hangover the next morning.....<br /><br />I swear that a cold can of Amy and Brian's Coconut Juice will quench your thirst like nothing ever has before.<br /><br />I was honestly so surprised and impressed at how good it made me feel that I did some research into coconut water. Coconut water is an isotonic beverage, containing similar levels of electrolytes found in human blood, and supplies potassium, magnesium, calcium, and iron. If the seed is not punctured the water within the coconut is sterile and can be used intravenously for re-hydration.<br /><br />Coconut water is so amazing because it is 100% natural, straight from the inside of a young coconut, and has tons of nutrients your body needs! There are so many drinks on the market these days that are full of preservatives, food coloring, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and a slew of other additives that are not good for your body.<br /><br />There are several brands of coconut juice but Amy and Brian's tastes the best, has the best consistency, and is the best company to support.<br /><br />Just try a can and you'll understand why so many people are in love with it.

review/text: it's hard to say how much i love this stuff. i've tried many brands, but this is it for me. others tend to taste a bit green and weedy, whereas this brand is sweeter and mild. i could see bringing this with me on a ride on my road bike. best when cold, of course.

review/summary: love it
review/text: This is the best canned coconut water i've found that wasn't sweeteend or full of preservatives.  Amazon has a decent price, especially with free shipping. I've recently discovered that my local "fresh&easy" market is selling them for 1.99/can, so even less than amazon if you happen to have one near you, you can save $.25/can and the wait for shipping.

review/text: Very good drink to replenish fluid and electrolytes during exercise with nothing artificial added.  This is second shipment for me of this product and unfortunately the cans are not adequately padded and arrive badly dented.
