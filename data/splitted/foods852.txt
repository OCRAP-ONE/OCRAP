review/summary: Great name; mediocre coffee
review/text: I'm a great 'jet fuel' coffee person. So I figured I'd give "Jet Fuel" a try in my Keurig. My favorites are still Emeril's Big Bold and Timothy's Rain Forest Espresso. Unfortunately "Jet Fuel" is not as bold and full bodied and leaves a thin aftertaste that is not pleasant to my taste. Definitely will not be on my re-order list.

review/text: Not undrinkable, but not great.  I'm a fan of Starbucks-style deep, dark richness with a little bitter kick.  This has the bitter, but it just tastes thin to me.<br /><br />I haven't found a great dark K-cup yet.  My favorite so far is Green Mountain Dark Magic, in case that helps you judge how you perceive my review.

review/summary: Puddle Jumper Fuel
review/text: If you're looking to upgrade from Donut Shop, Jet Fuel is a deep roast that retains Donut Shop's nutty flavor. IMHO Coffee People blends tend toward the weak side, and Jet Fuel follows the trend. I think of it as Puddle Jumper Fuel.<br /><br />For a K-Cup equivalent to Starbucks' Sumatra or Gold Coast blends, I would recommend Timothy's Midnight Magic instead. Midnight Magic really is "jet fuel".<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV90">Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I've been ordering subscribe and save for a while, but I think I'm done with this. When I opened the box, loose coffee scattered all over the floor, and all of 47 cups were stained/soiled with coffee. ( yes, I counted twice and only 47 were in the box of 50)  16 cups were opened, including 3 cups which were totally empty inside.  With the trouble of sweeping the floor and cleaning each individual remaining cups, buying this product from Amazon does't save me anything. I've been such a big fun of this coffee, but I will not give another shot.

I'd suggest this to anyone that loves a good strong cup of mud, but dislikes bitter over-roasted coffee.

review/summary: Harsh flavor, and yet still  not strong coffee by my standards
review/text: I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J

review/text: I put a sign up at my workplace that reads, "There is no strong coffee, only weak men." Alright, I'll admit that there are some coffees that are stronger than others, but not very many that are stronger than Jet Fuel. And, this is actually my wife's favorite brew, so no more excuses girly men! This has a very dark, strong flavor with just the right amount of bitterness to round out the flavor. However as mentioned in the title, it's for adults. We drink this as our every day coffee, but also keep some more milder flavors for guests and "weak men".

Turns out this is pretty darn good coffee, strong enough where I can brew it in a large cup add a little milk or creamer to cool it down, add a little more cold water if I need to pound it before I get out the door, and it still tastes great.  I'm no coffee snob, but I know what I like, and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />Kept me alert enough to get through pilot training, and will definitely keep on having it to stay alert and keep the skies safe.

review/text: Update to my review:  August 2012:  It appears they have changed the formula for this coffee.  It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway, oil spill is not there any more...<br /><br />Nor is the taste...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />First Review...<br /><br />For my taste buds - this is it.  Rich and full - with no burnt taste.  'Hint' of sweet finish - i.e. not bitter.<br /><br />Hard to believe this is pod coffee.<br /><br />Five stars!<br /><br />------<br /><br />About my tastes...<br /><br />I have been drinking K-Cups for two years and tried about 2 dozen types of coffee.  Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).  I thought that was pretty good until the Jet Fuel.  Newman's is fairly rich - but has a slightly over-roasted taste for me... again,compared to the Jet Fuel.

review/summary: The best K-cup so far!
review/text: We bought a Keurig for Christmas and have gone through the 80 cups that came with the machine along with well over a dozen cases of other flavors that have been 'highly recommended'.  Jet Fuel has been our favorite thus far.  In fact, we've reordered it twice already.<br /><br />That said, we prefer strong coffee.  Jet Fuel tastes perfect no matter which size you make.  There is NO bitterness or aftertaste that you find in some of the other k-cups.  I'm picky, I'd be the first to complain!<br /><br />If you like strong coffee, try Jet Fuel.  Other flavors that have been superior are: Green Mtn. Espresso (hubby alternates between these two), Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Revv, Timothy's Parisian Nights, and Paul Neumann's Organic EB.<br /><br />Donut House and Timothy's Midnight Magic were EB's that were highly rated, but I found them to have bitter/weird after tastes.  I have not enjoyed the flavored coffees at all.  GLoria Jean's Butter Toffee was particularly dissappointing.<br /><br />If I had to buy only one flavor of k-cup, Jet Fuel would be it.

review/summary: One of the best "extra bold" k-cups out there
review/text: It took me a LONG time to decide to order something called Jet Fuel. I was very put off by the thought of drinking Jet Fuel. Yet, I'm glad I tried this. It's very similar to Green Mountain Dark Magic. When I need a coffee that can wake me up, this is the one I turn to. The flavor is smooth yet very dark, rich, and bold.

review/text: I purchased this coffee for when I wanted to made double runs with my coffee maker.  For large cup sizes you can do a 10oz and then lift the lift like a new cup has been added and then do a 4oz or 8 oz on top of the orginal 10 oz.  The Jet Fuel is strong enough for my taste to allow me get away with this on one cup and not lose the flavor.  Works for me....

review/summary: Jet fuel
review/text: I like home made espresso, starbucks bold drip coffee and bold coffee that's not bitter. Jet fuel is bold, but not strong as home made over the gas range espresso or starbuck's bold drip. It is much smoother than black tiger though, and the strength is similar to black tiger. If you drink black tiger after jet fuel, you will definitely notice Black tiger's bitterness. When I use one jet fuel with 4oz water serving choice,  it gets pretty close to starbuck's.<br /><br />Before buying from amazon, I used to buy emeril's big easy, but jet fuel is stronger, and through coffee people and amazon's club, this is the cheapest way to purchase coffee for keurig machines. Cheaper than Costco or sams club.

review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]
review/text: ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that "bitter" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: I like strong black coffee. I like it to taste strong, have body, & wake me up. The way to make strong coffee is use more grounds per water, but that doesn't guarantee it tastes good . "Jet Fuel" tastes good & wakes me up. It seems at least a time-&-a-half stronger than most other coffees, is full-bodied, &  is consistently, equally great cup after cup: I've had a hundred of them so far. It's my favorite. I bought 50 cups on sale for $20, but the regular price at the time was only $21! Since you'll probably only need one cup in the morning, it's a great deal. Also: It arrived less than 48 hours after the order was put in

review/summary: Delicious and free of all icky stuff
review/text: I might as well just confess that I am a huge fan of Annie's products.  I haven't tried a single one I don't like.  Not only are they a much healthier alternative to the normal grocery store fare, I also think that they taste better.  Whenever I bite into an Annie's product, my first thought tends to be, "Oh, so this is how it's supposed to taste."<br /><br />I first picked up a box of these on a whim one day while out shopping with my 7-year-old and 18-month-old.  The little guy was hungry, so I opened the box to give him some and, soon enough, the entire family was walking through the aisles of the store, munching happily.  My daughter loves Goldfish and she also loves those faux-butter crackers, so she was thrilled with the combination of the buttery bunnies and the cheddar bunnies in this box.  The crackers have a nice, rich buttery flavor and a genuine cheesy zing.  The pretzels are also very tasty and shaped either like bunnies or like carrots, much to the amusement of both of my children (and, I confess, myself).  We were so hooked on these that I immediately looked for them on Amazon and set up a subscribe and save, which is also more economical than purchasing boxes at my local store.<br /><br />What I can't emphasize enough about Annie's products is that they are real food.  If you read the ingredients label, you can actually understand and know what each ingredient is, unlike all of the scary chemicals and preservatives that are thrown into foods traditionally marketed toward kids.

review/text: This my problem with all of annie's products.  Just because it is organic does not make it healthy.  There is very little nutritional value to these crackers.  There is no fiber and it high in calories, fat and salt.  I wish amazon would list the nutritional value on the sight.  If they had I wouldn't have purchase them.  I do have to say that they are tasty.  I'm to the point of making my own at home.  Lots of really easy recipes out there.

Try it - it's a blend of sweet, salty (not too salty, though), a hint of tartness, and a moderate amount of spices and heat.<br />Unlike other Indian snacks, this product is consistently fresh, you won't find moldiness, mustiness,  hair fragments or dead bugs - it is exceptionally clean and always fresh.<br /><br />I hope they keep up the high standards for taste and freshness because I've eaten this as a snack for years and I occasionally give a packet to friends.  : )

For a minute I thought i was getting a good price....When I came back to the states I bought this item in a asain market for only $1.09! I was so mad when I realized I could have gotten 35 sachets for the price that this person is charging for 7! So my advice is if you really need this product and cant find it anywhere then I guess you gotta buy it...but if you have access to a chinatown or a asian market they will have this prduct and sell it to you for 4x less money!

review/summary: Excellent Accessory for $20 to $25
review/text: Price<br />This is one of the best accessories I've bought for my Keurig.  I have four at home and two at work.  The product is excellent, but the price is way too expensive from vendors selling them for more than $20 - $25.  I got mine for $20 plus tax at my local Bed, Bath, and Beyond after using a 20% Off Coupon.  This makes them worth about $10 a piece since they are sold in pairs.<br /><br />Efficient<br />I love taking a K-Cup box home and dumping them in these containers.  I prefer this method rather than individually presenting K-Cups in other storage containers.  They are easy to grab from the opening at the bottom.<br /><br />Size & Looks<br />They are pretty big.  Make sure you measure your cabinet space before purchasing.  They won't fit in a lot of standard cabinets.  They are attractive after getting a few brands on display.  I like being able to use one of the K-Cups as a display model.

review/summary: Perfect K-Cup Storage - if you can get it cheap
review/text: I got a Keurig for Christmas and got these to hold the k-cups for things like hot chocolate that I have a ton of the same flavor.  Doesn't take up a lot of space, easy to access the k-cups, easy to refill, and looks neater on the shelf than some of the other racks I saw online.  I found them for around $25 at Wal-Mart, but was unable to find them on Amazon for less than almost twice that until someone listed a set with a slightly damaged box.  The box didn't bother me, the second set was just as great as the first, but I'm not sure I would have paid more than I did for either set.
