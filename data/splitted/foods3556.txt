review/summary: My dogs LOVE Greenies!
review/text: The Teenie's are too small for my Pug.  She swallows it whole, which defeats the purpose of the Greenies.  My Poodle mix can't tell the difference in flavor between the Lite and the regular.

review/summary: Greenies Rule!
review/text: A coworker gave me a box (or 20) that she received free.  I had not heard good things about greenies (intensinal issues), so I was hesitant to feed them to my dogs.  But hey, they were free and I did followup with research to find that they corrected those issues.<br /><br />My dogs are addicted.  These are like catnip for dogs.  I have a 12 year old Chow Chow that is extremely arthritic, but when the Greenies box comes out she dances around like a puppy.  I can't say enough good things about these treats, and the price from this seller is exceptional.

review/text: My dog loves these things but, even at Amazon's price, she gets only one a day!  I give her a size much smaller than recommended because she really chews her food; I wouldn't try that if she just swallowed without chewing as it could present a choking hazard.  They do seem to help with dog-breath, which is miraculous with my pup.

review/summary: Vegan in a can!
review/text: I was raised a vegetarian and have recently ventured into the world of vegans. I was also raised eating Cedar Lake Hostess Cuts. I have to say, that for a meatless, vegan cutlet these are pretty tasty. They're great to have on hand if I have other family members drop in and I need something tasty to feed a crowd of hungry vegetarians/vegans.  And they can be prepared in a variety of ways.  For people who are used to eating meat, they may take some getting used to in both taste and texture. If you are on a gluten free diet you will have to find another meat substitute since they are grain based, otherwise they're a great alternative to meat.

review/summary: Nice clean chai tea,
review/text: First, I'm a vigorous coffee and tea drinker! However, tea is hard to enjoy in Socal, since weather, ambiance, water, and my lifestyle demand me to go for coffee rather than tea. Somehow tea I enjoyed in Europe gets weird when I brew it here- for instance, Twinning! Only tea that delivered as good quality as it's in Europe is Harrods' tea so far as I've tested. (about 5 years)<br /><br />I first encountered Clipper's when I was in France. I was delighted with their Earl Grey. However, at the moment, on Amazon it was out of stock. My second favorite flavored tea is Chai, so I thought Clipper's chai couldn't be bad. It indeed lets me enjoy organic tea experience- supreme clean flavor. It might be too clean for people who enjoy pungent tea flavor. But, there is no lingering fermented taste or strong tea flavor coming from outgrown leaves. The spices are not overwhelming, but very well balanced. So, if you want Chai that punches your palate and blocks your senses from outside world with their spice fragrances, this is not your tea. Go get Starbucks chai. If you want clean, smooth, and mild spicy in your tea, go for Clipper's Chai. This will please you dearly.

review/summary: Clipper is my favorite tea
review/text: Clipper is my favourite brand of Chai tea. I've tried several brands over the years.<br /><br />I have bought the Clipper Chai in the UK frequently, and in the US only once so far (recently I found a single box of Clipper Chai in a small TJ Maxx store for a couple of dollars, and snapped it up!)<br /><br />Apparently tea that is packaged for sale in different regions of the world, even by the same company, can have a different taste:  I once wrote to the Twinings Tea customer service department to ask about the US and UK Earl Grey flavour differences that I was perceiving in their products, and they admitted that the Twinings US and UK Earl Grey flavours were different, because their flavours are modified based on what the consumers in each country/region seem to prefer.<br /><br />In the case of the Clipper Chai, I'm not sure if it's my imagination, but their US-market chai tea that I got at TJ Maxx a few weeks ago might taste a tiny bit different from their UK chai tea -- or maybe that is just a function of the US-market tea bags' being sealed in individual packets instead of intermingling unprotected in a cardboard box, relatively open to the air, like most UK-market tea bags are.  In any event, their US-market chai tea is very good.

What I do not like is that over the years the individual unit size has become smaller, while the count remains the same.  This is an old marketing tactic, I'd rather that the products stay the same size and that the Companies charge a higher price.<br /><br />This particular provider will be a favorite of yours, IF you like a VERY SLOW DELIVERY!!

Not only are they great for potato soup or chowder, but I frequently make a stuffing with them or my husband likes them whole, soaked in hot water until twice their size, browned in butter and scrambled eggs poured on top with ketchup. Not my cup of tea but he loves it.

review/summary: If I COULD TELL AMAZON NOT TO SELL THIS ARRANGEMENT, I WOULD. VERY MISLEADING PICTURE!!!
review/text: If you want to make a fool of yourself, and give somebody a reason to criticize you, order this "lilies for Mom" sold by Pro-Flower. I have never experienced such huge humiliation in my life, especially because I ordered this flower for my mother-in-law who lives in Florida. In the advertised photograph the lilies are beautiful and cute, of course for $42,58 which is what I paid on May 2012 including shipping, I wasn't expecting a huge and luxurious bouquet, but since I sent her a card with a $200 I thought of this as a "small and cute" extra detail for her.<br />She called me to say thank you, but I could feel something was off because she kept mentioning phrases like "I know you care about me and you always remember me and that is what counts" "...your intention is appreciated as always" etc.  At the time I did not make anything out of it. Maybe 1-hour after, I received a text with a picture from a number I did not recognize, It was from one my sister-in-law (I married the youngest of 11 Dominican brothers and sisters 3 years ago) This particular sister-in-law who is not very fond of me -and I do not even know why- because I never speak to her but maybe one or twice in a year. In any case she sends me the picture saying... "Just so you know, this is what she got"<br />It could have been my perception, but I felt horrible, and like I did something to offend my mother-in-law<br />When I told my husband the whole issue, he said we needed to send another one right away to avoid any gossiping, so to make the story short, I found a local flower shop (remember this was May, 11th, 2012 around noon) and after the new florist was denying me the delivery for that day because it was too late, I told her my story and I guess she felt sorry for me...so she decided to help.<br /> I ended up paying over $120 for the last dozen of roses they had, a few other flowers and green mixture including shipping...(my mother in law said "you should have not done it, but this one was extremely beautiful, keep using this one, not the other")<br /><br />Would you guess if my sister-in-law sent me the picture of the second arrangement? ...well, you guessed right...SHE DID NOT!<br /><br />FYI: I never write reviews, and I absolutely love purchasing everything from AMAZON, telling everyone I can, that they should join the Prime program, subscribe & save, etc.  As a matter of fact this is the very first one I write because I am too busy with my 9-month-old baby, a full-time job and trying to go back to college... If I COULD TELL AMAZON NOT TO SELL THIS ITEM, I WOULD. OR AT LEAST THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE ADVERTISED PHOTO OF THE ITEM, BECAUSE IT IS VERY MISLEADING.

review/text: My husband and I first tried Tully's Coffee when we were visiting family in the State of Washington a few months ago. Tully's was the 'house coffee' of the hotel we were staying at. We were both used to garden-variety coffee from our local grocery stores, so when we tasted Tully's House Blend for the first time, we were floored over how good it was! We always thought all coffees were pretty much the same, but we were wrong! Tully's House Blend is very fragrant and smooth tasting with no bitterness. It's good hot, cold, black or with cream and sugar. We highly recommend Tully's Coffee.

review/text: I purchased this coffee for the first time because it was on sale. Tully's House Blend is simply too weak for my taste. I prefer a bold coffee, so perhaps this isn't the blend for me. By comparison, I would say the Starbucks House Blend (medium) is actually stronger than Tully's House Blend. It is a smooth blend, and the taste isn't offensive....however it lacks depth & intensity. I plan on saving this coffee for the parents, who are satisfied with even Maxwell House.

I'm very disappointed in Orville Redenbacher as this is the second time that I know of that they've discontinued making a wonderful popcorn (Cinnabon Pour Over popcorn is the other). Looks like I'll have to find another brand that can satisfy my taste buds.

review/text: I'm always looking for quick, healthy, easy to make snacks for work. I love microwave popcorn and various cheeses therefore you can easily imagine my excitement upon discovering Orville Reddenbacher's "New Flavor" Cheddar Cheese popcorn at the grocery store. After trying not one but all three bags over the past week, I have never been so sickeningly disappointed. I thought maybe the first bag was "stale or bad" so I tried the 2nd and 3rd with the same results. It doesn't even taste like popcorn, let alone cheese. I tried a light sprinkle of salt but that made it worse.  It tasted nasty.<br /><br />From now on I'm only buying generic popcorn from Kroger, Marsh, or Aldis and adding my own seasoning.

review/summary: Cant go back!
review/text: Well I'm disgusted with Orville Redenbacker for canceling the pour over cheddar popcorn as with all the other reviewers maybe the pour on's were to expensive and people wanted more for there money so they bought the regular instead. I have seen in Sam's wholesale were you can buy liquid butter if you want to pour on your popcorn for better taste because after you eat one of the pour overs you just cant go back to the cheaper styles. I wonder why they don't do the same for cheese? If any body knows were I can find it let me know!

review/text: The product arrived on time, but the quality was less than expected.  Apparently the product had at some point gotten too warm either during storage or shipment and resulted in the truffles being slightly (noticably) melted with the cocoa powder coating gone.  These truffles are usually excellent in quality but we have never ordered from this distributor before.

review/summary: A Wacky Entertaining Look At The Afterlife
review/text: If this is what the afterlife is going to be like then I guess it won't be so bad when it's my time though gotta stay away from anyone like Beetlejuice.  Tim Burton movies are an a acquired taste while entertaining then do sometimes seem a little out there though that's what makes these movies so entertaining in the first place. The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.  I do advise new comers to try and watch a trailer or clip though as while many especially fans greatly appreciate the movie it might not be for you.

review/text: I know this was supposed to be some great funny movie, but I just didn't get it. It started off OK, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were fine, but it just got boring. I couldn't see the point of the movie, even in retrospect. Why make this movie? Plus, the Michael Keaton character was so annoying, I just wanted to go away. I know he was supposed to be annoying, so fine, he did a good job with that, but I don't want to have to listen to it. We watched as a family and my 8-year-old son hated it too. My husband liked it. Maybe it's a guy thing, a grown-up guy thing.

review/summary: Just gets better with age!
review/text: This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray.  The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree.  On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.<br /><br />The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen.  Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie.  Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.<br /><br />It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!

review/summary: BEETLEJUICE..A TIM BURTON CLASSIC!
review/text: [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]<br /><br />Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition.  Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy.

I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.

review/summary: A Really Bizarre Spectacle. Classic Tim Burton.
review/text: For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of "Beetlejuice" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, "Beetlejuice" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: After the Maitlands (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) are prematurely killed in an automobile accident, they are returned to their home as ghosts. Meanwhile, the old country house is sold to trendy New Yorkers that entertain unwelcome changes to its charm.<br /><br />The Maitlands want them out, but have difficulty scaring the New Yorkers. So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />"Know what they say about people that commit suicide? In the after life, they become civil servants."<br /><br />This flick is entertaining and worth the price.

review/text: Tim Burton's unique vision, which is almost cartoonish at times, really comes across, in this film. A dark comedy, that accents the humor, rather than the horror. Also noteworthy is, Michael Keaton's character, which is not only annoying to the living, but the dead as well. Winona Ryder's character is also interesting to watch.

review/summary: Fun Then, Fun Now; Blu-Ray An Upgrade
review/text: This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character "Beetlejuice"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a "haunted house" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!

review/text: Beetlejuice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEA6">Beetlejuice [Blu-ray</a>] is a timeless classic with Michael Keaton providing an excellent performance.  The afterlife concept of the film is excellent as well as entertaining; this film is a must for your video library... It's to be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The casting for this film is perfect, Michael Keaton is the outrageously funny and whacky witted (Betelguese - the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis playing (Adam and Barbara Maitland), a young couple that die prematurely. Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).<br /><br />One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song `Day-O'.  This is truly Tim Burton at his finest taking the significance of being dead and dousing it with humor.

BluRay is nothing stunning but good textures and clarity, better than dvd but not the greatest looking bluray disc, outside shots are great, indoors nothing stunning. grew up watching this as a child in the 80's, stills holds up alright if just a little too short.... last joke of the movie with beetlejuice in the waiting room sitting next to the african tribesman is a big laugh!!!! see it if you never before, guaranteed to make you smile..

review/summary: Tim Burton's imagination goes wild!
review/text: I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.

review/summary: "It Keeps Getting Funnier Everytime I See It!"
review/text: "It keeps getting funnier every time I see it,"  says Beetlejuice, the mischievous ''bioexercist'' of the title who is superbly played by Michael Keaton. And this quote pretty much sums up how I feel about the movie, especially the famous dinner party scene. The premise of the movie is great, the score is memorable, and the acting from the entire cast is just about perfect. I highly recommend this film, which is often tagged as a ''Halloween movie,'' but can really be enjoyed at ANY time of the year.

review/summary: Macabre Fun For the Whole Family
review/text: "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was director Tim Burton's first film but "Beetlejuice" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.

review/text: Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed.

review/summary: Another Twisted Masterpiece From Burton
review/text: Here's the plot of 1988's "Beetlejuice", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).

review/summary: One of Tim Burton's earliest and best films
review/text: Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.

Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.

review/text: Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<p>  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?

This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some.

It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place. Tim Burton did an excellent job, and you have to see this movie.

review/summary: Say it once, say it twice, third time's the charm!
review/text: When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was "Beetlejuice" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's "Day O." Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, "the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist." The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever.

review/summary: Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity
review/text: I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.

review/summary: BeetleJuice- DVD
review/text: If you like BeetleJuice and the supernatural then buy this movie you won't be let down.  This is a very good movie fun for all ages.  See this movie is what started the cartoon series on cartoonnetwork in the early 1990's BeetleJuice.  Personally I think Micheal Keaton did a fantastic job as playing BeetleJuice I just really like this movie alot it talk's about what the after life is like basically see Barbara and Adam Maitland die and their ghost's in the movie and they meet BeetleJuice and I'm not going to tell you the rest because you have to watch the movie trust me this movie is really good it will make you want to say BeetleJuice three times.

review/summary: Great movie turned bad
review/text: Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!

review/summary: WARNING: CLAMSHELL EDITION IS EDITED TV VERSION
review/text: I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it's very funny and entertaining, so I didn't hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition.  I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they  have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited  in the television version.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you want the uncut  version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION!

review/summary: Five Star Movie, No Star DVD
review/text: This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.
