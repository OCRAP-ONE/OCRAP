review/summary: best tea ever
review/text: The amazing flavor and smell of this tea is beyond compare.  A good friend turned me on to this years ago when I visited Seattle and Pike St Market.  This was before the ease of the internet so getting my supply replenished was challenging.  I had been without for quite a while and ran across the tea label and info just recently.  Did an internet search and viola!  My order arrived within days for me to enjoy.  And ENJOY it I am.  The cup of tea this brews is unlike anything else.  Perfect . . .

review/summary: A great spiced tea.  Very unique.
review/text: I've enjoyed this tea for years.  It used to only be available from it's source, the spice market at Pike Place Market in Seattle.  I used to run out and have to wait until my next trip to Seattle.  Now, with it available through Amazon.com, I can save the travel expense and have it delivered to my door!<br /><br />It's a great spiced tea for hot or iced tea.

review/text: We moved from the Pacific Northwest 11 years ago, but our fondness for Pike Place Market's most famous tea has not diminished.  With its orange and cinnamon flavor and distinctive bite, there's nothing quite like it.  So naturally sweet it doesn't need anything else.<br />Our order arrived on our doorstep within two days.  Definitely worth a try if you are a tea buff!

review/text: I lived in the Seattle area for 16 years but had never heard of this tea, until one of my Officers showed up to work with a cup of it.  The entire office was quickly filled with this orange-spicey aroma, & I had to ask what it was.  He let me taste it & the next day brought me a ziploc bag full.  Thank you Gran! *smile* I soon ordered my own & let my sweetheart taste it.  He fell in love with it also!  I'm here again about to place a secret order for him & have it shipped to his office.  This is a high quality tea, filled with lots of flavor & aroma!

My family has been ordering their tea for years, and we drink it all the time.  Now we even carry it in our own retail store in Portland! I'm not much of a tea drinker other than Market Spice, but it tastes so good that I can't resist.

review/summary: The best tea I know
review/text: Market Spice Tea is blended in the Market Spice shop at the Pike Place Market in Seattle.  Back behind the famous fish-throwing guys is the small shop that not only will sell you almost every herb or spice you can imagine, but blends the tastiest tea I've ever had.<br /><br />Market Spice tea is made with black tea, and contains essential oils of cinnamon and orange.  The result is a delightful tea that is naturally sweet without the use of sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />In Seattle, the tea is widely available, sold in many of the grocery stores.  Not so available to me since I moved across the country.  I'm happy to be able to order it online here at Amazon.com.

Last Christmas, my daughter's boyfriend in Seattle bought her an assortment of Seattle's best assortments of coffees, teas, and other gourmet items.  My favorite of course was the cinnamon orange marketspice tea! It has a taste that you just cant run out of it,or your going to keep going back for more.  Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I do!  Its a real winner in my book!

review/text: Of all teas I've tried, this is my favorite; sweet, powerful, and fragrant, MarketSpice is the answer for many moods and cravings.  I prefer this tea hot, steeped for 5+ minutes, but its good cold as well-although I've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming.  Be warned: if you only like very subtle white teas, this may not be for you . . . but it has converted many a non-tea-drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts.

I received a completely different item.  I called to have this fixed, and they denied shipping the wrong item.  This is such a frustrating and stressful situation, I decided just to keep the wrong item because I needed something.  But after dropping $600 on 2 packs of 100 and $300 for overnight shipping, I would expect to receive the correct item.  I really have to question ever ordering from Amazon again.  Watch out, you probably will not receive this item.

review/summary: The Good Stuff
review/text: Our two dogs love the by Nature canned food, and why wouldn't they? It's almost entirely composed of chicken, and they both love chicken. I'm not a total convert to the all meat diet, so we mix the canned food with some dry food by the same company that contains some oat, flaxseed, and alfalfa in addition to the meat protein component.I like to cover all my bases.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer, the canned recipe is formulated to "meet" the nutritional levels formulated by the AAFCO  Association of American Feed Control Officials) dog food nutrient profiles. It does NOT specifically state that this is a "complete and balanced" formula.<br /><br /> The food looks and smells like I would expect dog food to; it's a solid consistency that is easily stirred like baby food when warmed. The first three ingredients are chicken, chicken broth, and chicken liver.<br /><br />While comparing prices in the store, I noted that a 13 ounce can of this food is more cost effective than the smallish cans of Wellness (another great food) and other brands in the small cans.<br /><br />Eventually our dogs get tired of eating the same brand of food daily, but for now they are by Nature aficionados.

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: My little dog has alot of food sensitivities, mostly grains, so I thought I would try this food for him.  I bought a can at the local pet store before I committed myself to a whole case.  Glad I did.  He liked it OK, didn't love it, but I was worried about giving him liver all the time.  I did a google search about giving dogs liver and it recommended no more than 3 times a week or it causes some kind of vitamin A toxicity.  Anyway, I may end up giving it to him just a few times a week, because I do like this manufacturer.  I have spoken to them and they really are a quality food company with human grade products.

review/text: I purchased these at a big-box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.

review/summary: Nature's Miracle Oil
review/text: There is a quiet epidemic in America caused by excessive sugar in our diet and overuse of antibiotics.  The epidemic is Yeast (fungus) overgrowth, and it has been estimated that upwards of 85% of Americans suffer from it, many without even knowing.  Fungal overgrowth has been linked to cancer and other diseases.  There is a simple test called the "SPIT TEST".  Do a search on these subjects and take this test.  If you have the symptoms, purchase this product, Nature's Alchemy Essential Oil of Oregano.  Take as directed (usually 1 drop in water or juice 3 times daily).  Oregano is one of the most potent anti-fungal agents in existence, and it is completely natural with virtually no side effects.  Make sure it is wild oregano.  Don't take my word for it, do some research.  This product worked great for me, and cleared up a stubborn yeast overgrowth problem in just weeks.

review/text: This is Chinese green tea (some say that's the best).  This product is made in China. The box is not as stable after you open it, but it will continue to close and hold the contents. All the bags are individually packaged. It tasted good with honey and it's a great price for so many tea bags. Green tea is reported to be good for the body. One of my Traditional Chinese Medicine instructors drinks 7 or 8 cups a day. Only recently have I been drinking this tea. One cup a day is enough for me, but I like it and if helps my body, that great. It was delivered super speedy.

review/text: I bought this because (a) I love green tea (b) it was all natural and (c) it was organic. The tea has a lovely, delicate flavor and is quite satisfactory on all accounts except for one small issue: the string that allows you to steep/pull the tea bag out of your cup isn't always securly fastened and therefore has a tendency to tear off. This, however, isn't a major problem (for me at least) and I'd reccomend this product to anyone who is a true tea fanatic.

review/summary: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea
review/text: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea<br />=================================<br /><br />If you drink green tea you can-<br />* Lower Cholesterol<br />* Increase Thermogenesis (the body's rate of burning calories)<br />* Enhance fat oxidation<br /><br />Burns Fat Naturally<br />Green tea contains high concentrations of catechin polyphenols. These compounds work with other chemicals to intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis, where heat is created in the body by burning fuels such as fat. Drinking Japanese green tea regularly will increase your metabolism and help burn fat safely and naturally.<br /><br />Lowers cholesterol and increases energy expenditure<br />Green tea also causes carbohydrates to be released slowly, preventing sharp increases in blood-insulin levels. This promotes the burning of fat.<br />The thermogenic effect was originally attributed to its caffeine content. However, green tea stimulates brown fat thermogenesis far greater than a comparable amount of pure caffeine. It appears that the catechin-polyphenols, in particular epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and caffeine that naturally occur in green tea work synergistically to stimulate thermogenesis and augment and prolong sympathetic stimulation of thermogenesis. It has been shown to increase 24-hour energy expenditure and fat oxidation (caffeine only increases metabolism during the time you take it).<br /><br />Weight is gained as excess sugars and fats are stored in the body as fat cells. Green tea catechins can help prevent obesity by inhibiting the movement of glucose in fat cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been found to be especially effective. There is now good evidence that green tea catechins are related to reductions in body fat.<br />EGCG is a powerful antioxidant with positive qualities but a balanced diet and exercise, lots of it, are of paramount importance to any weight reduction program.<br /><br />Green Tea and Weight Loss<br />=========================<br />by: Kathryn O'Neill<br /><br />There's recently been a LOT in the weight loss news concerning green tea.<br />Green tea's weight loss effects have been causing more and more people to start sipping the ancient Chinese or Japanese brew.<br /><br />But just how does green tea help you lose weight? And does it really work or is it all just hype? This article gives you the real facts about drinking green tea to lose weight.<br />Advantages of Drinking Green Tea for Weight Loss:<br /><br />1) Green tea revs up your metabolism<br /><br />A study reported on in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that green tea extract resulted in a significant increase in energy expenditure (a metabolism `boost').<br />The researchers also concluded that that over a 24-hour period, green tea extract increases the metabolic rate by 4%. These effects are probably due to the high concentrations of catechin polyphenols found in green tea. These work to help intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis (the rate at which your body burns calories).<br /><br />2) Green tea inhibits fat absorption and helps glucose regulation<br />Experts tell us that the catechins in green tea help to inhibit the movement of glucose into fat cells. Green tea may also act as al glucose regulator. It helps to slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal. This prevents high insulin spikes (lots of insulin promotes fat storage) and the subsequent fat storage.<br /><br />3) Green tea may help reduce appetite<br />Scientists at the University of Chicago found that green tea caused rats to lose up to 21 percent of their body weight. Rats injected with a green tea extract lost their appetites and consumed up to 60 percent less food after seven days of daily injections. This may have something to do with the blood sugar regulating effects of green tea.<br /><br />4) Green tea can help you save calories on your morning brew.<br />We are a nation hooked on our java. Be it the regular double-cream, double-sugar standard or that mocha, dappa, frappucinno, the calories we ingest just to get our morning caffeine is wreaking havoc on our waistlines.<br /><br />If you want to save mega-calories in the morning but still get your caffeine fix, try substituting green tea for coffee. Or have a green tea in the afternoon instead of that 700 calorie mocha-chillate dream. You'll definitely notice the difference in your waistline after a few weeks.<br /><br />So there are 4 ways that green tea can help you with weight loss. But how much do you actually have to drink to get these amazing metabolism boosting effects?<br /><br />Experts vary but the general consensus seems to be that 3 - 5 cups of green tea per day is optimal. Doing this can help you burn an extra 70 calories per day which amounts to 7 pounds per year. Pretty good for not exercising or cutting calories, right?<br />However, 3 - 5 cups can be a lot for some people, so you might also want to consider green tea extract, green tea pills or a green tea patch.<br /><br />Disadvantages of Drinking Green Tea For Weight Loss:<br />#1) Green tea is not a magic bullet<br />While some people will tell you that green tea is the be-all-end-all for weight loss success, I think the keyword here is balance. You're not going to eat 5000 calories a day, drink a cup of green tea and make it all go away - it just isn't going to happen. A healthy diet and increased exercise will go a long way in helping you lose weight and keep it off.<br />#2) Be cautious of the caffeine if you have health problems<br />For some people that have heart troubles, high blood pressure or stimulant sensitivities, the caffeine in green tea may not be the best idea. If you're worried about the caffeine from green tea, try taking green tea extract. Most green tea extract is made from decaffeinated green tea so you can still get the weight loss benefits without the caffeine.<br />If you think the caffeine may be a problem, make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea for weight loss. Also make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.<br /><br />*** Bottom Line ***: Green tea helps you with weight loss by boosting your metabolic rate, regulating your blood sugar, suppressing your appetite and giving you something else besides that high calorie, high sugar coffee beverage to drink in the morning. While it's not the magic bullet, it can definitely give you a boost in weight loss and in your overall health!<br /><br />Green tea may benefit some more than others<br />-------------------------------------------<br />At the recent International Research Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer sponsored by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), scientists presented new evidence about phytochemicals in green tea that may help prevent normal cells from developing into cancer and spreading.<br />Yet people may wonder if drinking green tea is worthwhile, because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to allow a health claim for green tea on labels this summer.<br />Although more evidence is needed to justify a strong statement about green tea's ability to lower the risk of cancer, it is not a bad idea to include this beverage in a healthful, mostly plant-based diet.<br />Black tea is the most frequently consumed tea in the U.S., but green tea contains far higher levels of the phytochemical EGCG. Both oolong and black teas, including the common orange pekoe, lose some of their EGCG as they are processed. However, green tea leaves are steamed or baked before they can oxidize, so their EGCG levels remain high.<br />Since it is a powerful antioxidant, EGCG may help prevent both heart disease and cancer. It helps to stabilize highly reactive molecules known as free radicals that can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease, or alter the DNA in our genes, promoting cancerous changes. In addition, EGCG may protect against cancer development by increasing the self-destruction of cancer cells and by affecting enzymes and the signals between cells, slowing the growth and multiplication of cancer cells.<br />Related content<br />* Scientists find how green tea fights cancer<br />* Green tea doesn't lower cancer risk, says FDA<br />But while the evidence of EGCG's ability to deter cancer is quite strong in laboratory studies, population studies show much less consistent benefits. The inconsistent population evidence is one of the primary reasons that the FDA recently refused to approve a health claim on the labels of products with green tea that would link its consumption with lower cancer risk.<br />Benefits some more than others<br />In the FDA's view, the effectiveness of foods in laboratory studies is merely background material. Consistent evidence among populations is key to supporting health claims. However, researchers point out that the laboratory studies, which are overwhelmingly positive about the health effects of EGCG, are necessary to explain the results of population studies. Without them, we would not know what EGCG is or what it can do.<br />Furthermore, inconsistent results from population studies do not mean that there is no benefit to drinking green tea. Human studies show that the antioxidant capacity of the blood does increase about an hour after drinking green tea.<br />Other studies show that markers of DNA damage decrease after drinking even black tea or decaf green tea, both of which contain less EGCG than regular green tea.<br />The differences in health impact that are seen among green tea drinkers in population studies may mean that green tea benefits some people more than others. Genetic variations, varying exposures to risk-producing substances like tobacco, or different diets could all help explain the differences seen in these studies.<br />One study, for example, suggests that tea and soy may produce contrary benefits. Eating one of these foods may decrease the potential benefits from the other one.<br />Drinking massive amounts of green tea will never be able to save us from the ill effects of overeating a poorly balanced diet and living a sedentary lifestyle.<br />Eating a mostly plant-based diet, maintaining a healthy weight, keeping physically active and avoiding tobacco are the most effective steps we can take to lower our cancer risk. However, for those of us who would like to do a little more to reduce the risk of cancer, replacing three or four cups of coffee or soda per day with green tea is a reasonable step that may bring a variety of health benefits.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K2MUUY">Lipton Green Tea - 100% Natural, 2009 New Spring Green Tea, 50 Fresh Tea Bags from China by A2AWorld Green Tea</a><br /><br />&lt;the end>

review/summary: (Almost) too good to be true!
review/text: I love chai, and black tea with milk and honey, so I was not expecting this tea to taste "good" without adding a sweetener. To my surprise, it is exactly as its box describes - sweet and spicy. It has no sweeteners, however, as the sweet flavor comes from its unique blend.<br /><br />While there is artificial flavor in it - an artificial spice, according to Good Earth's site - there is also an organic version (which I haven't had yet.) I am convinced it's just fake cinnamon, because if you steep the tea too long, you get the same tongue-tingle as eating red hots (cinnamon candies) when you were a kid.<br /><br />All that aside, this is the best tasting tea I have ever had, and like most teas, it has very few calories. (3 calories, according to other sites I've seen.)

review/summary: Not your average tea - even non tea drinkers can enjoy!
review/text: I am a fair weather tea drinker & I can only palate most teas with a lot of sugar. This tea is the ONE exception. I first drank this years ago in a Good Earth restaurant (the first really healthy restaurant) & I was hooked immediately! I have never since found a tea that was even close to this. Most teas have a leafy, stick taste that screams to be covered up with sugar. This tea stands alone, no sugar, no cream - nothing but incredible full flavor. It is not much like typical tea but rather almost a cider instead (minus the apple juice). It has the most wonderful cinnamony flavor that is warming & relaxing. I have even made it cold & it is good, but so different from the usual ice tea.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to enjoy tea but who doesn't like the leafy flavors of typical tea, try this one!

review/text: I have enjoyed this tea for 25 years. Something changed at some point. Recently reading the ingredient list I noticed the second ingredient is "Natural Flavor".  What is it?  I wrote to the company and received a pat answer that it is a 'proprietary blend' and they can not divulge the actual ingredients except to your enquiring physician. It could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe  similar to MSG or it could be worse. Might our bodies think it unnatural?  Do they mean 'natural' as in from planet earth?  So I'll be giving up my favorite tea.<br />I think I am going to get some star anise, cinnamon, rose hips, and cardamom  from Frontier herbs via Amazon instead.

review/summary: Natural OR Artificial Flavor, your choice
review/text: So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a "spice flavor not found in nature," they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad).  It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper.<br /><br />Update Aug 2012: I purchased this tea from another source (referenced in another Amazon review for this product) and although it did come in the newer purple packaging, the box says, 'with natural flavors,' whereas the one I ordered from Amazon says, 'with natural and artificial flavors.'  The one without the artificial flavors has the excellent taste you're looking for.

review/summary: the only herbal tea that tastes fantastic without adding anything to it!
review/text: Even my picky young children love this tea.  It's hard to describe the sweet and spicy flavor of this tea - it is entirely in a class of its own.  I've tried many different brands and flavors of herbal teas, and none can compare to the potent flavor of Good Earth Original.  It's so delicious that we often have a mug of it in place of dessert.  It's the perfect pallet cleanser and a wonderful addition to any cold evening.  Try it iced for the summer as well.  You can't beat the fact that it needs absolutely no sweetener!  Even though I try other kinds of tea regularly, I'm always finding myself grabbing another Good Earth tea bag because it's second to none.

review/summary: Tastiest tea ever
review/text: I have been craving this tea ever since I moved to Cleveland, where it is not available. What a joy to find it available through Amazon!<br /><br />Good Earth Original is a tea for people who like a sweet and spicy tea.  Cinnamon is the main note, followed by orange, rosehip, and just a touch of mint.  The tea does contain artificial flavorings, which is the only downside.  It's already sweet without any additional sugar, but a bit of honey really makes the flavor "pop."  Great hot or cold.<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to go have a cup right now.

review/summary: Change in ingredients, hardly has more taste than water
review/text: I have always purchased "Good Earth Caffeine Free Original Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea." I tried to reorder the same tea, and was directed to the page of this tea. The box has changed, but it still says "Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy Tea and Herb Blend" and the description of the product on Amazon says it is "caffeine-free." .<br /><br />I received the caffeinated tea. I then tried to return the tea, and saw that Amazon doesn't let you return grocery items. I spoke to Good Earth and they said that they would send me a label to return the tea, but that was two weeks ago and I still haven't received a label.<br /><br />I did try the tea and the worst part of this experience is that it hardly has more taste than water. Now its time to find a replacement tea (and to see whom I can convince to take this tea from me while I admit to them how tasteless I found it.)<br /><br />One more complaint, the product description on Amazon says: " All Good Earth Teas contain absolutely no sugar, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives." while one of the main ingredients in both the caffeinated and decaffeinated teas is "artifical flavor."

They are sweet because of the combination of spices... so a perfect alternative to juice, soda, etc. During the summer, I toss a couple of bags in a cold jug of water in the fridge and I have instant iced tea all day long. Now THIS is a healthy habit I can enjoy!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I saw other reviews (but not for this entry) that said, "artificial on the box" , but "natural" in the AMZN write-up.  Well, the other day, I got the box.. Second ingredient said, "artificial flavoring".  Calling Good Earth Teas resulted in futility.  They told me the definition of "artificial flavoring is proprietary"  So, GET, you're telling me that I can stick a chemical of some type in my body, unaware of what it is, and expect I won't have a complication from it??.  Even if I don't, the idea that y'all won't tell me what it is, concerns me, and it should concern anyone else who is drinking this "new version" of their tea.<br />They also said, "until we can find this source, it'll continue to be 'artificial'."  THEN, DON'T MAKE IT until you have the necessary ingredients!

review/text: Prior reviews had me concerned, and yes, it's true. The second ingredient is "artificial flavor". How dumb. I've been drinking this tea for many years and it isn't as good as it used to be (before the purple packaging change). But it's still pretty darn good and a nice sweet treat, so I'll continue to drink it. And the Amazon price is very good.

review/summary: My all-time favorite iced tea!
review/text: Back in the day I would go to Good Earth restaurant in Santa Clara with the wife and kid and we would proceed to snorkel down gallons of Good Earth iced tea along with delicious healthy food!  Well, last time I checked, the restaurant is gone but I can still get my favorite iced tea -- and I do, I get a case of these boxes every month!  This is a great tea if you are a fan of cinnamon spicy goodness combined with the bite of a good bit of black tea (I'm not a fan of the decaf version!).  A slice of lemon really takes it over the top, sweetener is optional (ok, so I add sweetener because I'm now a Southerner) since it does have a natural sweetness to it.<br /><br />Really my only complaint is that I have to mess with this silly little teabags, I wish these guys would make iced tea quart size tea bags or sell this tea in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they do to make this tea so good.  I've tried other teas that sounded very similar but none of them have quite the unique flavor of the Good Earth tea.  Highly recommended even if you are not a fan of the restaurants.

review/text: I prefer coffee over tea most of the time. I've never been much of a tea drinker. I find myself drinking it only when I get sick or have a sore throat. But I saw the positive reviews on this tea so I had to try it. I think it's pretty good. Definitely better than any other teas I've tried. It has a spicy kick to it. It kind of reminds me of a liquid version of fireballs - a penny candy I used to get as a kid. There's a bunch of interesting ingredients in this tea such as papaya, ginger root, anise seed, lemongrass just to name a few. But the cinnamon stands out the most. I'm now drinking tea a little more than I used to thanks to this.

But the description above says that it is caffeine free, yet the Good Earth web site states that their black tea has 50 mg caffeine per 8 oz. cup for the Original. The first ingredient listed is black tea. And it is sweet, due to perhaps the anise seed or papaya, but there is no sugar, corn product or stevia on the ingredients list. I've been drinking it for 20 years.

review/summary: pleasantly surprised
review/text: I'm not normally a tea drinker...I actually ordered this for my mom as a gift because she loves this tea so much. She got me to try it, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a subtle, yet not overpowering taste of cinnamon, and doesn't have that usual "tea" taste. Mixed with a bit of honey, I think I could get used to this!

review/summary: Great tasting tea
review/text: I drink a lot of black flavored teas and I have to put milk into all of them except for this tea, which has such a unique flavor to it.  Just the right touch of sweet and right touch of spice.  Truly a delightful tea.

review/summary: Awesome tea
review/text: This tea is absolutely delicious.  I've been enjoying it and making it for iced tea for over 15 years.  I first started drinking it at the Good Earth Restaurant in Northridge, CA.  Not only is it the best iced tea I've ever tasted, but it is high in antioxidants and very healthy. Every person that I've made this tea for loves it, hot or cold.

review/summary: Unique Test - A New Favorite
review/text: A friend of mine gave me the caffeine free version, which I loved. I had a hard time finding the tea in my local grocery stores, so I went only. I was thrilled when I noticed there was a caffeine full version so I quickly bought it. I love the unique flavors - a mix of chai, fruit and spice flavors. Also, the longer you let the tea bag sit in your cup, the stronger the taste - no bitterness like other teas here.<br /><br />I also love that you can buy it in bulk - in 6 boxes. I've got boxes at home, at work, a few bags in my purse and some in my Christmas room for presents.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I've been drinking GoodEarth Original for close to 20 years. When I could no longer get it locally, first place I looked was Amazon. I drink a cup of hot tea every morning. Don't want to live without it!
