review/summary: Crunchy Raisins
review/text: I love this mix. The one thing that really did it for me were the crunchy raisins. I can only eat raisins in Kellog's Raisin Bran and Little Debbie Raisin cream pies. But I loved these raisins so much that I purchased them separately. But, they weren't crunchy. How do I make the raisins crunch?!<br /><br />Anyway,Just Fruit Munchies is a great snack, if you don't have a problem with the crunch. I only gave it four stars because I could do with the mango/apples. Still good, but unnecessary.

review/summary: System Jo Premium lube
review/text: This isn't bad personal lube.  It is silicone based, so that's good.  However, the formula for this particular one is pretty thick.  The consistancy is about twice as dense as other silicone based lubes (Astroglide X, Wet Platinum) which are really good.  I wouldn't use this for anal with my wife (or whatever you're in to, I won't judge) but maybe for foreplay and massages, this is fine.  It's way too thick for toys, anal or just fast penetration.  Think of it like putting 80 weight truck oil in a small car that should have some thing closer to 30 weight oil to work properly.  It'll still work, but not with the performance you'd like.<br /><br />So as stated, if you like anal or just like it fast and rough etc., stick to Astroglide X or Wet Platinum (silicone based lubes with a fairly lose consistancy).  They use Wet Platinum in porn...  System Jo premium, use it for massages and foreplay.

review/summary: Sweet taste of home.
review/text: The pharmacy in my hometown used to sell these and their green (actual medicinal cough-drop) alternative. The others were great for if you had a sore throat, but these.. oh, these were amazing for me. I was a little kid and the local pharmacy sold both types, but I would always fake sick so my mom could get me these since she knew I wasn't really ill, I just wanted the candies.<br />I had to move across the country and quite frankly, I hate the cough drops and hard candies that Walmart sells. I was aching for a taste of my hometown, so I went as far as hunting them down online, since I didn't remember the name. I'm glad to know I can get a steady supply of them online from now on.<br />They just arrived today - rather quickly - and I tore into my first pack. You're paying a very cheap price for a box of 24 packages, each of which has 9 tasty drops.. Trust me, one is all you need to satisfy your sweet tooth and leave you tasting like honey all day long.<br />I will probably continue to buy these for as long as I live.

review/text: Pardina lentils are my favorite.  They hold their shape when cooked so, being a vegetarian, they are great as a meat substitute in things like sloppy joes or casseroles.  The dryland hills of the Palouse in eastern Washington and northern Idaho produce the best lentils, dry peas, garbanzo beans and wheat, much of which are exported to India and Asia.  Pardinas are great in soups, salads, casseroles and rice pilafs.  Palouse Brand are the only brand of lentils in my kitchen.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: These are excellent lentils, from a great agricultural area. I've been to the Palouse several times, a wonderful, amazingly beautiful region of rolling green farmland in eastern Washington/northern Idaho, famous for photography, rich soil, and, well, lentils.  They even have a lentil festival every August, no kidding. When I saw these lentils on Amazon I had to try them - I belong to Amazon Prime, get free two-day shipping - and they are excellent. Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores. I agree with what someone else said, too, they are very clean, I haven't found any rocks or twigs in them. Just great lentils. I'm ordering a five pound bag this time so I can have them on hand for awhile - and I love knowing I'm supporting a great gem of a growing region by buying them.

review/summary: Great Wasabi Taste
review/text: I love wasabi and thought I would try this product out. I hate to have to run to a restaurant every time I have a wasabi craving.<br /><br />You mix this powder with equal amounts of water, let sit 10 minutes and you've got wasabi sauce.<br /><br />It tastes good and has a good kick. It will burn your sinuses. The color isn't a bright green like I usually see in restaurant but is kind of a pale, pea-soup color but it doesn't affect the flavor.<br /><br />The texture is like when you take powdered mustard and mix with water, the texture is a little different than restaurant wasabi. It is more like a sauce than a paste.<br /><br />If the color and the texture doesn't bother you then I recommend this product, it still has all the wasabi taste.<br /><br />Amazon does sell wasabi paste on here also if you are interested in more of paste texture. I'm pleased with this product, it's great on food and since it's a powder, you can sprinkle in food like a spice. Yum!

review/text: After some unpleasant experiences with unwholesome "rawhide" type dog chews (some from China and Mexico) we found these Purina brand "HeartyHide" (real beefhide) chicken basted strips a great diversion for a 7 month old Scottie with a need to chew.  Our dog spends hours working these strips over and actually consumes some of them.  He prizes the chewed on pieces and tries to "bury" them under pillows and chair covers.  He likes to carry his current chip around and will take it to bed and sleep with his head over the chip.  Wonderful, safe and wholesome dog chew.  The chicken flavor coating does not stain our rugs but the original (beef?) flavor has a dark brown coating that did stain our rugs...the light tan chicken basted strips seem to taste good to MacTavish and do not stain.  Your dog will thank you trying these.

review/summary: Simply awful
review/text: I decided to try this to up my protein intake. After my first bite I thought it wasn't so bad. After my second, I changed my mind. It may be the worse breakfast cereal I've ever eaten. I told myself to finish the bowl, but couldn't and had to spit out my last mouthful to prevent myself from vomiting. It was that bad. I honestly wonder if people on strict diets lose their sense of taste.

review/summary: High in Protein, Low in Carbs
review/text: I started eating this cereal when I found out that I had gestational diabetes with my current pregnancy. It is very difficult to eat an almost Atkins like diet, be vegetarian and have keep your choices varied. It is VERY low in carbs, yet high in protein which is different from almost all other cereals. It tastes good and fills you up.

review/text: I was looking for a new cereal to enjoy, since Product 19 can't be found on grocery store shelves anymore.  I know Kellogg's is really pushing the "Special K" diet and all, but this is the worst tasting cereal I've ever had.  After I choked down most of the first bowl I immediately pitched the rest in the trash.  Thanks Amazon for making Product 19 available; wish I had thought to look here earlier before buying the Special K Protein Plus.

review/text: One word- Yucka. After not being able to finish just one bowl of this, I've decided I'll give it to the birds. Seriously so nasty. People always complain about how fiber cereal tastes like cardboard. Well, I think Kelloggs tried to fix this problem by making this cereal 'thinner'. But by that it just turned it into newspaper instead of cardoard. It takes forever to chew! The people who think it's good are probably old, taste-bud-less, or just choking it down for it's fiber benefits. There are easier ways to get fiber.

review/summary: This is worse than cardboard
review/text: I relied on the Special K name when I chose this cereal.  The pecan variety was wonderful so, after reviewing the grain content, I figured that Protein Plus would be comparable.  I could not have been more wrong.  After an hour of chewing, I finally choked down a bowl.  Was almost late for work.  It tasted like "All Bran" from the 60's, but worse.  I asked my spouse if he tried it and without coaching, he said after chewing forever, he finally got through a bowl.  'Nuff said.  Kellogs, try again.  Worst cereal I've ever had in 50+ years.

review/summary: Ridiculous!
review/text: Normally, I don't add reviews to Amazon, but after seeing the reviews for this cereal I just had to. My wife and I started dieting and eating healthy within the last year and have changed most of the foods that we eat. Our diets differ in the sense that I watch my caloric intake and my wife is on a low carb diet. I picked this cereal up for her at our local grocery store a few months ago and decided to try it myself because it does have really nice nutritional value listed on the box. However (and this is the main reason for my review), it tastes totally horrible!! I noticed that there was not only a few people on here stating it tasted great and wonderful and they saw flowers blooming, the sun come up and so forth when they ate some. The only conclusion as a clear thinking adult is that these people are used to eating saw dust or whatever comes out of their paper shredder normally. To sum it up, if you want to eat this cereal because of its nutritional value then go for it. That's a great and noble reason and I'm with ya, but PLEASE do not tell other unsuspecting people considering whether or not to purchase this product that it tastes good.

review/summary: Best tasting "cardboard" I ever had . . .but not any more!
review/text: ** This review was done for the old formula - see update below for review of the "improved" formula **  Last year, I stumbled across a website that evaluates your current breakfast cereal for nutrition, satiety, etc. and this cereal was at the top of the recommended list as an alternative to my former option.  I've always found that original Special K left me more hungry and the suggested serving size was laughable.  The artificial chocolate pieces in Choco. Delight were vile, so with those strikes, I was a bit reluctant to try Protein Plus.  It didn't help that some reviewers didn't like the taste - ordering 4 boxes that I'd be stuck with was uncomfortable, but I went for it.<br /><br />That was nearly a year ago and this has been my "go to" cereal ever since.  I think it tastes pretty good, so I advise that you decide for yourself on taste.  It has a light and sweet cinnamon flavor, I love the added protein and it's very low in sugar (2 g's per .75 cup serving). The flakes are sturdy (great crunch) and dense - not airy at all - holds up well in skim milk or yogurt, but I typically eat it straight up - out of my handy measuring cup.  I don't need to sweeten it at all and a serving size, or just over, leaves me satisfied (really hard to do) and a box seems to last me awhile - another huge plus.  I even carry a bag as a snack - especially when I travel - so that I'm not tempted to make less healthy choices. While I can't give all the credit to Protein Plus, as part of an overall reduced calorie daily intake attempt, I've lost 20 lbs in the past year - and although near my goal - have no intention of taking this off my grocery list.<br /><br />**Update 8.5.12** - the  formula and stats have indeed changed, and significantly IMO.  I am not thrilled and I wish they left well enough alone.  Examples:  Calories from 100 to 120, Sugar (now the 3rd ingredient) from 2-3 to 7 grams (double - really?!), fiber and protein same, but the old box claims 5 grams of fiber when the fine print says 3.  The new box just has 3.  Other stats have changed too, I just don't have the old box available to refer to.  I am eating the new boxes since I have 4 from Subscribe and Save, but I got no warning of the change and there is a huge difference in texture, sweetness, etc.  Overall, it tastes okay, but it lost its edge.  I have cancelled this S&S and I am going to look locally to see if I can still find the old formula and stock up.  Big fat BOO to Kellogg's - other than the easier opening inner sack,this was a stupid move.  If I could choose no stars - I would.  I have found the old formula locally and I am stocking up!

review/text: I have been enjoyng the Special K Protein cereal for at least a year but Kellogs decided to "improve" it, and I say, Yuk.  The "Extra" means they've added extra sugar! Now it does taste like cardboard, but cardboard that is sickly sweet.  Another case where corporate America is determined to keep America's sweet-tooth in high gear.  Thanks Kellogs, for making a good product bad.<br /><br />Update:  A good, less sugary low-carb, high-protein substitute for this cereal is Hi-Lo Low Carb Cereal by Organic Milling, which is also available on Amazon.  Hi-Lo has 1/7 the sugar of the Special K, more protein and more fiber.  And it tastes better.

review/summary: Formula changed to make it LESS healthy
review/text: Boo to this.  I was SO happy with it when I had finally found a low-carb cereal in which I could add my own sweetener to control how sweet I wanted it, and safely - with Stevia or something else.  Even just a couple of sliced strawberries.  This was the only one to fit into a reasonable daily carb allowance.<br /><br />Then they changed it to be sweeter and loaded up on more sugar and carbs.  I complained to Kellogg and they replied that they did a taste test and found people wanted it to be sweeter.  A TASTE TEST.  On people that probably had no interest in its intended purpose to be a healthier option for people that actually need to watch their diets closely - they evidently didn't test for value when it came to its health benefits, they tested purely for flavor.  Shouldn't this have been tested on people that WERE concerned with health...?  It's that essentially the goal demographic?  The general public has TONS of sugary cereals to choose from.  Can't we just have ONE?<br /><br />You've lost my business, Kellogg, as well as many others that follow a low-carb/keto diet.  I was once recommending this cereal to everyone that was trying to be more healthy so they didn't have to give up all the types of food they love--those on Atkins, Protein Power, the huge following of low-carbers on reddit, to name a few.  Now we're back to pretty much no cereal options once again.

review/text: This used to be one of the healthiest cereals available. As an almost vegetarian it was one of the only ways I could get enough iron and protein, plus it had loads of fiber. Now it has less fiber, way more sugar, and more carbs.<br /><br />After 7+ years of this being a staple in my diet I will no longer be purchasing this. Such a shame.<br /><br />I am SO disappointed and I know others are, as well. So, I created a petition in the hope that if enough people sign they might eventually return the original formula.<br /><br />That said, since I've found Hi-Lo cereal which is even better (carb, sugar, and fiber-wise) than the original formula of special k low carb I kind of don't care what Kellogg's does.

review/summary: Not so healthy anymore BEWARE!
review/text: BUYER BEWARE!  I have been enjoying this cereal for quite some time.  I was so disappointed when I received the "Now Tastes Even Better" boxes of this cereal.  I guess Kelloggs' idea of "better" is adding sugar and reducing the fiber.  Sugar is now listed as the 3rd most prominent ingredient.  REALLY???  Had I wanted more sugar I could just add that myself.  The description of the cereal I bought from Amazon reads:<br />  Product Features - 100 calories<br />  "4 boxes of 13.5 ounce Special K Protein Plus Cereal<br />  Protein-rich combination of tasty, low-carb wheat, soy, and rice flakes<br />  10 grams of protein with just 2 grams of sugar and 3 grams of fat in each serving<br />  Lightly sweetened and deliciously crunchy for a great breakfast or snack<br />  Good source of fiber for overall dietary wellbeing and sense of satisfaction"<br /><br />The new numbers are 120 calories, 7 grams of sugar, just 3 grams of fiber and at least the one positive of only 1 gram of fat, reduced from 3. It may taste better to some, but to me it was fine just the way it was.  I would have appreciated knowing about the change before I purchased this cereal again.

review/summary: Bad change in formula to "Plus" version
review/text: The previous incarnation of this "protein" cereal was acceptable ( nutty tasting, good with fruit) and relatively low in carbs for junk food.  It has been my mainstay for breakfast for years.  I used to travel with it in the days when it was hard to find because I wanted to stay on track with eating while traveling.  I was not the only one to do this: I recall that a business passenger who was on the airliner that landed in the Hudson river a few years ago voiced his distress on air to a reporter that a box of this hard to find cereal was certainly lost along with his luggage.<br /><br />Now I just bought four boxes of the new "Plus" version and I am trying to give it away:  sweet, bland, overly dosed with chemical flavors. It has gone from 9 to 19 gr carbohydrate with sugar as its third ingredient.  I am irritated at being forced to change, but on the positive side it has prompted me to do the sensible thing and jettison commercial breakfast stuff entirely.

The whole point of getting the protein plus cereal is to get a protein boost without the added carbs.  This cereal now has an addition 20 calories and 5 grams of sugar, and to be quite honest tastes worse than the original.  I don't care for overly sweet cereals.  I prefered the whole grain taste of the original special K protein plus.  It now tastes like a box of Tony's Frosted Flakes.  Yuk!

I was so happy to see it back on the shelves, but now they've change it.  Even the sugar level went up.  I just wish there was another cereal on the market that had 9 grams of carbs or less.  Oh well, I'll surely miss it.

review/summary: Thumbs down on the New Improved Formula!
review/text: I just spent the past 90 minutes scouring the shelves of my local grocers with the original Protein Plus formula.  What on earth were they thinking with changing the formula? Caloric load went up 20%, sugar content when up 350%!!, carb content went up 36%, and fiber content decreased 40%.. Yes, fat content decreased, but it's better to have some fat with those carbs. This product, as originally formulated, was good for people on isocaloric (kinda like Zone: roughly balanced macronutrient ratios). It no longer is.<br /><br />I am furious.

review/text: This is a big disappointment.  Suddenly the formula changes - for the worse.  I have canceled my formerly wonderful "Subscribe & Save" Amazon subscription.  Might as well buy Cap'n Crunch or Frosted Flakes.  "Now Tastes Even Better!" the company says.  Well, it depends on who's doing the tasting! It is now far too sweet, as well as being significantly less healthy - look at the increase in calories and sodium.  What a pity.  Farewell, Special K Protein Plus, old style.  It was nice knowing and eating you.

review/summary: Why did they change this????
review/text: I just called Kellogg and told them how disappointed I am in the new formula for Special K Protein Plus. I also told them that the reviews on Amazon are horrible. The woman I talked to was very nice and she took down all my info and it will be forwarded to the Quality Control team. She said there has been many other complaints as well. She also mentioned about the taste testers liking this. And I pointed out that I would be interested in knowing how many of these people are health conscience and are not looking for sweeter food but healthier food. The taste testers preferred it because it is sweeter. I told her that most cereals are sweeter and that those people should just stick with those cereals and that Kellogg should have just left well enough alone. Now there are many people who have enjoyed this cereal for many years and have to go find another.

The flakes now actually look like some cardboard fell into the box. Awful texture. I am moving to Hi-Lo (also not so tasty unfortunately). The nutrition numbers are worse as well. Considering the health-mindedness of this cereal's customers, this move is hard to understand.

review/summary: Disappointing Change
review/text: I must say I really dislike the new recipe.  I liked the old "low carb" version and had been enjoying it for years, but somewhere along the way Kellogg's decided that people really just wanted high protein and high carb. No doubt the new formula will appeal to some, but for me, it no longer is that different than a range of other cereals out there.  Unfortunately the old one was pretty unique and I have not found a suitable alternative.

review/summary: Kellogg Doesn't Care About Our Weight...they have doubled the sugar and cut the fiber
review/text: I wrote this to Kellogg...<br /><br />YUCK!!! I do NOT like the new formulation of Special K Protein Plus....WAY TOO SWEET! And you REDUCED the fiber from 5 g. to 3 g.!!! WHY?????? You are making this cereal much less healthy by putting MORE SUGAR and LESS FIBER in it. Please change it back!!<br /><br />I don't understand why they are calling this a HEALTHY cereal, which it obviously IS NOT anymore. When you base your business decisions on the fact that people WANT SWEETER cereals, you are doomed to fail. You are neither HEALTHY nor FRUIT LOOPS. As a nutrition major, I know that some FAT...the right kind is good for us. It provides SATIETY, so we are satisfied with less and feel full faster.<br /><br />I would rather have a little MORE FAT and LESS SUGAR, which all of the experts know leads us down the road to increased diabetes and heart problems. Also, as a nutrition major, I know that in our society, PROTEIN deficiency is NOT a PROBLEM. We eat so much meat, chicken, fish, soybeans, tofu, we don't need more than 25 grams per day.<br /><br />I can see that Kellogg is not going to reformulate SPECIAL K, until the public DEMANDS IT, so count me as one person who will buy whatever remaining 5 g. of Fiber SPECIAL K that I can find and then I will get my cereal elsewhere and it WILL be HEALTHIER THAN SPECIAL K. Goodbye KELLOGG and thanks anyway.

review/summary: really not that good but it is comparatively healthy so that's worth something
review/text: Okay, so I had high hopes for this one. I would NEVER eat this cereal alone. It's just not very good at all. It's an odd texture, not very filling, the serving size is not GREAT. just normal/small. I believe theres ~100 calories per serving, so not bad in that regard but I'd have to eat 300 calories to feel even remotely satisfied.<br /><br />Nutritionally speaking it is pretty good. There is sucrolose in it though so if that's not something you want to consume then do not buy this product. Lots of protein--from soy but still a pretty hefty dose if you're deficient.<br /><br />I don't plan to purchase it again but I'd eat it if nothing else was available.

review/text: This is a great cereal all around. It has low sugar, high fiber, high protien, and tastes great! But my favorite thing of all is that I can eat it at 6 a.m. and make it to lunch time without getting that starving feeling mid morning. I eat it every day with blueberries or banana. It goes great with fruit of any kind. Of course I never add sugar, it's just sweet enough on it's own. Its also a great snack anytime of day because of the fiber, low calorie count, and its ability to stave off hunger. The reviewers who wrote that hey didn't like the taste must have been Froot Loops and Coco Puffs eaters because it's nothing like cardboard (have they really eaten cardboard?). I'm a huge fan of this cereal and tell all my friends about it. Try it !

A serving of this new formulation has more calories and less fiber than a serving of the previous version, and it contains sucralose, which I believe is not healthful.

review/text: Like many other reviewers, I've been eating this for YEARS and am in total shock that Kellogg made such a drastic change for the worst. This is a completely different cereal now, and one that I wouldn't buy. It's definitely not worth the price anymore. Not only is it less "healthy" (the reason most of us bought it in the first place!), the texture and appearance is like a 99 cent generic bag of corn flakes. Except those taste better than this does.<br /><br />The product I received is NOT what I paid for; after weeks of trying to like it, I'm ready to request a refund. Yes, it's that bad now. If you used to like this cereal, don't buy a 4 pack until you've tried it.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed. It WAS the only high-protein, somewhat lower carb cereal that didn't taste (or cost) like diet food. I'd eat a bowl and not feel hungry before lunch. It was slightly sweet, even my kids liked it! Guess what? They don't like the new version, either...kind of a big deal considering Kellogg TRIPLED the sugar!<br /><br />Definitely putting my Subscribe & Save on hold. Maybe Kellogg will take a hint. If not, bye-bye!

The cereal was a little 'bland' by most measures but as you see, this is why most of us liked it.  It didn't need sugar.  It was great for the nutritional value and we liked it as it is.<br /><br />Kellogg's decided that it's customer base for this cereal is a bunch of 7-year olds who want sugar stuff.  Tripling (yes, tripling) the sugar in a cereal to improve it and 'make you feel full longer'...is really NOT an improvement.  And, oh yes, lowering the fiber.<br /><br />On its own, is the new version okay? Yes.  But for those who had sworn by the old recipe (like me), we won't be buying this product again.  Good riddance.

review/summary: Kelloggs reformulated this
review/text: At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now.  Today, I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states "satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says "Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore.

review/text: For the very few people that rated this cereal with one star and said it tasted horrible, what do you normally eat? Frosted Flakes? If you compare the flavor of this cereal to other sugary cereals then of course this will taste bad to you. But compared to other nutritional cereals on the market, this is one of the best tasting and nutritional. I ate Kashi Go Lean for years. I liked the taste of Go Lean Crunch better but could not eat it very often because of the higher sugar content. I tried Special K Protein Plus on a whim and I loved it! I not only eat it for breakfast every work day, I sometimes eat it for lunch too. It's filling, full of nutrition, tasty, and low in sugar. I hope it never goes away.

It's just sweet enough, and somewhat nutty-tasting.  If you're accustomed to cereals with added sugar, you might find it bland, but I love it.

review/summary: Special K Protein Plus review
review/text: I have been eating this cerial for about a year and I really like it. When I first ate it I thought it had a bit of a cardboard like quality, but after eating it for a week I really like it. I have it with Safeway organics soy milk, which is slightly sweet, which I think makes a big difference. I usually have 2 servings, which is quite filling. It is still low in calories, so I don't consider this too much food for breakfast.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: This cereal doesn't taste very good, and it turns to mush the moment my almond milk touches it.  However, it is the only cereal I can eat on my low carb diet - and sometimes I just need to eat cereal.

review/summary: Its great
review/text: I have tried the origional Special K cereal and I liked it but I noticed the flakes went soggy in the milk very fast. The Special K with protein has a different taste, that I like better than the origional, and the flakes stay crispy in milk. After a bowl I feel satisfied and also I feel like I made a healthy choice.<br /><br />Ordering in bulk therefore was the best option for me and I found I saved money too.

review/summary: Terrific cereal
review/text: This is a barely sweetened cereal that is loaded with protein and fiber and has a reduced sodium content--in short it is actually one of the few healthy cold cereals. If you like a sugary tasting cereal, then this is not for you, but it most definitely does not taste like "cardboard," especially if you eat it with fruit or flavored yogurt.<br /><br />Here is a comparison with Regular Special K: 2g sugar vs. 4g; 5g fiber vs. 1g; 110mg sodium vs. 220 mg; 10g protein vs. 7g. This costs more than Regular Special K, but the extra cost is worth it to me because I feel that I am getting more for my money.<br /><br />In the spring and summer, when I stop eating my hot oatmeal each morning, I mix this with Kashi Go Lean Crunch (which is another great cold cereal that I have reviewed on Amazon), add milk, and then add some fresh fruit. This is a great way to start the day and more than holds me until lunch time.<br /><br />My wife mixes this with flavored yogurt for her breakfast, and is also good to go until lunch time.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is less than my supermarket, and if you sign up for the subscription service (as I did), you will pay even less.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want a filling, healthy cereal for breakfast that tastes good, and depend on fresh fruit or flavored yogurt rather than a sugary coating to satisfy your sweet tooth at breakfast, then you will really like this cereal.

review/summary: Can't miss a week without it!
review/text: This is my second 4-box purchase of this product.  My thoughts after my first bowl of this was, "Really?  Does protein cereal HAVE to taste so dull?"  But, I thought, this is an excellent source of protein, so I was hoping I could "flavor it up."<br /><br />If you add some berries and two packs of Truvia or Splenda, you really can create a high-protein, low-carb cereal that tastes great.  Be creative!  I eat it with different types of berries (blackberries, strawberries, raspberries), usually 2-3 times a week (the rest of the week it's eggs and/or greek yogurt).  It's really helped me with my cereal cravings and high-protein, low-carb diet, and now I couldn't make it a week without it.

review/summary: Best low carb cereal--South Texans eat with HEB Mootopia milk!
review/text: I am a superbly picky eater because I love sugar. This cereal tastes a but like raisin bran to me. I eat it with HEB Mootopia milk, which is also lower carb than regular milk, and it tastes great. Also, it helps my digestive system lots. :) Try it! Cereal sold at Wal-Mart too.

review/summary: Very Healthy for a Breakfast Cereal
review/text: First ingredient is Bran which will tell you a lot about what to expect from this product. That is why it has so much fiber that will help keep you fuller longer. The protein comes from soy which is a great protein for body health especially heart health, it is not good for muscle building. Also if you are a male try not to over do it on soy as there are numerous ill side-effects that you can Google on your own time. For the sake of this product, I would imagine this amount of soy protein could benefit anyone who isn't allergic. Don't fret about the High fructose corn syrup as there is hardly any in this product. Obviously this isn't the best tasting cereal, one reviewer said it is the "best tasting cardboard" which is a very accurate description. This item would be great to use for a diet or simple to benefit your health.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: I've been hooked on Special K since I was in high school (I'm 25).  I've gone from the regular cereal, to Special K with Strawberries, and now I'm hooked on Protein Plus.  There is just something naturally sweet and tastey about this cereal- I eat it at least once per day.  And you can't beat the price!  I subscribed to it on Amazon, and get it delivered for $2.50 per box.  In the grocery store, when I can find it, it is $4.50+ per box.  Love it, and love Amazon!
