review/summary: Newman's Dog Treats
review/text: This review is for Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. There is really not much to say here. The dogs loved the treats, and they didn't last long at all. My only complaint is that I don't thing the name of the product is long enough :)

review/summary: They're Golden!  Healthy, Wholesome Dog Treat.
review/text: "Bottom Line Up Top":  While individual tastes may vary, this healthy and humanely produced dog food is a real treat that bot you can your dog will feel good about; you in your head and heart, the dog in a very happy tummy.<br /><br />This is "one cookie" (Newman's great line in "The Young Philadelphians) that was a HUGE hit with our 14-year old Golden Retriever, "Sadie, The Wonder Dog." After some circumspect sniffing and tentative gnawing, Sadie got into these in a major way.  Yes, they're crunchy, but Sadie had no trouble chewing it up and gave us the patented "Retriever Look" signaling she wanted MORE.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The treats are about 1" by 2" and are scored so that they can be broken in half.  THe ingredient list reads like something you'd find at a California health food retreat (well, except fo rthe meat):<br /><br />Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, Organic molasses.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that Sadie is not very particular when it comes to food. Not at all. Oranges, cherry plums, lettuce, bok choy, and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She's not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach--probably some early puppy experience), but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.<br /><br />However, it's important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks, especially at her age. She has arthritis, and a poor diet has been linked to a number of disorders in older dogs. Fortunately, our vet has warned us about this, and it's become necessary to tell a certian neighbor to stop feeding her raw hamburger, baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon, etc.<br /><br />Now, I don't want to guilt-trip anyone over what they're feeding their pooches, but here's a (partial) list of culinary "BAD DOGS" that you won't find in Newman's pet foods. (The following--and MORE--can be found at [...]. WARNING: The following contains graphic descriptions of typical dog food ingredients.  HIDE YOUR CHILDREN.<br /><br />NO Poultry by-products - Ground, rendered, cleaned slaughtered poultry carcass parts such as necks, feet, lymph nodes, undeveloped eggs and intestines (and a small amount of feathers). The quality is very inconsistent between batches. Note: By product meals are often derived from 4-D meat sources - defined as food animals that have been rejected for human consumption because they were presented to the meat packing plant as "Dead, Dying, Disabled or Diseased".<br /><br />NO Chemical fertilizers - Chemical fertilizers have been incriminated in serious health problems in animals and are not allowed in organic-certified products.<br /><br />NO Antibiotics or steroids - Long-term daily administration may result in a compromised immune system, muscle wasting, and destruction of the friendly bacteria living in the intestines that aid the digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients.<br /><br />NO Chemical additives or artificial preservatives - Chemical antioxidants, such as ethoxyquin, BHT or BHA, that were designed to extend the shelf life and reduce fat spoilage (rancidity) of pet foods may cause allergic reactions and affect liver and kidney functions.<br /><br />NO Artificial Colors and Dyes - Coloring agents provide an artificial "rich and meaty" look to modify the appearance of highly processed foods and make them more appealing to pet owners.<br /><br />As if this weren't enough, 100's of thousand of dollars are donated by the Newman Foundation to animal advocates (lest you think this means radical animal activists, we're talking mainstream things like animal shelters, etc. Details available at the website above).<br /><br />Sadie says, "Give it a try!"

review/summary: TOO healthy for my Shepherd's taste?
review/text: It has been said, that dogs often show signs of their owner's personality and quirks---that our bad behaviors become their own.  In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini-me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.<br /><br />Although my dog is far from a 'mini-me,' at 126 lbs and 30" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence---we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.<br /><br />In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain brand---okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.<br /><br />Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols---a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.<br /><br />These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.<br /><br />I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues.

review/summary: Iffy
review/text: Gave this to my mother for her Doberman,  and Akkita/Shepard mix.  That said,  she has two large dogs.<br />So, they didn't like it at all,  and wouldn't touch it unless there wasn't  anything left in the house for them to eat,  Then they ate it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if they don't like this type,  flavor,  or brand,  or just aren't very fond of biscuits.  They don't seem to have too much of a problem with the milk bone brand biscuits.  Dogs are fussy,  it's really hard to find treats for dogs.<br /><br />Mine like chicken strips... And sweat potato sticks.  Greenies,  haven't really found much else.  Chicken flavor pup er ronie. Don't like beggan strips, love anything duck....  Does this give you a better idea of what my dogs taste buds are like?  Your dog may be different,  I dont know if you can really judge by what our dogs like.<br /><br />I'll rate it 3 stars since they ate it,  just not as a first option.

review/summary: Great ingredients, dogs love 'em - but not recommended for small dogs.
review/text: These are dog treats you can feel good about feeding your dogs. No fillers or artificial ingredients - just good stuff for your pet.  However, I would only recommend these for medium to large breed dogs (over 40 lbs).  The treats are quite large and are very very hard. My two small dogs (dachshunds) really wanted to devour them, but gave up as they were simply too large for them.  Even when broken into smaller pieces, the bits were very hard for the little guys to chew.  I gave the rest of the bag to our neighbors and their yellow lab simply loved 'em.  Great treats for bigger breeds!

review/summary: Not Accepted By All My Dogs
review/text: I give my dogs very wholesome food. So when I give the occasional treat, I want it to be enjoyed by my dogs. Meaning, I want the experience to be motivating and rewarding. After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.<br /><br />CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.<br /><br />Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them.

review/text: I gave these treats to a friend for their dog.  The dog seemed to enjoy them, he did not choke, and everything seemed to be dandy.  I am not a dog person, do not have a dog, but I know lots of people have them and love them.  This treat worked well for someone's dog, so it would probably be good for yours, too.

review/summary: My dog LOVES them - no wheat, corn, or soy
review/text: First of all, our dog Sheila cannot get enough of these. Seriously, I just got a 10-ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it - very simple.

review/summary: The dogs love them
review/text: We have 2 dogs, a Boston terrier (22 lb) and a basset/shepherd mix (55 lb).  Both have had digestives issues and we feed them a wheat free diet.  They flourish on this diet and don't have any of the problems they used to have.  That being said I wasn't certain how they'd react to these treats.  The dogs love them and we haven't had any GI tract problems.  They've had no bad reactions whatsoever to them.<br /><br />The treats are 2 1" x 1" squares attached together, with a line incised between the squares so they can be broken apart for smaller dogs.  They are fairly thick and substantial enough that it takes a few minutes for our dogs to finish them.  They don't wolf them down in one gulp which is a good thing.  The package has a good number of treats too.  I also appreciate the source of the lamb, New Zealand, and the fact they are organic.<br /><br />I'll be buying these again.  They love lamb, enjoy the treats and I think they are a good value.

review/summary: Tail Wagging Treats!
review/text: My four mixed breed dogs (40lbs-100lbs)gobble up Newman's Own dog treats.  But, these terrific dogs gobble up just about anything (except fresh green leafy vegetables), so perhaps their standards shouldn't be the mark of "goodness".<br /><br />I'm an ingredient list reader for all foods (human & animal), so that is what I did when I received the Newman's pet treats.  The ingredient list is short & consists of the following:<br /><br />Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses<br /><br />The treats themselves are rectangular & scored in the middle.  They are 2" x 1-/4" for the full size & 1" x 1-1/4" for the 1/2 size.  They do not have a strong smell, but a hint of apple is noticeable (& a grain smell, which I presume is the barley).  My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.<br /><br />I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about "nicely".  With the rectangular shape, my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle, I can break them down, so my older, smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat, and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs.

review/summary: No More Guilt
review/text: We spoil our dog. We drive twenty miles to get special food for our Great Dane. But for doggie treats (and doggie teeth cleaners), we've been buying off-the-shelf brands at the grocery store. Yeah, I was beginning to feel guilty, but our baby needs little treats when we leave the house, you know.<br /><br />Now we have Newman's Own. I'm ecstatic. Yeah. About doggie tidbits.<br /><br />The ingredients are organic so I can feel good about supporting the environment. The ingredients are wholesome. If I were not a vegetarian, I'd probably feel OK about eating them myself.<br /><br />Oh, and as I writer, I must mention that I love the marketing. It includes a little story on the back of the package. Let's call it creative nonfiction. No, let's call it fiction. Whatever we call it, it's entertainment, and those of us who read everything, including milk cartons and cereal boxes, will find it entertaining.<br /><br />As smart as my dog is, she doesn't read. But she does snarf up these little biscuits. There is one little, bitsy problem. They come in divideable biscuit shapes and are a little hard to break apart. So, be a sport. Don't be stingy. Forget about breaking them in two. All the better for her teethies, my dear.<br /><br />~The reviewer is an award-winning author and poet.

review/summary: Unattractive but Terrific Treat For Pets
review/text: The Newman's Own Organics Ranch Style Dog Treats are pretty plain - a brown rectangle (the kids call them ugly), compared to the other dog treats we've purchased at the supermarket.  But the real consumer of this product are the dogs and they love them.  We have two large mixed breeds and one is more finicky than the other (think of them as the Oscar and Felix of the dog world) and they both enjoy these treats (though the treats are small for 60+ pound dogs).  The treats are sized for medium sized dogs (you can always give bigger dogs two) and the nice feature that I like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to break the treat in half if you have a smaller dog.  So while, they won't be winning any awards for attractiveness, they are organic without unneeded additives and the dogs appreciate them as a reward for a job well done or just a treat for being the wonderful pets that they are.

review/summary: My little Westie is begging for more!
review/text: Okay, I love many Newman's Own products (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ6IA">Newman'S Own Marinara Pasta Sauce With Mushrooms ( 12x24 OZ)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP1VG">Newman's Own Ranch, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>) so why not try giving some to my favorite furry friend?  The promises on the package look good - made with organic barley, no wheat, no corn - and the analysis on the back tells me that my West Highland White Terrier will receive 9% minimum of crude protein, 4% minimum of crude fat, 4% maximum of crude fiber.  The ingredients are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic applies, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), and organic molasses.<br /><br />So it sounds good, but how will it be received.  I cannot say that my Westie is a particularly fussy eater (I have yet to meet a terrier who is), but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat, so I can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested.  Like any good dog, he can running at the sound of the package rustling, with high hopes that this might be for him.  I pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop (or you can look at your keyboard - as wide as your Shift key and as tall as Enter and Shift together).  While my little guy thinks he's a big dog, I know better, so this had to be broken down.  Fortunately, there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him.  That half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog, but it works nicely for my little guy.<br /><br />I gave him one piece and he took it and waited, hoping I would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away.  After I told him one was all he was going to get, he took his piece out in the yard (he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats).  In just a couple of minutes, he was back and waiting patiently for another.  As soon as I produced the other half, he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently.  Even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as I was getting the information off the bag.  I think my Westie is Newman's Own's newest fan!<br /><br />These are a little pricier than the treats I typically purchase for him, but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much.  Besides, it makes sense to me to care just as much about what I put into his body as I can about what I put into mine.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: These ranch style dog treats are made with all organic barley, and contain no wheat or corn.  They are roughly about 1.25 x 2.25 inches a piece in rectangular shape, almost like a fat fig newton. My 10 oz package had a total of 16 biscuits.  Upon opening the package, it had barely any smell to them.  Almost like a bland cookie smell.  The package doesn't have a recommend serving suggestion, but I would basically give my dog 1 to 2 treats a day.  The cover says the treats are baked in small batches.  They have been certified organic by Oregon Tilth and are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />I gave these treats to my 80 lb Lab mix and he tore it up.  He must enjoy them because he keeps staring at the bag sitting on my desk, even as I type this review.  However, my dog doesn't discriminate between organic treats or Milk Bones, he'll eat whatever and begs for treats all the time when he sees them.<br /><br />Guaranteed Analysis on package says:<br /><br />Crude Protein  9.0% min<br />Crude Fat  4.0% min<br />Crude Fiber  4.0% max<br />Moisture  11% max<br /><br />I would try these again in the future and recommend them.

review/text: Well, I didn't actually eat one, but my faithful Golden Retriever did. The thing with dogs is, they eat pretty indiscriminately. How do I know this dog biscuit is any better than any other dog biscuit? He eats them all! Open the bag and smell. Most dog treats smell horrendous. I was very surprised at the non-offensive odor of these. Yes, the idea of organic all healthy treats appeals to me too. But mainly, they won't stink up my car if I take them with me someplace. They are a nice size for bigger dogs, but have scores on them so you can break them up to smaller sizes. Nice packaging too, with a zipper top. I like that much better than a box that comes open constantly. We give'em five woofs!

review/text: My big yellow lab was initially unenthusiastic about these treats, I think primarily because they seem different consistency-wise than the dog snacks she's used to (bones).  These are sort of like a hard cookie, and they don't smell bad the way that some dog treats do.  After initially leaving the treat alone she came back to finish it and now she'd eat them all day if I let her.  I have a big dog, but it seems like it would be difficult for a smaller dog to eat because it doesn't break up that easily (although there is an indentation in the middle that makes it easier to break it in half if you want to).

review/summary: Very hard, nice breath refresher for big dogs
review/text: Ok.... so all the fancy name effort means nothing in the long run. I mean goodness...TEN words in the name alone... for dog biscuits! LOLOLOL However, the nutshell is pretty straightforward. The dogs like them and they have healthy ingredients in them and that is all that really matters to me! The ONLY negative I noticed is that these cookies were really hard - not just crunchy, but HARD and several of my older dogs had some difficulty breaking them down and chewing them. Even so, all the dogs in this house have enjoyed them and the biscuits did improve the Walker Treeing Coon Hound's notoriously disgusting breath issues. I would probably buy these again for the younger dogs and find something less brick like in texture for the elder statesmen in my pack.

review/summary: Schnauzer Recommended!
review/text: Tried these on our two Schnauzers----they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.  So, on their input I must give this product a five star rating.

review/summary: Dogs love 'em
review/text: I generally buy the Blue Dog bakery dog treats, but I thought I'd try these out. Overall, I like them, and so do my canine family members.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The dogs really like them.<br />- They are thick and crunchy - the dogs chewed on them for a while, unlike most treats where they were consumed more quickly. I think this is better for their teeth.<br />- Resealable pouch is a nice touch.<br />- Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to break apart.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The package was a bit difficult to open - it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended.

review/text: My pets came running when they heard the call of "treats!". Of course when a new treat is offered the devour it, the real test is...will they eat all the treats in the bag over the next few days or will they turn their nose up at the treat the second or third time it is given.<br />They LOVED the whole bag! Even the cats had to get in and get some(of course theirs had to be crumbled for them, as the biscuits are medium to big dog size)and the loved the treats too.<br />I did not feel guilty about giving any of the animals the treats as they are 100% organic and even better I could pronounce what every ingredient was (as well as know what it was (carrots, lamb, molasses etc)!

review/summary: My finicky dog who won't eat anything hard LOVES them
review/text: I have a small dog who is finicky and most treats/dog food gives her diarrhea.  She loves pupperoni and will carry around a beggin strip for hours and rarely eat one.  With milk bones, she whines and tries to bury them in the sofa cushions and finally after a day or two, maybe, eat them.  All this is said so you can see just how finicky she is.  She really does not like anything hard.  These treats are thick and rectangular with a score down the middle so you can break them in to two squares.  I broke one and my dog carefully took it from my hand and then looked at me as if to say "now what".  She set it down, looked at me again and then picked it up again.  She didn't try to bury it like she does with milk bones but tried to eat it.  Several minutes went by as she gnawed away, making no progress.  I took it away from her and the outside was a little softer but the biscuit was still too hard.  She really wanted it back so I let her work on it a little longer.  She still hadn't managed to get any off of it so I took it away and soaked it in warm water for a couple of minutes.  This softened it just enough that she munched it down.<br /><br />The next time I offered her one of these treats, she held it in her mouth for a few minutes and the next thing I hear is crunching!!  She loves them.  She's missing a lot of teeth and is still able to crunch these down.  These treats are never hauled around the house and I have not found one in the sofa or her bed.<br /><br />I really like the ingredient list: lamb, apple (her favorite), carrots - natural stuff that I recognized and NO corn.  I'm sure a bigger dog would munch these right down without any problem.  It's nice to find a hard treat that my dog will actually try to eat and not bury.

review/summary: My dogs love them, which doesn't mean much; I like that they're organic.
review/text: I have a greyhound (very weak-jawed) and a lab mix. Both of them seem to love these treats and are very enthusiastic about them.  The treats are quite hard, which is a little difficult for the greyhound to manage so he makes a big mess of it.  But the lab cleans up after him.<br /><br />Of course, my dogs also enjoy garbage and cat litter goodies, so I can't say that they have discriminating tastes.  However, I also appreciate that Newman's stuff is organic and wheat-free.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Good treats for any dog who can handle a crunchy biscuit, and for any owner who cares about buying organic.

review/summary: My dog liked it!  But just too big for my small dog
review/text: These definitely work as treats, since my dog is very excited to get one.<br /><br />However, even though they are scored to break easily, they only break once, and half of one of these is still too big for a small treat for my 18-lb dog.  Half is about twice the size (or more) of several other brands of treats I have around, so I think these may be extra-big.  Might be great for big dogs who can barely taste regular sized treats!<br /><br />My other complaint is that the name of the product should be "Barley and Lamb" dog treats, since the first two ingredients are in that order.  Otherwise, though, the ingredients are pronounceable and look very healthy and I feel good about this dog treat....as long as I want to give her a BIG treat!

review/summary: Good quality and organic - what's not to like?
review/text: Some people want to criticize organic products due to their often higher-than-average cost. I'm not sure I agree with that thinking. Organic ingredients ARE more expensive, and their added cost ensures that you (and your pets) are eating food that meets strict production standards.<br /><br />Is it worth it? Well, consider the source of the ingredients in most pet food. I shudder to think about the junk that makes its way into "food" that you feed to your beloved animals. That's why I'm more than willing to seek out--and pay more--for quality in the form of products like Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. What you get for your money is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your dog will be eating human-grade ingredients, including certified-organic barley flour, ground chicken, carrots, apples, rolled oats, etc.<br /><br />My beagle loves these treats, and I love giving her food that keeps her healthy.

And both Miko and Sparky refused to leave after getting these treats - when I said "that's it", and showed them my empty hands, they usually will both leave the kitchen. But no, they both just sat there, wagging their tails, demanding more! After reading the ingredient list, I was tempted to try one myself!

review/summary: Treat size is a little on the large size
review/text: It is hard to review a product that was meant for a dog but I will give it a try.  The first thing upon opening up the resealable package is that the treats are a little on the large size and seem to be meant to break in half as there is a line down the middle that allows you to snap in two.  These should not be considered training treats because they are much too big to feed to your dog several times a day.  I did smell them before giving them to the dogs and the smell seemed fresh and reminded me of a regular cookie which is what they resemble.<br /><br />Now for taste I left that to the dogs.  I have two dogs a Schipperkie and a Mini Aussie that are given treats twice a day plus training treats.  They only eat the finest products which are fresh from the dog bakery or a gourment dog treat store so it is safe to say the dogs are somewhat pickey.  When I first gave the treats they both took them from me and ran off to enjoy. Now it is important to note that when they get a really special treat they each go to there favorite place to enjoy and keep the other dog from stealing the treat.  In this case the dogs ate their treats next to each other so I am going to assume they did not feel that the treat was all that special.  Next I put the Newman Treat in the bowl with a cookie that smells like a pizza from the dog bakery.  One dog took the Newman cookie first and the other dog took the pizza cookie first which was smaller than the Newman treat.  The dogs digested the food properly after checking as the poop size was normal after a week of using the Newman product as their daily treats.<br /><br />All in all I wish the product was sold in a smaller size but the quality of the treat seemed to be good and the dogs liked the treats but I dont feel they loved them (as I mentioned before they did not go to their special place to eat the treats in piece and quite as they will do on their favorite treats).

review/summary: Healthy and apparently tasty
review/text: My first reaction to these when I opened the pack was "Wow, they smell good enough to eat!"  I'm not sure that matters, since some of my dogs' favorite treats smell like something I don't even want to touch (check out their most favorite sometime, Icelandic fish skins -- ick! I have to face the bag away from me when I open it.)  Nevertheless, it moved the Newman's Own treats up a notch in my own preferences.<br /><br />Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to confess that I have Cardigan Welsh Corgis, a breed infamous for its hearty and undiscriminating appetite.  Having said that, they loved these treats.  They found it hard to sit still to get one (standard house rules) because they had to wiggle and wag and be all-over excited about them.<br /><br />Each bag contains only 10 ounces of treats, which does make them expensive, but good ingredients never come cheap (if price is your only deciding factor, brace yourself before you go look at those fish skins).  Given the healthy ingredients and my dogs' reaction to them, I would certainly buy them again.

review/summary: Arf!
review/text: I have to admit, I'm no stranger to dog treats.  I've had about forty years worth of dogs, and they've all gotten one sort of biscuit or another, and I've tasted the varieties.  With only two exceptions I've not been able to discern any of the advertised flavors.  Neither peanut butter, nor liver, nor any of the assorted others.  The best biscuit I've tasted was given out at a neighborhood coffee spot.  The waitress brought it out to the table I was sharing with my good dog Sam, and asked me if I'd like to give it to him.  It looked an awful lot like the scone I had on my own plate, so I said yes, and waited for her to leave.  Once she was out of sight I tasted it, and if it wasn't the same as my scone it was darn close.  Since I had my own, Sam got his, but I have considered going back for coffee and a doggy treat sans doggie.  The other biscuit whose flavoring I could taste was baked by my wife and it was something like an over-baked crust of bread.  My good dog Shalako ate 'em up - I passed on future offerings.<br /><br />On to Newman's Own.  I'm a sucker for anything Newman's Own - not that I like everything the company puts out, but I appreciate the altruism - so I jumped at the chance to review Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley etc's.  Upon opening the package I was hit with an aroma.  Nothing that got my mouth watering, but very few dog biscuits have an aroma, so that was a good sign.  The biscuits were a good color - standard brown, but they didn't look dyed.  Another good sign.  What also surprised me was how solid they were.  Not at all crumbly, and it took a bit of effort to break it in half, even though each biscuit is scored for breaking.<br /><br />I put the first biscuit behind my back and changed hands a few times, spreading the aroma.  When I held my closed fists out for Sam to choose the one with the biscuit he sniffed both but fixated on the correct one right away.  It was that good aroma.  When I gave it to him I think he was as surprised as I with its hearty texture.  I could see it was a good tooth cleaner, and as Sam never gets animal bones, a good thing to have.  The next test was for him to choose from hands that each held a biscuit, one with Newman's, the other with another brand.  The strong aroma didn't work to Newman's advantage this time, and Sam went for the hand with his old familiar treat.  But as soon as he downed it he was sniffing around for the Newman's Own that I still held out in front of me.<br /><br />I don't know if these tests prove anything.  I skipped the human taste test as the biscuits are so durable I was afraid I'd crack an implant.<br /><br />I'd buy Newman's if I saw them, but not for myself.  I'd get them for Sam.  He's a dog who deserves a good treat.

She chooses them over her usual Milk Bones and store brand dog cookies every time. As an older dog (twelve years), she sometimes needs an appetite stimulator, and these cookies do the trick. Amazingly, the contents of the cookies are all organic; barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. If they weren't so hard, I might be tempted to try one! I think I'd break my teeth, though. Chelsea gives them a big four paws up!

This week I've been mixing in these treats and, based on the experts' reaction, they are quite popular.  They seem to come from a safe source and have good ingredients.  So, get some for your pup.

review/text: Right out of the bag, these are dense, oaty-smelling biscuits that look like hardtack.  My dogs loved the taste, and I felt really good about feeding them something with an ingredient list that talked about organic ingredients.  However, neither of my dogs tolerated these well.  If your dog has a sensitive stomach, this might not be the dog biscuit for you.<br /><br />Just for reference, I have an older full-breed corgi and a younger corgi/chihuaha mix.  My older dog has definitely developed gluten and corn allergies over the years, while the corgi mix just has a sensitive tummy.  That's probably why they couldn't tolerate these--it's not the fault of the ingredients.

I took a packet of these treats and began opening the packet, he ran out from under the bed in anticipation and into the kitchen.<br /><br />My miniature dachshund is fed the very best of homemade organic diet (a take on the Spot-Stew diet). He is not a picky eater but will rarely go crazy for treats that are not home-made.<br /><br />The reason I like Newman's Organics is because finding organic lamb to incorporate in my dog's diet is impossible. Finding organic lamb meat is almost as hard as finding unicorn meat. These treats allow diversity in his food (he usually gets chicken, turkey, or tofu with oatmeal or brown rice and a variety of vegetables).<br /><br />The ingredients listed on these treats are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses.<br /><br />The analysis listed on these breaks down as follows: crude protein - 9.0% min, crude fat - 4.0z% min, crude fiber - 4.0% max, moisture - 11% max.<br /><br />I'd definitely say these are dog and owner approved!

What's great about these is that they are a lot better and healthier than other treats. Like others have said these are pretty hard.

I'm a little nervous to offer them to small dogs or older dogs with more fragile teeth and jaws... they have no "give" at all and don't break apart easily (which is why they need to be scored in half).

The first thing I always do is check out the crude fat content and the ingredients to see how good this will be for my baby.  I have a Toy Fox Terrier and the last thing I want to give her is something that might cause her to get sick.  These cookies are quite big so you will need break them up and they are a bit on the hard side but Max loves them.  Just in case you don't know, one of those little cheaper cookie treats is equivalent to a large Snicker's bar to a toy dog breed.  That's far to much sugar.  They are pretty much all natural so I'm able to give her something I would not otherwise.  Newman's makes wholesome good for aniamls products and that should be your main concern when buying.  They are a bit more expensive but worth every bit when it comes to the health on our baby.  Better than having to worry about vet bills with using cheaper dog products.

review/summary: My Dogs Love 'Em!
review/text: Newman's Lamb and Barley dog treats have been happily, and eagerly, devoured by both dogs in the house: a Siberian husky, and a Jack Russell terrier. The ingredients in the treats are organic and natural, without anything weird or unusual (like colors, stabilizers, preservatives, etc). The treats are odorless and come in a re-sealable ziploc pouch.<br /><br />The treats are rectangular with an indentation down the center to allow (in theory) one to break the treat in half. Even half of the treat, though, seems a bit large for smaller dogs. Additionally, the treats are so hard and dry, that breaking them in two can be difficult. Fortunately, a good number arrived pre-broken, and those are the ones the JRTs been getting. The hardness of the treats makes me think they're probably good for the dog's teeth, and each pup takes a while to eat them. They can leave crumbs, but dogs are usually pretty adept at getting every last morsel, so there's never been any mess left-over.

He even opted for this over another dry biscuit treat that was offeredat one point. The treats are east to break into smaller pieces if you want to give your dog a bit a smaller portion than the whole.  They're also crunchy enough to be good for teeth and gums.  The price was reasonable given the ingredients and overall, this is a good, reasonably priced option for your pet.

review/summary: Nice, Organic Dog Treat
review/text: These are really good treats for dogs.  I have a French Bulldog who will gnaw and crumble up these treats, gobble it down, and beg for more.  They are organic and an interesting thing about my sickly little pooch is she can't eat any organic foods because it gives her diarrhea.  She only gets half of one of the these treats but one day I gave her two and she got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom but it wasn't runny.  That didn't happen when I only gave her half a treat.  Now I know what to give her if she is constipated.

review/summary: Delicious (or so I am told)
review/text: My dog really likes these treats.  They come in a domino-like biscuit that can be broken into two pieces that are roughly 1" square.  I found it interesting that these appear to be hand-cut as the biscuits are not all exactly the same size.  They look like a fig newton but with a scoring in the middle.<br /><br />These are very hard treats.  My dog is 5 months and is just getting her permanent teeth and I was worried that they might be too hard, but she absolutely loves them and had no trouble chewing. She likes most treats, but she seems to be especially fond of these. They will be perfect for pocket treats as they will neither stink up my pocket (the barley makes them smell like a good bread) or crumble like milk bone treats.<br /><br />Although they are called lamb and barley treats, the ingredients include carrots and apples, two of her favorites.<br /><br />I will definitely buy more of these, but due to the price I will also continue to use fresh carrots and apples for at-home treats and use these for training or special treats.

review/summary: My dog likes this treat
review/text: While these are a bit hard for our 17-year old (almost toothless) dog to chew, our much younger (and larger) black lab really enjoys these treats.  Lady could smell them even before I opened the bag, and she was begging for them before I got the bag opened.  Talk about an impatient dog!  These treats are hard, like a biscuit, but with a rectangle shaped (about 1 1/4" x 2"), and they're scored in the middle.  The score in the middle makes it easy to break in half for smaller dogs.  Those are all the reasons my dog likes these treats.<br /><br />The reason I like them?  Organic ingredients make these treats healthy for my dog.  I love that I can give her a healthy treat that she loves.

review/summary: Hardtack Dog Treats
review/text: We have two small dogs with two small mouths, so when I opened up the bag of Newman's Own Organics New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats Lamb and Barley Recipe I was taken aback by the size of these biscuit treats. The one inch square bricks are joined together in pairs - pairs than can be separated by hand at the indentation in the middle. Trying to make furthur manual divisions is fruitless unless one is a pro wrestler or football player. The treats are also too big, I thought, for our two dogs. Now what?<br /><br />Using the serrated edge of a metal ice cream scoop I was able to break the biscuits into manageable pieces. After some intial sniffing and backing away Gabby and Piper took their first tastes and seemed to like the new treat. On subsequent days they've taken to them more and more eagerly. Just to see what would happen, I gave a whole biscuit to Gabby the Bolognese. She coccooned in her doggy bed and ate the whole treat leaving a few crumbs behind but not as many as expected. The next couple days I gave her whole biscuits again. These biscuits were carried about the house all day and hidden in secret places like on the middle of our bed, on the sofa, and on  the stairs leading to the upper level. She hasn't tried to bite into a whole biscuit after the first and only time.<br /><br />Piper the shih tzu just can't handle these biscuits because of their size and hardness. As long as she seems to enjoy eating them, I don't mind using the ice cream scoop to break the Newman treats for her.<br /><br />I like the recipe ingredients used to make the lamb and barley treats and the absence of fillers and artificial chemicals used in many supermarket treats. The organic aura is also a plus.<br /><br />Based on our experience I think these wholesome treats are best for larger dogs who have the teeth and jaw power to tackle and enjoy such hard biscuits. The Neman's Own line of dog products is excellent, but for our pooches something smaller would serve our needs better.

review/summary: My dog was not thrilled
review/text: First I want to say my dog is a carnivore, he primarily eats raw meat. I do allow him many treats other than carrots but he will jump at the chance to eat anything I toss at my chickens.  For that reason I wanted to try Newman's own because it is organic and has all the good things a dog should have, and I felt he should be able to have something good for him other than meat.<br /><br />When Amazon offered this to me to review for all of you. I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2-1/4" long and about 2" wide and about 1/2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to brak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.<br /><br />I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.<br /><br />I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is. I then sat down at my laptop and he jumped up to be with me, he stared at the treat and I moved it toward him and nothing, I gave the OK command and he looked at it,  I had to pick it up and give it too him. Now it is a few minutes later, he is sitting here, the treat is on my leg and he is looking at it, oops just jumped off.<br />My dog, who will eat just about everything, just walked away from this treat.  He is not interested, I will not be buying this.  I will bring it to the shelter for another dog.

review/summary: A hit with our little guy!
review/text: I spend plenty of time looking for healthy organic snacks for my wife & myself, so why not do the same for the family dog? Mom's toy poodle Beau took to these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats straightaway. Most of his treats are quite soft, so he got a kick out of crunch from these hard biscuits. Further, all his treats to date have been beef flavored, so the organic lamb & barley taste is a very nice change of pace. The ingredients are all natural, with no fillers or junk to be found, which made us all very pleased. Our Beau is a little guy, so we did find we needed to break the biscuits up so he could really enjoy them & you may want to do the same if you have a smaller breed dog. Otherwise, these Newman's Own dog treats are very highly recommended! Leave it to "Pa" and Nell Newman to go all the way to New Zealand to find a great snack for dogs!!

review/summary: Two paws way up!
review/text: Many dog biscuits seem to be plagued by a crumbly texture or the odors of old cardboard - or, at best, old, rancid cardboard. Not so with the Newman's Own Organic treats. Made of high-quality organic products, including lamb, barley, and apples, they're nice and solid without being rock hard, they smell like something good and wholesome, and both of my dogs absolutely love them. I like that they come in a resealable (and recyclable) plastic pouch, too. No more worries about accidentally bringing home beetle-infested biscuits as I've done on more than one occasion.<br /><br />I've enjoyed several of Newman's Own's product for people and would wholeheartedly recommend their dog treats to owners who care about their pets' health and happiness. Two enthusiastic paws up.

review/summary: Organic, baked and good sized treats !!!!!!  Yeah, baby !!!
review/text: I am thrilled that my dogs got to sample these new, organic dog treats. I've been a fan of Newman's Own treats for a while and my dogs love them. I have been looking for a *Large* size treat since the last company I bought treats from discontinued making theirs. These treats are a good size rectangle which are scored so you can break them in half if you wish. I won't be breaking them in half because I want my dogs to have a good sized treat between meals which will keep their belly full. They're *good and crunchy* which is wonderful for keeping tarter in check, and they smell like the earth.<br /><br />They are made from organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil and organic molasses. Excellent !! There is also a cute story on the back of the bag about Paul Newman's dog which is very creative and amusing. I'm so happy to have found these snacks !! I also love the option for *Subscribe & Save* on Amazon.com with free shipping with 6 bags shipped all at once. A great deal and a great product !! I can't wait until they become available.

review/text: Of course most dogs do love a treat, but I have found some they actually wouldn't eat.<br />Not the case here.  These are light and come where you can break them in half for small or larger dogs.<br /><br />Although more pricey then say Milkbones, you know exactly what's in these treats.  No added preservatives, etc.<br /><br />I've tried several of Newman's products and have found them to be excellent in quality.... plus the company donates a large portion of their profits to charity.<br /><br />Buying this product for your dog not only makes the dog happy, but you can rest assured you're purchasing from a quality company.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: My dog loves this and its good for him too
review/text: He loved this cookie as a treat.  Not sure if this is available in a smaller size of cookie, but the bars seem larger than the heart shaped chicken cookie treats I have been buying.  The lamb one does not upset my older English Cocker Spaniel who has a sensitive tummy, and isn't any more fattening either than the other cookie, but I do break each bar into two or three pieces to feed it to him.  He can actually deal with the size just fine, tho this particular style is more appropriate for a large dog vs a middling size dog like him, but he counts the number of treats we give him and isn't happy until he gets three pieces :-)  I feed him one bar broken into three pieces, while I feed him two to three of the little heart shape cookies(depends on how much food he's cadged from my toddlers that day) I totally trust the Newman's brand of dog food and have been happy with my baby's silky and healthy coat and no tummy upsets on the Newmans food or cookies.

review/summary: My Giant Dog Loves Them
review/text: I can't give a truly detailed review since my dog refuses to talk, but by his actions I can tell he really likes these treats. Of course for full disclosure I must state that he tends to like any food, or even non foods (such as paper towels, backpacks ... you get the idea). But he really wolfs these down and begs for more. I plan to buy more of these, when they go on sale.<br /><br />My only problem is that they are a bit expensive. Perhaps not more so than other "natural" snacks, but more than I am used to paying for treats. Had they been a little less expensive, I would have rated them five stars.

review/summary: Great, All-Natural Treats - Good Snack Size
review/text: I love all of Newman's Own products, and I like that their dog treats are all-natural and that it's a trustworthy brand. My dogs really like these treats and they are a good-sized for a snack for medium/small dogs (I have pugs). The biscuits are hard and they come in "sets" of two, but are easy to break apart. The broken-apart squares are about one square inch.<br /><br />They are definitely hard snacks, and they are easy to break into one square, but I could see that it would be difficult to break them up further. They are perfect for my dogs, but I would say that they may be difficult for tiny dogs to chew because of their size and crunchiness.

review/summary: picky dogs like picky treats
review/text: Little things to know - these biscuits are rock hard - if your dog has fragile teeth avoid them, if your dog devours everything in sight you might find they work.  They are about 1" square and 1/4" thick with a 2 biscuits stuck together - they even put a score line in the 2"x1" pair so you can break them with your hand.<br /><br />They don't have a strong odor - in trainging my dog right now we've had several tests where we put down yummy treats and teach the dogs to walk in an oval avoiding the treats.  This particular one was ignored by all dogs - it doesn't smell good which seems to be the key to a treat working well - hot dogs were preferred 10/0 over these biscuits by the dogs in the class.<br /><br />I am presently training a purebread (3 generation 1/2 german 1/2 american) german shepherd dog and treats are an essential part of the process when your dog is food motivated.  The Lamb and Barley flavors don't really attract the attention of the dog when working with it and build attention span.  This dog is spoiled rotten getting a kong stuffed with peanut butter frozen overnight and fed GSD dog feed designed for the nutritional needs of a GSD.<br /><br />Training involves repeating the command and holding the treat in front of the dog's nose to get them to learn the commands - these worked the first time then not so well- I had to find something that smelt better as the dog would igore the treat.  Presently my dog is 6 months old and in a weekly training class with other dogs - we use chicken pieces, turkey pieces, and hot dog slugs to entise the dog into behaving well.  These were nowhere as motivating as the hot dog pieces which seemed to get the most attention.<br /><br />I am pleased that they are organic in nature but they lack a strong odor for the pet.  The pouch they come in is helpful to keep on your belt when training as well.  I don't see a real value in the product for dog training - they are almost too big for even big dogs, so hard to break they are pre-scored to 1x1, and just don't get the interest of the dogs - we tried a malamute, a husky, and my dog and they were only effective if the dog was really hungry!  Also the price is kinda high - I found a 10 pack of hotdogs next door for $2.50 which included a zipper pouch too.

review/summary: Wife says they taste great!  My dogs love it too!
review/text: Much of the junk sold as dog food is made of filler and animal by-products and mysterious stuff with long scientific names.  How refreshing to have a simple organic dog biscuit made from good organic stuff that you can actually pronounce.  My dogs love these biscuits and eagerly offered a "sit" before I had a chance to fully open the package.  Lamb and rice, yum!<br /><br />My wife was curious and tasted a bit.  She said it tasted good like Zwieback crackers. (I took her word for it but didn't try it myself).  My two dogs eagerly chomped them up.  The only negative to these tasty treats in my opinion is their size.  I'd prefer a treat about the size of a pencil eraserhead for my small dogs as I like to give treats frequently for training.  The large size are a mega size treat.  I won't give them anything less than five stars. These biscuits are yummy!

review/summary: Dog tested, Mom approved (mostly)
review/text: Boy did I ever test this out.<br /><br />Each morning after the kids get on the bus, the dogs get a quick walk around the neighborhood park.  They love this, and they especially love the dog moms who bring treats.<br /><br />My dog is a little weird.  She doesn't really like treats -- or rather, she doesn't like a lot of treats.<br /><br />So I thought between my dog and the 5 or 6 others that join the walk, I could give a good review of this product.<br /><br />The consensus:  Every dog liked them!  So that's the main thing that you're looking for when you spend your money on dog treats.  If natural ingredients are important to you, then you can depend on Newman's Own.<br /><br />The one thing that makes me hesitate in giving them 5 stars is that they are big and crumbly.  Crunchy dog treats are good for their teeth I think, but these are 2 x 1 inches big, with a scored line to break them into 2 1 x 1 inch treats.  I found that the scored area was easy to separate, but even so, they are kind of big.<br /><br />So when my dog (a 40 lb mixed breed) ate them, they made a big mess!<br /><br />The other dogs on the walk are the same size or bigger, except for one tiny Shih Tzu.  She wasn't intimidate and tackled the treat with gusto as well.<br /><br />There are about 10 to 15 bars per bag (scored in two, so 20 to 30 treats).  I didn't think to count them when they first arrived, but that's my best guess.

review/summary: My dogs loved them
review/text: There's such a range with dog treats - you can find those fake bacon treats that are filled with chemicals and then you can find these treats that contain only organic ingredients - no strange chemicals that you can't pronounce. If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.<br /><br />These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can break them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to break them in half). These treats are very hard - so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test - since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon/cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon/cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.<br /><br />For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat.

review/summary: My Dogs loved these
review/text: My wife and I usually try to give our two dogs the best food and the best treats which is why we generally feed them Wellness products or really anything from the Old Mother Hubbard family of products.  We have always given them the Wellness dog biscuits and they have been wonderful.  However the only pain of the Wellness biscuits is that we usually have to go to the pet store specifically to get them as they are not available in our regular grocery store.  I know, petty reason for not getting the biscuits, but when the pet store is an additional ten miles away from your grocer you begin to wish that the local shop had better options.<br /><br />Luckily they have the Newman's Own Organics at our grocer.<br /><br />Our dogs loved these biscuits.  Not only did my wife and I have the peace of mind giving our girls these treats due to the wonderful ingredient list but it turns out that the dogs adore these treats. They are also pretty good sized chucks that takes a while for dogs to crunch through which is good for their teeth.<br /><br />I received this pack through the vine program but this is certainly something that I will be buying plenty of in the future.

He first sniffed the Newman's Own, then ate the "jerky", then came back for the Newman's Own.<br /><br />The Newman's Own treats are dry hard biscuits, but my beagle had no problem eating them.  They do create a lot of crumbs, so be ready if your dog wouldn't eat the crumbs also.<br /><br />Though second place, Newman's Own is probably a healthier treat.  Either way, they were enjoyed.

review/text: My dog Penny is a ten lb. Jack Russell/mini dachshund mix, and is a little over a year old.  She eats a limited amount of treats, but they are usually "healthy" treats I purchase from Whole Foods (Zuke's).  These treats are crunchy and scored to break in half, which is great since I have a small dog.  She ran off to "bury" the first two (one she retrieved from in her blanket, the other, still "buried" in my bed clothes probably!).  Once she started eating the first one, she got very excited when I gave her another.  These seem to be pretty tasty for her, and they are made from real ingredients (barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil and molasses), which also happen to be organic.  I can recommend these for any dog.

review/summary: I have never seen her dance for treats
review/text: I was skeptical, little Ms. Pepper can be finicky.  We were at a pet store recently and the pet store told us that every dog loves their treats, and our dog turned up her nose and walked away.  She had no interest.  She loves treats, she just doesn't want dog treats.<br /><br />So we tried Newman's own treats - and I like Newman's own values and mission - and she mowed down like nobodies business.<br /><br />Today, I opened the bag, and I kid you not our schnauzer started shaking, wagging her whole butt.  (and she's not an excitable animal)  She stood on her hind legs and pranced about.  I was completely amused.  I told her to sit.  (she's also very stubborn)  She sat, her little paws shaking, she wanted that treat so bad.  I said take it like a lady.  And ever so gently she took the biscuit.  And then she ate like a hog.<br /><br />The biscuits are bigger than the treats we normally give her.  They smell fresh.  There doesn't appear to be any artificial color in it, at least it doesn't stain her beard.  I really feel good about giving Pepper these treats, and she seems pleased as punch to get them.  I've honestly never seen her that excited about a treat.  We'll have to get them once and awhile, she actually listens when these are waiting in the wings.<br /><br />*UPDATE* We just bought more of these for Ms. Pepper and I'm not kidding you, when she saw the bag she did a little dance about sat at my feet and just waited.  Once she got her treat she took off running with it just in case I'd changed m mind, and she devoured it like a little pig!

There are a number of other lower-quality brand treats in our "treat cabinet", but both of my dogs start trying to get to the Newman's Own bag whenever I open the cabinet door.  I can definitely tell they like them the most.  And shhhh, don't tell them... but it is probably the healthiest choice for them from all the treats in that cabinet.<br /><br />The treats sort of smell nice... dare I say "fresh".  I am almost tempted to break off a small piece and try it myself (ALMOST, but not quite).<br /><br />I think I will stop buying the cheaper, unhealthier brand treats from now on and go with the Newman's Own Organics line.  It will be a nice compliment to their quality dog food, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul</a>.

review/summary: Elvis likes it better than peanut butter & banana sandwiches!
review/text: Our retriever, Elvis, tried to open the package himself.  After a little assistance from opposable thumbs, he stuck his snout into the bag and retrieved one.  It didn't last long.<br /><br />This is indeed an all-organic product, according to the label, and this company has enough integrity that it's not in doubt.  Barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses, all listed as certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  Low fat (4%), crunchy, about the size and shape of a Fig Newton.<br /><br />I used to joke about organic foods.  Having read up on the subject, I find that it's verifiably (not just anecdotally) healthier for humans to avoid preservatives and other artificial additives.  Natural foods are more easily and fully digested, and don't tax the system as much as the cheaper products with long lists of additives.  It stands to reason your dog's system is the same.<br /><br />Elvis will have a hunk o' hunk o' organic Newman treats, please.  While he WILL eat anything but okra (no joke), he's not always this enthusiastic about it.  Mr. Newman, keep up the good work.

review/summary: The thought of reviewing a doggie treat...
review/text: I have to LOL a bit at the "How do you rate this item?" question for this review.  How would "I" rate the item?  Do "I" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that.

review/summary: Organic treats my dog eats!
review/text: What's not to like about these?  All organic ingredients that i actually understand on the label compared to the usual junk I buy my beagle.  While she is not picky about what she eats, she usually behaves much more enthusiastic about a pupperoni treat vs a milk bone.  With these ranch style treats, she seems to act as if they are the pupperoni style treats so I assume they taste good to her! I also like the fact that these treats are hard like regular dog bones as that is needed for dogs to maintain healthy teeth (among other things).  Considering what we spend on food and treats for our beloved beagle, I will gladly add these to the monthly list.

review/summary: Fantastic and flavorful organic treat!
review/text: These truly are a superior dog treat. I have two small dogs and they are spoiled and picky when it comes to treats. They love these. Newman's Own brand is so much better than the bland dog treats that my poor dogs have always been subjected to in the past. These are high quality, and that is obvious when I see the way my dogs respond to these treats. They smell good, look good, and break easily if you just want to give them a half. As my dogs usually take a treat and lick it a few times and drop it in a corner, these were actually eaten with enthusiasm.

review/summary: The Good Bark
review/text: OK, so I sit in the Dawg Pound for NFL games and firmly believe that the Uga dynasty is the best mascot tradition in major college athletics, but my fandom ends at barking at officials and not demonstrating special mettle by munching on snacks designed for "man's best friend."<br /><br />Earlier today, I put the treats to a taste test with a pair of dogs that run every morning with their owner....and they ate the biscuits with aplomb. The back of the package has a complete nutritional analysis, but the "Newman's Own" name means top quality in every product.<br /><br />Nell Newman continues to do an oustanding job in continuing and expanding the company's vision. And that the good news can be shared with pets simply makes it even more enjoyable.

review/summary: Yummy dog treat
review/text: I opened the packages, and pulled out one of the biscuits.  They are shaped as two pieces that can easily be broken in half.  Each 1/2 piece is a bit large for training, I would prefer smaller bits, but the 1/2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog (45 lb).  The biscuits are a rather drab brown, a simple rectangular shape, very utilitarian, favoring function over form.<br /><br />Now the real test.  I gave one to my dog.  She was hesitant at first, but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto.  Her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit.  Once she finished the first treat, she got into the sit position, and stared intently at me and the bag, eager to earn another.  I gave her a second, and it was gone in moments.  I then placed her regular treat (a Milkbone) 2 feet apart from one of these treat, made the dog wait for 15 seconds.  When I let her go, she went first for the Newman treat.  Once gone, she went just a quickly to the Milkbone.  Hardly a scientific test, but interesting all the same.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the item says it's a 6-pack of treats, but I received only a single bag of treats.  For the price, this is in no way worth it for a single bag.  For 6 bags, however, this would be competitive with "name brand" snacks, and the ingredients list would cause me to choose this first.

review/text: I am pretty particular about what I give my dog for treats. She has always had a funny tummy. If she gets something not right with her she vomits and gets some digestive issues going. My sister has long been a fan of these treats so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />After giving my dog one treat a day for a couple of days they seemed to agree with her stomach and she moved up to a couple a day. She responded well to them so they get the thumbs up there. She is also fairly motivated do things for them as well.<br /><br />They don't have any odd odor and there isn't any residue left in my pocket from carrying them around for awhile when she is out and about with me.<br /><br />Overall, they are a high quality treat with a decent treat value (in dog terms). I'm not sure how often I will purchase them, but from what I have experienced with them right now I would certainly consider it.

review/summary: Worth a Try
review/text: Having lost our German Shepard that we raised from a pup at age 12 to heart disease a couple of years ago we are always interested in products to help our new dog live a longer and healthy life.  When I saw this I was impressed with the healthy ingredients in this snack.  When it arrived I began to open the package and Bella, our black lab, was sitting ready and waiting for what morsel was coming her way.  She eagerly accepted the treat and carried over to her favorite spot to chow down.  We watched in anticipation as she inspected the treat.  Finally she decided it was worthy of her pallet and ate it in a few quick bites.  We were enthusiastic at her acceptance of the treat as she can be very finicky.  However, a few days later, after receiving a daily helping, we notice she was leaving the snacks unfinished.  Perhaps she quickly grew tired of them or maybe she just decided to be finicky, but whatever the reason I now have my doubts that this will become one of her favorite snacks.  But, iF you want your dog to live a long and health life it is certainly worth the price to see if your pet will like them.

review/summary: kinda dry, but dog doesn't seem to mind
review/text: These treats are natural, which is good if you're looking for that sort of thing. I was a bit skeptical because our hound mutt wasn't a big fan of the Natural Balance dog food (we've since switched her to Blue Buffalo which she loves - I think she mostly wasn't a fan of the fish flavor). So I was skeptical of a natural doggie treat.<br /><br />These a pretty good sized treats. They are scored down the middle, so you could theoretically break it in two for a smaller treat or smaller dog. They are pretty hard and pretty dry though, so it might be tough. If you have a dog with gum or tooth problems, this is definitely not the treat for you.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that the dog likes them. Not as much as a plain ol' fake Milk Bone or some of her other stuff, but she definitely likes them.

review/text: Of course my fat dog loved these treats! It's always good to feed your pooch something that might be good for her, rather than something that might cause allergies or other issues. I'm hoping the "organic" part of these treats are good for sensitive dogs.<br /><br />My dog absolutely scarfed these down. But then, my dog will also pick up a discarded pizza crust in a gutter (try and get THAT out of her mouth.)<br /><br />Verdict: probably good, can't hurt the dog. Might hurt your wallet. These are not Milk Bone-priced.

One is a little pickier than the others, and was slower to take it from my hand but once she had her first one, she didn't hesitate again.  I like these because they are healthier for my dogs, and also because they took longer to chew than an average dog biscuit.  This is a quality product, healthy for my dogs, yet obviously with ingredients that dogs love.  I also like that bit of extra chewing time they take.  I'm glad we got to try them - I will definitely be buying these again.

review/summary: My Dog Approved!
review/text: Newman's Own Organics - New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, Lamb and Barley Recipe, are a hit with my dog. I own a Shar Pei/Beagle mix with an extremely finicky appetite. She is very hard to buy treats for, as she turns her nose up to most dry, larger treats. I had my misgivings about this product, as the treats are larger than I expected, two cookie-like squares attached to each other. There is also no powerful or distinct smell of her usual favorite treats, peanut butter or cheese. Yet, every time I give one to her it disappears in seconds! I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />I'm also grateful for the healthier ingredients: organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), and organic molasses.

review/summary: Odorless, Dividable Treats
review/text: Newman's Own brand "ranch style" dog treats are a fine addition to my pantry. First, my two dogs love the taste of this particular treat; it makes for a great, high-level reward for good behavior, following commands, etc.<br /><br />Second, the treats are easily dividable into one- or two-bite snacks. A distinct cleavage runs down the middle of each treat, which means you can decide whether to reward your dog with the "full" treat or half of it. This is especially good for me, since my dogs are of different sizes/weights and can expect different treats for their rewards.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps best of all, the treats are completely odorless. I didn't put my nose up against each snack, but I couldn't detect any odor whatsoever from them, or the bag they came in. This makes the treat a win-win for me and my dogs.

review/summary: They love 'em!
review/text: I've got an out of shape Jack Russell and a diabetic chihuahua.  They are definite chow hounds but are a bit spoiled when it comes to treats -- they have developed discriminating palates.<br /><br />I watched closely when introducing them to these Newman's Own Organics Lamb/Barley Ranch Style.  They were a little puzzled at first . . . . The texture of these treats is extremely hard and crunchy and they are in an irregular square shape and have a rather "handcrafted" appearance.  The chemical free nature of these and the  hard texture have obvious health benefits.  The taste test? . . . . .<br /><br />In short, after a couple of introductory feedings, my dogs absolutely love these Newman's treats.  They snatch them and immediately retreat to munch and enjoy in private and with gusto.  And I feel like I'm providing a quality wholesome treat.  I'm very happy with this product.

review/text: I loved the fact that there was really nothing in these treats that I couldnt eat.  I want to keep chemicals and bad things away from my dogs.  However, I did not try one to tell you what they taste like!  I also like that they come in large sizes with a break in the middle so that they can accomodate both large and small dogs.  That being said, however, my dogs had a little trouble with them.  They are square and thick.  I have toy dogs (Papillons) and they found them a little difficult to eat.  It was hard to tell if it was the size and shape or the taste that bothered them.  They did eat them, but they did not devour them.  All in all, it appears to be a great product though.

review/summary: We agree on this much.
review/text: Let's be real. My dog is happy for any attention and will eat just about anything. The worse it smells to me, the better the dog likes it. My dog's absolute favorite treat is a horrible herring-flavored dog biscuit from the specialty pet store--to me it smells like rotten fish but just opening the package will cause the dog to run into the room.<br /><br />My poor pooch suffers from food allergies so I have to be careful what he eats. This dog biscuit is everything I look for: no corn, no chemicals, no mysterious "by-products". To date, my dog has had no reaction to these biscuits. This is a big deal because the wrong food can give him running sores under his long coat and make him itchy and miserable. NEWMAN'S LAMB AND BARLEY biscuit has an attractive (to me) smell that is reminiscent of  molasses, which is one of the ingredients. Each biscuit has a groove down the middle making it easy to break, so one has a choice to feed the whole biscuit (suitable for a big dog) or only half (for a smaller dog).<br /><br />The dog doesn't go wild for these things, but he does like them. Based on his body language when these are offered, they rate at least a seven. I love these things and would rate them as five stars because they are healthy and safe for my special needs pet. The four star rating comes from my dog. We agree on that much!

review/summary: It's a Doggy Treat!
review/text: We have a lot of fun watching out special dog (Bandit) get a treat.  He runs with it, and he often tempts you to grab the treat from right in front of him when he finally stops.  He runs in circles and acts really funny.  To make this time even more special for him, I often try different treats to make sure it truly is a "treat" for him.  I was interested to try these Newman's treats because of the brand recognition.  To determine if he liked them, I fed him one, and we played his little game.  The next day, I laid three different treats out to see which one he would grab.  He didn't grab the new one.  I did that again for a few days.  He consistently grabbed the Newman treat second.  So, based on this in-depth scientific research, I would say he liked the treat as well as we like green beans.  We like green beans, but they're not the same as a piece of cheesecake and not gross like a brussel sprout.

review/summary: Nutritious, but pretty hard and my dog isn't too excited about them
review/text: My title says it all.  I appreciate the fact that these are built with nutrition in mind, but since my dog ONLY eats healthy dog food I'm not entirely concerned about a small, fun snack for him from time to time.<br /><br />At the sound of me saying "treat!" my dog almost looses his mind.  When I first gave him this he took it in his mouth, ran over to his treat-eating spot, and then dropped it and looked at it, not sure what to make of it.  After a while he bit into it (CRUUUUCH!) and ate the entire thing.<br /><br />I offered him another one the next day and he took it with a lot less enthusiasm than he usually does when taking treats.  It was almost as if he was saying, "Well, if that is all I get I'll take it, but next time you say 'treat' it better be something I can get excited about."  He ate it as well, but without the usual glee he puts into his treat-eating.<br /><br />So, he'll eat them but there are a host of other treats -- most of them also built with health in mind -- that he would prefer to eat first.  I'll still give him all of these square little biscuits from time to time but only because I don't want them to go to waste.  I won't be getting another bag.

review/summary: Shocked that my dog chose this over her favorite treat
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:10 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog's favorite treat is vitalife chicken poppers.  I did a video taste test with 3 treats (this one, the chicken popper, and a regular milkbone biscuit) expecting her to take the popper first, but then see how fast she came back for the Newman's Own Dog treat.  To my actual surprise she took the Newman's Own first.  This was the first time I ever offered it to her.  I usually give her a few treats in the morning and she smells them all and grabs her favorite first.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more.  Check out the video.  I asked her to give the treat back to me (she's a good dog) and choose again just to make sure.  She chose the Newman's own again and gobbled it.  She did come back for the chicken popper when she was done with the Newman's Own.  She left the Milk Bone where it was.<br /><br />In addition to her liking it, I liked that the ingredient list was so simple without unrecognizable ingredients ... i.e. it was Barley, Lamb, Carrots.  If I like the ingredient list and she loves the treat, that's all I need to know!<br /><br />Very very happy with this product!!!

review/summary: I say yes but my dogs said NO!
review/text: I love everything I've ever tried from Newman's Own for myself and my favorite K-cup coffee is Newman's Own, so of course I just knew my treat loving dogs would love Newman's Own Dog Treats. Boy was I wrong. I had to go out for a few hours so gave each pooch a treat (the treats are rather large) and left. Normally the treats are swallowed so quickly I often wonder if they even taste them. But not these treats. After being away over 2 hours I came back to find both treats still there, still whole. So while I would give this product a 5 just knowing everything about it is the best - my pups give it a 1, hence the average of 3.<br />Both my pups are Maltese - 5 and 7 pounds and they may just be overly picky, but they are all I have to go by.

review/text: My 35-lb dog could not break these treats by chewing on them. She gave up after only a minute or so and decided to look elsewhere for a treat.<br /><br />I was unable to break the treats in two even though they are scored across the middle.<br /><br />My toy breed dog thought it was fun to play with, but he couldn't get much headway trying to chew it either, and never ate it.<br /><br />They need come out with something soft!

review/summary: Reality check: dry, dusty, and uninteresting---and expensive
review/text: My dogs are decidedly not "new age" or impressed by the fact that these dog treats "are high in protein, naturally preserved with no wheat or corn, no artificial colors of [sic] flavor enhancers, and are free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemical additives."<br /><br />Out of the bag, these treats seem decidedly overmanufactured, dry, dusty, and uninteresting. But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.<br /><br />This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.<br /><br />Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.<br /><br />Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications.<br /><br />I really think a reality check is needed. (And I can already feel the sharp sting of venom as folks take me to task for holding a contrarian opinion here.)

review/summary: Dog Loves 'Em but...
review/text: The dog loves Newman's Own Dog treats. I know this because she spins in circles and nearly takes off my fingers when given one. She never does with this other treats-except for steak. The treats are nice little squares that you can break in half if you want. They have a slight greasy feel. The ingredients are high quality. No bad smell.<br /><br />There's only one problem. The dog passes gas a few hours after a treat. It does not smell good. Your dog may not have this problem, but ours did. That is the only negative I have. Otherwise, recommended.<br /><br />Update: The dogs gas problem went away with continued use of this product.

review/summary: My dog enjoys these, but they can be a bit crumbly
review/text: I was excited to be able to give these to my dog because he has tried and liked other Newman's Own Organics dog treats, like the cheese treats, so I figured he would enjoy these as well.  My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)<br /><br />My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.<br /><br />So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky-style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.<br /><br />Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20-lb sized dog.  They can easily be broken in half, but breaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large-sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.<br /><br />Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere.

review/summary: My doggie is not a huge fan
review/text: My mountain feist (a breed that is similar to a Jack Russell), an admittedly finicky eater, is no big fan of them. He will only eat the treats if they are mixed with canned dog food.  While it is good that the treats will be eaten and will not be wasted, mixing it with food seems to defeat the purpose of a treat.<br /><br />They are made of great ingredients and not made in China, which is a great thing if you are concerned about some of the junk that has been put into dog food as filler ingredients. I give it three stars because, despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand, the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering.

review/summary: Our Little Gourmands Rated These Five Paws!
review/text: The bottom line is that I recommend these treats.<br /><br />We've been feeding our dogs organic food and treats for years. Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to break it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.<br /><br />Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic brands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the "Subscribe and Save" program. If / when that happens, the 15% discount will bring these down in price. Until then, I'm knocking off one star for price.<br /><br />If you question whether, in general, it's worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.<br /><br />Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified "organic" usually add yet another premium.<br /><br />Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you've given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name brand foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.<br /><br />Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.<br /><br />We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.<br /><br />Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by-products can vary wildly.  By-products include lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Also, non-organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even brand name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.<br /><br />Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It's been years now since I've had to clean up one of his messes.<br /><br />Olliver's canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don't seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they're really eating.

review/summary: Healthy, organic ingredients...but mixed review on flavor
review/text: These lamb and barley treats have some excellent features. I was impressed the certified organic ingredients, the re-sealable bag, and I like that they are large bones, but are scored so they can be broken in half. Left whole, the treats are good for large dogs, but when broken in half would be good for medium-sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.<br /><br />Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food, so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog, who usually likes anything, would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle-sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes, he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store-bought and homemade dog treats. However, these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley), and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.<br /><br />Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some, since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly, I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household.

review/summary: Almost Perfect...
review/text: I'm one of those fussy dog owners that read labels and annoy others and so I really like the ingredients in this and think this would be a 5 star product for a lot of owners. My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew -- still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size -- remember, couldn't break it -- and the hardness, but she managed.<br /><br />If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak.

review/summary: My dog REALLY likes these
review/text: When I give her one of these treats, my dog snatches it, runs off, greedily wolfs it down, then spends 5 minutes going back over the place where she ate it, trying to hoover up the crumbs.  I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a dog treat.  They are pretty hard and a pretty good size, so the dog seems to have a little trouble getting it broken down (she's a relatively small beagle).  Really small dogs might need these broken up a bit.  I don't think it's a problem that they take a while for the dog to consume, since that means she eats it a bit slower and it's longer before she comes back to me begging for some more.

review/summary: Nutritionally Superior and Digestible, Too!
review/text: Okay, I have to be honest here.  My Black Lab is not exactly a picky eater.  If I refer to something as a "cookie" or a "treat" and call her a "good girl" when I give it her, she is guaranteed to enjoy it.  Therefore, I can't honestly say that she "liked" Newman's Organic Lamb and Barley treats "more" than any other snacks I've given her over the years.<br /><br />However, I can say that I felt better about offering them to her!  First of all, a "Nutritional Facts" comparison showed them to be superior to some of the common store brand biscuits that I've bought in the past.  Secondly, they smelled better (I'm tempted to use the word "fresher") than some of the other brands.  And finally, she digested them well.  I don't feed her table scraps or people food aside from an occasional raw or frozen carrot, and I don't switch her regular food very often, because her system is fairly sensitive to changes in her diet.  She handled the Newman biscuits with no problems at all.<br /><br />I would probably feed her these treats on a regular basis if price were no object; however, these are a premium product and are priced accordingly.  What I will do is purchase them when they are on sale, just as I do a couple of other premium brands.  Definitely recommended!

review/text: I can't speak for myself, but my dog usually hates most "dog biscuit"  style treats.  In contrast to her usual preference, these were a strong favorite.  They don't smell or feel like meat, and have no greasy residue that many meaty treats have.  But the dog loves them like they are chunks of beef.

Yes, they're really hard and solid, unlike Milkbones, but I like that for my dogs.  I never feed them wet food or soft treats, and like them to have hard foods to clean their teeth.
