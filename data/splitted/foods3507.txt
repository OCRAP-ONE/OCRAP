review/text: I have a 50 lb Shepherd mix who is an enthusiastic chewer.  She can usually go through a $3.00 rawhide bone from the grocery store in two days.  On top of that she might find something else in the house equally as fun to chew!  So I decided to order one of these pressed rawhide bones and she has loved it.  Its last more than a week now (its down to about 30% left) and there have been no chewing accidents.  I'll definitely be buying more of these for my happy doggy and my happy wallet.

review/summary: Same as Look's at Big Lots
review/text: Have purchased some Bar Harbor Herring on Amazon, found Look's sardines at Big Lots for $2/can. Fantastic, both in the normal smoked, cracked pepper, and ground mustard versions. If you have any inclination at all toward this type of food, it is probably the best around, buy them here or there or anywhere!! Look's is the parent company of Bar Harbor and maybe others. I'm pretty sure this is the same thing. They are juicy, tender, meaty, delicious, and good for you. IMHO.<br /><br />BTW, after a bit of research, I've found that Sardines and Herring can be the same thing! Seems a moderate number of related fish fit either category. One interesting yet not surprising fact is that some companies cut off just the part with the tail and sell them as sardines. Nothing like the middle part IMHO.<br /><br />See also Woody Allen's 'love and death.'<br /><br />Mike

review/text: My cat is turning 19 and he has become a serious  picky eater the last few years.<br />As a pet owner you can relate this can become expensive.<br />His favorite right now is canned over dry. We have been trying out all kinds of different foods (brands, varieties, etc).<br /><br />This weekend I went to a charity "Pet-Walk" and there was  vendor there handing out "FREE" Samples. Well the nice lady listened to my story and gave me 4 can (different flavors) of B.F.F. Canned cat food. Wa-la! My Senior cat loved it. Each flavor had pumpkin in it so I don't know if that is the key or not. We only gave him a little at first and he gobbled it up. Then he would see you in the hallway meowed as if to say "I WANT MORE OF THAT YUMMY B.F.F. FOOD".<br /><br />This is made in Natick, MA in (as they stated) "Human Food Facility"  and is Grain Free.

review/summary: Love this pan
review/text: I love brownies but hardly ever made them because cutting them into nice 2" squares was near impossible.  No matter how many times I soaked  the knife in ice water after each cut I always had the same result, a lot of the brownie stuck to the knife.  With this pan my brownies always come out looking like those they sell at a bakery.  The only drawbacks are 1.  You do have to grease the entire pan between every square or they will stick to the pan.  I spray Baker's Joy baking spray between all the squares,  And 2. ... Cleanup is also not fun as you have to wipe between every square with your sponge and soap.  I make brownies many times a year to share with my coworkers and I'm proud to bring them in looking so nice and perfectly square. This pan is a definite keeper.

review/summary: Stay away from products like these made in China
review/text: Companies like this go to great lengths to try to disguise the fact that their products are made in China. Some are advertsing "Made under US supervision". In this case they keep emphasizing that their products are "tested in the US". I wrote to them asking where the product was manufactured and they never responded but it appears that the products are actually made in China. "Tested in the US" means close to nothing as they obviously cannot test every single treat. In the last few years the FDA has issued three warnings about chicken tender/jerky treats made in China and their harmful effects on dogs. Thus you are taking a real risk by buying a product like this. Curiously in the case of this product it is not any cheaper than buying a similar one MADE in the US so I can see absolutely no reason to buy these. I fully appreciate that dogs like these types of treats. I know of no dog that does not. However I also know of no dog that reads FDA reviews, notices or warnings and thus the responsibility for buying the proper safe treats is on you - not the dog.<br /><br />Follow-up: Company has now replied and these treats are made in China.

review/text: I still can't believe I'm paying this much for salt, but it is definitely worth it.  Every time I bypass the salt section of my grocery store, I see the salt for 98 cents -- Oh well, I'm worth it to have the best salt on earth.  If you've never had Himalayan Pink Salt, you have missed a lot.  It has a great salt taste that leaves out the "bite" of regular salt.  Also, I have an ayurveda practitioner friend who told me to use this salt always because it doesn't have any of the bad effects of regular salt.  It apparently doesn't effect blood pressure as bad as regular salt, and there are many health benefits from all the minerals in it.  Health benefits aside, this salt just tastes amazing.  You have to try it to know what I'm talking about, because words lack the means to describe the smooth, silky, full salt taste with a gentle robustness that surprises the palate in ways that only Himalayan Pink Salt can.  Buy it once, and you'll be hooked on the goodness...

Then as you scroll down it states under ingredients that it is, " rock salt medium crystalls". Finally at the very end, under directions, it says, " The large crystalls make this pink rock salt excellent for cooking and roasting ". I was given three different sizes in the discription of this salt. I wanted to buy a small grain salt much like the picture. When it arrived I was surprised to find that it is the size of large rock salt. I have to put it in my pepper grinder to use it, which is fine. We are really enjoying the flavor of this Himalayan pink salt. I just wish that they would clarify the real size of this salt.

review/text: I believe Tinkyada is the gold standard for gluten free noodles.  I love their products and find that most people will not notice a significant difference using them in recipes.  The tricks to cooking gluten free noodles is to cook with a dash of olive oil in the water to prevent sticking and when done (take one out and cut it and then taste it to be sure) to rinse them extremely well with HOT tap water, then drain and SERVE immediately or add to your favorite dish or casserole.<br /><br />Please note that when using frozen gluten free noodle leftovers, expect the noodles to break up and disintegrate when recooked.  Leftovers are better used in the first two days refrigerated than frozen.

review/text: Need gluten free pasta?  My suggestion is to try the other brands of corn or rice pasta first, satisfy yourself that they're better than nothing but not like the "old" "real" pasta you used before having to go gluten free.  Then try Tinkyada.  After years of other brands, and reasonable satisfaction with them, I tried some Tinkyada.  I can still remember what "real" (wheat based) pasta tastes like, and this was very close to the real thing.  It's so good that my wife stopped making two batches - one gluten free, one "her" kind (wheat-based).  She says even she can't tell the difference.<br /><br />I'm not going to try to make up a different review for each of the Tinkyada products we've tried - because this fits all of them.  These folks really have done the gluten free community a huge favor.  And Amazon's prices are as good or better than anywhere else I've found this (once you figure shipping costs and possibly state/local sales taxes).  Either buy something else to get your order up to $25 (free shipping), or just stock up on Tinkyada all by itself to get 25 pounds.<br /><br />Also, don't forget about Amazon's subscription program for food - it lowers your cost an additional 15% and shipping is also free shipping.<br /><br />Bottom line: nothing else in the gluten free pasta world equals Tinkyada, in my opinion as well as my wife's (and she doesn't even NEED to be gluten free).

review/summary: Incredibly tasty but crumbly
review/text: These cookies have incredible flavor. They're so good the flavor is addicting. But the cookies are crisp so they're crumbly to the point that you need a plate to eat one without getting crumbs all over yourself. One bite and the cookie disentegrates all over the place. If you don't have a soy, egg, milk or peanut allergy, these would be the ultimate cookie if it weren't for the crumbles.

review/summary: Usual Great Pamela's Taste
review/text: These cookies have the same old great Pamela's taste, however the box that I received contained 50 packets of broken and smashed cookies.  The cookies are packed two in a foil pouch, 50 pouches in a cardboard shipping box.  Every last one of the pouches was damaged (I assume during shipping) with damage ranging from both cookies broken into two pieces to the more common extreme of opening a pouchful of crumbs.  Still edible, but oh, so annoying.  Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction.

review/summary: How the cookie crumbles.
review/text: These cookies are gluten and wheat free, but do contain dairy products. They are very good for the kind of snack that they are. I find them a little dry and out of three boxes, (they come as 12 packs of two cookies in a box,) only the first came with the cookies intact. A lot of them were almost all crumble with very little cookie. But if you need to stay gluten free, then you would probably enjoy them anyhow.

review/summary: Was: Whole Cookies! Now: Still arrive as mostly crumbs
review/text: Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.

review/summary: Tasty but Crumbly - Eat them with a spoon!
review/text: Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)

review/text: To be fair, I should say that I haven't ordered these cookies from Amazon.com yet, so I can't speak for the condition they arrive in. I sampled them recently and was looking for an online source for family in another state.<br /><br />In any case, the cookies I tried were surprisingly delicious! I picked up a sample packet at a local health food store, and didn't have high expectations. I bake the vast majority of my own goodies, I'm a very experienced baker, and I don't normally eat gluten-free products. I was happily surprised to find that these had a good peanutty flavor, pleasantly crumbly texture, and lots of little chocolate chips. Unfortunately, I think that the crumbly texture is probably what makes these less than ideal for loose shipping.

review/summary: *Tasty* New Flavor From Stella & Chewy's!
review/text: I'm glad that Stella & Chewy's has come out with this new flavor of freeze dried raw food for dogs. The SURF N TURF is a combination beef and wild salmon and my Shiba Inu loves it.<br /><br />The round patties are dehydrated and you can just add some lukewarm water to reconstitute them again. There is a fishy scent to the patties, but it's not overpowering and I think it adds to the enjoyment of dogs olfactory senses and makes the food more appetizing.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're thinking about trying a raw diet for your pooch but don't want to go through the mess of frozen raw or DIY (do-it-yourself), I recommend the STELLA & CHEWY'S FREEZE DRIED RAW SURF & TURF. It's perfect for small to medium size breeds. I don't think it's good for larger breeds because you'll probably go through a bag every other day or so, which can get expensive. Also if you have a picky eater, which I do, I suggest trying this or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CK0EU">Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Beef Patties, 32 Count, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />And since Stella & Chewy's are adding more varieties to their freeze dried line, like this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIRMM">Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Lamb Patties, 32 Count, 16 Ounce Bag</a>, your furry kid can get the nutritional benefits from eating a wide selection of different foods.

review/text: I researched foods very carefully when we decided to change over, and we decided to try Natural Balance, duck and potato formula, for our 2 dogs, and our son's 2 dogs.<br /><br />We found that the pieces were not overly large, with was nice for the senior, and smaller of the 4.<br /><br />Then, we discovered that they loved it; one, and all. They wouldn't leave the bag alone, and when we tried to change them over slowly, they just picked the Natural Balance out of the bowls, leaving the old food behind.<br /><br />Even so, none experience the slightest system upset at the changeover, not even the one with the sensitive stomach, and everyone looks good, is acting well, and continues to look forward to their meals. Even the dog who has never eaten a whole bowl of food in a meal since he was a puppy is now regularly doing so.<br /><br />I can't guarantee the same results for every dog, as each is an individual, but after trying it on 4 different breeds, and age groups, I can say that I'd recommend it highly as worth a try for someone else!

review/summary: Cleared up chronic ear infections.
review/text: Our local pet store owner suggested this food when I showed her my dachshunds ears that were red, inflamed and never seemed to clear up even after I don't know how many antibiotics our vet prescribed. Within a few weeks they were totally cleared up and we never had the problem again.<br />Also, he used to get hot itchy spots on his belly in the summer and those never came back either. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Dog is way healthier!
review/text: We made the switch from Iams to this food about 3 yrs ago.  We actually did not switch for health reasons for the dog, but instead because I had a crawling infant that was allergic to everything.  Obviously I don't let my kids eat dog food but I was worried the baby might find a piece, stick it in her mouth, and have an allergic reaction.  This food fit the bill as being free of all my daughter's allergens.<br /><br />Within a month we noticed a HUGE change in our dog!  She's a border collie/lab mix and her coat was much healthier looking.  Her nails used to have a lot of breakage and that stopped.  The biggest most important thing that stopped though was her diarrhea.  Previously I had never considered it could be from her food since she didn't get it every day.  However maybe once every 3-4 weeks the poor dog would have explosive diarrhea in the middle of the night that would end up all over my walls (ugh).  Ever since we switched to Natural Balance 3 yrs ago not ONE time has she had that problem.  She also stopped having ear infections.<br /><br />I know other reviewers have said the formula changed and while we did notice that the kibble looked different it did not affect our dog at all and she's still just as healthy with no problems at all.  At one point we tried to switch her to another grain free dog food, Taste of the Wild, because we couldn't find Natural Balance in the city we moved to.  Even though we did a slow transition that food made her really sick, she had horrible disgusting gas, and once again she had diarrhea (thankfully all outside during the daytime this time!).  We went back to Natural Balance and she was once again her old, healthy, self.

review/text: I've been feeding my dog this food for three years now due to her allergies.  I haven't had any problems at all, I'm not sure what the deal is with all of the negative reviews.  Perhaps they changed their dog food too rapidly which causes negative side-effects.  You need to mix the old food with the new food for several days before changing brands.

review/summary: Has done wonders for my dog
review/text: I've been using this food for 3 years and did not even notice the formula change.  I have a dog that used to get chronic ear infections, hot spots and infected anal glands.  Since I put her on this food she has not had ONE problem with any of the above.  It has saved me hundreds of dollars in vet bills.  Occasionally we will get a bag of this food that is a funny color and the dogs don't eat as eagerly so, clearly there is occasionally some inconstancy with the ingredients but I have never had a problem with either of my dogs becoming ill from it.  It's been a real help to us.

review/summary: This Poison Should Get 0 Stars
review/text: By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the "new" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs.

review/summary: Natural Balance Potato and Duck
review/text: This dog food reduced my dogs itching almost immediately and they liked the taste as well. I have no problem getting them to eat it. It has almost totally stopped their wheezing as well. I was not aware that diet could control wheezing, but it seems to have worked that way. I can only conclude that the wheezing was caused by food allergies.

review/summary: No issues with my dog
review/text: I just transitioned my 9 month old Collie pup to this formula from Eagle Pack Large Breed Puppy food.  He likes it fine and it hasn't affected his digestion or stools.  He doesn't suffer from any allergy problems, so that doesn't apply in my case.  My biggest concern was whether the new food would cause loose stools (my collies always seem to be sensitive to this), but no problems.<br /><br />I did notice that the current ingredient list on the back of the bag is: Potato, Duck, Duck Meal, Potato Protein.... So apparently they've restored the duck meal ingredient to the formula.  I selected this product based on suggestions from a animal nutritionist that works for a local Pet Supplies Plus store.  She seems to know her stuff.<br /><br />Edited 4/8/2011: Well I spoke too soon.  After being transitioned over to this formula for about 3 weeks my dogs stools became consistently soft (not loose though).  I was disappointed because his eliminations have become very regular and smaller - just too soft (like peanut butter).  After beginning to add some high fiber kibble (Science Diet Adult light) to this formula things have begun to firm up nicely.  My previous Collie seemed to need a higher fiber diet to maintain the desired "output".  I'm not sure if I'll completely transition to another food or just continue with a mix.

review/summary: Great for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog loves this we had gone for the cheaper lamb and rice formula but my dog stomach wasn't adjusting to it very well. We decided to go up in cost and try out the Duck Formula. Now my dog doesn't have any more issues with his stomach and he really loves eating this food. I would definitely recommend this for any dog. We have a normal sized dachshund and he is very picky but scarfs this food like it was a treat every day for him. The larger size is definitely a cheaper way to go especially for a small dog, just make sure to have a good storage area to keep it in as the bag doesn't seal.

review/summary: CHANGED THEIR FORMULA - MAKES DOGS SICK
review/text: Our boxer was on Natural Balance Duck and Potato for years and did very well on it.  After they changed the formula, he experienced horrible vomiting and diarrhea.  He has also had an major increase in skin irritation (ear itching and paw chewing).  The change in the formula was not made apparent by the company for months.  Later they indicated the changed with a small sticker on the bag.  Very disappointed in the company and hoping that no permanent damage has been caused to our pup.

review/summary: Formula change- Now it makes the dogs sick.  Avoid this food.
review/text: This food was the best out there until Spring 2009, then they changed the formula.  If you check the website, they admit they lost their access to the "quality" duck protein they were using.  Easy way to tell was the food went from light brown to greenish.  That, and after your dog eats the new formula, he will throw up and have diarrhea all over your house. I have two mutts, neither of which are picky eaters.  Both of them chose to starve, rather than eat this food after the formula change.  When combined with the fact that Natural Balance was part of that Chinese dog poisoning issue a few years back, I don't trust this company not to kill my dogs.<br /><br />By the way, if you buy it from PetCo, you will never know, since this food is a good seller, and PetCo has been editing its reviews of the product to delete anything that puts people off the food.  They should be ashamed of themselves, and I won't be getting food there, anymore.<br /><br />Do yourself and your dogs a favor and avoid Natural Balance Ultra.

review/summary: Best Non-Organic Dog Food
review/text: Please see my review of the canned version of NB's Duck and Potato Formula.<br /><br />I am very impressed this this product line. Both my dogs have been able to easily digest both the kibble and the canned versions. I've begun to mix in the dry formula with the canned for my 18 lb Shih Tzu, and I was shocked that she actually ate every bite of her dinner tonight. She's never been a fan of kibble in the past. I also have an elderly Chow Chow who loves every form of the NB's Duck and Potato she's tried (kibble, soft and treat - both the bone/dry and the soft versions). Both dogs have solid poos and high energy - after 10 days. So far so good... keeping my fingers crossed as it's been a long journey to find a food that suits both dogs and their various ailments.

Haven't tried any other flavors, but duck and potato?! He eats better than I do. I only purchased this on Amazon.com to avoid an extra 5$ of tax a brick and mortar store near me would charge. It's pretty much the same price everywhere I've found it.

review/summary: Perfect for our pug! No more skin problems
review/text: Last year after my then 2-year-old pug had several successive skin rashes, my vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. After trying a couple different brands and formulations, I finally found the one that worked best for our pug was Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. I read that they also have it available in a smaller size for small breed dogs. But my pug, which has a fairly small mouth, seems to have no problem eating this kibble.<br /><br />We once tried another brand of limited ingredient dog food from Royal Canin that contained rabbit and potato. I didn't like that one because the kibble had a strong smell. This one from Natural Balance does not.<br /><br />I was very pleased to see within one month that our pug's skin was free of redness and irritation. When we were gone on vacation for over a week Spanky got nothing else other than this food (no treats!) and his skin showed rapid and remarkable improvement. It seemed fairly obvious that we had finally found a suitable food for him. He hasn't had any gassiness and his stool is not loose or showing any sign of intestinal distress. Spanky will eat pretty much anything, so it's hard to say if he enjoys this food any more than another brand as he basically inhales his food. However, it does seem to keep him full and from begging for so many treats. To me this is usually a good indicator of a quality food, as it doesn't just go right through him like corn-based foods do.<br /><br />Definitely a 5-star food.

review/text: I have been feeding this dog food to ny dogs for two years without incident.<br /><br />I am so glad I read these reviews because recently I noticed the food looked different when I poured it into my dog's bowls. Soon afterwards I had several of my dogs coming down with recurring bouts of bloody diarrhea. I had no earthly idea what could have been causing the trouble. I just logged onto Amazon to see about automatic shipping of this food and discovered that this brand did in fact have a new fomula change (unbeknownst to me) and that others have been having the same bloody diarrhea in their dogs since the formula changed. I will never ever buy this dog food again! I will never recommend it again. End of story!

review/summary: Should have heeded warnings...
review/text: I read all of the reviews I could find about this food, and despite the warnings, we started one dog on this food because of suspected grain allergies. His ear/paw infections quickly cleared up and he seemed healthier than ever.  We fed him this for about 6 months without a problem.  About a month ago, we decided to transition our other dog onto it, as well.<br /><br />About 3 weeks ago both dogs started to get very sick - the worst diarrhea I've seen.  It started with one dog, so we took him to the vet.  After screens for parasites and bacterial infections turned up nothing, and antibiotics weren't helping, the other dog also became ill.  On the off chance it was the new bag of food we had recently opened, we fed them something different one day.  Within 24 hours both dogs were fine.  I don't know if it's simply inconsistencies in their production, but I cannot take the chance that I might poison my dogs with a bad bag of food.  We will no longer feed them any Natural Balance food.

review/summary: LID helped my dog
review/text: I have a 140 lb Dogue de Bordeaux (French Mastiff) with chronic colitis. Needless to say, it was a real nightmare to find a dog food that would not give him diarrhea. We went through numerous foods, including other high end products, for a year and finally found Natural Balance Potato and Duck. He still has bouts of colitis but they are fewer and farther between, and with metronidazole to help clear it up, we seldom have issues with diarrhea anymore. Thank goodness!  I will say, though, that I was disappointed that they changed the formula without warning consumers that they would be doing so. After all, those of us who buy this product do so BECAUSE we have dogs with sensitive stomachs and need lots of notice before changing their food!  However, I can honestly say that this product saved my dog's life because I could not have kept him a reasonable weight nor myself sane if he had continued to have such frequent bouts of diarrhea.  Hooch thanks Natural Balance, too!

review/text: I got an English Breakfast tea in with a sample pack and I was surprised at how good it was.  Right after that I noticed the Celestial English Breakfast Tea k-cups on sale at my supermarket.  As soon as I tried the Celestial I thought, "Whoa, this can't be right - it doesn't taste anything like the one in the sample!"  Then I realized the sample cup had been a Timothy's and ordered some of them.  Yup, that was more like it.  I use milk and sweetener with the middle size on the brewer and it's just the right intensity for me. I can't believe how various brands of the same "flavor" can be so different.

review/text: These are tasty, but a lot of work to make. They also were a bit expensive. They're good, but I don't know that I'd buy it again.

review/text: They tasted awful! I followed the directions step by step, took about 30 minutes to make them. The final product was not worth the time it took to cook them. We won't be buying them again.
