review/summary: Not the Best I've had, but still pretty good.
review/text: It is nice tea for a low price. It has a slight sweet, light, and fruity taste but the quality isn't as high as I would expect from a green tea of this grade. In my opinion it's more akin to a Japanese Sencha than gyokuro. Although to be fair you can get this tea for bargain price. If you want a good gyokuro tea I recommend Teavana's Gyokuro (which i'm basing my opinion on)albeit it is about double the price for the same amount.

review/text: Perhaps the previous reviewer is starting out with polluted water, because if anything, Revolution Teas have a very clean and simple taste.  Their Golden Flowers version is no exception.  Probably one of the best Chamomile blends that I've ever had, it has a very natural and un-adulterated flavor.  It's not one of the most expensive teas on the market, yet manages to be steps above the crushed leaf standard teas that most people are used to.  This is a very soothing tea, perfect for a post-dinner experience.

review/summary: best tea bags
review/text: The person who gave this 1 star and said it tastes like polluted water has given the same review to other flavors.  I think he has something against the brand.  While I concede the possibility that a tea connoisseur might be somewhat disappointed by this tea, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better tasting higher-quality tea from a teabag.  I'm not sure if I've ever had Chamomile tea before.. I've always thought of it as a boring flavor but I got a single bag of Revolution's Chamomile tea in a sampler pack, and I really liked it.  I found the flavor to be very mild and harmonious.<br /><br />So far I've loved almost all the revolution tea flavors I've tried.  Their white chai tea flavor was a little strange, but it still beats any other teabags, which generally taste like 'polluted water' compared to Revolution tea.

The blend of herbs and the sachet pouches make it a joy to make every time and each cup is amazing.  I don't know which kind of tea the "1 Star Reviewer" tried, but I challenge them to try the Chamomile and see if they won't change their mind.<br /><br />If you like good tea, you won't regret this purchase!

review/summary: Only slightly dented enthusiasm
review/text: Since I've gone hrough several case lots of Libby's fruit salad, there must be something I like about it. Actually, there are several things. Packing the fruit in pear juice makes the salad a much better alternative to packing in light or heavy syrup, especially for seniors who are teetering on the edge of diabetes. Also, the 12-pack on a subscription plan from Amazon is a pretty decent deal when I can get it for around $16; too much higher and I start shopping local sales. Last, this brand is at least as good as the other generic and name brand versions that I have sampled.<br /><br />However, I'm not giving this product a top rating for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. Libby has a tendency to let small amounts of fruit grit slip by in its quality control.  I've seen minor amounts in this product. I've seen a bit more in the smaller cans that Libby also offers through Amazon, and other reviewers have complained as well about this.<br /><br />2. About 25 percent of the cans in one shipment were very severely dented almost to the point of rupturing. It wasn't from rough handling. While Amazon promptly sent another case, I've begun wondering along with another reviewer if Libby is sending rejects to Amazon.<br /><br />3. I guess for five stars, I would like to see something more distinctly chunky in a fruit salad. This is very good as canned fruit salad goes, but it's not great.<br /><br />By the way, these may or may not come with pop-top cans. I've gotten them both ways.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Hard to Find, But What a Bounty!
review/text: I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that a case of peppercorns is quite a lot.  I'd been searching for brined green peppercorn for ages, checking all our local gourmet shops and coming up empty-handed.  Amazon to the rescue, of course. I was able to make the Steak Au (Green) Poivre I'd been craving with these and it was delicious; I just still had 11 1/2 cans worth of green peppercorn left over... So, I took it as a challenge.  I mashed the remainder of my first can with a fork and mixed it into butter along with some sun-dried tomatoes - voila! An instant sauce for baked chicken.  I peppered up traditional recipes with mashed or whole peppercorns too: Chimichurri Sauce gets an extra kick; Mashed Potatoes are topped with Herb-Peppercorn Gravy; and my Minestrone Soup never tasted so green peppercorny before!<br /><br />I haven't made it through all 12 cans yet, but they do stay usable for a long while and I'm having fun playing around with them.  It's hard to find many recipes that call for the peppercorns, so be prepared to be creative with your abundant bounty.  The Roland Green Peppercorns are an excellent value for a high quality product that isn't available everywhere; if you're interested in getting some, why not get a case?  At worst, donate what you don't use; I'm sure the people at your local Food Bank will be surprised!

review/summary: Bad Bunnies!
review/text: I ordered three solid chocolate bunnies for Easter for my wife and kids. They arrived today; all three are broken, one is broken in more than one place. Each bunny was wrapped in clear foil and loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. They were then placed in a cardboard box where there was enough room for them to float around freely. Apparently they did. Broken chocolate bunnies. After paying $60 I would expect they would spend 50 cents to add enough bubble wrap and/or cardboard protection so that UPS couldn't (easily) break the bunnies. Guess not. Crap. Now I don't have anything special for Easter and I'm out $60. Do not buy from this vendor; it's at best a crap shoot.

review/text: Most mint teas tend to be herbals- peppermint, spearmint, and the like.  What I like so much about this tea is that it combines mint with black tea.  I'm very much a black tea drinker.  I love a variety of flavored and unflavored black teas, so for me, having a black tea mint option is a great thing.  On to the tea itself- I find this tea to be extremely smooth, with a nice mint kick.  The mint flavor is certainly strong, but it's not overwhelming.  This works well as an after-dinner tea, if you don't mind the caffeine.  The mint is refreshing, but I find it helps me relax more than wake up.  The tea offers a very clean taste.  Absolutely recommended for those who like mint and flavored black teas.

They're delicious, grainy and moist, with none of the strange textures and weird flavors that so many gluten-free baked goods have.  I already loved Mary's Gone Crackers for their crackers, and I think this product has the same kinds of good qualities that their crackers do--it seems like they just take clean whole ingredients and figure out how to make them taste good.<br /><br />These were the first gluten-free cookies I tried and because they were so good I naively thought gluten-free products in general wouldn't be too different from regular, gluten-having ones, but many subsequent disappointments have made me realize how special these are.

review/text: I ended up picking these up by accident, thinking that these were unrolled anchovies that I could throw on a pizza & eat. (My fault for not looking more closely.) When I opened them up to discover that they were rolled & stuffed with a caper, I was pretty surprised to say the least.<br /><br />Even so, these were pretty tasty. I was a little turned off by how oily they were (being stored in tons of olive oil), but they really did make for a delicious snack & the olive oil did complement the caper/anchovie combination. The capers really did enhance the flavor of the anchovies.<br /><br />I have to say, I'll probably get these again the next time I have a craving for anchovies. (Minus the pizza of course.)

review/text: I wanted to try Anchovies and I figured that the capers would make them a little less scary because I like capers. They were ok but the salt was off the charts for me. I enjoy lots of salty stuff like Jerky and Sunflower seeds but this was so salty that I pretty much could hardly eat them. I forced myself to eat most of the can because I didn't want to waste them, I tried eating them with bland crackers thinking that might make the saltiness less but still pretty salty. So I wouldn't necessarily tell someone not to eat them, just fair warning- it is a very salty product.

review/summary: excellent sugarfree candy w/o any aspartame
review/text: I was looking for something sugar free but did not know that there was something out there that did not have aspartame or other synthetic poison in it.  This has erythritol in it, a sugar alcohol, with 0 calories and no effect on your glucose level.  The flavor is not sweet, but the texture of this candy is just right for when I need a chewy nutty treat that won't effect my insulin level.  I am excited to have found this and the erythritol.  I have read about erythritol and feel it is safe,and have purchased it as well.  Try this turtle candy.  Won't make you sick, and helps you not feel so left out when everyone else has a treat.  I hope amazon starts carrying it soon.

review/summary: These are great! Inexpensive and taste like the real deal, Erythritol has no gi issues!
review/text: I buy them at Walgreens and Walmart for about $2.00 a bag. They are made with Erythritol which doesn't cause GI upset (unlike the Russel stover stuff which has malitilol-ugh)  My children love DeMets too. These candies are very authentic tasting, I am used to the real deal and only recently had to switch to low carb/sugar free. Try these, you will not be disappointed.

review/text: I was so excited to find these candies.  I remember saving my money as a kid to buy a small bag of them at a department store candy counter.  They were so wonderful, and they tasted like the fruit they were shaped like.  These, however, are a cheap imitation.  The fruit flavor is non-existent.  The main flavor is sugar, and the "peach" tasted like bubble gum.  They remind me of the hideous Brach's East Hunt Eggs.  Sadly, I am still on the search for the yummy candy I remember.

review/summary: All-rye bread baking review
review/text: I made an all-rye bread using Bob's Organic Dark Rye Flour and Rye Meal Pumpernickel.  Yeah, it's supposed to look somewhat broad and dark, but I'm working on that.  It is truly a tasty, dense, dark, moist, chewy bread that goes well with cream cheese and lox; it's great toasted with butter.  I learned to sour some rye flour for about 24-36 hours with water and a little yeast and create the dough from there--helps to create a good rye that bakes well.  I don't use caraway, but this last time I added a tablespoon or so of dried onion flakes to the dough as I mixed it.  That was tasty.  It's hard to find dark rye flours and pumpernickel meal in Texas, and finding the flour really helped a lot in my escape from white flours.  I used to call this "linoleum bread" when I bought it for my husband.  No more name-calling, no more buying.  If you work without a recipe, remember that the dough will be sticky to knead; I usually use half again the amount of yeast I'd use in a white loaf.  Bob's products made a wonderfully tasty loaf of bread.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: Knowing that I like ramen my sister suggested that I give these a try. I'm on my second order as I really enjoy the flavor and texture. The noddle's in this Yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what I am use to in the ramen packets that I normally eat but are very tasty. As with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used.<br /><br /> I reason for only 4 stars has to do with the container that is used. After it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip. Not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container.

review/summary: Not as good as the Mini version & not what the photo leads you to think
review/text: I know, it IS weird that I would prefer the mini version of Ritter Sport Milk Chocolate with Butter Biscuit bars.  But here is why:  the mini has a more pleasing ratio of chocolate to cookie.  Plus, the parts of the mini become one in my mouth, whereas with the larger bar, the cookie slides away from the chocolate.  The larger cookie is not all that great IMO, being very dry and uncomfortable against the teeth.  I much prefer the Gestalt sort of experience the Mini provides; who wants deconstructed dry cookie moving around all over the place.  Unfortunately, I bought a whole box of these big bars, but thankfully the chocolate is most highly edible.<br /><br />Now, take a look at the picture ... doesn't it look like this bar will be a cookie filled with gooey melty chocolate?  My husband picked up my first Mini for me as a surprise, and I honestly did not find the picture appealing, so I set the Mini aside for a few days.  (First time I've ever done THAT with chocolate.)  But the mini pleasantly surprised me for the reasons I've already mentioned.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try if you already like Ritter Sport.  But compare it to the Mini version - I'd love to hear what other people think.

review/summary: Great Protein Snack: Less Fat & More Nutritious.
review/text: I've tried all the flavors of the primal soy jerky, and this is my favorite. It has less protein than some of the others ('Hickory' has the most, I think), but still more protein and nutrition for the fat it brings compared to meat jerky (which has much more fat, less calories, and much less nutritional content). My biggest problem with the other Primal jerky is not so much the flavor, as it is the consistency. When you take a bite from the 'Hot & Spicy' you just get that bite. With some of the others (especially 'Hickory' and 'Texas BBQ,' you snap off more than you intended). I also don't like my hands to be sticky if I'm out hiking, on the gun range or somewhere else running water and soap isn't easily available. Some of the more 'juicy' primal jerky make it difficult to take along as a trail or road snack. To me, that's what it should be for--Otherwise I'd just eat real, hydrated food.

Actually, too good -- no worries that they will go stale because the bag is emptied too soon. Only problem was that Amazon shipped in the original case meant for store display - which means there's a large perforated flap across 2/3 of the front of carton -- opened during shipping and 3 front bags were bagel dust rather than chips. Back bags were fine for party fare.

review/summary: Nice change from the regular version
review/text: I found this to be a very tasty alternative to the regular raisin bran. The flakes are crunchier - not as crunchy as the Raisin Bran Crunch version, but certainly more so than the regular version. A nice compromise.<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor is nicely balanced - not too strong, but you don't have to wonder where it is. There's a good amount of raisins, but the almonds are rather sparse.<br /><br />The downside is that this version has a bit less fiber than the regular version. It has 5g per serving (which is 21% of the recommended daily amount) versus 7g per serving (28% of the recommended daily amount) in the regular version. The Cinnamon Almond version has about the same calories as the regular (200 per serving, which is 1.25 cups versus 190 per serving in the regular, which is 1 cup). Fat and sugar content is the same for both.<br /><br />I'm a big raisin bran fan, and really liked this. Nice change of pace.

review/text: The original Raisin Bran will always and forever remind me of my paternal grandmother. Without fail I would have Raisin Bran or cinnamon spice instant oatmeal for breakfast whenever I visited her. Now with cinnamon in the Raisin Bran it gives me a combination of both tastes that bring back happy memories.<br /><br />The flakes and almonds stayed crunchy in my milk the whole time I was eating. The cinnamon is just right and not too much or too little. Of course there are also plenty of raisins to keep the ratio of cereal to raisins consistent throughout the whole bowl. The almonds weren't overly crunchy in fact you could hardly taste that they were there. There was just a little extra crunch from them. I highly recommend this one for anyone who loves original Raisin Bran and wants a new tiwst.

I have my favorites, mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market.  I would say that Kellogg's Raisin Bran would be considered a favorite from childhood.  Therefore when I saw this new spin on "Raisin Bran" I was quite interested.<br /><br />This "Raisin Bran" has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon.  Well I cannot express my disappointment with this cereal. First and foremost the cinnamon, I am not sure I would use the term "dusted with cinnamon" rather "dumped with cinnamon".  This is all I tasted was cinnamon and it was very, very sugary.  Secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent, which is sad considering it is promoted on the box.  Thirdly this is "raisin" bran right?  Where are the raisins?  Did the two scoops that Kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops?  The taste itself isn't bad per se, if you love cinnamon.  I would rather just have a bowl of normal "Raisin Bran".<br /><br />Kellogg's did a find job with their "Raisin Bran Crunch" so I am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal.  And not for nothing, but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small.  This seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging, higher prices.  But in the case of this cereal there is some major deception.  The cereal is supposed to have almonds, raisins and cinnamon.  Well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon.  So it appears that Kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product.  Simply by charging more, making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes.  I would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months.

review/summary: tasty cereal
review/text: The Raisin Bran cereal with cinnamon and almonds is a great flavor upgrade to the original cereal. The almonds add a crunch to the cereal and the cinnamon adds a light sweetness. The raisins were soft and fresh like it always is in the original cereal.<br /><br />Like with any other cereal, it's enhanced with needed vitamins and minerals and it claims to have 5 grams of fiber per serving which is a plus. However it is less fiber than the original version. I just wish the box was bigger. My family basically inhaled the entire box within a couple days. I will definitely buy this again if I see it at the grocery store.

review/summary: Great flavor upgrade on a classic!
review/text: Barring an unfortunate allergy to either cinnamon or almonds, this is a great pairing of flavors to spice up Raisin Bran with that should not be missed if your a fan of the original(and who isn't?!).  I've always enjoyed Raison Bran, even at the risk of it's somewhat serious side effects, most notably sugar shock and/or your stomach turning into an atomic bomb.  Of course like anything else, if used responsibly these effects can be avoided-- yet here I sit eating my fourth bowl... and in ten minutes my world will be upside down.  Still, great cereal, worth the risks, and highly recommended(just eat with caution)!

review/summary: Cinnamon almond flavor makes old bran favorite new.
review/text: I have always liked Bran flakes, so I was a little hesitant to try this "new" version of Rasin Bran. I turned out to be pleasantly surprised to find that adding the cinnamon and almond made this cereal taste great. There was just the right amount of flavoring to make the cereal taste different. Adding the almond seemed to also make the texture of the cereal less grainy, which is a good thing if you don't normally go for the texture of bran cereal.  I wish the box was bigger, because I really enjoyed eating this. I would definitely purchase this again as it is a great healthy cereal that tastes good as well.

review/text: The Cinnamon Almond version of Raisin Bran tastes great!  I just wish it had a little more nutritional value to start off my day (the regular version is a bit better in this regard).  Not one of the nutrients exceeds being 25% of your daily value.  The raisins had perfect flavor and the almonds stayed crunchy while the cinnamon added just the right amount of sweetness.

review/summary: Disappointing variation of an old favorite
review/text: As a huge fan of the original Raisin Bran,I was looking forward to trying this new flavor. I did not think of this brand as 'sugary sweet' like some other cereals on the market. Unfortunately the sweetness in this new variation was way too sweet for me. There was too much cinnemon in this cereal for me, and I may have enjoyed it more, with a touch less. I ended up discarding the rest of the box. A positive was that it didn't get soggy and was very crunchy, but I will be sticking with the original flavor.

review/text: I'm not much of a cereal eater, but have always been a fan of raisin bran.  So, I was curious about this new version.  It's delicious!  Plenty of almond taste, plus raisins, and plus these little sweet crunchy clusters.  The cinnamon flavor was light, not overpowering at all.  I had some for dinner the other other night, and it was so good I had a second bowl.  I will definitely buy this in the future!

review/summary: Thin Box, Thin Flavor
review/text: While no worse than your average bowl of Raisin Bran, I was disappointed that I didn't find this to be noticeably better. The flavor of cinnamon could certainly be stronger (for my tastes, anyway), and the little slivers of almonds didn't really add to the "crunch" in any sort of meaningful way. And unlike the experience of some other reviewers, I found that this Raisin Bran got soggy remarkably fast after the milk was added, turning to slurry by the last few bites. I've definitely had other Raisin and Bran products that remained crisp longer.<br /><br />I was also a bit taken aback by the box, which holds only 14.5 ounces of cereal. It's the same height and width as the regular cereal box you'd see on the store shelf, but to hide the fact that you're not getting much cereal, the box is so skinny that I actually had trouble getting it to stand on end a time or two. And maybe this is common to a lot of cereals these days - it was just new to me.<br /><br />Overall, I've got nothing bad to say about this product...but to give it a rating of more than 3 stars, I'd have to feel like it was "better than average" somehow. And it simply wasn't.

review/summary: Bland version of Raisin Bran
review/text: Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran somehow managed to have less taste than the regular version. Although I am a big fan of anything with cinnamon, in this case, it seems to take away from the overall flavor. Not only do the almonds lack any flavor, they don't seem to make a difference to the texture either. You would think they might add a crunch to the cereal, but that isn't the case.<br /><br />Definitely, my least favorite Raisin Bran.

review/text: My favorite desserts are cake and ice-cream, but lately I settled down for spicy, fruity cereals with low fat milk in hopes of avoiding some calories. The Kellogg's Two Scoops Raisin Bran Cereals had been a favorite at my home for years, but this new addiction of Cinnamon and Almonds is an auto buy. My daughter loves it, and I had to remember that it has calories too, otherwise I would be eating a whole box in a couple of days. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Why not cinnamon?
review/text: When I first saw this, I thought, "Why are they adding cinnamon?" I mean, Raisin Bran is a classic. However, it was pretty tasty. In fact, I would've liked a bit more cinnamon. It turns out that Raisin Bran and cinnamon are delicious together.<br /><br />Compared to regular Raisin Bran, this is the same but crunchier with milk and having a light cinnamon flavor. It doesn't come off as sweet. The almond slices don't get soggy, so you end up with some crunch all the way through your bowl. I like this even better than the original. So, if you like Raisin Bran, you should definitely try the Cinnamon Almond version.

review/text: I've eaten Kellogg's Raisin Bran for years. It's one of my favorite breakfast cereals. Now when it comes to most foods I have a very open mind and am always ready to try something new, but when it comes to cereal......not so much. So I was just a little bit apprehensive approaching this re-work of a classic cereal. I'm happy to say I was more than pleasantly surprised. I found the cinnamon flavor to be at just the right level. Not so strong that it overpowered the mix, but not so weak that it was just a "hint" either. The sliced almonds added a nice flavor note and a great change-up in texture. Overall, I'd say this is now one of my top three cereals. Highly recommended.

review/text: I don't eat raisin bran.  I got this box of Kellogg's Raisin Bran for my husband who has a bowl of regular raisin bran nearly every night.  It turns out that I am eating more of this cereal than he does. I get tired of regular raisin bran; it is just a little boring. This has cinnamon on the raisins and sliced almonds, neither of which I just love, but with the raisins and bran flakes it all works.  Neither the cinnamon nor the almonds are so strong they take over.<br /><br />I am not normally even a cereal breakfast person, but this has an extra crunch, plenty of raisins, a sweet, but not too sweet taste and has been exactly what I needed the last few mornings.  I got this box through Amazon Vine, but I like it enough that I will buy another box.  Does my husband, the raisin bran authority, like it, yes, but he said it is difficult to improve on Kellogg's Raisin Bran.

review/text: I read a few other reviews here, one said there were hardly any almonds, and another said the cinnamon was barely noticeable. Maybe they each got a bad box, because the one sent to me has lots of almonds, and I could instantly taste the cinnamon.<br /><br />It's a surprisingly nice combination of flavors - bran flakes, raisins, almonds, and cinnamon, but as I always find with most, if not all, breakfast cereals, it's way too sweet. If they eliminated half the sugar, I'd probably be a buyer, but not as it is.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Raisin Bran. I like the serious, healthy flavor of bran, I really like raisins, so it's all good until about halfway through the bowl. At that point, it stops being a healthy breakfast option and turns into a bowl of soggy mush with hard raisins in it, and I have to stop eating.<br /><br />This new incarnation, Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran, is crunchy and surprising, with the almond rescuing it from the earnestness of traditional Raisin Bran. But the real delight is whatever they've done to make the flakes stay crispy through the entire bowl. It's fantastic with whole milk and a little Sugar in the Raw (just a little).<br /><br />Delicious.

review/text: I've eaten regular Raisin Bran for about a year now, a few times each week (always with skim milk).  I've also eaten many other varieties over years.  One of my  favorites is another Kellogg's cereal, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E76570">Special K Cereal, Cinnamon Pecan</a>, so I can't help but compare these two, and for me, the Special K Cinnamon Pecan is far better.  This review is purely what I think tastes best (I'm not a nutritionist, so I'm not going to try and compare which is better for you).<br /><br />I suppose I like Pecans better than Almonds.  I also think the Cinnamon Special K flakes taste a lot better, and stay crisper in milk longer than the Cinnamon Raisin Bran flakes do, and the Special K flakes have more cinnamon glaze on them than the Bran flakes do.

review/text: Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran adds...cinnamon and almonds to your Raisin Bran. Plenty of people on here think it tastes amazing, so I'm a bit in the minority. I think it tastes...okay. It's a bit too sweet for me and a little too strong on the cinnamon. If you want a good analogy of what it tastes like, this cereal basically tastes like you're eating a bowlful of candied almonds. It's been a couple years since I've eaten regular Raising Bran so maybe things have changed or maybe it's just this cereal but I always remember the raisins in Raising Bran being a bit on the small side and kind of firm; in my box of Cinnamon Almond Raising Bran anyway the raisins are fairly large and are soft, making for a bit of squishiness. This is a pretty good cereal that kids and people with a sweet-tooth will probably love. It really does taste just like you're eating candied almonds. Worth trying if you like cinnamon, almonds, and Raisin Bran on their own.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've been watching my nutrients for the past year in order to lose some weight. I find that I can do a good job with every component of my diet except one--fiber. Calories, fats, sodium--no problem. But I often come up short on fiber. When I do, well, let's just say that I've reached that stage of life where a shortage of this component causes me not to be a regular guy.<br /><br />Original Raisin Bran is a great weapon in this fight. I've tried other high-fiber cereals, but I always come back to the old standby. It gives me what I need without a lot of strange ingredients like chicory root extract (inulin) or soluble corn fiber. It tastes good too. So, I was very happy to try this new version of my old friend.<br /><br />It's quite good. A lot of cereals add cinnamon to boost flavor, but they tend to hit you over the head with it, adding so much that it becomes overpowering. Not so here. There's a nice, balanced flavor of cinnamon, almonds, and the original raisins and bran flakes. I find it very appealing. It has a few more calories and a bit less fiber than its un-spiced forebear, but overall a worthy addition, I think.<br /><br />In 58 grams, you'll get 200 calories and 5 grams of fiber.

review/summary: Excellent Twist On an Old Favorite
review/text: I'm a big fan of Raisin Bran. so I was happy to try this newest spin on Kellog's classic. The cereal is still one of the healthier ones that Kellog's puts out but it now tastes even better. The almonds gives the cereal a little added protein as well as an extra crunch. The Cinnamon flavor is understated yet you will still instantly notice it, especially if you routinely buy the original version of the cereal.<br /><br />The cereal is low fat, although the almonds add a bit more than regular Raisin Bran has. It has 5 grams of fiber in every serving, but also 18 grams of sugar. It's high in Iron, B vitamins, folic acid and other essential nutrients, so although it's a bit more sugary than most cereal that my family eats, it's still one you can feel good about eating. My rabbits really want to eat it too...<br /><br />All in all, if you're a fan of bran cereals, definitely give Raisin Bran: Cinnamon Almond a try. It's quite tasty and a nice change from the original version.

review/summary: Great Upgrade
review/text: Raisin Bran is one of those cereals that has been with me since childhood, but has never made much of an impression.  It is good and satisfying, but also pretty boring.  This new version adds only what it says in the name: cinnamon and almonds.  The amount of cinnamon is just right to give the cereal an interesting and delicious flavor.  On first bite, I thought, "This is delicious!"  I have never done that with the original, and rarely do it with cereal in general.  The almonds politely play a minor role, elevating the flavor a bit, but not getting in the way.  This is not a cereal that will make you feel like you are eating a spoon of slivered almonds.<br /><br />I would recommend this cereal to both people interested in a fun new cereal and those that eat Raisin Bran for health reasons and fall asleep shortly afterwords.  It kicks up the notches in just the right ways, tasting like this was how it was always meant to be.

review/summary: Good balanced flavors; I prefer it without milk
review/text: The cereal is not "sugary sweet" (meaning that the primary flavor isn't sugar). The raisins are soft and plentiful (I remember eating Raisin Bran as a kid, when the raisins were like little rocks). The slivered almonds add to the overall crunch, but their subtle flavor is somewhat lost to the taste of raisins and cinnamon. The bran flakes are crispy, but they rapidly wilt when milk is added. For that reason, I prefer to eat this cereal like "trail mix"...there's no law that says you HAVE to put milk on cereal, but if that's the way you prefer it (and if you eat at a normal pace, as opposed to wolfing down your meals) you may wish to seek out a heartier flake. That said, for my personal tastes, I'm still giving the product five stars.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: It's difficult to write a cereal review when the contents get eaten within 3 days, but I'll do my best!<br /><br />To start, the bran flakes didn't get soggy immediately, which was a huge plus. The cinnamon flavor really came out once the milk was poured, and it was just the right amount - not too light, not too overpowering. The raisins tasted fresh, and the sliced almonds gave that little kick that makes a great-tasting cereal even better!<br /><br />Reaching the bottom of the bowl, there were plenty of almonds and raisins to be found, so our bowls were empty but our stomachs were full. Everyone loved the taste and we will definitely be picking up more of this cereal...my wife and child were ready to fight me over the last bowl!<br /><br />Enjoy!
