review/summary: Tastes like dog food
review/text: Take a big whiff of a dog food bag and smell that gross stench of nasty dog food...keep that in mind because when you chew into this bar you get 2-3 chews of banana and then all of a sudden this WAVE of dog food overcomes and I gagged and had to spit it out...that was so disgusting. Me and my husband love healthy foods, and I'm all about organic and healthy foods...but this....this wasn't food...this was something that should be given as dog treats to your pups. EW.

review/summary: eh
review/text: My first bite was just so-so. At first, I thought it had a slightly burnt flavor, but I was wrong. I finished the whole bar and thought about it. I had time to be thinking deeply about snack bars, since my sons were at baseball practice and I was sitting in some bleachers. Baseball practice is a great time to contemplate anything, like, say, world peace or the evil of fractions. I went with snack bars. I'm deep like that.<br /><br />These are not awe-inspiring, as snack bars go. They aren't bad though. I might buy them again. But, I really think I could whip up some banana bread and it would taste better and cost less. But, in a hurry, they're good.

review/summary: Put it in your disaster kit
review/text: Without a doubt, no one in our home liked this product.  As another reviewer stated, it taste like burnt banannas. The product crumbles easily because it is very dry. I suspect there may have been an issue in the manufacturing process that led to the burnt taste and dry texture.<br /><br />If I was really hungry, I would probably eat it- hence the title of this review.

review/summary: Healthier and less sweet
review/text: As its name indicates, these bars are not crunchy, but more cake like. The banana flavor overrides the chocolate, though not entirely, and is reminiscent of banana bread. What I found most interesting is that they contain 1/2 serving each of fruit and vegetable, a plus for any portable packaged snack, as is the fiber content. Great for snackers looking for something less sweet that the traditional granola based bar.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: Something billed as banana chocolate chip seems like it would have to be pretty awesome, a sweet flavor explosion, something so good it just has to be bad for you, right? Ah, not so much. While I have little doubt this snack bar is a healthier treat than, say, a Payday candy bar or a chocolate brownie, it's also not as tasty. So if you want to feel like you're doing something good for yourself and don't mind a cookie type product that tastes a little closer to cardboard, have at it, kiddo. Kashi is right up your low carb, low-sugar, low-flavor alley. However, if you're sweet tooth is jonesing, I say give in and have some chocolate or, heck, even a banana off the tree. You'll be much more satisfied and you won't feel like you compromised.

They have a strange flavor I can't place. They're dry but it feels as though they added something to make it seem like they aren't.

review/summary: Okay, but nothing to write home about... A little heavy.
review/text: So, this stuff's advertised as "soft & chewy" and made out to be health food, of a sort.<br /><br />Granted it's probably better than a fig newton, since it's made with whole grain flour (oats, hard red wheat, rye, brown rice, triticale, barley, buckwheat, sesame seeds) and various kinds of grain & such. So, there's probably SOME nutritional value. But, on the other hand, it seems to be packed with sugar (apple puree concentrate, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, Banana puree, brown rice syrup, evaporated cane juice). But not enough to make up for the fact that it's also pretty "heavy," despite fulfilling the "soft" & "chewy" claim. Being honest, I didn't really taste much banana, either (which seems weird considering they use banana puree).<br /><br />I wanted to like these, but they felt more like eating a heavy protein bar, despit there not being especially much protein. The chocolate chips were nice. But, for some reason the little crunchies seemed kind of out of place.<br /><br />So, yeah, far from terrible. Not as heavy as a lot of protein-type bars out there. But not as "soft & chewy" as a fig newton or something similar, though possibly slightly healthier on account of the whole grain flour & such? So, it's a mixed bad. I guess I'd say there wasn't anything that dazzled me or set it apart from other such bars.

Those who don't think so must have LOTS of dead taste buds or have a funky-taste fetish (it takes all-kinds to make a world).<br /><br />The bottom of the bars coloring looks suspiciously over-cooked, as well.<br /><br />Many people have come to the same conclusions on Amazon and other sites regarding the flavor of these things.<br /><br />I know, I know.

review/summary: Better than Cardboard
review/text: Kashi's Banana Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar is intended for the health conscious and those who prefer more natural ingredients in their snacks. The bar has great banana and chocolate flavors; however it has the texture of a dry fig newton without the gooey center. The product describes itself as having a banana bread taste. Though Kashi's bar is a fine attempt to replicate banana bread, I would always select real banana bread over this product. It's not that it doesn't do what it's intended to do, but it's hard to get past the bar's dryness and underwhelming texture. Give it a try, but as for me, I'll be walking past Kashi's Snack Bar the next time I see it in the grocery aisle.

review/summary: A pretty darn good snack
review/text: Kashi is a brand under the Kellogg umbrella. It has a wide variety of products, though it seems to focus primarily on breakfast foods. This snack bar is actually quite tasty, tasting rather like some sort of banana-nut bread. The bars weigh in at a nice 140 calories (25 from fat), which is nice and close to 100 calories - the target for my afternoon snacks.<br /><br />What can I say? I like the taste of these bars, and I like the fact that they have a 1/2 serving of fruit and a 1/2 serving of veggie. I think that they make a pretty darn good snack, and I look forward to trying some other flavors!

review/text: Kashi's products are usually pretty good. However, when it comes to snack bars, these are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The good -- the bars aren't cloyingly sweet. They do taste like natural banana, but have a slight bitterness (some other reviewers have commented on a 'burnt' flavor).<br /><br />The bad -- the nutritional value isn't notable, and these aren't exactly 'health' bars. The chocolate chips, rumored by the packaging to be contained therein, are unidentifiable and not taste-able in the product. The texture is unremarkable, a bit too dry.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't purchase these again. They're simply not worth the calories -- their taste and nutritional values aren't what's needed for regular purchase and enjoyment.

review/summary: A great breakfast bar or snack when you need energy
review/text: Now I might be a little biased, as Banana Bread was my mother's favorite snack item to make herself, but this bar reminds me of the bread she made. Some of the bars were a little on the dry side, but overall I like these. They are good for when you don't have time to make breakfast or for when you need a energy boost between meals. The Banana bread is the dominate flavor in all the bars I ate, the chocolate chips were there but not very noticeable. Personally, I would like to see more chocolate chips in my "Chocolate chip chewy snack bar". They had a consistent taste from the first to the last bar, the dry aspect didn't seem tied to how long they were on my shelf, more likely due to to how they are made. The last few did not get hard like some snack bar do, so they might be a good choice for a survival/emergency pack.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice snack bar, could use more chocolate chips, but very nice Banana bread flavor.

review/summary: Okay for a snack
review/text: The first bar I had, I decidedly didn't like it.  To me, they didn't taste of banana or chocolate, but definitely sweet, dry, cake-like.  By the end of the box (there are 5 bars per box) they had grown on me a bit.  They are sort of like a sweet slice of banana bread, with oats on top and chocolate mixed in (although I still don't really taste the chocolate).  They are soft and chewy bars, although I found them a little dry, hence crumbly.  They are pretty low-cal (only 3g fat per bar) and boast "1/2 serving of fruit, 1/2 serving of veggie" on the front of the box.  I think you would need to be a Kashi fan to really appreciate these.  To me, they were average, hence 3-stars.

review/text: When I first tried one of these snack bars, it reminded me of other high fiber bars I've eaten over the years. The chocolate flavor is light but does add a nice combination with the banana. My wife took them to work for colleagues to sample. They ate the whole box in one setting and everyone really liked them. The most common reaction including my own is that they are a little dry, but otherwise pretty good.

review/summary: I wasn't impressed, but my child liked these bars
review/text: Nutritionally, I thought these bars were fine. 140 calories, 3 grams fat, 4 grams fiber, 9 grams sugar.  The ingredients were recognizable and include apple puree, banana puree and dried pumpkin.  Unfortunately, the taste is not very appealing.  The chocolate is barely discernable and the taste of the rest of the bar is lackluster.  It may be because although the bars use decent ingredients, there are a lot of them and it must be highly processed.  Despite my lack of enthusiasm, my 4-year-old liked these bars just fine.  So 2 stars from mom and 4 stars from the kid make for a 3 star rating.

I will agree that the banana and chocolate flavors don't really come out and there is a hint of a burned flavor, but all in all, I found them to be okay.  Compared to other health food bars, they were pretty good.  I actually really liked the texture.  They were filling, fairly low calorie, and pretty healthy.  I went through the whole box in a few days and didn't share any with my kids, so that is saying something!

review/summary: Dry but satisfying
review/text: I love bananas and chocolate together, so this seemed like a can't miss. I like to have snack bars in the morning with my coffee, so I opened my first bar with a hot cuppa joe. The bar looked as it does on the package upon opening, however after taking my first bite I was first struck by the dryness of the bar. Really too dry, and I chose to dip future bars in my coffee. But I continued on with this bar without dipping in order to properly review. I found there was a slight burned taste to the banana, but I didn't find it that objectionable. I guess I'm one of those weird people who likes a little burn taste to food from time to time. The chocolate was fine, nothing memorable, could have used a little more. I will say it kept me feeling full until lunchtime, and it improved considerably once I dipped it to add some moisture. I probably wouldn't buy them though, and I usually like Kashi products.

review/text: I brought my Vine sample box of "Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar, Banana, Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar" in to work...had my first one at break time, hoping to try out the rest over the following 2 days. But, it was not to be, because colleagues snapped up my remaining few bars. The consensus was: not overly sweet, with a nice soft (but not unmanageably crumbly) texture and consistency.<br />So, just based on our small sample, I have to say that these are worth a try. Ingredients-wise, there does seem to be a lot of sugar, even though they are not that sweet...so diabetics might need to be careful. And they seem a bit pricey for what they are. So, we decided that a 3-star rating was fair.

review/text: Whenever I try a 'healthfood' product I assume that the health claims are for the most part true - at least I assume that the snack is going to be better for me than a candy bar. Unfortunately alot of nutrition bars taste like cardboard and drive me back into chocolate purgatory. In this particular taste, I found this Kashi product tasty, crunchy, chewy, and filling. It passed my test - and i did not feel like sneaking a piece of chocolate to supplement my snack. When I went back to try another bar later, I found that the gremlins (my children) had discovered my stash. When this happens sometimes I find half-eaten bars lying in the folds of the recliner - not this time. The bars were consumed totally, wghich tells me that these snacks passed the kid test. They're not interested in health - they go for taste! Congratulations KASHI! Another winner!

review/summary: Not the Best Tasting Snack
review/text: When I first opened up one of these Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bars my initial thought was that they looked like yummy banana bread bars. Unfortunately, they do not taste like banana bread. They are dense, heavy and mostly lack flavor. You get an occasional faint banana flavor & the chocolate chips are almost non-existent. They taste like bad health food bars. While I don't hate the taste, I don't like it either.<br /><br />Nutritional facts:<br />Each bar is supposed to have 1/2 serving of fruit, 1/2 serving of veggies, 7 whole grains and 4gm of fiber. They claim to be naturally sweetened, but pack 9gm of sugar per bar. 140 calories, 3gm of fat, 125mg of sodium, 25gm of carbs, 3gm of protein.<br /><br />Given the nutritional content and lack of taste, I recommend just eating an apple for a snack. It will be healthier, cheaper and better tasting. Skip this one!

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious!
review/text: The Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar Banana is a healthy alternative to junk food snacking. Aside from the its great taste and being all natural, it is healthy, giving you the half serving of fruit and half serving of vegetables in a convenient snack bar form. The 3g of fat, no cholesterol, 140 calories per bar and 4g of dietary fiber makes this an ideal grab snack for those trying to lose weight and eat on the healthier side. The only drawback I could see was the 9g of sugar per bar. Maybe Kashi can lower this to around 2 or 3 g's of sugar and you absolutely have a healthier, all-around snack. I have been a regular user of Kashi products and the Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar, Banana is good but not great. With 9g's of sugar per bar, moderation in consumption is still advised.

review/summary: The first bad Kashi - this bar is not appealing!
review/text: Like other reviewers I actually like Kashi products. Generally I find them flavorful within the allowance I make for healthier food. That means I don't expect a Snickers bar - but I do expect a good flavor. These had a taste that was bland but with a slightly bad aftertaste. The texture is fine and was not a problem. I didn't taste much of anything in it other than banana - but that flavor didn't even taste that good. No chocolate that I could determine. They are not the worst bar I've ever had but they are not something I would ever buy. I didn't hate them. If they were the last food and I was shopping for a hurricane or something I'd have to pick them up so I would not starve.<br /><br />Look it's 2012 - not 1990. Back in 1990 all my health food tasted, well, gross. But there wasn't much available so I dealt with it. Now in 2012 healthy food does not have to taste bland, unappealing, and cardboard like. Take a pass!

review/summary: mixed results from the kids, just OK, won't buy again
review/text: Well, I've got two 5 year olds, and these bars claim to be kid friendly.  I like the nutritional info in terms of having fiber and being low in sugar (we try to not to get stuff with more than 9 grams of sugar per serving).  They are very soft which is nice, many granola bars are too hard for little ones to eat.  The banana flavor in these is natural tasting, not fake or chemical, but it has a weird taste, like over cooked baked goods or something.  I did not taste any chocolate AT ALL in these.  Now, I gave one to the less picky eater, she said she liked and gobbled it up.  Gave one to the picky eater, said she liked it then half way through didn't want to finish it.  On next offering, NEITHER girl wanted one and said they did not like them.  On next offering they both acted like they were getting some sort of special treat and the both gobbled it down.  Also of note, both girls flicked off the oats that are on the surface of the bars and did not like those.  So, it is hard to say.  I guess I can simply say that these were just okay and that I would not buy them again.  I'll stick with Annie's chocolate chippers.

review/summary: Good Bar With a Few Kinks
review/text: I found the Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar, Banana to be tasty and filling in exactly the way you'd expect from a Kashi breakfast bar, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the choices made when developing this item could use a re-think. While the overall flavor is good, the bar does have an odd flavor that does resemble "burnt". The chips of dried banana mixed in the bar taste ok, but add a brittle "crunch" texture that has a mouth feel less like a nut and more like a foreign object. These are ok, but not at good as I have come to expect from Kashi.

review/summary: One of my few disappointments with a Kashi product
review/text: I was eager to try this product. I love banana flavored anything and add chocolate chips and you've got a winner. So I was terribly disappointed at how bland, heavy and dry this bars tasted.<br />There was no sweetness or banana taste and very few chocolate chips.<br />They also left a very heavy feeling in my stomach after I ate them. I tried three bars on three separate occasions and each time I felt like I couldn't move afterwards, as if I ate a huge meal.<br />This wouldn't discourage me from trying any other Kashi products because all of them except this one have always been a quality product. (Their Dark Chocolate Coconut Bars by contrast are delicious and flavorful)<br />I would just take a pass on these.

review/summary: Those In Need Of (Or Are Simply Fans Of) Low Glycemic Index Snacks Are In Luck Here
review/text: I have heard a lot about Kashi food products over the years, principally from my eco-hip, health-nut acquaintances who simply can't get enough of the outfit's stuff.  I have always looked askance at Kashi, given that I am not one of this yoga-pants wearing, Whole Foods shopping demographic (in truth, Kashi goods can be found in just about any supermarket).  But I digress.<br /><br />As for the product itself, while being very flavorful (indeed, it's almost like snacking on a real banana), the product is not very sweet.  Texture-wise, it came across as kind of grainy and flaky.  The combination of texture and composition, when ingested with a suitable liquid (coffee is my preferred beverage) is actually quite filling.  However, I like my snack bars sweet and diabetic-coma inducing, and this, quite frankly, didn't cut it.  And oh yes, it needs more chocolate!<br /><br />That said, I gave a few to a couple of friends, one of whom is diabetic, and both raved about them. Neither of them were originally big fans of Kashi products, so that is a plus.  Additionally, both actually liked the lack of (simple) sugars, and loved the combination of oats, grains and fiber.  In its defense, the Kashi snack bar would make for a great fuel source either during a strenuous workout or after, especially in combination with a protein-dense food source such as soy milk or a non-fat latte.  Indeed, I found the best results when nibbling on it with a de-caf, non-fat latte after a solid aerobic workout (you get your carbs, protein, fiber and fluid all at once).  I also had one with my normal cup of Joe, and it was quite filling.<br /><br />Sometime later, on a lark, I believe I may go to the supermarket and buy a couple of boxes to use as post work-out fuel.  While not the sweetest thing around (and very stingy on the chocolate!), it is quite an improvement over those candy bars masquerading as "healthy snack bars".  For those of you that want the sweet snack bar, I say take a pass on this product.  However, for those of you that want a flavorful snack bar that won't send your blood sugar into the stratosphere, this just might be the ticket.

review/text: The Kashi Banana Chocolate Chip Bars sound perfect. Each bar has a half serving of fruit and veggies. Each contain 4g of fiber and are soft and natural. At only 140 calories, they won't ruin your diet and can make a perfect snack or breakfast supplement. So, the question is, do they taste good?<br /><br />They taste GOOD. Not great, but they are tasty and easy to eat. The oats on top give the banana bread a crunch, and chocolate chips give it a sweetness. I great, natural bar you can have for a snack or supplement your breakfast.

review/summary: I'd rather gnaw on my wool hiking socks
review/text: These would be okay on a hike when I am famished enough to eat my backpack.  But on the sofa, these bars do not satisfy;  they are far more savory (and not in a delectable way) than sweet, and necessitate a tall drink of anything.  The pumpkin flavor prevails over the banana, followed closely by the taste of the boiled apple juice.  I crumbled apart an entire bar just to count the molecular-sized chocolate chips (3).  While I do like Kashi cereal, I'll be disposing of - rather than digesting - the remainder of the box.  I would much rather go to the trouble of baking my own banana/pumpkin/whole wheat bread with proper adult-sized chocolate chips.  The reason I am giving these 2 stars instead of 1 is that I do like the hint of barley and the (too few) crunchy oats on the top.

review/summary: Tasty, but Kashi might want to add "Dry" to the product description
review/text: Let me preface this review with the statement that I am a big fan of Kashi products, particularly its Autumn Wheat, Island Vanilla and Cinnamon Harvest cereals and its TLC Fruit and Grain Bar, Dark Chocolate Coconut.  Kashi's chocolate chip/banana snack bar, however, didn't resonate with me like the aforementioned products.  It lacked any sort of tasty greatness, coming across as an average experience for the palette.  The bar lacked moistness and was very dense in consistency.  I choked down half of my first bar and determined that I would be unlikely to finish it without a drink of water.  My second experience was much better because I dipped it in yogurt before each bite.  Good product, but it fell short (for me) in several areas.  I'll stick with the Dark Chocolate Coconut (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPMN2">Kashi TLC Fruit & Grain Bar, Dark Chocolate Coconut, Layered Granola Bars 6 - 1.1 oz  Bars, (Pack of 6)</a>) for now.

review/summary: Taste a bit unusual but promises 1/2 serving of fruit and 1/2 serving of veggies
review/text: The Kashi banana chocolate chip bars come in a box that contains five individually wrapped bars. Each bar has 140 calories with 3g of fat (0.5g saturated, 0g trans), 0mg cholesterol, 125mg sodium, 25g carbs (4g fiber, 9g sugars), 3g protein, 8% Vitamin A, 4% Iron, and 2% Calcium.<br /><br />The box promises that each bar is half a serving of fruit because of the apples and bananas included, and half a serving of veggies because of the pumpkin included (dried pumpkin with rice flour).<br /><br />The bar is on the soft side, with the chocolate bits providing some light crunchy resistance.<br /><br />The taste it is a bit off. I don't know if it is the combination of banana and pumpkin or the way it was prepared and baked. The chocolate chips are decidedly losing the taste battle to the banana+pumpkin combo. I can sort of feel a little bit of a pumpkin-ish after taste, similar to when eating pumpkin pastries or pumpkin pie.<br /><br />They deserve credit for at least trying to come up with healthy snacks, but the taste needs to be improved!

review/summary: Tasty But Could Be More Nutritious
review/text: I really like the taste of these bars.  They are soft and flavorful with bits of crunch in them, and not overly sweet.  I didn't get the burnt taste than some people experienced, but the banana does taste like very ripe bananas.  Those who are fond of only relatively green bananas may not be thrilled with the taste of these.<br /><br />Although I like the flavor, there were a couple of drawbacks.  The bar, at 140 calories, has only 3 grams of protein, less than I expected.  The sugar content is 9 grams, which I don't find too bad.  The bars weren't as filling as I expected.<br /><br />It is, for me anyway, next to impossible to read the ingredients as printed on the outside of the box.  The print is white on a yellow background, and there is just not enough contrast to make it readable.  The nutritional information on the box is a bit more readable, but still not easy.<br /><br />On the inside, the nutritional information is easy to read but the tiny print of the list ingredients still makes reading that difficult.  Manufacturers, please make your information easy to read.  When you do not, I assume you are trying to hide something.<br /><br />While I enjoyed these bars, I probably won't go out of my way to get more in the future.

review/text: I wasn't expecting too much from this newton-like cereal bar, and I can say that it was edible but nothing special. The texture was somewhat dry and a little crumbly, not moist like I thought it would be. It was also a little dark and had a faint burnt taste, not sure if they're all like that or if mine was an anomaly.<br /><br />I didn't taste much banana in this bar at all, and the chocolate chips were small, though they added a nice textural contrast. It isn't very sweet and is relatively low in sodium and fat, which is good for your body, but unfortunately doesn't add to the taste.<br /><br />At only 140 calories per bar with 3gm of fat, this makes for a decent and fairly healthy snack bar, but frankly a regular piece of fruit would probably be more satisfying, and there are a number of other energy bars out there that have more taste. If they could punch up the banana and chocolate flavor, and make it a little more moist, then I think they'd be getting somewhere.

review/text: Honestly, Kashi is not one of my favorite brands, but I am constantly on the lookout for 100 calorie snacks (or lunch bars) to tide me over to dinner, especially since I now have to lose weight for health reasons.  Actually, these bars are 140 calories, and they are pretty good.  They are moderately moist, the banana taste is not overpowering or artificial, and there is just a hint of chocolate.  They are not overly sweet either; the first ingredient listed is apple puree concentrate.  The rest of the ingredient list is long, but amazingly, 99 percent of the ingredients are recognizable and pronounceable.  What I did not like is that when biting into the bar, it tended to crumble (not good at the computer); I solved this by just cutting up the bar into pieces.  The other thing is that for a snack, I personally would not pay more than 75 cents apiece for these.

My two daughters are pretty picky about flavors and consistencies but they both enjoyed the Banana Chocolate Chip chewy bar. They have a nice banana flavor without the fake taste that I hate so much.  There are little pieces of oatmeal on top and inside there is something that gives a tiny crunch, makes me think of rice krispies.  I compared them to the other chewy bars we have on hand (Kashi TLC, Cascadian Farm, and Kellogg's) and they have very similar nutritional values.  The only thing, all my other boxes have six bars and the Banana Chocolate Chip came with only five.  Something to think about when comparing prices is the quantity of bars in the box.

review/text: I sort of taste a banana flavor but not at all like banana bread or anything close.  I don't taste the chocolate chips at all - they might have just as well left those out for as much impact as they have.  After reading there is Pumpkin in it I almost can detect it but I think if I had not read that was in it I would not have been able to put my finger on it.<br /><br />If you gave me this bar - without the wrapping there is no way I would have been able to tell you the main flavor was supposed to be banana or chocolate chip.  There is a sweetness but it's so hard to define.  You can taste the oats and grains and that gives it a nice texture.  I would have said the main flavor was supposed to be oats I think.<br /><br />Over all the texture is very soft and moist with the oats and the chocolate chips giving a little bit of roughness to the soft texture.<br /><br />The taste is sweet, an undefinable mix of flavors... the banana I guess sticks out most but it's not at all like banana bread in the traditional sense.  It is tasty I think, and my 1.5 year old loves them but my 8 year old does not like them so well.  My husband say he thought they were just "ok" but nothing special so I guess everyone in our house has a different opinion.<br /><br />But the ingredients are certainly better than most other bars and that is something to consider when choosing one product over another.

They also have a little vitamin A, iron and calcium.<br /><br />Kashi soft-baked bars are a practical solution to my personal dilemma of what to eat "on the road," and I've also been enjoying them for breakfast every morning. I really like this product!

review/text: I realize that Kashi stuff is made more for health food approach using grains, fruit and veggies, so when I got this banana chocolate chip I wasn't expecting it to be super sweet (which it isn't). It's a nice sized bar with small dark chocolate chips throughout.  It kinda tastes like Raisin Bran in bar form.  It's filling and even though I didn't find the banana flavor that strong like I was hoping.  Overall, if your looking for a healthy snack this would certainly do at 140 calories for the whole bar.  Having 3 grams of fat and 125mg of Sodium with -0- cholesterol.  It carries 17% (4g) of your daily intake for Fiber.  It also has 7 whole grains. The label claims that its a 1/2 serving of fruit from the apples and bananas and 1/2 serving of veggies from the pumpkin.<br /><br />If your looking for a healthy snack this would work.  They come in other flavors (Ripe Strawberry, Blackberry Graham and Cherry Vanilla)

review/summary: Better than I could make at home
review/text: I like these bars as a snack because they're only about 140 calories and they taste like homemade banana bread, with the yummy addition of tiny dark chocolate chips. They're probably better than any banana bar I would attempt to bake at home. The only thing that keeps me from rating them any higher is the texture, which seems to be the downfall of the Kashi products I've tasted before. It's a little dry.

review/text: OK, I like bananas and I like chocolate chips, but I wasn't too sure about putting them together. In a word, it's DELICIOUS!! They're dark, soft, cake-like bars with a bit of crunch from pieces of banana chips, and I find them irresistible.  Very highly recommended.

review/text: Nicely balanced flavors--I didn't find the banana overwhelming.  Definitely a "healthier" tasting snack, which isn't a bad thing to me since I try to keep my snacks on the less-junky side of things.  If your diet is rich in whole grains, and you're used to the heartier flavor of them, I think you'll like these.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm getting more.

review/summary: Not Bad; Not Great
review/text: I'm sure these snack bars are much better for you than many sugary snacks.  Each bar provides 1/2 serving of fruit and 1/2 serving of vegetables (from pumpkin), 4 grams of fiber, and 7 whole grains, with only 3 grams of fat and 140 calories.  That would be great, but I didn't find the flavor to be that great.  They look appealing and the texture is good and they are soft and chewy, but there's something about the flavor I don't care for.  I taste pumpkin more than banana or chocolate, and the aftertaste is a little bitter and reminds me of other protein bars that I don't care for.  But taste is subjective and others may love the flavor.  It's certainly nice to have the option of eating a sweet snack that is a little more nutritious than, say, cookies.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I love Kashi products and was looking forward to trying out this snack bar. However, unlike the other Kashi products I've tried (cereals and other bars), this snack bar isn't very good.<br /><br />When you open up the package and smell the bar, it smells a bit burnt - like burnt chocolate with a very light banana smell to it. Taste-wise, while there's a slightly sweet taste, there's a bitter aftertaste. There's very little to no banana taste to the bar. It is chewy, but it's dry - you'll need something to drink with it. And while there are chocolate chips in the bar, you really can't taste them.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say pass on these bars.

review/summary: Very tasty, just a bit dry
review/text: I recently had the opportunity to review the Kashi Banana Chocolate Chip Soft n Chewy Bars.  I am a longtime fan of the Kashi brand, it is a brand I trust to provide healthy, delicious foods.  I had a feeling that this bar would live up to my high standards, otherwise Kashi would not be making it.  That feeling proved to be completely accurate.<br /><br />The first thing I took notice of was the nutritional info.  Each bar contains 4 grams of fiber, 7 whole grains, 1/2 serving of fruit, 1/2 serving of vegetables, only 3 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein, and only 140 calories.  In terms of a snack, this is pretty good.  While still a processed snack, this is a lot healthier than some on the market.<br /><br />As I opened the package, I was struck by how the bar itself really looked exactly like the picture on the box.  That is so rarely the case.  Same dark brown color, same oats on top.  It looked pretty delicious.<br /><br />As I tore a bite off of the bar, I noticed it was not as moist as I would have liked.  It is still a soft, chewy, texture, just a bit dry.  The flavor was actually really good.  It was not overly sweet, in any artificial way, and I thought the banana flavor was just right.  It did not have an artificial banana flavor, the flavor was subtle, mellow, but still detectable.  The same can be said for the chocolate, there are not too many chips, just enough to give the bar the perfect blend of tastes.<br /><br />All in all, I was really pleased with the bar, as was my husband.  We are big fans of the chocolate banana combination, and this bar is a healthy way to satisfy a sweet tooth.  My only complaint is that it is indeed a little dry, so it would be best paired with a glass of water, or even a cup of coffee.  All in all, I think I can safely say I plan on buying more of these in the future.

review/summary: disappointing, to put it mildly
review/text: My friend and I, both of whom buy Kashi products and enjoy them, opened my package for review together -- with anticipation of a treat.<br /><br />What we got was bars that were overcooked to the point of turning black.  (Was your quality control on vacation, Kashi???)  In what I could force myself to try, there was one tiny chocolate chip almost too tiny to notice -- and he got none.  The bars were dry and unpleasant.  They tasted strongly of pumpkin, NOT banana or chocolate.  There were large chips of peanut leading me to think they should have contained peanut in the title.  When I told my friend that I could barely give this product two stars, he said he wouldn't even give it one.<br /><br />If this is Kashi's "new" approach to food, I think it will cost them customers.  The poor quality control alone will make me wonder whether the products I already use will continue to be up to snuff.  Both of us deplore wasting food, but even the garbage can seemed reluctant to accept these bars!

review/summary: Not exactly banana bread, but close
review/text: This little snack bar seems designed to be banana bread in a wrapper, and it's not perfect, but it's definitely very good.  The most important aspect of a snack bar, for me, is taste, and this is a tasty snack.  The banana and chocolate ingredients have strong flavors, and the overall sweetness is satisfying without being overwhelming.  I also like the little crunch from the oats sprinkled along one side of the bar.  I don't love the texture - it's very dense, especially compared to good banana bread or similar bars from other companies - but it's certainly not bad.  I would buy more of these bars for my morning commutes.

review/summary: Not bad snack, taste a bit bitter.
review/text: This bar is more like cookies, but truly is not as bad according to ingredients (main: fruit, veggie-pumpkin, oats, barley). Sugar 9 g, protein 3g, fat 3 g, total carbs 25g.<br /><br />It does taste a little bit bitter, but I think because it was baked and flavors are natural. Usually in very tasty banana products (except for real bananas;) artificial flavors are present. Some chocolate chips in it sweeten up the bar.<br /><br />I don't mind the taste (I prefer less sweet snacks overall) but I am not fond of the texture. It makes good snack for my toddler though, he loves them and can easily bite and eat it.

review/summary: Health food?
review/text: Reviewing the taste of a snack food is iffy at best. I like it, but then again, I rather like burnt banana bread.<br /><br />That said, I take issue with this being a "health food." The Kashi brand would lead one to believe that it is, and the back of the box reads, ". . .just like homemade!" I'd love to list the ingredients here, but I can not read the print on the box. It is tiny and printed in white on a yellow background. I had to go to the Kashi website to find a readable list.<br /><br />It's not all "bad." Kashi's signature "seven whole grains and sesame" are in these bars. Canola oil? Well, some say that's not good for you. I don't know, but I do know that it's doubtful that the very long list of ingredients would not be in any "yummy banana bread. . .just like homemade!"<br /><br />The back of the box boasts that each bar contains 1/2 a daily serving of fruit, and 1/2 a daily serving of "veggie" (from pumpkin). These bars taste like cookies to me. I like them, but if one wants a cookie, there's plenty of cookies out there, and if one wants a healthy snack, an apple and a few pieces of broccoli would serve you far better than one of these. We fool ourselves when we eat products like this. They are not "health food," even with the assurance that "you can snack with satisfaction and feel good about it!" from Kashi (on the side of the box). An honest cookie, one that contains flour, butter, and sugar, is just as good or bad for a person as these.

review/summary: Perfect Snack
review/text: It's yummy. In fact, the Kashi Banana Chocolate Chip far is so yummy that my husband who is definitely not a fan of nutritious health bars has been getting into my stash. When first considering whether to get them or not, I made a pretty quick decision based on the descriptive words on the box: � service of fruit from apples and bananas, � serving of veggie from pumpkin, 7 whole grains, 4g of fiber, and dark chocolate chips. What's not to like about that combination of flavors?<br /><br />When I opened the wrapper, I was surprised and pleased to see that it was a bar of substance, not little and thin like some bars. And the taste and texture...sweet but not too sweet, chewy but not overly chewy, and soft but with some "bite"to it. Plus, the bar has just the right amount of crunchiness to add another gustatory sensation.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are only five instead of six bars in the box.

review/summary: Edible, but not exactly your mama's banana bread
review/text: According to marketing claims, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BXV176">Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar, Banana, 7-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> has "Yummy banana bread taste with dark chocolate chips--just like homemade." The bars also have "a touch of natural sweetness," and "soft-baked, natural goodness you can see and taste."<br /><br />My taste-testing suggests that Kelloggs may be going a bit far in making comparisons to your mama's (or your own) banana bread.<br /><br />When you first bite into one of these bars, you feel its softness. It's not as soft as a slice of banana bread or a Fig Newton, but it is softer and probably less chewy than a typical oatmeal raisin cookie. Chewing it, you note some odd, crunchy, rice-crispy-ish bits, along with small chunks of chocolate and paper-like rolled oats. Tasting it, the banana flavor is sharp, almost artificial-seeming, but it does not overpower the chocolate, pumpkin, or other, less identifiable flavors. What's most memorable about the taste, though, is the bitterness. I don't know if the bitterness is "natural" or otherwise, but it is a lot more prominent than sweetness.<br /><br />In other words, taste is NOT the best selling point for these bars. Likewise, high carb content (25g), and low protein content (3g) are not going to win the bars many points. On the plus side, they are made with whole grains, they have a moderately high fiber content (4g), they have little fat (3g total, 1.5g monounsaturated), they have a low calorie count (140), and they feature "natural goodness" (note that the packaging does not make an "all-natural" claim). The bottom line, though, is that they're edible but not much fun to eat. Not recommended.

review/text: I was very disappointed in these Banana Chocolate Chip snack bars. I didn't find that there was much taste in them. I couldn't taste much of either the banana or chocolate chip. In fact, they sort of taste slightly of cardboard. And when I ate a bar, I had a really hard time swallowing it. It seemed like it wouldn't break down in my mouth and ended up getting caught in my throat. I had to drink quite a bit of water to make it go down. Not a pleasant experience, to say the least. Then, as others have pointed out, the print on the box is extremely hard to read. When I tried to read the nutrition facts, I got an instant headache while trying to make the words out.<br /><br />A disappointing product overall and I wouldn't recommend it.

review/summary: A good snack, but not a great one
review/text: I generally like Kashi stuff, and love banana bread- so I thought I would give this a try.  The Banana Chocolate Chip bars are not strongly favored of banana (its pretty subtle) nor are there many chocolate chips (which helps keep the calories to a reasonable 140 per bar, with only 3 grams of total fat).<br /><br />The package is correct in that they are "soft and chewy" but they are also a bit dry.  I had mine with coffee, which seemed to complement each other.  Without something to drink, you will find these a bit too dry I think.<br /><br />Ingredient Check:  the reason the banana flavor is so subtle is that the first ingredient listed is "apple puree concentrate".  The second is seven grain flour (which gives it the dryer texture and slightly nutty taste).  Then pumpkin.  Then "evaporated cane juice invert syrup" aka sugar.  Then vegetable glycerin.  Finally banana puree makes an appearance.  So first in name, but clearly not in the ingredients.<br /><br />On the plus side, 1/2 serving of fruit and of veggies per bar each doesn't hurt.  And the 4 grams of Fiber per bar is 17% of the total daily value, which is outstanding.<br /><br />On the negative side, these aren't organic ("all natural" doesn't really mean anything), and do appear to have quite a few potential allergens.  Those sensitive to the following should take notice: wheat, milk, soy, egg, PEANUT and ALMOND and may contain other tree nuts (emphasis added- you wouldn't expect this from the general product description and nut allergies are not to be messed with).<br /><br />In summary, while I liked these as a snack with coffee (especially at the Amazon price) the banana flavor was pretty subtle, chocolate chips rather spare and the texture was a bit dry.  But the calorie, fat and fiber profiles were quite good for a snack.  As a healthy snack I liked them, but did not love them.

review/summary: Not bad, not great
review/text: If I was basing this review on just the first bite, you'd see a lower rating from me.  My first impression was that this is really dry.  But as I finished the rest of the bar I could appreciate the sweetness and the small bits of crunch - most likely the chocolate chips - and it didn't seem nearly as dry.  Although for something called Banana Chocolate Chip, you really don't get the taste of either.<br /><br />The � serving of fruit comes from apples and bananas.  Most of the sweetness seems to be from the apples.  The � serving of veggies comes from pumpkin.  That is probably the most dominant taste - although it's somewhat similar to ginger.  Not bad tasting, but not great either.<br /><br />7 whole grains, 4 grams of fiber and naturally sweetened.  Not a bad choice for a somewhat healthier afternoon bar snack that gives you a full feeling.<br /><br />I really have to take umbrage with the packaging, especially the Nutrition Facts.  White type on a gold background is incredibly difficult to read.  I have trouble reading the long list of ingredients, even with my glasses on.  The fact that the ingredients list is so long might take away from the healthy aspect of the product.<br /><br />The price of $18.20 for 4 boxes with 5 per box makes each bar .91, so the price isn't bad.  I'll definitely be finishing the box.  Not sure yet about a future purchase.  Maybe after I get out a magnifying glass and read all of the ingredients.

I don't know any other way to describe it other than rather than blending in it makes itself known in the after taste. This will not keep me from buying more, because if you're having a sugar craving, this is a helpful option that will satisfy the urge without breaking the calorie bank.

review/summary: Yuck but does have merits too
review/text: If you've tried the natural energy bars,you might be familiar with the flavor and textures you'll experience with this bar.<br /><br />If you aren't...expect a dense, soft but dry texture.  There's the off flavor of something designated as "health food" that is commercially produced.  Banana flavor?  I didn't detect any.  Same with the chocolate.  I did, however, notice the pumpkin flavor.  Besides the dense, dry texture, there is both crunchy and chocolate chips that do add some badly needed relief for your mouth.  It's pretty bland, which might be why it is considered "kid friendly."  It does have an overall sweet taste but it isn't overwhelmingly sweet.<br /><br />As for the package...they chose yellow and white for the predominate colors.  I have poor eyesight up close, and was completely incapable of reading the labeling due to the lack of color contrast, even with my glasses.  Standing in a grocery store aisle, that's enough alone to get me to give up on trying a new product.  The nutritional information was actually printed in white on the yellow side of the package, and was totally illegible even in the larger letters to me.  I could not read ingredients or the nutritional information at all.<br /><br />For pure snacking pleasure, this is a loser.  If you want something that isn't chock full of refined sugars to stick in your backpack for a hike...this might be the ticket.  Just make sure your canteen isn't empty because you will need water to wash this down.  It does have the advantages of extended shelf life and single unit packaging that makes it portable.  For snacking without a ride in a backpack, I'd stick to a healthy homemade bar.<br /><br />I'm not likely to buy this for snacking at home.  Despite its less-than-wonderful flavor, I might actually buy it for a portable snack when I know I will need complex carbohydrates because it isn't ridiculously full of preservatives, sugar and fat.  I suspect, between the heavy texture and the water you'd need to wash it down with, it is a snack that would keep hunger at bay for a while.

review/summary: This tuna is terrific!!!
review/text: The Starkist Chunk Light Tuna packed in *oil* has a superior, fresh flavor, not greasy, with just the right amount of salt.  The texture is firm and, unlike canned tuna, there is actually tuna in this pouch.  A 7-oz pouch of tuna has more tuna than two 6-ounce cans (which are about half water or oil).  I highly recommend you try this.

review/summary: best tuna ever
review/text: This tuna is (without any close competition) The Best I've ever eaten. I used to love albacore packed in spring water, but now that tastes absolutely tasteless & dry compared to this one. So, even though this one is chunk light, it's not heavy tasting at all. I can't stand regular canned chunk light, since it tastes way too strong. And this one is also not greasy tasting at all. I've also tried the water pack pouches, but they're harder & drier in texture & not nearly as soft & delicious as the oil pack. I used to be able to find both large & small oil packs in my local supermarket, but now they sell only the small ones. So, I was thrilled to find the large ones here on Amazon. I will buy it . . . forever. Many thanks!!

review/summary: You won't go back to canned!
review/text: The Starkist Tuna in oil in the pouch is far superior to canned tune!  No fussy, messy draining.  No metal taste from being in can too long.  Lovely cuts of tuna and, though I've been buying exclusively in the pouch now for years, virtually never a bone to be found!! (Literally I've only found one little bone ever.)<br />Great eaten as is, or mixed in tuna salad, tuna melt, etc. You have to try it!

review/text: The product is great. The tuna has great taste and is delicious.<br /><br />it took 22 days to get my order and surprise surprise the box only had 11 puches (instead of the 12).<br /><br />I called  Customer Service and after 20 min of explanantion tey told me to go online and return the box to get another one. because this item is considered "food" it's not returnable.<br /><br />Bottom line the product is great but in this case the Amazon service was pretty low,

review/summary: 1/2 of the shelf life was gone upon arrival!
review/text: I haven't tried the product yet, but regardless of that experience, I think it's pure BS that when I checked the date code, I found out that the product I was shipped was half-way through it's shelf life!  Give me a break!  So in my view, I paid full price but received half the value expected, since I had intended this for my earthquake food supply.  Not a huge deal, since I'll use it, but I had intended to keep it for 12 months before use.  I suspect that the expiration date is just a suggestion, and that the product will last much longer, but why not ship products that are fresh to begin with?

review/text: Waffle Crisp has been my favorite cereal since I was 12 or so the first time I tasted it. Now I'm 24 and I still totally live it. I can't find it sold anywhere in my area, which frustrates me, so I have purchased it here on Amazon to be delivered to my house every three months, which is already not enough. It was my first purchase from amazon and I'm not a internet buyer, so if that tells you anything...

review/summary: Best cereal ever!  Thank you, Amazon!
review/text: I'm not sure how many grocery stores carry Waffle Crisp anymore - all I know is that I can't find any stores in Los Angeles that do.  I used to be able to go to my local Ralphs and find it amongst the inferior cereals.  But over the past year, it started disappearing.  I was worried that Post had discontinued it.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue!  I can now enjoy the greatest cereal ever invented anytime I choose.  For those of you who have never had Waffle Crisp, you are missing out.  Think of the most delicious waffle swimming in maple syrup and butter...and imagine it in a bowl.  That is exactly what it is like eating Waffle Crisp.  I brought a box to my office and now everyone is addicted.<br /><br />Sure, it isn't healthy.  But that's not why you're eating Waffle Crisp or any other sweetened cereal.  You are eating it for the unparalleled delicious taste experience.  Try Waffle Crisp - you will not regret it.

review/summary: Post Waffle Crisp
review/text: I don't know about other areas, but in New York, I cannot find this cereal on the shelves. It was taken off a couple of years ago where I live. At subscribe and save price, I pay $4.04 per box. Normally, I wouldn't pay that amount for cereal in the grocery store. However, my thirteen year old absolutely loves it. Good quality packaging for cereal. The subscription came boxed quite well. No dented boxes, none broken open. Prompt shipping as well. This is my third order of this, I continue to buy it every three or four months. It is quite sugary. In between orders we usually get wheaties to recover from the sugar overdose. It tastes A LOT better than the Eggo waffle cereal. Very glad that Amazon carries this and hope they continue to do so.

review/summary: I love this cereal but it's hard to swallow
review/text: I love the syrupy taste and I just love this, in general. If you like really sweet cereals and sugary cereals then I'd buy this. It does taste like waffles in the same sense that a toaster strudel tastes like an actual strudel or the way Cookie Crisp tastes like cookies. Cereal lovers will understand.<br /><br />I'm an adult, though. I wouldn't want my kid to eat this every day because of the sugar content but a box a week would be reasonable, I think, between a couple of kids.<br /><br />The reason I knock off a star is because the cereal is so hard. Literally, the little waffles are hard and it can make the roof of your mouth sore from eating it. Let it sit in the milk a little bit before you gobble it up or you'll hurt your mouth. It really happened lol.

review/summary: Ok it REALLY is the best Cereal ever Made.
review/text: Cereal god George Post (ok thats a totally made-up name) broke the mold when he created this cereal. This cereal is good enough to eat right out of the box...no milk, just grab and go. Each little waffle packs a consistency that gives it that right amount of crisp with every bite. And the taste..........its like waffles that have been soaking in maple syrup overnight. It has that satisfying taste after each bowl...not like ("ughhh i'm eating ceresl to stay healthy" but...." omg this is so good....I must stop. But it also is not like lucky charms or frosted Mini Wheats and inundated in sugar for no reason. The cereal was formulated with Purpose, not mindless sugar. And its good for you! Fortified with 10 essential Vitamins and minerals- lots of calcium and its MULTIGRAIN!!

review/text: This cereal hasn't been sold in stores for years because I haven't seen it anywhere anymore and figured it would be gone forever. Not until recently did it occur to me that, hmm..it might be sold online if they still make it. Well it was! I found it on amazon and bought it for 16.37, a great price for 4 boxes, because if I was to buy it now individually in stores, it would be well over 4 dollars, probably closer to 5.29 or something. Point is, I bought it and was immediately brought back to my childhood days when my dad would buy this for my brother and I. I loooooooove this cereal, it is by far the best and well worth the money. Can't beat the price, can't beat the taste. Tastes just as I remembered years ago. Definitely a great buy for the cereal lovers in a family. Even people who swear they don't like cereal like this kind. Definite recommend! This is my childhood in a box!
