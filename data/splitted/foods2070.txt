review/summary: Great flavor, good product
review/text: I was really surprised, I initially tried this product because my usual coffee was out of stock. The flavor is deep and full without being bitter, which can happen with some of the darker roasts. This has quickly become our family's favorite coffee choice and I haven't gone back to my previous preference. A very good morning wake up call. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who prefers lighter roasts.

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: I ordered this coffee for my Keurig brewer and I was very disappointed with the flavor.  It was very bitter and acrid.  I like strong coffee--but this was just unpleasant to drink.  I ordered 2 cases and we managed to finish off one of them... I'm giving the second one away as I can't bear to drink another sip of it.  It tastes like burned rubber.  Blech!  I can not recommend this product.

review/text: Since I got my Keurig about 6 months ago I've been trying different coffees to see which I like best.<br /><br />So far, this is the worst.  It's thin and tasteless.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I usually make the 10 ounce mug.  But with this item the results were dreadful.<br /><br />Now I make a 6oz cup and it's STILL bad.<br /><br />I don't understand why others seem to like this coffee.  Did I get a bad batch?  I don't know.<br /><br />For comparison, I like Cafejo Adrenaline Explosion for my Senseo.  So far I haven't found it for the Keurig.

review/summary: Coffee People pods are the best
review/text: Black Tiger is my favorite coffee pod. First, it is delicious coffee. Second coffee people pods are the only pods I have seen where you get some crema, or the creamy looking froth that high pressure brewing can get. This is the sign of a well brewed cup and something that drip cannot duplicate. I used to mix up my pods but after trying the Black Tiger I have 4-5 boxes and unused pods that will never be used. The other Coffee People pods also get some crema.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for.
review/text: To begin, disregard the low ratings for this item given by other reviewers. 1: they are not reflective of the coffee as a product, and 2: the issue was obviously a market-wide increase in price as I cannot find any site or retailer that sells them for the prices they claim.<br /><br />As far as the coffee, I am very pleased with it. I can be very picky with my coffee and took a gamble by ordering this specifically instead of a variety pack, luckily I was not disappointed. It tastes distinctly of coffee without being harsh, even when there is plenty of cream and sugar. A common problem I have with stronger coffees is an acidic aftertaste that persists unless I eat something or try to wash it down, but  I have not had any issues with this and I am nearly through my first pack.<br /><br />I can't speak for other blends from Coffee People, but I honestly can't see myself wanting to. Black Tiger is absolutely delicious and just what I like in the morning or when I come home from work. Very satisfied.

review/text: The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast is by far the best K-Cup I have tried.  I have had my Keurig brewer for about a year now and I have bounced around from brand to brand sampling the different coffees to find one that really speaks to me.  The Black Tiger may be that coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't want it to be bitter or taste burned.  The Black Tiger has no bitterness or over-roasted taste to it.  It is very smooth and full bodied.  I have also tried the Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and this coffee is far superior in texture, body, flavor, and strength.  I keep 3-4 different types of K-Cups near my brewer and ever since I bought the Black Tiger it is the only coffee I have drank!

review/text: After being a Starbucks drinker for the past 20 years at least, the Kcup has won me over, especially Green Mountain coffees and blends like Black Tiger.  None of this coffee is ever bitter or acidic like Starbucks.  It's strong but as it's perfectly measured you never get that "put too much coffee or too little water" feeling.  It was interesting to see a CNBC special on Green Mountain, which also makes the Keurig brewers; they said the makers are sold literally at cost and they make their money off of the coffee.  Starbucks is now selling Kcups...for over a buck each!!  I say drop the Star and save some Bucks!

review/summary: disappointing
review/text: You may be wondering what is disappointing about a four star coffee.... This is a better than average brew, reasonably strong while not bitter (so no robusto beans), but the flavour, if "intense," it is not particularly rich. If you love Timothy's Rainforest Espresso & Parisian Nights, this coffee is not in the same league. It is similar to Green Mountain's bold roasts.

It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one.

review/text: I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy, what mistake-- it was VERY bitter and I was stuck with two boxes of it!  If you like your coffee with a bite then go for it.  This is bitter even at the mug setting. If you like your coffee smooth avoid this like the plague! After two months of trying to use this up, I'm finally finished with it. I was the only one in my family that would go near it-- it was like swallowing a bitter pill every day.  Never again! I thought I should warn those out there from being swayed by bitter-coffee lovers.<br />David

I've since ordered him the Timothy's Columbian and he likes it even better - a bit smoother and more mellow taste, but not weak.  My preferences lean toward flavored blends.

review/text: I drink my coffee black and prefer the bolder, stronger k-cups.  I don't like the french roasts or the other dark roasts, but I do like my coffee strong.  After having tried many different extra bolds, Coffee People's Black Tiger and Gloria Jean's Black Gold have become my favorites.  I alternate between the two of them and sprinkle in Green Mountain's Sumatran Reserve now and then which is also very good.

Tastes differ so if you like a strong, dark coffee, try it - it may be just the one for you.

review/summary: Yeah !!
review/text: *THIS* is the stuff right here!<br /><br />I had been going through a ton of K-CUP varieties trying to find a really good, strong coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee-snob and most of the K-CUPs I tried just left me saying "Meh... It's 'ok'. Not terrible, not great just 'ok'."<br /><br />Even the K-CUPs marked 'extra-bold' left me wondering who decided this coffee was even deserving of the name "slightly bold", let alone "extra bold". I usually found myself using 2 K-CUPS, and running the small cup size twice just to get 1 decent cup of coffee - and even then the flavor just wasn't quite "there" (to me, they always taste "old", as if someone ground halfway-decent beans but then left it out open and exposed to the air overnight to spoil.)<br /><br />.. and then I picked up some Black Tiger.. Yeah!!! This is the *only* K-CUP I've found so far where I can choose the 12 oz brewing size and still get decent cup of coffee that doesn't taste like someone rinsed out my cup and served me hot water instead of coffee.<br /><br />Now even as such, this coffee is *still* not nearly as good as the cup of coffee that I can get with my good old french press using coffee that was roasted 2 days ago and ground 2 minutes ago. Sorry, ain't no way a K-CUP is going to get you that level of coffee. Ever.<br /><br />However, this variety is still darn good for a K-CUP and definitely deserving of my morning cup of coffee! (coming from me, that's saying *alot*!)

review/text: Tiger Black is certainly a decent coffee with a bold flavor that will definitely perk up your day. I've just found that it's not to my personal taste; I don't like dark roasts as much as mediums, such as another flavor by Coffee People called Donut Shop. This is because the dark roast flavor overpowers the cream I use, while the Donut Shop is a good balance that I will gladly have every day.<br /><br />Don't let that discourage you: if you like dark roasts, this one may yet become one of your favorites.

review/text: This is probably the best coffee made for the Keurig single serve brewer. Bold statement, I know, but this is one bold coffee that stands apart from the mediocre "Green Mountain" blends that Keurig offers. This is a strong, in your face, wake you up, no holds barred coffee that I wish they made available in whole bean bags (or even pre-ground, it's that good) just so I could take it with me for when I didn't have my Keurig. The only downside is that it can get a little expensive, especially with how addictive it is to drink.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this coffee for anybody that like to flower up their morning brew with sugar, cream, sweeteners, or heaven forbid those awful flavored creamers.<br /><br />If you like good coffee, drink this and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Written while sipping a cup of Black Tiger coffee.

review/text: This coffee is burnt tasting.  Like burnt toast.  The burnt taste overpowers the other flavors that may be there.  Not much coffee flavor detectable, reminds me of and old fashioned large percolator, after several hours, only more burnt tasting.  I have not had this problem with any other K-cups.  This one, Black Tiger, stands out as the worst tasting.  Adding milk added will not mask the overwhelming sour, bitter and chalky flavors.  I have tried it several times over the past 2 years, so I think I have sampled a few representative "batches."  My wife, who prefers the darkest roasted coffees, consistently complains about the taste, and drinks it only as a last resort.  She drinks a lot of coffee, and I see her point.<br /><br />Try any other brand, Donut Shop, Dark Magic, French Roast, any other brand is much more drinkable.  Maybe some folks appreciate the burnt taste.  If you like the taste of burnt toast, then you might like "Black Tiger."

review/text: This used to be the only cat food my 2 cats would eat.  I ordered this from Amazon, because I was having trouble finding it in the supermarket.  Harmony must have changed the ingredients.  Now my cats won't eat it.  I would check with harmony to see what has changed before ordering this.  The old cans had a goldtone top, and that is the formula my cats loved.  The new cans which I am convinced has been changed, has a silvertone top.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: Onion Sprouts Are Fussy
review/text: I've found that Onion Sprouts are one of the fussiest to grow....no matter Who's seed you buy...mainly because they take AT LEAST two weeks to reach proper eating size...as well as they tend to hold onto the seed hull but its not going to hurt you to eat them.<br /><br />I normally soak for about 6-8 hours then drain. What I DON'T do is always rinse them every day...it really depends on how much moisture I still see in the sprouter..if I see beads of moisture I might skip a day. Then the next day I will give them a 5 or 10 minute soak instead of a quick rinse.<br /><br />The flavor of them is worth the time and effort.

review/summary: Big disappointment
review/text: I'm an old hand at growing my own sprouts. But for some reason I can not get onion sprouts to grow well. It's not just this brand ( although I had hoped this one would grow for me ) it's all brands of onion sprouts. I have even soaked the seeds over night. After several tries I have given up. Unless you have some magic formula, or extra green thumb - save your money and go for a different sprouting seed.

review/summary: Product expires in a month and a half
review/text: I haven't tasted the product yet, so I can't comment on that. I just received the order today, having had it shipped to me to Canada through a third party (MyUS.com)and the expiry date on the product is Oct 21 2012. Ridiculous! I think one should be able to see the expiry date of the product before ordering. I ordered these for backpacking and portaging trips, so I may not even have a need for them before the expiry date. I'm glad I only ordered one package of six instead of ordering more like I had the intention of doing.<br /><br />The size of the individual packages is great. Each has 70.87 grams. Serving size is 7g so there are 10 servings per package. A package can be consumed by one person if they want a really big serving, or more reasonably split between two people. Each 7g serving has 30 calories, 2g of fat, 5mg of cholesterol, 190mg of sodium, and 3g of protein.

review/text: Listen, if you want bacon that taste the old fashion way, this is the one for you. I know bacon, my dad cured his own bacon and sausage in his smoke house in the 1950s and 60s. I like to eat foods that taste the way it suppose to taste. No bland tasting food for me, thank you! Amazon did a good job finding this brand. You can use this for any purpose as you use store bought regular bacon, but this bacon has more flavor.

review/summary: Not bad, but too much chocolate and not dark enough
review/text: Really 3.5 stars would have been more fair.  I ordered these along with the same brand milk chocolate beans.  Both bags suffer from a high chocolate to bean ratio (personal preference, but I like a thinner coat of chocolate), but the dark chocolate beans are also a little hard to distinguish from the milk.  The milk chocolate is decent and not-too-sweet, but these dark chocolate beans could use a higher cacao content to differentiate them in my opinion.<br /><br />That said, these bulk bags are a great deal and a handful works wonders for waking up in the morning.

review/text: This is a flavorful pouch of baby food. It tastes better than Sprout's pasta with lentil bolognese, that had no flavor. If you eat bland and boring food at home then your baby probably won't like this pouch of red lentils.  We eat all types of foods in my house ("ethnic" as the other reviewer describes, and American) so this was naturally a hit for my babies. I would go so far as to say that the red lentils taste authentic, just without the hot spice factor.  I also like that it is a large portion of food (5.5 ounces).

review/summary: Too sophisticated for simple palates
review/text: I was excited to have some new flavor options for textured baby foods, but this one didn't deliver. The flavor combination was not favorable at all to my 11 month old. Perhaps I was too zealous on introducing her to ethnic type foods at her age. I'm not sure I know many children who would favor such a flavor combo and it didn't even smell very appealing to me! Perhaps we are just picky eaters in our home, but this was not preferred by us. I would recommend buying one pouch as I did to try it before investing in a case of them.

review/summary: Received out of date product...
review/text: I received my Kraft Grey Poupon Bistro Sauce and it was already out of date. I called the manufacturer to find out what the date code meant...and it seems that the product that I received was already out of date by 3 months.<br /><br />Date code on my Bistro Sause was 07M2402 meaning 07 is July, and 24 is the day of the month, and 02 indicates 12 for 2012...so again my product was best by July 24, 2012 and as I write this, it's October 22, 2012. I've had the product since the 10/21/2012...yesterday.<br /><br />The product, itself didn't taste as I remembered when we had it at our local restaurant.  But, that's probably because it's old. Kraft customer service told me to return it and not to use it.<br /><br />Here's the date code so that you can figure out your best by date.<br /><br />07M2402 is July 24, 2012 (QUICK REFERENCE)<br /><br />So, mine is going back.

review/summary: More to it than expected
review/text: Because this product is a food service product, I expected a simple chain restaurant style sauce.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and bite of the flavor.  No specific flavor overwhelms, but it still has a nice strong flavor, with a hint of both horseradish and garlic - with the garlic having a tiny bit of raw garlic bite.<br /><br />This is certainly thick enough to be a fine dipping sauce, but thin enough to be easily spreadable on sandwiches and would nicely incorporate into a salad dressing.  This is mostly smooth and creamy, but with very small pieces of mustard seed and possibly garlic and onion.  It seems somewhat reminiscent of a country style mustard/thousand island dressing/french fry sauce mixture, but much tastier than that sounds.<br /><br />The best thing it has going for it (hence the 5 stars), is that along with its great taste, there really is nothing else on the market like this. It is quite unique.<br /><br />I have eaten this on chicken sandwiches, but think it would be excellent with most meats - including seafood, any fried food, most vegetables and excellent on most vegetable salads.  I also think that mixed with honey or jelly, it would make a wonderful glaze for chicken and pork (maybe with some ginger added to the pork).  I am also tempted to mix this with maybe some honey, lemon juice and cream cheese as a dip for fruit.
