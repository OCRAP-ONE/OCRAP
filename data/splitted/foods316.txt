review/text: I love the taste of Pour Over Movie Theater Butter Popcorn from Orville Redenbacher. I have found it tough to find in my local grocery stores so it's nice to be able to find it on Amazon. It always arrives in a timely fashion and in good shape. Please don't ever run out of it.

The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to "dust" all my sugar cookies! Thank you!

review/summary: What a mistake!
review/text: After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib.

review/summary: I haven't had licorice in 20 years!
review/text: I recall fondly those days as 10 year old eating Twizzlers black licorice with my grandmother until they changed the recipe, removing molasses. It became too disgusting for words. It was the only time in my tween years that I wrote to a company to complain. Y&S Candies sent me back a letter saying that molasses had become too expensive and was no longer being used in the licorice, but they included coupons for spaghetti sauce as an appeasement. Inexplicable. In any case, my licorice consumption declined. A few years later, I developed a horrid gluten intolerance, and my licorice days were over for good.<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />After nearly 20 years without licorice (OK! I admit I would steal an occasional nibble...), I was shocked, SHOCKED to find Candy Tree Gluten-free licorice, and best of all, it's pretty darn tasty! I blame Candy Tree for restarting my sugar addiction, but I just can't stop eating it. I highly recommend this product. I like the licorice twists the best, but the ropes are good, too. Give it a shot!! And thank you, Candy Tree, for giving me something I truly missed.

review/text: I was hoping it would be softer but it's pretty hard to chew.  There isn't much flavor at all.  In fact, I can get more flavor with any licorice at the supermarket.  I've bought many types of organic and specialty licorice and this was the blandest I've ever had...hardly any flavor at all.  For the price I won't be repurchasing.  Disappointed.

review/summary: Hard with Strong Molasses Flavor
review/text: I am gluten free and was craving soft black licorice that tasted like Twizzlers black licorice but was gluten free.  Candy Tree Organic Licorice does NOT taste like Twizzlers black licorice, and it is much harder to chew.  This black licorice has a strong molasses flavor that I am just not into, but I guess if you like your black licorice to be rather hard and taste strongly of molasses, then this may be the licorice for you.

review/summary: a great appetizer
review/text: My cats love it.  It is a bit overpriced though.  And I don't like the epackaging claim that it is made of rice paper.  Now, that sounds all so nice and eco friendly, but the truth is, it is plastic.  Perhaps the outer packaging is layered with rice paper for effect.  This doesn't change the fact that I am stuck with plastic packaging that is not biodegradable, and possible leaching of chemicals into the product.  Nonetheless, I concede convenience of plastic packaging and some inevitability of its use, especially in shipping.  Just, let's not make a misleading claim to give off a wrong impression.

review/summary: Good, but be aware of expiration dates!
review/text: I just received this package of four-- September 2012. All four canisters had an expiration date of November 2012! My husband and I should be able to drink all of it prior to the expiration date-- but really, a little over one month is not a lot of time to finish four canisters of coffee.<br /><br />Also, packaging-wise the product arrived covered with coffee powder, wrapped in plastic. At first I thought that one of the canisters had opened during shipping, but all of the foils were intact, so I have no idea where all the coffee powder came from.<br /><br />Outside of that, the coffee is good, the shipping was super fast, and the cost is better than the grocery stores. If you know you'll drink it fast (or you're not too militant about expiration dates), it's a good deal.

review/text: First of all, nobody told me this cereal was getting discontinued in the stores. Big mistake. I almost went Fruit Brute in my city chasing cars and stealing babies. I don't know who came up with the horrible horrible horrible idea to discontinue selling the physical embodiment of delicious. For the last few weeks I've been eating Cocoa Puffs trying to pretend like everything was okay. Well you know what? It wasn't okay. Eating Cocoa Puffs in place of Count Chocula is like dating a girl that looks sort of like the woman you love. You're only fooling yourself. Count Chocula is the best cereal ever. Period.

And you're probably annoyed at the way that it's no longer stocked on the shelves of your local grocery store.<br /><br />Well, buying this 21st century version of Count Chocula won't bring back the good old days.  This cereal doesn't look the same, it doesn't smell the same and it doesn't taste the same!<br /><br />I remember when I was a kid, opening up a box of Count Chocula and my nostrils would be treated to an overwhelming scent of chocolate goodness.<br /><br />Now, as an adult, I open up this NEW version of Count Chocula and there isn't any chocolate scent at all!!!<br /><br />And this cereal doesn't even LOOK the same!  The marshmallows look different and the crunchy part is coated with some sort of unfamiliar glaze.<br /><br />And the taste is all wrong too.  In the 1970s the cereal was MUCH sweeter!  They've obviously changed the recipe.<br /><br />And back in the 1970s, after eating the cereal the milk in your bowl would be all brown and taste like chocolate.  Basically the old Count Chocula would turn ordinary milk into chocolate milk. Now with this NEW version of Count Chocula, the milk stays white and it just tastes like ordinary milk!<br /><br />It's just not the same.  The thrill of the 1970s Count Chocula is gone.

review/summary: Delicious chips
review/text: These chips are surprisingly delicious.  They have a mix of cashews and nutritional yeast on them - not actual cheese, so they are vegan.  Even my husband who is a meat and potatoes guy thinks these taste good.<br /><br />Each 1oz serving has 100 calories, 4 gram of protein and, and 7 grams of fat.  The bag itself is 2.2 ounces, so there are only 2.2 servings.<br /><br />I like them much more than Brad's Kale chips, which seem more widely available in my area.<br /><br />I would buy Kale Krunch all the time if it was more affordable.  I've been purchasing bags at my local healthfood store for around $6.25.  At the present time, amazon's vendors aren't offering bulk discounts, but maybe that will change!

review/summary: Yummy!  (does not contain actual cheese or dairy)
review/text: We received a bag of these yesterday in a snack gift box sent by my sis in law.<br />I tasted them and they are quite good!  I looked at the ingredients and realized there isn't any actual cheese in them so I figured the nutritional yeast had something to do with the flavor.  I confirmed this after googling "nutritional yeast" and also found that it has a good amount of nutritional value, I loved the fact that the kale chips contain 4 grams of protein per ounce!  I'm always trying to find "other" ways to get protein into my kids since they're allergic to animal milk and I have to bribe them to eat meat!<br />Although these are quite good I'm such a cheapskate that I will probably not be paying that much for this item specially when you can easily find the recipe for cheesy kale online ;)  but then again I'm not much of a kitchen person so I might buy it once in a while if I can find it at a local store.<br />My only question regarding this product is...can nutritional yeast worsen candida?  my 4 yr. old is under candida treatment and after reading random blogs, articles, etc. I still can't figure out if it's an issue for a person with candida, I could not find an actual article backed up by research so if any of you have any information on this subject I would appreciate it if you would comment.

review/summary: not as good as Nespresso's darker capsules
review/text: I have tried a few varieties of these ECC capsules in my CitiZ machine so far and will submit separate reviews under the different product listings over the coming few days.<br /><br />What's common to all of these capsules is that the CitiZ machine is a little more difficult to close when using an ECC capsule versus a Nespresso capsule. Also, before the espresso starts coming out of the machine, the capsule makes a bit of a popping. Both of these issues are addressed on ECC's website, where they try to assure customers that this is normal and should not cause any concern.<br /><br />So, on to this particular variety, the Espressivo.  I'm a little surprised by the other reviews posted so far.  Unless the design of the CitiZ changed drastically, I'm not sure why one of the other reviewers was unable to use the ECC capsule.  As to the flavor, while I agree with the other reviewer so far that it isn't as good as Nespresso's darker roasts, I'm not in agreement that it's nothing more than bad drip coffee.  I actually think the Espressivo ECC capsule tastes okay -- definitely stronger than drip coffee -- and in my CitiZ it produced as much crema as a Nespresso capsule.  Unfortunately, however, the flavor seems kind of "one note" compared to my favorite Nespresso capsules.  Given that the cost of the ECC capsules on Amazon isn't that much less than Nespresso capsules available through the Nespresso club (about a 12% cost savings), one has to factor in the "green" factor of the ECC capsules to help them decide which capsule to choose.  While I personally feel a lot better about being able to compost the ECC capsules, I also want the best possible flavor from my CitiZ -- that's why I bought it instead of a much less expensive espresso machine.  I'm afraid that unless another variety of the ECC capsules is more to my liking, I'll be sticking with the Nespresso capsules.

review/summary: Not a bad alternative
review/text: I bought a package of these when they first came out.  My initial reaction was the price difference did not justify purchasing these.  The capsules work well.  The flavor of the coffee is good but, there is not as much creama as the Nespresso capsules.  With the new lower prices, these are a good alternative to Nespresso, but they are a compromise.  If you want the best flavor and creama, stick with Nespresso but, if you want a cheaper, almost as good altrnative, give them a try.  I really wish they would package several varieties in one "intoductory" package so I could try five varieties without having to buy five fifferent five packs of the same variety.  The descriptions don't give much of a clue as to how the coffe will taste and how strong it is.  If you purchase a five pack and aren't fond of the flavor or intensity, you have a lot of coffee you may not like.  I may try these again although, for now, I'm going to stay with the tried and true (and expensive) Nespresso brand.  Maybe the competition will slow down the frequent price increases from Nespresso.<br />UPDATE:  Prices have come down dramatically on these.  Still not as good as Nespresso originals, but Nespresso's customer service stinks so bad and their prices so high, I'm done buying from them.  These are close and environmentally much friendlier.

review/text: I tried it a few times. First to just try.  Then again to compare against Nespresso Capriccio (green pod) which has an intensity of 5 and is made like the ECC's Expressivo. Arabica and Robusto mix.  The Nespresso Capriccio is not my favorite because it is relatively weak.  Then I tasted the Expressivo, I was amazed how much weaker an espresso can get and to legally call it espresso.  Folger's makes much better coffee and I think Folger's is boring.  I like the environmental friendliness of this company, but it has to make a better tasting product.  This stuff was horrible.  I still have 48 pods to drink.  I guess I will give it away to my environmentalist friends as a gift.<br /><br />So disappointed.

review/summary: Ecopackaging 5 stars, Coffee 3 stars
review/text: An eco-conscious competitor to Nespresso? YAY, I thought, this would be good. And it sort of is.<br /><br />The packaging is great as it gets away from Nestle's use of we-don't-care-about-the-planet metal (aluminum?). Five stars for that.<br /><br />On the other hand, the coffee isn't so great. I bought these without a review and without much information about what type I was buying -- I guess I'm a maverick like that (ha). Although I got them on time, and had apparently purchased an espresso that was considered 4 out of 5 in strength, it really tasted like a 1.5 out of 5 in strength. So, I'm NOT impressed with the coffee -- and I am NOT a coffee expert.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I might try them again if I can find out which espresso is strongest. And, I might try them again because I hate the planet-hating, overpriced monopoly that Nestle has on Nespresso pods... but I gotta say that Nestle's Nespresso pods are tastier.<br /><br />So would some entrepreneur mind doing something about this dilemma?

review/text: I like this and I am switching, although I will continue to buy some Nespresso capsules -- as well as Illy capsules for my Illy machine upstairs.<br /><br />It is hard to predict who will like the ECC coffees and who will not: many things contribute to the experience, and not even just taste, aroma, and looks. I am from Italy, and lived in one of the Italian "coffee capitals" -- Trieste, home of Illy, Hausbrandt, San Giusto, and others.<br />[...]<br /><br />I suggest you try this without bias and with neutral expectations. If yr experience is positive, you are lucky and this coffee will save you money, and the Earth some environmental grief.<br /><br />One suggestion to keep you honest in testing the new coffee: don't just compare the Espressivo and yr choice of Nespresso side by side -- DO A BLIND TEST. With two cups that are exactly alike, the same amount of sugar, if any, try both coffees in sequence. Ask an accomplice to keep track of which cup contains which coffee, and see what the test reveals.

I popped the first capsule into the machine and pulled down the lever and heard the pop of the capsule and soon smelled a very pleasant aroma that immediately reminded me of the Italian coffee shops of Milan.  THe Espressivo had a very strong taste and a smooth finish and gave me just the right lift I was looking for.  I then had a latte the next day and the combination of milk & crema was perfect- I am sold.  The convenience of getting the capsules delivered right to our door (free of charge) is brilliant along with the whole biodegradable capsule which my wife said she would put into our garden is a nice feeling.

review/text: Ethical Coffee seems to be the only alternative to Nespresso available in the US (there's another in Europe). The price differential isn't huge (about 20%), but it adds up with everyday use. Nespresso has about a dozen caffeinated styles to Ethical Coffee's two, so those with discriminating tastes will prefer to pay extra for a more precise flavor profile available from Nespresso. To my taste the Ethical Coffee capsule most resembles the Nespresso Capriccio. The Ethical Coffee capsule seems to be biodegradable, which the Nespresso capsule definitely is not.

review/text: Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules. Taste is what matters, ECC capsules are awful.<br /><br />This goes for Cremoso, Indiad'oro, Espressivo - unfortunately, I bought all three types. Hardly a difference between them, but I listed them in awful to undrinkable order.<br /><br />However, if that's not enough of a reason to avoid, consider these;<br /><br />-they're difficult to insert in Nespresso machines<br />-they're difficult to remove from Nespresso machines<br />-they frequently blister during brewing, thus "brewing" coffee from the side of the capsules<br />-they are stale right out of the package (though the expiration date reads otherwise)<br />-all ten per box are not quite vacuum-sealed in plastic, hence opening the plastic hastens further spoilage<br />-they are only a dime less than real Nespresso capsules!!!<br /><br />I actually threw away unused capsules, they were that bad. They are not worth free. Quite weak for a company started by a former Nespresso executive. Perhaps they have a serious quality control issue in the U.S.?

review/text: Terrible!  Not only do they cause me to have to jam the lever down just to seat the capsule, but it feels like I'm taking hours of life away from my machine. And the espresso is terrible. Very, very weak, almost like TEA, and the flavor is horrible. I bought this flavor and another and I ended up throwing them away. It's not drinkable and it ruins my machine. Why bother?  Nespresso's prices are not that bad, delivery is FAST and relatively cheap, and you know what you're getting.

review/text: Pleasantly surprised! The coffee is pretty good, and you can't beat the price! I live in Hawaii, and shipping from nespresso is $12! That's crazy! Even when they have free shipping offers, it doesn't apply to Hawaii, so I'm glad to have another option in the Ethical Coffee Company. Also love that these capsules are "green"! Thank you!!

review/summary: Dysfunctional Pods
review/text: I purchased these pods to try with my Nespresso CitiZ. The flavor is decent, though less creamy than Nespresso, which I expected. The main problem is that the pods themselves don't function well in the machine. They get stuck and I have to use needle-nose pliers to pry them out of the machine. Additionally, the water isn't able to fully penetrate the pod and through the paper cover, so the espresso flows nicely for the first 5 seconds...then slows to a drip. After extracting the pods with the pliers, I can clearly see the center of the cover of the pod is not wet. On the Lungo setting, it takes 3 pods to generate the same quantity of coffee 1 original Nespresso pod creates.<br /><br />I do not recommend using these pods with the Nespresso CitiZ. If you decide to try, order just one unit of 5 boxes and give it a try - because they are not returnable, even if unopened and in the airtight packaging. I'm now stuck with 100 extra pods that will go to waste. Learn from my mistake!

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I bought all five of the different types of Ethical coffee capsules made for Nespresso machines.  Unfortunately,<br /><br />1. Coffee flavor-marginal-not great<br />2. Quantity of Coffee-less in capsule than in Nespresso capsule<br />3. We have a brand new Nespresso Pixie. These capsules continue to get jammed in the machine and we have to reach in, struggle with the capsule to pry it loose before we can make another coffee.<br />4. Since 10 capsules are packaged in one plastic sleeve, the moment we open the sleeve, air comes into contact with the remaining capsules minimizing their freshness.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the espresso coffee is not worth the lower cost to purchase these capsules.

review/summary: pods get stuck
review/text: I purchased these pods for my nespresso machine to save a little money but I actually lost money. I tried using the pod. At first only water came out and then only a little bit of espresso came out. The lever was hard to close when i did put the pod in there. When I lifted the lever to release the pod, the pod was stuck in the machine. I want to return it but that is not an option. So now I have 49 pods that I cannot even use. I wish I could just return these.

review/summary: Officially the worst.
review/text: Simply terrible.  Awful.  I've never tasted a worse espresso in my life.<br /><br />ECC Espressivo vs. Nespresso Roma vs. Nespresso Ristretto ... I expected to write a detailed taste review after pulling each of these shots this morning, comparing the flavor profiles and nuances side-by-side.  But after tasting the ECC Espressivo, I realized that any comparisons to the Nespresso pods would be completely worthless.  The Espressivo is so horrible, it's a huge disappointment that shouldn't even exist.  To call it "gas station coffee" would be an upgrade.<br /><br />About a 1/3 of the way through the Espressivo pull, I noticed that the stream was quite watery and blonde.  At first, the crema appeared similar to the Nespresso pods ... but then, just 1 minute later, the Espressivo's crema had all but disappeared (while the Roma/Ristretto crema was unchanged).  Translation: It's not really espresso.<br /><br />I love the lower price.  I love the biodegradable aspect.  I love that a non-Nespresso pod option exists.  I was so excited about this ECC pod, but I couldn't be more disappointed.  The taste was so terrible that I can't even give it an extra star for price/eco-friendliness.<br /><br />If you're looking for your Nespresso machine to give you bitter and watery swill like it came from a Senseo machine, this Espressivo is the pod that you've been dreaming about.  On the other hand, if you bought your Nespresso machine to produce good quality espresso, please stay FAR, FAR AWAY from this product.

review/text: I liked the idea of having an alternative source of "pods" for my Nespresso machine. Unfortunately this is not fulfilling its promises. After making coffee with these alternative pods, the pods stay stuck in the machine and you need pliers to take them out, not convenient at all especially in the morning when I am barely awake.<br />What is worse is that you can't return the pods to Amazon so essentially you will throw away 25 or more dollars, and that's bad.

review/summary: Z-Bones Natural Dog Dental Chews - Great Dog Chews!
review/text: The Z-Bones Dental Chews are great!  I was looking for a dental chew that both of my dogs would like, in addition to being a healthy and effective chew.  I have a Sheltie and a Chihuahua (they make a funny couple), and while they are not super chewers like Labs, they do like to chew (including the Chihuahua surprisingly!).  Well, both dogs loved these chews.  They liked the smell and couldn't wait for me to open the re-sealable plastic bag, which was inside the box, keeping them fresh.  Both dogs got right down to chewing the bones and the Sheltie finished his in one sitting, while the Chihuahua almost did!  Even the piece of the Z-Bone that was left (about a 1/3) was finished by the Chihuahua in a couple of days.  It was also nice that the Z-Bone lasted quite a while for both dogs, rather than disappearing in just a few minutes.  I just thought I would share my experience with other dog owners, since I have appreciated the feedback provided by others on different products, which has resulted in great purchases, helping me to avoid poor choices and saving me money.  Thanks!

The reason I get these particular bones is because Cody has Lymphoma and is on what is called a 'cancer diet', which one of the main problems in finding a treat that is compatible for this diet is finding one that is grain free and thankfully Zuke's supplies a no grain treat for my pet that also helps his teeth, wonderful product, and most of all he LOVES them.

review/summary: Heavy Chewer is very happy!
review/text: Today was the first day we gave our 5 month old puppy one of these. She LOVED it! It was like giving a baby a bottle, she just laid with it for a 1hr/20mins (yes we time treats here for longevity, Maggie is a heavy chewer haha) and was in heaven. Would definitely recommend. A lot of her 'big' treats dont last more then 5/10 mins, so I was not expecting anything much longer,  these were a great surprise. I know she's a little young for them per packaging rules but I took the chance because she tries to eat crazier non-edible objects then these. My only gripe is the price is a little high per bone BUT they are made from great ingredients and last awhile. I have tried many Zuke's products over the years and have always been very happy. I will keep ordering them for sure.<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::::: Okay, shes figured them out and only last about 15 mins but they are still great!

review/summary: The best balsamic I've ever used
review/text: Balsamic is my favorite vinegar.  I use it to make dressings, add it to deviled eggs, glazes, and sauces.  It's a staple in many dishes.  Generic, inexpensive balsamic is okay to use for some purposes, but gourmet balsamic is best for reductions.  I tried using an inferior vinegar to make a reduction sauce as a dessert, and it didn't turn out.  Fattoria not only gives a stronger flavor to salad dressings, but reductions taste rich and sweet.

review/text: Fattoria Estense's silver label balsamic vinegar has been my (Italian-American) family's go-to brand for years.  We love how it brings out the flavor of so many different foods, from vegetables to meats to strawberries.  This product is nothing like the so-called "balsamic vinegar" sold in supermarkets.  Fattoria Estense silver label is slightly syrupy, sweet and sour, full-bodied, and a good value.  It would be nice to have an smaller spout so that pouring can be more precise, but the hanging drop from the neck of the bottle makes finger-licking-good treat for the pourer!  With Fattoria Estense silver label, it's easy to forego calorie-laden salad dressings, butter, and such.  Have fun experimenting; you'll be sure to find a new favorite food and balsamico pairing.  Buon appetito!

review/summary: A Delicious Way to Enjoy More Fiber
review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tried Smart Bran. I love its crunchy texture and great flavor, all the more because it is low in sodium and low in sugar without resorting to using Aspartame. The fact that all of the ingredients are organic is a definite health plus. I have been eating Fiber One original (the "twigs") for years because it seemed to be the only really high fiber cereal (14 grams)and was not loaded with sugar in one form or another. It is sweetened with Aspartame, however, contains corn oil, guar gum and a few other less-than-desireable ingredients, and is primarily corn bran. Smart Bran is composed of Oat Bran which has been shown to help reduce high cholesterol. I haven't heard anything about corn bran in that regard. Smart Bran also contains psyllium in a very tasty form & works great for keeping the lower digestive track functioning efficiently. I mix a rounded quarter cup of Smart Bran with fresh fruit and cottage cheese for my breakfast most mornings and find it's a great way to start the day. Buying it through Amazon in a 6 pack saves me more than $1.50 per box over local supermarket prices, and I don't have to worry about it being out of stock.  I highly recommend Smart Bran, and look forward to incorporating it in my baking as well.

review/summary: tastes good and very filling
review/text: It does expand pretty quickly when soaked in milk but it doesn't get soggy soft unless maybe it's soaked for 30 minutes.<br />I love it. It tastes good. Sometimes I also a little bit if the Smart Bran on my yogurt. And it's awesome.

review/summary: So tasty AND so healthy!
review/text: I am always looking for the most fiber bang for my buck - and this cereal wins hands-down. It has a light, crunchy texture and doesn't get soggy in milk. There are no artificial sweeteners but it has a nice natural sweet flavor. It is satisfying and healthy. And - it doesn't give me gas!! Nary an intestinal rumble. Your body will thank you for eating this cereal!

review/summary: great cereal; very satisfying
review/text: The cereal itself is great. It's tasty and filling. However, all six boxes had the same expiration date, which was dated only a month after the order arrived. Most people I know eat a box of cereal a week at most. Two boxes will therefore expire before they are eaten. I'm sure it will still be edible, but it's kind of underhanded to sell a bulk pack of cereal so close to its expiration date. I plan to cancel my subscription.<br /><br />Update: I decided to give the subscription another shot before cancelling. The next shipment arrived with a November 2012 expiration date. Plenty of time to enjoy! This product deserves a full five stars now.

review/summary: works like a charm
review/text: I got this cereal to avoid the extra sugars & GMO grains found in the similar cereals (FiberOne & All Bran e.g.)  It tastes good, has plenty of fiber and "works like a charm."<br /><br />I gave it four stars just 'cause the box only has a bit over 10oz so it seems kinda pricey.

review/summary: If you like fiber...
review/text: This is a cereal I found while on vacation in Seattle but can't find locally. I order it on Amazon in a package of 6 boxes and it is cheaper than it would be at a health food store. I am in my 60's and fiber is my friend and sugar is not! This cereal is high-fiber and low sugar, so I buy it over and over. I use low-fat organic yogurt instead of milk and usually add blueberries or other ripe fruit for a lovely, low calorie, high-fiber breakfast. Good stuff!

review/summary: Daily fiber source
review/text: This isn't the best tasting cereal on the shelves, but when I add a little bit of dried cranberries and some granola, it actually tastes really good.  After dealing with digestion problems for a long time, I've definitely noticed an improvement when I consume about one serving of this every day.  You could say I've come to depend on this cereal as a staple in my diet now.

review/summary: Made me sick. Go figure...
review/text: My doctor recommended that i eat bran cereal since i have had some intestinal  issues the last couple years. So i have been eating all Bran for months and felt great. So i thought I would try  this organic bran in leu of All Bran for two weeks. I thought it would be better for me since it was organic. But I had many intestinal problems with it-nausea, bloating, gas pains... Felt better the day I switched back to All Bran. I have no idea why, but this was the only thing I changed in my diet. The taste is really bland, too.
