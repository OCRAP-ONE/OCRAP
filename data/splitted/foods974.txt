review/summary: Israeli Couscous
review/text: The Roland Original Israeli Couscous was not the same as I have previously ordered. The size of each piece of toasted pasta was half the size of the real "original". Instead of pearl pasta it is closer to standard couscous. I was disappointed with this aspect of my purchase and will look for another manufacturer.

review/summary: My bassett hound LOVES his food now...
review/text: Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try "Canidae". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.

review/summary: Good price for a highly rated dog food
review/text: I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.

review/summary: great dog food at the lowest cost
review/text: I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website.

review/summary: Great choice for the active young dog!
review/text: I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.

review/summary: Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull
review/text: I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).

review/text: We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food.

review/summary: best food out there
review/text: Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains "gas" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.

review/summary: Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
review/text: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.

review/summary: Food for my picky puppy
review/text: I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product.

review/summary: Dog developed GI problems
review/text: Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.

I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.

review/summary: Dog loves it; no tummy problems, but I've eased the transition
review/text: I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget.

review/summary: Great Quality Dog Food
review/text: My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!

review/summary: Excellent for large breed dogs
review/text: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!

review/text: Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!

review/text: I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats.

review/text: I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae.

review/text: I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: Other than for novelty purposes, I really cannot recommend this product.  There is a strong odor of smoked bacon that emanates from the popcorn, but it is has a strong artificial plastic odor to it.  The flavor of bacon really seems to be overwhelmed by a taste of smokiness.  I would think it is more accurate to say smoked popcorn than bacon popcorn. At first I thought it might just be me, but when I shared them with my friends, they took an initial handful for the novelty, and then stopped. The more I tried it, the worse it tasted to the point where the smell was just nauseating.  But I do admit that people get a kick out of receiving it as a gift.

review/text: The theory, "Everything tastes better with bacon," sounds good, but does it ring true? J & D's put the theory to the test, and with their Bacon Pop product, they almost hit the mark. Bacon-flavored popcorn is a fantastic idea, but the bacon flavor in Bacon Pop just doesn't quite pop. It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but the flavor is just a bit too subtle. It smells great when popped, but the taste leaves you wanting more. Fortunately, J & D's provides bacon lovers with other options, and we'll explore one of those soon.

Not to mention, it has versatility. We've added it to our chili recipe, to chicken dishes, and have even been inspired to experiment with spanish cuisine. In comparison to any paprika you could buy at the store, it's night and day. I don't think I'll ever be able to settle for the grocery store bland red power again. I highly recommend this!

review/text: This mac and cheese is a great product, all organic and real food used in it's making...the cheese sauce is to be made separately by mixing the powder with milk or cream while the mac cooks, so it is a bit different from the standard dry-box mac and cheese. This may seem tougher by one step than you are used to, but it is really just a matter of dumping the powder in with the liquid and stirring. This allows the cheese sauce to be made quickly, no cheese lumps, and no added butter or margerine...tastes great!

To up the cheese flavor I don't add the milk to it, just the butter and the cheese powder. I usually leave a bit of the pasta water in it so that there will be enough liquid to make it creamy. My children love it and I don't feel too bad about letting them eat once in a while because it is organic and doesn't contain artificial ingredients or preservatives.

review/summary: The best blue box
review/text: This is the best powdered cheese macaroni I've found. I always add 1 tbsp of unsalted butter to it. I used to buy it at WalMart but they stopped carrying it and it's $3/box at my local grocery store so this is a pretty good deal on Amazon.

review/summary: Household favorite
review/text: My son loves Mac and Cheese, but I certainly didn't want him eating all of the artificial ingredients in some other major brands.  We buy many of Annie's products, and I always make sure to have plenty of these on hand.  I don't have to worry about the chemicals, and it's really good!  It's the closest thing to Kraft Mac and Cheese that I've ever had.  The sauce is a bit watery, but I actually like it better that way.  There's no way I'd ever buy anything else now, and usually the subscribe and save is a better deal than the grocery store.

review/summary: Annie's Macaroni And Cheese
review/text: This macaroni is very good. We usually buy Kraft or Great Value brand of Mac and Cheese. Our friends told us about this so we decided to try it. It is organic pasta and cheese basically. We did notice that it was a lot healthier for you than other brands. I would say it doesn't contain as much content as Kraft does though. It has way few calories and fat. Also, the cheese flavor isn't very strong. You can taste way more noodle than cheese, so sometimes we add just a tablespoon of melted cheese, and if we get the Annie's White Cheddar Pasta, a little organic parmesan cheese sprinkled on top will sure make a difference! Overall, very good product. Will continue to buy.

review/summary: Fair take on an alternative to Kraft box Mac n cheese
review/text: Made the 3rd box of this for dinner and for the second time the macaroni cooked unevenly.  It didn't destroy the meal but it was noticeable.  My wife likes pasta al dente, so when half of them are perfect and the other are over done(at least over to my wife), it either means something is wrong with the cook, or something is wrong with the product.  My wife cooked the first mix matched product and I cooked the the other.  Both of us lived on Mac and cheese in college so we really great at mac and cheese box top instructions.  Again the difference is not huge enough to prevent another purchase.  It just is enough to prevent the preparation of a perfect al dente.  The product flavor was nice and had almost a savory undertone. I recommend this product.  It's decently different in a good way.

review/summary: Good, easy, and with identifiable ingredients!
review/text: Mac and cheese is a popular quick meal with my children, so I like to have some around the house just in case. We've generally gone for the big name brand stuff, or one of the local grocery store brands (which is just as tasty as the big name brand stuff). However, I feel a bit bad about it given the somewhat unidentifiable ingredients on those boxes, so I decided to give this a try, having enjoyed some other Annie's products we've tried. Made the way I tend to always make box macaroni and cheese, it's just as good as the other stuff. (Made by the directions on the box it's not quite as good.) I generally go for 1 tablespoon of butter per box, and enough milk to make a proper sauce, mixed with the cheese mix and noodles at the same time. The only difference my kids noticed were the shape of the noodles, as I prefer to buy the spiral noodle mac and cheese in the other brands. Is it the healthiest thing out there, even in this box? No, but at least this helps me feel a bit better about the occasional box mac and cheese meals the kids get. Ultimately, the only thing that would make this better would be a version with spiral noodles, in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'd recommend that you make it in whatever fashion you're used to making other box mac and cheeses for the best results.

review/text: This macaroni and cheese is very good.  Lately I have not been able to eat my favorite foods, since nothing seems appealing to me, and  thinking about eating anything makes me depressed. I picked up a box of annie's which I have tried in the past, and it it hit the spot. I can eat my whole serving. The flavor of the cheese is very subtle and natural tasting, and doesn't make me feel sick after eating it like other mac and cheese. I think it's because it's all natural, since I usually never eat processed foods, but this is the exception! Thank you Annie's!

review/summary: Not as good as other Annie's products
review/text: Perhaps it's just me but the noodles in the Homegrown Classic Mac & Cheese seems to have a unique flavor - I can't put my finger on it but the closest thing I can think of is a slight cinnamon or even saffron flavor.  I tasted the cheese sauce separately and it had a good, mild cheese flavor.  My 5 year old liked it but did not ask for a second helping like he does with other Annie's products.<br /><br />We just switched from Annie's Gluten-Free Mac & Cheese (which was wonderful for being GF!) but I did not care for the flavor of Annie's Homegrown Classic.  I'm going to go back to Annie's Gluten-Free version even though we're not on a GF diet anymore.

review/summary: Toxic Ingredients?
review/text: I used to buy these in bulk and finally great tired of finding dried glue caked on the elbows in the box.  I've had the same problem with the shells from Annie's.  I contacted the company about this problem 3 times before receiving a brief reply informing me that I had nothing to be worried about and that the glue caked to the pasta in the box was not toxic.  Forgive me if I don't take anyone's word on that, and why would I want to eat glue anyway when I'm paying extra for a healthy alternative.  No thanks.  I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese products now and will remain with these as they have the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes.

It isn't sweet at all, it's bitter and...tastes and smells like wet hay. I gave it away to someone who claims they like it. My advice is to buy one single bottle at your local store. If you like it (and God bless you if you do) then go on Amazon and buy a case of it, because more than likely, it will be a much better deal than your local store. Love Amazon, hate the product.

review/text: These are much, much larger than the Toblerone's I get at Target or local stores.  I prefer the larger size and just break off a piece and eat that piece--I eat less at a time this way compared to buying the smaller one.  This is the exact same taste as you get in the smaller one.  I love it and feel that the chocolate is very good quality.  It seems to me that these larger ones have more honey and almond nougat than the smaller ones but maybe it is only because it is larger chunks so you can taste it better.  I prefer that to the smaller ones where the nougat is there but not as noticeable as it is in these.<br /><br />I have ordered these a couple of times--the most recent time temperatures were over 80 degrees and i was concerned it would be delivered and be melted.  It was not, it came in perfect condition.  However, I'm not sure I would risk it in the dead of summer and 100 degree temps.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/text: Please keep your eye out for the soon-to-arrive Marge's Bakery website ordering, as you cannot possibly go on in life without trying their Rosewater Snowball cookies. I've developed a cult-like obsession with these cookies simply because they are the most delicate, pure, aromatic, creamy, light, nutty crisp but smooth cookies to ever touch my lips. Sounds insane, but the most accurate comparison I could make to emphasize my fervor here is one's love for a perfect French macaron. Now did that make a little more sense? Further, if one of your favorite macaron flavors is rose, then you would DIE for this cookie, not because they resemble each other but because the lust simply goes hand-in-hand.<br /><br />I understand this particular Amazon item is featuring OTHER Marge's Bakery cookie varieties, but since the Rosewater Snowballs are so impossible to find, hopefully at least the cookie name will appear in an online search to give a glimmer of hope to other shoppers out there in my similar situation. My order was fulfilled by directly contacting the company, and the sweetest person (Jeanette) emailed me directly to tell my that my very own batch was being baked Monday and shipped out Tuesday. You can't get any more genuine than that--regardless of what this company sells, their degree of customer service is of the highest quality. An exquisite company...please don't short change yourself. If I were Oprah, I'd send MB to the moon by raving about them every single day to anyone that will listen (and taste).

review/text: These cookies are slightly soft-baked, and although I'm a vegetarian of over 10 years and can't stand meat, have been more than tempted to try these due to their delicious smell!  They have a wonderful herbally scent to them, and my dogs absolutely love them!  These cookies are easy to break and 100% grain free.  One of my dogs developed a problem with ALL grains, as well as poultry, and while "grain-free" doesn't include rye, oatmeal, etc., these are things that cause him to itch horribly,  so finds like these are wonderful!  As for the complaint below on the price (no comment about quality!), these are absolutely top notch, and are also devoid of dairy, something which I only give my dogs if they have diarrhea (which makes them quite constipated).  Overall, I'm quite happy with this find, and recommend it (and the beef tripe version) to picky dogs or dogs with specific food allergies!

review/summary: Great anytime of the year
review/text: Being from Pennsylvania, I grew up with these.  They are the best Irish Potato candy that you can buy.  These are the coconut fondant type.  Not many people realize that there are two basic types of this candy.  This kind, fondant, and one actually made from potatos.  Around St. Patrick's day, the stores are full of Oh Ryan's.<br /><br />As I have gotten older, I have started to make my own Irish Potatos, and homemade are always a little better than store bought.  I guess because there is that element of love that you can't buy.  But if you are not kitchen inclined, or if you have no idea what they should taste and look like, you can not go wrong buying Oh Ryan's.<br /><br />In cast you weren't aware, these candies have become a tradition at St. Patrick's day in order to remember the struggle of those who went through and those who died during the Irish Potato Famine of the 19th century.  Make sure that you talk to your kids about the Potato Famine and its impact on the Irish people and how it changed the United States.

review/summary: If you like cinnamon you will love this
review/text: I purchased these to try something new. I like them but expected them to be softer. These are hard. I'm sure they are meant to be seeing as how they are supposed to be "potatoes". I'm glad I bought them but in the future I will only purchase as a novelty candy. I think these would be good with coffee...

review/summary: They're (magically) delicious!
review/text: (Horrible title, I know)<br />I just received my package of two boxes of these little potato-y sweets. These were suppose to be for a little St. Patty's Day potluck at work, but unfortunately the party was cancelled due to not many people wanting to contribute. However I'll still bring one box to work.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the smell. That wonderful cinnamon smell that makes me instantly think of Christmas. Second was the size, which surprised me a little. They were smaller than I thought they were, slightly smaller than a golf ball. When I opened a box the potato sweets felt a bit hard when I gently squeezed them, but they gave very easily when I bit down.<br />The flavor.... It reminded me of a mix between a macaroon and a snickerdoodle. It was WONDERFULLY sweet (but not too sweet), soft, and with a light crunchiness from the coconut.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend Oh Ryan's Irish Potatoes, and not just for St. Patty's Day. Get them anytime of the year! They're 100% worth it.

review/summary: My daughter loves these!!!
review/text: My daughter loves just about any flavor of the mashups by Revolution Foods. She hadn't tried the Beetbox Berry flavor before I ordered online (and 4 boxes at that). She gobbled it down in seconds! And this flavor seemed to be cheaper than the others. There are other brands of fruit puree's that my daughter will not eat, but anything by Revolution Foods she eats quickly, and sucks out every last drop!

review/summary: My kids love these things!
review/text: I stumbled upon these at Target and picked up a box for my kids.  They absolutely loved them.  Realizing I could get a healthy dose of fruit and veggies into them when we're out and about intrigued me.  I came to Amazon and with Subscribe and Save, they were around $1 each.  TOTALLY WORTH IT.  We have bought several cases in various flavors since and my kids and their playmates just love them.  I'll continue to order them all for as long as they eat them.  I tried them too and they are delicious!

review/summary: DELICIOUS NUTRITIOUS on the go
review/text: My 3 y.o. loves these. He considers them a treat, in fact. I love that he can get fruits and veggies on the go without any mess (I would never give him beets without a bib and without being strapped into a highchair)I also use these smoothies during winter months when strawberries are out of season.

review/summary: Great way to sneak in a veggie.
review/text: I love these.  Not because I have eaten them but because my kids will eat them.  I get tired of the daily battle over veggies.  My preschoolers do fine with eating fruits and vegetables most of the time but it is nice to have something on hand for one of those times that you need to get dinner together fast or you are on the go and you want them to have both a fruit and veggie.  These fit perfectly into that scenario.  My boys will finish the entire pouch every time it is given to them.  Often they will want to have it first.  I like the fact that is appears to be a fruit smoothie but there is a vegetable in there.  Personally I love beets, but my kids have not acquired my love for beets so they eat the Beetbox berry without knowing what a beet is.  I also buy them on subscribe and save and sometimes find myself getting an extra shipment.  That tells you how much we like these.  We also like the Carroty Chop and Fruit Berry.  We have tried a few other versions of other brands - one with a Fairy Tale rabbit on it - they hated that one - but these by far are the most popular.

review/summary: Too Sweet- not enough vitamins
review/text: This flavor is super sweet. I usually have to ad it to a smoothie or mix it with another flavor for my toddler to eat it. It tasted like strawberry jelly. I was also disappointed with the lack of vitamins.
