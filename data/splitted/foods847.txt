review/text: My dog loves trying to get these off her toy, but she gets them off in about 4-5 minutes.  All she does is stretch one side of it until it comes apart.  I'm kind of concerned that it might be bad for her to swallow these.  They smell like they're just plastic so I'm not sure how easily they digest.. anyone have thoughts on that?

review/summary: Doesn't Last Long At All
review/text: I have a 50-lb Lab who loves to chew things.  I bought this a few times to use with a busy bone, hoping to keep the dog busy!  Well, he chews through it in a couple of minutes, and pretty much once he gets a tear in it, the entire thing comes off and he chews and swallows nearly the whole thing at once.  Needless to say, after a cost of 75cents or so per treat, it really wasn't worth 2 minutes of distraction, plus I wasn't happy with how he could swallow it nearly whole.  This would probably be better for smaller dogs or ones that aren't so food motivated!

review/summary: Gone in a heartbeat
review/text: I purchased these to put on my dog's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KVF49Q">Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, Medium</a> My dog is a lab mix and as soon as I put these on her bone...they're gone!  She loves the taste of them and they're pretty soft for a hard treat, so they just break right off, she chews a couple times and..."Gulp."  they're gone.  So, in general,  if you are purchasing these for a large breed, the bouncy bone itself is a great idea and very very durable (as are ALL of the Premier pet toys,) however I do not recommend the gnawhide rawhide rings for anything larger than a medium terrier breed.  Otherwise you'll be spending wayyyy too much on these refill packs.<br /><br />Note:  If you have a large breed (as I do) these rings work great on the bouncy bone as a big treat/reward for good behavior!

review/summary: Used For Chewing Puppy
review/text: I've been trying to find something for my puppy (a weimeraner)to chew.  Regular rawhides are too tough for her just yet, but everything else seems too soft.  Thought that these might do the trick. Unfortunately, she just goes through them too quickly.  It takes her less than 20 minutes to finish one off, and these are the "large" ones.

review/text: These are refills for the Busy Bone and Bristle Bone.  It is the best possible option for dogs who like to chew:  They love the challenge of the busy bone and bristle bone, yet the rawhide intake is very limited--both on the positive side.  When paired with the cornstarch/rawhide refill rings, it is a special treat.

review/text: I keep getting these because my puppy likes them and they are safe for her to chew.  They don't break off into pieces that can hurt her.  I have a "Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone" that unscrews on both ends.  You just slip these on and give it to them and it will keep them busy for a long time.  I have the small size, but they have larger ones for bigger dogs.  They also have one that has a sort of ball in the middle that these little round chews slip onto also.  It's a pretty good product and I'll keep getting them until she gets tired of them.

review/text: The gnaw-hide rings purchased to refill the med/lg sized bouncy bones do not fit. You can slide one on one end but it will not slide across to the other side of the toy.  Only one end of the bone screws off, so, unless the hole is big enough on the refill ring you can only use one ring at a time.

They are quite expensive though so I don't give them that often.  Good way to keep her busy.

review/text: I also very much wanted to love this coffee. We are seeking a DARK roast organic, fair trade coffee to make espresso drinks such as Americanos and lattes at home. The flavor strength is just not there- it is lost in the milk. Our ratio is 2 double shots, (quads) ground just before pulling a 20 second double shot to 8 oz of boiling water or six ounces of steamed whole milk.<br />I am sad that I cannot return the TWO unused bags, or exchange them for something else. I am also disappointed that there does not seem to be a contact seller button for Larry's Beans.<br />We opened and tried the first bag, but I do not like the flavor even if we ground it for drip coffee. Larry's Beans described it as buttery- it is buttery like a warm chardonnay; and very disappointing when you are use to drinking a full favored espresso akin to bordeaux.

review/text: I have been drinking espresso a long time and use the beans in my Jura X90 commercial automatic espresso machine.  Larry's beans are way too light to work as an espresso blend.  The coffee tastes good, but it is not the strong taste that a seasoned espresso drinker is looking for.

review/summary: received spoiled with green mold all over bars
review/text: I really don't think Amazon should try to sell natural products such as this that require refrigeration or temps below 70F and short storage life.  The box for this product had an unsealed top and the bars were floating around the bigger box it came in. I almost bit into one bar but fortunately opened it outside with sun light and could see well lots of green mold on it. Then I looked on the other bars and they were mostly all spoiled.<br /><br />The other pecan bars I ordered were not spoiled, but taste a bit dated.<br /><br />Too bad as these healthy bars are really tasy and healthy when properly handled.

I couldn't put my finger on it until I checked the box under a heat lamp with a magnifying glass.  I saw maggots (The common house fly lays its eggs in rotting, moist material. The maggots emerge from the eggs in warm weather within 8 to 20 hours, and they immediately feed on, and grow in, the material where the eggs were laid) and a molded Wheat Free Cashew-Apricot Energy Square.<br /><br />Buy these at your local store instead.

review/summary: MOLDY, MOLDY!!!
review/text: These Frankly Natural Bakers' Carob Energy Squares arrived MOLDY, and since they are individually wrapped in clear plastic, it was clear to see the green FUR growing off of each bar. I called the company (found the phone number on the box) and they mentioned that Amazon purchases these bars in bulk and sells them seperately and I would need to get my refund through Amazon. I called Amazon and explained the moldy mess. The agent apologized and immediately issued me a refund over the phone. Good customer service in the end, but I think the bars need to be refrigerated for the duration of their storage at Amazon, and the moldy mess could easily be avoided.

review/summary: small but satisfying
review/text: These squares aren't very big -- about 2 and a half inches wide -- but they're very dense. The 12-count box is heavy! And they pack a lot of flavor into a small space. When you unwrap one of these, you're hit by a rich orange aroma. The texture is chewy. These squares are meant to be savored, not wolfed down. I like that this company's products are vegan and they're made from a short list of simple, natural ingredients. But if you don't like sesame, you will not like these squares. If you're like me and enjoy sesame, I suggest also trying Frankly Natural's tahini cookies.

review/text: Gotta admit, I did not love these as much as the vegan blondies, but if you're into the nutty, fruity, health bar type of snack, this would be up your alley.  I'd call it more like a large energy bar.  On the plus side, the ingredients are readily apparent, so you can feel virtuous about your snack choice.  On the downside, it's so healthy looking and tasting it didn't really satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />Again, be aware that the expiration dates may not allow for hoarding of said bars, as my order came with an expiration date 3 months out.

review/text: I was excited about these and brought home one a few days. Loved that my husband and I could easily share this candy bar. But we were both ultimately disappointed. While there wasn't anything DIStasteful about these, they just kinda felll flatflavor-wise. The peanut butter was not pronounced at all and the chocolate coating seemed messier than on a regular Snickers. Overall they just tasted very sweet, but there was no real depth of flavor. If you're looking for peanut butter, go for the classic Reese's Cups. If it's Snickers you crave, then stick with the original. Our lesson learned!

Wouldn't buy them again and if given one would probably give it away unless I was starving for chocolate right that moment.

review/summary: Snickers Peanut Butter Candy Bar
review/text: While the traditional Snickers bar is delicious and satisfying and filled with peanuts in every bite and that wonderful smooth and tasty chocolate flavor, the Snickers Peanut Butter candy bar falls short on flavor, taste, ingredients, and portion size.<br /><br />The 1.78 oz. 250 calorie bar has very little traces of peanut butter or peanuts as intimated by the packaging.  I found only one half of a peanut in one of the two sections of the candy bar.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Much of the candy bar is chalk full of artificial flavors and fillers.  Although the ingredient peanut butter is prominently displayed on the packaging, it is listed as peanut butter (peanuts, partially hydrogenated soybean oil).<br /><br />The chocolate also has a rather diet flavor, and is listed as milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor).  It doesn't taste like chocolate.<br /><br />So, don't waste the calories on this flavorless dud.  It's not worth the 13 g fat, 6 g sat. fat, 24 g sugar, and 150 mg of sodium.  Go for the traditional to satisfy your craving for a nutty and tasty chocolate treat.<br /><br />It does not have the hefty weight of the traditional candy bar so you get less candy for your money.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The packing is brightly colored and appealing.  The product is divided into two small square shaped sections that allow you to save one for later.  It has the Snickers logo prominently displayed on the brightly colored yellow package.

review/summary: Good when Prepared Right (No Thanks to the Packaging)
review/text: I seriously think whoever made the instructions for the alfredo sauce made a typo when stating how much water to add to the sauce.  If you follow the instructions to the letter, you will end up with something that looks like greenish library paste.  The following method yields a sauce more like alfredo sauce in consistency, rather than the stickier mac and cheese style sauce.<br /><br />Bring 1 cup to 1 1/4 cup water to boil in a small saucepan.  After water is boiling, gradually add sauce mix while stirring constantly with a whisk.  After all the mix is combined, add 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of salt.  Cook until sauce is at desired consistency, stirring occasionally.  This makes enough sauce for me to have two meals of veggies and noodles, but I like a lot of sauce.

review/text: Like other reviewers already stated, the directions for how much H2O to add is WAAAAAY off! Following the directions will yield a gummy clump! The directions say to add 1/2 cup of H2O. When I make it, I add TWO cups of soy milk & vegan butter. This creates a thick, creamy sauce. The sauce is okay but still a bit bland for my taste. I also add garlic, herbs, and some nutritional yeast. It is delicious! On it's own, this product sucks, needs lots of extras but provides a good base for my vegan cream sauce.

review/summary: Not as good as the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese
review/text: Wow.  What a disappointment.  My son and I loved the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese, so I had high hopes for this alfredo sauce packet.  I thought it would be nice for a more grown up meal than the kid's mac version.  The first turn off (and again, totally different than the shells packet) was the aweful color. I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and a vegan for most of that, so I have a pretty high tolerance for these things.  The color was a very unappetizing greyish green, like sliced avocado that's been left out too long.  The smell and texture weren't very appealing either.  My husband will eat anything, he's a human garbage disposal, so he had no trouble with it.  But I doctored it up with some sauteed mushrooms, olive oil and a little almond milk for creamyness and it was a passable sauce on top of pasta.  But I was looking for a no fuss packet and ended up having to get creative and work with it.  I spared my son from having to eat it and opened a jar of marinara sauce for him.  I guess I'll use the rest of the packets as a thickening ingredient in sauces because they certainly aren't edible acording to the package instructions.

review/summary: Don't do it.
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I in no way expected this product to taste like real cheese. I did, however, want to try using something else besides cheese to flavor pasta. Let me also say that I commend this company's efforts to make an alternative cheese option for people who cannot eat dairy or gluten.<br />However, I had a horrible experience with this stuff. The picture on the package is false advertising by the way. The mix comes out a sticky grey blob. There is no way you could make it resemble the white creamy alfredo on the picture. Now, perhaps I am asking too much. Maybe it just wasn't possible to make it white instead of grey due to the ingredients. But it made me realize how important the visual aspect of my food is. If it doesn't look good, I'm going to have a hard time believing it tastes good.<br />The mix was so sticky that I couldn't get it to spread evenly on the pasta. Notice I said "spread"--it couldn't even be classified as a sauce, really. The package says to add milk or olive oil while cooking to make it "creamy." Well, I added olive oil and it definitely was nothing even close to creamy. It was more like a ball of dough. By the way, I might as well mention here that I followed the instructions exactly.<br />At first, the taste wasn't TOO offensive. The first couple bites were not great, but I stuck with it because I don't like to waste food. But the more I ate, the more disgusting it became. I had to throw the leftover mix in the trash because I couldn't bear the thought of eating any more of it.<br />I bought a package of their regular chreese mix as well. I will be willing to try it despite my bad experience with this mix, but I'm not hopeful.

review/summary: Marshmallows Are My Passion - Pumpkin Spice Is My Weakness!
review/text: Marshmallows are my passion.  I love them so much.  I can eat them plain, in cereal, in coffee, in Rice Krispie treats, any way.  My favorite way to use these marshmallows is to drop two of them into the bottom of my cappuccino cup and pour in steaming espresso and steamed milk.  The marshmallows give the coffee drink just the right amount of pumpkin spice flavor.  I wish these were available all year round as I love anything pumpkin.  The flavor is the perfect amount of Pumpkin and Spice and not overly sweet.  I still have a bag left, but wish I would have ordered three times the amount.<br /><br />For Halloween, I made Pumpkin Spice Rice Krispie Treats and not only were they pretty, they were delicious.  My friends and their kids went crazy over these treats.  At Thanksgiving, I made a Yam Casserole and instead of using regular plain white marshmallows, I used the Pumpkin Spice marshmallows.  They were a real hit.<br /><br />If you like Pumpkin and you like marshmallows, get these; you will not regret it at all.  I could sit and eat the whole bag plain.

review/text: We wanted to make rice krispie treats for our classroom for Halloween. I work in a special needs classroom with 9-12 yr. olds. I found these at the store I went to and decided to try something a little different and we made the treats with the Pumpkin Spice Marshmellows. The kids and adults LOVED them!! We wanted to make more but none of the stores had them anymore, they are a seasonal item! So I searched online and found them! We made the treats again and they are still a hit, this flavor of marshmellow is fantastic and I will be using them to make homemake gifts for Christmas!!!

review/summary: Nice lightly spiced marshmallow......
review/text: I purchased one bag of these at a local store.  I must say that I was a little hesitant; but thought, what they heck I'll give them a try.  Surprisingly, I found they have a pleasant light spice flavor. I especially like them on a cup of coffe for some extra low calorie flavor.  Think they would go nicely with hot chocolate as well.

review/summary: This stuff is awesome!!
review/text: I have tried a lot of products from Alaska Smokehouse, and this one is by far my favorite. The pepper garlic flavor combined with the savory salmon is a great balance. I took this with me on a long hike up Mt. Baldy so I could have something protein & sodium rich when I reached the summit, and I was pleasantly surprised by the great balance of flavors.

review/summary: Strong pepper flavor
review/text: I've tried a couple other Alaska smoked salmon products (original flavor) and liked those better.<br />This one, the pepper is too overpowering for me. It's hard to taste the salmon itself.<br /><br />I didn't get two 4oz pouches as one of the other reviewers. I got one 8oz pouch.<br />I guess the packing can differ from one to another.

review/summary: Alaska Smokehouse Wild Smoked Salmon is a treasure
review/text: At least that's what the box says, and I would agree :-). Very tasty and convenient.<br /><br />You get two 4-oz. pouches that can be opened individually. The box says they're "gold foil" but they are actually Mylar (I assume it's Mylar).<br /><br />A CAUTIONARY NOTE: There's considerable liquid in the pouch (unavoidable, I guess). It tends to squirt out once the pouch is cut. I therefore suggest opening it carefully over a bowl and draining it thoroughly (unless you like to have fish juice all over everything).<br /><br />You get either two small servings from a pouch, or one generous one.<br /><br />I'm reducing my rating to four from my original five stars, since I have had better smoked salmon. This is quite satisfactory, however, and a splendid value.

review/summary: Bland & watery
review/text: I'm used to higher quality smoked salmon which is pink, a bit dry, yet slightly moist. The salmon packaged here was somewhat water-logged (considering 8oz, water is cheap, salmon is not), almost a grayish hue, and not very flavorful. Had a recurring shipment set up for cheap, but deactivated it after the first arrived. Don't expect to be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Really great price
review/text: Don't expect to have your world blown away by this salmon and it is definitely hot smoked so it is a little dense.  That being said, it has a nice clean flavor and is cryosealed so you don't have to deal with cans.  My purpose for buying this was to replace turkey on my sandwiches and this is a perfect application of this salmon for only a fraction more than what I pay for turkey.<br /><br />Great buy for the money and I will definitely keep my subscription.

review/summary: Pretty Dry Salmon
review/text: While this is technically smoked salmon, it is not the kind we all think of. This kind is first soaked in brine and then smoked at a higher temperature. This both causes the extra liquid in the pouch that other reviews talk about as well as dries out the salmon. Yes, sadly, this smoked salmon is not the fabulous dark pink smoked salmon with the texture of sashimi and the delicate taste of smoke. This salmon has an overpowering taste of peppercorns and the texture of dry turkey. Caveat emptor

review/summary: These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.
review/text: I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.  There are 7 nice big chunks in every jar.<br /><br />These taste like tuna in a can but, because they're preserved in glass, you don't have to worry about either aluminum or BPA; BUT ... they are not just tuna and spring water.<br /><br />There is salt in there, too, and it's not healthy sea salt, it's toxic table salt.<br /><br />I am trying to contact Tonnino to confirm that.  I might be wrong because the label states that the ingredients are "tuna fish" but the sticker on the top clarifies that it is the smaller (healthier) yellowfin, so the "salt" listed in the ingredients might be sea salt but, if it was, why don't they say so?<br /><br />Without confirmation, I will continue to look for a salt-free olive-oil free tuna preserved in glass.<br /><br />If you know of one, please contact me!

review/summary: Instant coffee flavor!
review/text: I really like coffee-flavored candies and decided to order the large jar. The service was fast. The candies are intensely flavored with coffee and as soon as one hits your mouth you get to taste coffee. I love them! Also, there are so many packed in the jar that when the level goes down, I just shake the jar and it becomes a full jar again - how cool is that?

review/text: Well, to start with, this candy is NOT sweet, it is very bitter, I don't drink black coffee, it must have cream and sugar, this doesn't have that, in fact, it doesn't taste like coffee at all, it is an overpowering hazel-nut in taste, a taste, I do not like at all, if only I could have tried this before buying, I wouldn't be stuck with this 28 oz jar that I am going to trash.

review/summary: Very tasty, but not healthy or nutritious
review/text: Think of this as a candy/snack bar rather than a granola bar and you will not be disappointed. It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose).<br /><br />Each bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture. It's chewy, but not hard like Nature Valley granola bars.<br /><br />Ingredients: granola (whole grain rolled oats, whole grain rolled wheat, brown sugar, sunflower oil, high fructose corn syrup, dried coconut, honey, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, whey and whey protein concentrate), yogurt flavored coating (sugar, palm kernel and palm oil, whey protein concentrate, yogurt flavored powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, artificial color, citric acid, salt), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice, sugar, malted barley flour, salt), brown sugar, glycerin, vegetable shortening (canola oil, palm and palm kernel oils), corn flakes (milled corn, sugar, salt, malted barley extract), whey mineral concentrate, oat flour, rice flour, sweetened dried strawberries (glucose syrup, strawberries, high fructose corn syrup, modified potato starch, sodium alginate), corn syrup solids, sorbitol, salt, sugar, modified food starch, soy lecithin, natural flavor, malted barley flour, sodium bicarbonate, BHT (a preservative), citric acid, water.<br /><br />Made in Canada.

review/text: I am an avid fan of these pretzels and order often. This particular box had a rancid smell and bad taste to them.  I was very disappointed as I purchase these and the whole wheat pretzels often and have never have this problem before.  I will hesitate to order again as they can't be returned.  This particular product has no expiration date so it is difficult to determine shelf life but like I said I normally would give them 5 stars!!
