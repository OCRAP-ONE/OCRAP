review/summary: Absolutely the best Belgian chocolate (Variety Pack)
review/text: New Tree is relatively new to me and I received this gift pack from a friend and now have a great idea for friends for this Christmas.<br /><br />The gift pack came with a lot of different great flavors but the best were Mint, Lavender, Ginger and just the pure chocolate.  The chocolate is just great quality and taste.  I would recommend to everyone and they are in mini-bar type so easy to grad as a quick snack/indulgence.<br /><br />Enjoy, I don't know much about the company but it gives you New perspective on chocolate taste.

We have ordered these a few times and find them to be fresh and delish as always. Our local source mixes the old with the new so some are hard as a rock. Our orders from Amazon have always been fast. We cannot get enough licorice.

review/summary: The very best seasoning - incredibly flavorful!
review/text: This is the most versatile and flavorful seasoning I've ever used. It goes with virtually everything (well, except sweets of course...) and I use it in pretty much everything.<br /><br />It lends a richness and flavor that you absolutely cannot get with salt and individual spices alone. The richness of the flavor reminds me of when you sautee spices in butter which releases and enhances the flavors of the spices. That is what this seasoning is like.<br /><br />From what I understand they take veggies and spices & put them in salt water, it evaporates leaving the salt which has absorbed all the flavors of the veggies and spices. It is really really good!<br /><br />YUM!

review/summary: It's okay, but not what I expected
review/text: I received this product today and put a small amount in my palm to taste. It had a slight kick to it but otherwise my palate missed all the richness, etc. that other reviewers have noted. It tasted salty w/ a bit of warm spice. I then sprinkled some on mixed vegetables and microwaved them. Typically I use only lemon juice from a fresh lemon and a heaping teaspoon of salted butter. The gentle spiciness was welcomed, but the vegetables tasted a bit too salty. I rarely use added salt except for pasta and popcorn, or when a recipe calls for it, so others may find it is their usual level of saltiness. I applaud the manufacturing process of this product, particularly since it is certified organic. Would I purchase again, probably not, but then in retrospect I think my expectations were that this product would be more of an organic version of Mrs. Dash.

Beautifully fresh (vacuum packed for the loose-leaf teas), finest leaf, richly satisfying, fairly traded, among tea connoisseurs Dilmah is more an institution than a regular tea company. By purchasing their products, you will not only be indulging in the ultimate tea-drinker's experience, you'll also be helping a multitude of award-winning non-profit programmes instituted by Dilmah's enlightened management. There should be more products like this. Do yourself a favour and buy some today.

review/summary: No flavor!
review/text: I am so disappointed!  After reading the great reviews I decided to order this tea.  I was so excited when it arrived and immediately brewed myself a cup.  It had NO flavor!  It was like drinking warm water.  I find it hard to believe that we are even talking about the same tea here.  Adding a bit of honey did give it some taste, of honey.  What was I doing wrong?  Correct temp, correct brewing time, but no taste.  To give you an idea of my tastes, here are some teas that I purchased here that I enjoy.  I really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0FOZQ">Guayaki Greener Green Tea Blend, Tea Bags, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 6)</a>I am getting low on that and purchased this Dilmah tea as a replacement due to a better price.  Big mistake.  The greener green is really delicious and flavorful. My favorite. I also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIFA">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Gunpowder Green, 16-Ounce Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIE6">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Organic South African Rooibos, 16-Ounce Bag</a>.  That is a great bedtime tea.  And I enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8AS">Stash Premium Fusion Green & White Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8BC">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  All great. I also have purchased<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SANUEK">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Silver Needles, 16-Ounce Bag</a>, and have found that to be kind of on the weak side.  In an attempt to get some flavor in my cup of Dilmah tea I tried brewing 2 teabags.  That resulted in some flavor, but not much. I get much more flavor from a second brewing of my gunpowder tea leaves. I feel bad giving this only 1 star, but it is easily the worse tea I ever tasted.  A total waste or money.  What am I doing wrong?

It's the getting them on and off that is difficult. They have a "waist" about at the wrist - both the small and medium (which would have been too large in the fingers) are very tight, and the lining isn't quite slippery enough to offset that. They are so hard to get on and off that I gave up wearing them long before they could wear out.<br /><br />Too bad, since they're a better option than the "name brand", which last a month at best.

review/text: I was really wanting to like these eco-friendly gloves. They do fit comfortably while they are on and give me a good grip. They are a better fit than the (loose) yellow Safeway brand gloves. Unfortunately, they are so hard to put on. The wrist area is tight, so you have to do a bit of pulling to get it on. And although you get 3 inches of arm coverage, because the rubber is thin, the cuff will fall/fold over if you are doing scrubbing or a lot of movement. At this point, water will easily pour into the glove. It does not compare with my favorite - Playtex Living with Drip-catch cuff, which is thicker and has 5 inches of arm coverage that never falls over. But I suppose if you're not scrubbing or if you can avoid too much movement, they should be ok for use.

review/summary: Finally the Perfect Household Gloves!
review/text: I really love the fact the gloves and the packaging are environmentally friendly and FSC certified.<br /><br />I love these gloves for chores! I have to use gloves for dish washing due to really dry hands and I have had a problem finding gloves that last. I hated using environmentally unfriendly gloves that lasted maybe a couple of weeks or so. Typically other gloves I have tried developed a hole in them within a couple of weeks or so and then had to be thrown in the trash. I am still on the first pair out of the 6 I picked up from Amazon, so far 3 months and going. I have never had a pair of gloves last this long!<br /><br />These gloves do a very good job at staying on and not trying to slip off as I have had problems with other gloves doing. Also because of the way they fit I have not had a problem with water getting in these. (Unless of course I accidentally get the opening right under the faucet while it is running or submerge the glove)<br /><br />I wear a medium and found these medium sized gloves fit well. I believe that they are designed to fit closely on your hands so that they do not slip while using them, so if mediums are typically a little on the tight side trying a large might be better.<br /><br />As someone commented they do have a "waist" approximately at the wrist, which actually I really, really like. I found they take a couple of more seconds more to get on and off, but they are well worth it.<br /><br />Some stores sell these individually so picking up a single pair to try for size and then purchasing another pack of 6 here might work better.<br /><br />I have also bought other items made by If You Care and so far have been equally pleased. These are well made gloves that I will continue to purchase and hopefully they never discontinue them!

review/summary: AWARD WINNING WATKINS CINNAMON
review/text: I recently went to our local (Del Mar) fair, in July, and purchased my first tin of this award winning product for the first time, and all I could say is, "WOW! This is the what cinnamon should taste like." I took a very 'small' sample on my finger, and tasted it right from the can - it has a wonderful and naturally 'sweet' taste to it!<br /><br />WATKINS uses only the finest cinnamon bark with the highest oil content and then processes it to a consistently fine powder. Their premium grade sweet 'korintje' cinnamon has an intense aroma and is MUCH MORE flavorful than the ceylon cinnamon (generally sold in supermarkets). This 2 ounce tin is a nice 'sampler' size, if you have never tried it before.<br /><br />This stuff is GREAT for baking desserts (i.e. cinnamon rolls, apple pies), and is a wonderful flavoring in gourmet or home cooked dishes, such as beef stews, chili's etc.<br /><br />WATKINS has enjoyed a stellar reputation (since 1868, when it first made it's debut), and for good cause:<br /><br />Watkins possible has the finest cinnamon product sold on the open market, and worth every penny!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br />Watkins Cinnamon<br />Weight: 2 Ounces

review/summary: This low-carb follower can now enjoy the classic American condiment again
review/text: Just received this in the mail from Amazon (actually, it was sent directly from retailer CarbSmart).  Simply put, Heinz's reduced sugar & reduced carb ketchup tastes just like regular Heinz ketchup, making me wonder why Heinz doesn't make all its ketchup this way.  Anyway, this controlled-carb enthusiast is now regularly enjoying ketchup on his (alas, still mostly bunless) burger patties again; just using mustard was getting a little tiring.  While some low-carb versions of previously favorite foods take some getting used to, this one doesn't, so don't hesitate to order this product.  The price isn't all that bad, either.

review/text: I'm currently on a high protein, low carb diet (Ideal Protein Diet).  Carbs were restricted, but as I'm allowed to work them back into my diet, this is one condiment that is allowed (One Carb Heinz).  Before now, I tried the Walden Farms ketchup and that was pretty bad - but this Heinz tastes just like their regular ketchup only it's low carb, reduced sugar - so it's less bad for you.  I will say that this item is available in most Walmart stores for $2.88 per bottle, which sure beats having to buy in bulk OR having to pay for shipping.  So if you choose to try this product, I suggest getting it at Walmart.

review/text: There is only one reason all ketchup isn't made with no added sugar like this...money.  It's much cheaper for the manufacturer to use high fructose corn syrup instead of tomatoes.  This ketchup tastes fresher and overall better than "normal" ketchup.  I tested it on a variety of friends and they all agree that this ketchup is better than the usual ketchup by far, plus you're not putting extra sugar in  your system needlessly.

review/summary: You can tell by the taste that it has sweetener in it.
review/text: I grabbed this off a shelf at a grocery store when I was in a hurry to get back to my place and put a meatloaf in the oven. I have been trying to eat better and one major was is to reduce my sugar intake. I never drink diet sodas, and I avoid sweeteners at all times because I dislike the taste.<br /><br />I naively thought that "Reduced Sugar" meant just that - they put less sugar in it. But there is more to it than that; they should call it, "Reduced Sugar, but Increased Sweetener". Sucralose is listed on the ingredients. So, a more fitting name for this is really "Diet Ketchup".<br /><br />I was in a hurry and did not read the ingredients in the store. So yes, purchasing this item when I know I can't stand sweetener flavor was my fault. But I still feel justified in the low review because of the actual taste of the ketchup. NOT KNOWING that it had had any artificial sweeteners, I could tell from the first bite of my favorite meatloaf recipe that sweeteners had somehow made it into my meal! There is not that much ketchup sauce on the loaf and I could still taste it - I am pretty sure I am going to follow the course of the other negative reviewer and buy a new bottle of "regular" ketchup.<br /><br />If you don't mind sucralose, then maybe this is a great option for you.

review/text: This is a fantastic product that I buy whenever I buy ketchup.  Maybe it is not as sweet as regular ketchup, and I'm not a huge ketchup lover, and part of that has always been that disgusting moment when you bite into something and realized it's basically got corn syrup on it.  Old ketchup used to have enough sugar in it to balance the acidity and saltiness, but since the advent of corn syrup, it just seemed to me like you could dip your fries in Karo syrup.  (Sorry for the rant, :)  Anyway, while low carb dieting, I discovered that there were lots of meats to eat, but sometimes it is a drag to eat a plain burger or steak.  What really motivated me was when I made a pork roast into pulled pork and realized you can't make it into really barbeque because that would totally blow your carbs when you add sauce.  So, I found this ketchup and created my own barbecue and steak sauce which basically involves using this product mixed with other ingredients including Liquid Smoke.  Viola!  An ultra-low carb BBQ/steak sauce.<br /><br />Granted the price fluctuates wildly here on Amazon, depending on the seller and the shipping costs. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is widely available at the big bad box store we all love to hate, and thank goodness for it.  I had just had to give a shout out this product, and the Heinz folks, because this fills a need, however you get it to your house!

review/text: I try and follow a low carb diet and I love ketchup. This is a perfect product for me. Heinz One Carb Ketchup tastes, to me, the same as Heinz' regular ketchup. (I just wish it was widely available in local stores.) Sure, the small size of the bottle makes this a spendy proposition, but then it really is the only way to go for that "real" ketchup taste. I adjust by using less ketchup than I would have in the past, and purchase it in bulk to minimize shipping costs. I have been drawing down a case for nearly a year now, and have a few bottles left. Like all ketchup, it stores well. I wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone who wants/needs to eat low carb and desires to continue using ketchup as a condiment.

review/text: As other reviewers have stated, this "Reduced Sugar" ketchup contains sucralose.  Why they don't state this plainly on the bottle I have no idea.  I would not have purchased this product if I knew it contained sucralose as I don't want my kids eating that junk.  On the back of the bottle they have a clever little note that sucralose is not found "in normal ketchup".  That's for sure.  It's really wrong that they did it this way and frankly there was no reason -- what they thought we'd never notice??  It lowers my opinion of Heinz which I always thought was an honest company, guess I was wrong?  Oh and did I mention, the ketchup tastes disgusting?  Sucralose may be low calorie but it is way, way too sweet. Stick with the original version you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Anyway I think I'm going to try Annie's or another brand of organic ketchup, with fewer calories than Heinz, and see how my kids like it.

Does that sound forthright to you? Does that sound like they are trying to keep the customer fully informed? Kind of a shady practice and a shady response from the company.

review/summary: Awful, just awful
review/text: We bought this as a low carb substitute for the 17-Day Diet program. My wife and I could not believe how genuinely terrible this stuff tastes when compared to regular Heinz Ketchup. We either had to forego ketchup altogether or just cheat on the diet with regular Heinz. We chose the latter and lost weight on the program anyway. We had absolutely no hesitation in dumping this product right in the garbage.

review/summary: Sucralose/Splenda Ingredient is Toxic
review/text: Sure, we're all too busy to make our own ketchup (with Stevia, a healthy sweetener with no carb or glycemic load), but it would be much better to try to do so especially if you're feeding kids too. For those needing low carb, low or no sugar, watch out for the ingredients "sucralose" or "splenda" (and of course most already know about the harmful effects of aspartame, saccharine and "Equal"). Don't believe me? Do your own web search to find out more. A great site is the EWG, Environmental Working Group, a non-profit group which tests many products for toxicity levels.

review/summary: Super Flavor! The Real Stuff
review/text: Yes, it's the real thing! This is the genuine UK-made Lea & Perrins, and it tastes so much better than what we buy at supermarkets in America.  Most people don't realize it's a totally different recipe, with a rich, smooth flavor that complements even the most delicate foods, meats and seafood.<br /><br />Grab a bottle of your USA-made L&P and compare the ingredients to these of the real UK-made product: Malt Vinegar (from Barley), Spirit Vinegar, Molasses, Sugar, Salt, Anchovies (Fish), Tamarind Extract, Onions, Garlic, Spice, Flavouring.<br /><br />Notice there is no high-fructose corn syrup!<br /><br />Once I tasted this, I just couldn't buy the American version ever again. The shipping cost listed above blows me away, but the product is superb. If you can get this product from whatever source, you'll love it.

review/text: These are great-tasting snack bars, and are even better when you warm them up (remove from wrapper, microwave for 10-15 seconds), which makes them much softer and smoother, like a treat that just came out of the oven. They have lots of fiber and protein and nutrients, and plant sterols that lower cholesterol.

review/summary: I love these!!
review/text: I am not a fan of breakfast. Never have been, probably never will be. But I have started new medications that must be taken in the morning and must not be taken on an empty stomach. So I shopped around and after a few poor choices, stumbled across these Oatmeal Squares. Now I love the taste of raw oatmmeal and I have never met a peanut anything that I did not love so I decided to give these little treats a try. What a wonderful surprise! These squares are soft and chewy, not overly sweet, I believe they are sweetened with brown rice syrup, date puree and cane syrup so the sweetness is not overpowering. I don't heat them up or anything, just open the wrapper and enjoy. As for the complaint about not tasting peanut butter, I was a bit surprised that there is not a pronounced peanut butter flavor but there is a peanut flavor. And when I thought about it, if there had been a more pronounced peanut butter flavor it would mean that there would be more fat so I guess peanut flavor is probably better for me than peanut butter flavor. I also love the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip variety of these squares. These bars run @$1.30 each but I added them to my Subscribe and Save account and lowered the price by @ 20 cents each.

review/text: These oatmeal squares grew on me, but still don't thrill me.<br /><br />The first one I ate as a treat but I did not finish because I didn't enjoy the taste.  The 2nd one I ate out of desperate hunger while cooking dinner and it was pretty good.  I guess these should be eaten as filling bars, rather than desserts.  They certainly satisfy hunger - they are dense and heavy.<br /><br />Because there are still a few sitting on my shelf a month or so later, I guess I really didn't grow to like them as much as I'd hoped.  I guess I was secretly hoping for a more sugary, peanut-butter taste.<br /><br />After saying all that, I would definitely recommend this product for the pure peanut butter lovers.

review/text: I was really looking forward to getting these because I am a complete, over-the-top fan of all the fabulous Corazonas chips.  Unfortunately, I found these squares to have a slightly odd flavor undertone.  After mulling it over, I decided it was a tiny bit reminiscent of the cod liver oil my mom foisted on my when I was a kid.  If it weren't for that odd flavor, I would like these just fine.  Maybe they can tweak the recipe.  Then I would buy them.  Sorry, Corazonas, but I had to tell the truth.

Now we travel(for 10 years) full-time in our motor home and it is not as easy to hand make them.  The Buggy brand is within an eyelash of what her family made for generations.  I have tried the "Amish Type" and other knock-off brands and they are little better than store bought.  These are the real thing and well worth the price.  We buy in the 10 lb. package and then re-pack in well-sealed baggies.  NO NEED TO FREEZE.  Actually, they will keep up to a year 'on the shelf' if you repackage well.  Call the people at "Buggy Brand" in Illinois and they will also tell you this.  Nice folks.

review/text: Butter beans look like lima beans, but are sweeter and avoid the slime factor of canned limas. These beans are the best I have ever found--they are firm and well-cleaned, ready for use. I have an old Shaker recipe for a butter-bean-potato salad: I use a can of these beans, some boiled and diced red potatoes, and the corn cut from a fresh ear of corn. The dressing is mayonnaise, a little olive oil, and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Eden makes it possible to do this recipe at any time with these hard-to-find beans. They're great!

review/text: A word of warning: These are NOT the large, rich, and tasty Habas Grandes that Goya, for instance, calls Butter Beans.<br /><br />These are small Petit Lima Beans with very little flavor. The texture is on the mushy side as well.<br /><br />On the plus side, they mash more easily than a lot of beans if you want to use them to provide the body and bulk for patties or dumplings where spicing and other ingredients provide the flavor. That is the best use I have found for them.<br /><br />Bottom line: I won't have any problems finishing the case I bought, but doubt I will buy these again.

Only problem with the boxed ones is they are smaller and harder than the ones you buy in the market.  Buying them in bulk saves as much as a $1.20 per box but the taste isn't as good.  So, I've gone back to buying them in the store.  Only other suggestion could be that they might be just as good with slightly less sugar even though the sugar content is low. All that aside, I've gotten about 20 people addicted to them as I am.

Which reminds me, these are packaged in boxes, not tubs as described. These are much cheaper thru Amazon.  I pay $3 at the local store and they are sold in the paper sleeve.  I like the box because they protect the contents.  My order thru Amazon arrives in better condition than the store bought.  I have ordered direct from the company and with postage they are very expensive; but available in tubs if that is your preference. Be sure to close a partial package securely because they quickly pick up moisture and lose their crispness and become chewy. I hope these will continue to be available.

review/text: The cupcakes are good, but be aware it is not 4 pounds as it is described in the shipping weight. It is a tiny box that makes 6 regular size cupcakes OR 12 tiny cupcakes...I squeezed 7 cupcakes out of it. It is not worth the $4.94 I paid and you would be crazy to pay the $14. regular price. I would never buy this again. The box says 6 ounces cake mix and 1 ounce frosting mix to a total of 7 ounces. Where they got the 4 pound shipping weight I can not figure out. I did not find a brick in the box, but it came in huge cardboard box.

review/summary: A Top of the Line Food
review/text: Some dog owners may find it strange to feed their dog(s) a fish based formula, but I learned years ago that dogs can enjoy eating fish and can thrive on a diet of kibble with fish as the main protein source. Our bichon had been suffering from skin allergies, and a helpul employee at our local pet store suggested a fish based Wellness formula. Within a few weeks Evie's skin problems improved dramatically.<br /><br />The by Nature kibble is less expensive than the Wellness, but is a premium food too in its own right. The protein sources are salmon and ocean fish, and the included grains are: ground barley, ground oats, ground brown rice. Also included in the many wholesome ingredients is one of my favorites - SWEET POTATOES.<br /><br />We like the small size of the kibble, perfect for our petite-mouthed shih tzu and bolognese girls.<br /><br />The maker guarantees satisfaction or your money back, and the food is made in the USA.<br /><br />By Nature dry dog food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO  Association of American Feed Control Officials) dog food nutrient profiles for all life stages.

review/summary: Excellent Salmon and Sweet Potato Dog food; my dog really likes it.
review/text: My dog really likes this by Nature Salmon dog food. The dog food is in small pellets; easy for a big or small dog to eat. I like the ingredients from the salmon and other ocean fish to herring (fish) oil, alfalfa, flaxseed, fruit and vegetables as well as with minerals and vitamins (no corn or soy too.)  It is a high quality food that my dog gets excited about. He also likes Nature's Domain (also salmon and sweet potato.) I am positively impressed with it; it is also made in the USA.

review/summary: Salmon Dog Food with Fruit and Vegetables; healthy food made in USA
review/text: I usually buy Nature's Domain dog food (Salmon & Sweet Potato); but I tried this brand Nature with Salmon and Yogurt which also has sweet potatoes as well as fruit, vegetables, minerals and vitamins.<br /><br /> My dog really likes both the Nature's Domain and Nature Salmon Ocean Fish and Yogurt Dog food with alfalfa, flax seed, herring (fish) oil, etc.<br /><br />The size of the dog food nuggets are small suitable for small or large breed dogs where as the Nature's Domain Dog food nuggets are about twice as large as the Nature brand.
