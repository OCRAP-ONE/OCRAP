review/summary: The best, hands-down
review/text: This is my go-to for all luncheons, potlucks and picnics.  Really superior stuff, and much easier than making from scratch, which I had used to do.<br /><br />I make mine with orange juice (and a Tbs. lemon juice), chickpeas,  chopped roma tomatoes, cucumber (or green courgettes), yellow squash and raisins.  If I omit the tomatoes, I'll add toasted pine nuts.  --Really, there's little you can't do with it, and the addition of the extra vegetables makes one box of enough to feed a good sized crowd.

review/summary: Tabouli Newbie Review
review/text: I can't compare this brand to any other, since it was only recently that I was introduced to Tabouli, but I don't think I'll need to look any further because this is very good. If you like ceviche like foods, you'll definitely enjoy this. I served it on tostada's; super easy to make and should be perfect for packing for lunch. My 10 year old son also enjoyed it although he isn't very picky.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is the lack of an expiration date on the box. Ingredients look to be one's that will last long but I still like having a reference point.

review/text: I have been trying for some time to find a reliable way to make chicken tikka that approximates what you can get in a restaurant, either from scratch or from a mix. By itself, this mix is no better than anything else I've been able to come up with, which is not particularly great. It has the right spices, but lacks the heartiness.<br />However, I have come up with a way to use this product in a way that, at least to me, is passable as chicken tikka. Specifically, combining this mix with heavy cream and tomato paste helps to solve the heartiness problem. Basically I just do it to taste and it works out moderately well. So I continue to buy it, but it takes a little extra work.

review/summary: My latest "OMG, FABULOUS" Find!
review/text: I'm a big-time foodie. I live in New Orleans and MUST have flavor!!<br /><br />One of my favorite cuisines is Indian. I love a great Indian restaurant and will also cook at home from a favorite Indian cookbook. But cooking Indian at home is extremely labor intensive and time consuming, so I'm ALWAYS looking for a good cheat.<br /><br />I picked this Tikka Masala sauce up on my last grocery trip, without much expectation that it would be anything special...as every other pre-fab Indian food is on the market (I've probably tried MOST, if not all of them;).<br /><br />What a PLEASANT SURPRISE! This sauce is FABULOUS. It's thick, rich and full of authentic flavor!!! This sauce is at least as good as any restaurant I've ever tried. And it beats my homecooked recipe, hands down! Add to that, it only takes a few minutes to cook a complete meal, and I'm SOLD!<br /><br />My household is vegan, so here's how I prepared it:<br /><br /> -Simmer sauce packet with one pack vegan chicken strips, combined with 1/4 cup veggie broth, for about 7 to 10 minutes.<br /> -Swirl about 1/4 cup thick homemade cashew cream sauce (recipe below) and bring back to a boil.<br /> -Serve over rice with garlic naan.<br /><br />(You can make a delicious heavy cream substitute, cashew cream, by soaking raw cashews 8 hours, then blending with filtered water until super smooth:)<br /><br />I think adding mushrooms would be fantastic as well:)<br /><br />This sauce is now an official pantry stock in my home. I can't wait to try her other sauces and chutneys!

All you need to do is brown a little chicken in a pan, add the mix and some water, and let simmer covered for 20 minutes - the chicken gets wonderfully tender and the sauce is spicy, flavorful and aromatic. Throw in some broccoli and you've got a healthy, delicious meal in under 30 minutes (counting prep time.)

review/summary: Tasty peppery goodness
review/text: This is a great idea, chickpea snack. It is also executed well. While a little on the dry side, these are a hearty but not heavy snack that have a very robust peppery taste. Af first I thought they were a tad bit on the expensive side which is my only down side in addition to you REALLY need to like a pepper taste. However, especially with subscribe and save, you get a good amount of snacking for the price. Especially for something that is better for you than most snacks and filling.<br /><br />But I still think many people who are just ok with pepper might find the taste too intensely peppery. But overall for a hearty, healthy snack I do recommend these. And if pepper is not your thing you might want to consider a different flavor.

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: Best Earl Grey I know
review/text: I have been a tea drinker all my life (loose tea, not teabags), and this to me is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted. I have bought this Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey for years and despite occasionally trying a different brand, a different supplier, I am always coming back to this one.<br /><br />The best I can describe it is: It is balanced. Not too strong a bergamot taste, but not too much plain tea taste either. I would also describe it as elegant and delicate. I find Earl Greys that do not strike this fine balance to be either bland/flat or overpowering, in any case one-dimensional. To my taste buds, this one is perfect and has just the right amount of both key ingredients.<br /><br />Here are my tips to enjoy this tea to the fullest. I apologize if some of this seems self-evident, but I have encountered so many people who just did not know enough about tea, and then blamed it on the product that I want to make sure I am mentioning the key points:<br /><br />1. Storage<br />I keep my tea in the bag that it originally came in inside the box, and also clip it shut to preserve the aroma. When it comes to tea, it is critical to keep it away from light and to keep the storage container tightly shut. Also try to use up your tea in a reasonable amount of time or it will eventually go flat and old.<br /><br />2. Brewing<br />Use about 1 teaspoon per cup, and if you can, use filtered water (such as Brita-filtered, etc.). Then brew your tea with boiling water! And I mean boiling, not almost boiling.<br /><br />If you want to do it perfectly, give the tea leaves plenty of space - tea eggs are not the best choice to get the most flavorful taste. Ideally you will want to let the leaves float freely in the pot and then, after steeping, pour the tea through a strainer. But large tea filters also work. Examples are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G72D70">swissgold� TF 300 Tea Filter</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDW9MO">Finum 100 Tea Filters - Large (Make your own Teabags)</a><br /><br />3. Steeping<br />Rule of thumb: Steeping tea for less than 3 minutes will have a slight wake-up effect, more than 3 minutes (I usually do 3.5 minutes with this tea) will activate the "calmer" side of teas.<br /><br />I recommend Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey whole-heartedly - but I guess that is self-evident, too! :-)

review/text: I confess ... I'm not a tea connoisseur; but I do enjoy iced tea and the occasional cup of hot tea.  I've had a couple of orders of this Taylors of Harrogate Earl Gray tea and I really LOVE the additional zing it adds to my iced tea blend (3 family sized bags decaf tea, 4 regular bags green tea, and a generous helping of earl gray in those bags you can get from Amazon for tea and fill with whatever you like.  I think I have it on auto-ship.  I live in Florida, so we have iced tea year round.  Lovely fragrance and taste!  It comes in a foiled (is that a word?) plastic bag in a tin.  I keep it in the original bag, folded over and sealed with a clamp, in the tin and have not noticed any loss in fragrance or flavor.  The tin is very nice and, of course, re-usable.

It allows you to experiment with amounts, steep times, and temperatures more easily, so you can make the cup that is perfect to your own personal taste preference.<br />Taylor's of Harrogate ships at a decent speed and tastes great.<br /><br />Plus the tin cans can be used for any type of craft thingy once they are empty, if you are into that sort of thing.

review/summary: Neither here nor there
review/text: I found this Earl Grey to be a bit undecided, if that makes sense.  Although it smells beautifully of bergamot in the can, once brewed it's too weak for a flavored black tea but too strong compared to a green or white e.g. Teavana's Earl Grey White which has a lighter flavor but has a balance of its own.  Taylor's just doesn't have much body nor flavor and lacks a defined character.  No matter what, it always tastes "watered down".  It gets a bit better with 1.5 tsp per 8oz but it's still unbalanced.  I brew for 3 min.  If you like flavored teas on the "lite" side you might enjoy it.  It's somewhat similar to Lady Grey which I found too weak as well.

review/text: This coffee is a good blend, but nothing spectacular.  The fact that it is organic and fair trade are the main reason I order it, though of course it also has to be a tasty enough product.  I add a dash of cinnamon during teh brewing process, and that livens it up a bit.

review/summary: Cinnamony
review/text: Opening this coffee bag didn't fill my kitchen with a strong vanilla-cinnamon aroma.  Nor did the bag emit much of a strong scent.  But once I tasted this medium roast I could tste the cinnamon.  It wasn't an overbearing taste, either, but just strong enough to be aware of the spice.  I couldn't even taste much vanilla.  So, for those of you who prefer vanilla over cinnamon, there may be other brands or flavors better for you.  For those of you who like a nicely-spiced coffee, though, this is a great blend.<br /><br />Just like the bag states, this is low acid coffee. The grounds are medium brown. I used this coffee in my cappuccino maker and created a mild espresso drink, with a bit of crema, flavored with cinnamon.  It wasn't too strong and definitely not bitter.  I like the subtle flavors of this blend very much.<br /><br />I've had other Bean Coffee flavors and like them all for their consistent roasts and flavors.  This seasonal drink is another such blend to add to Bean Coffee's quality roasts.  It's an ideal coffee for a cold winter afternoon, when one wants to sit back and savor a coffee for its flavor, rather than for its jolt.

review/text: The coffee has a very "coffee-ey" flavor which is by no means overpowered by the hint of vanilla and spice.  It tastes like an expensive cup of coffee but the low acid is really smooth going down (and it doesn't taste bitter the next day).<br />highly recommend this to anyone that just likes good coffee!<br />and for people who are skeptical of flavored coffees which can often taste very artificial this one is subtle and only hints at some vanilla and spice which pleasantly waft when you brew a fresh cup!

These and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDB3YY">Reese Artichoke Hearts, Extra Small Size, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  Both were well worth what I paid at an average of $.99 a can, compared to $3+ in my local grocery store.<br /><br />These are great chopped up and added to salads, but my favorite way to eat them is to top them with a stuffing and bake.  This is an easy one:<br /><br />3 Slices French bread cubed<br />2 Artichoke bottoms chopped<br />1 clove garlic minced<br />1/8 cup fresh parsley chopped<br />1/4 cup Romano cheese grated<br />1/2 tsp dried Italian Seasoning<br />5 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br />1/2 cup chicken broth<br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />Combine everything except 3 tablespoons of oil, top each Artichoke Bottom with a couple spoonfuls of mixture.  Then drizzle remaining oil over them. I also sprinkle on a little extra cheese.  Bake for 15 minutes at 425*F.

review/summary: old woody bottoms
review/text: I was injured early this summer so I've had to turn to the internet and the mail to get the vegetables I used to be able to buy fresh.  I was amazed to find these at such a great price, but I should have remembered, that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I've used two of the cans of the 12 I bought and both cans had the same problea. The bottoms are from old, woody artichokes and are very poorly cleaned.  Once you scrape off all the inedible woody tissue, you only have about 40% usable artichoke meat.  I won't be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Delicious and convenient!
review/text: I adore artichokes, but waiting for them to cook and then cleaning all the thistle bits out just doesn't fit into most weekdays for me (or most other people, I assume).  These artichoke bottoms taste great and are super convenient and versatile.  I personally use them most frequently to make a healthy, low carb version of eggs benedict - simply grill or saute two artichoke bottoms and use them in place of the English muffin (and leave off that hollandaise, hehe).  As other reviewers mentioned, they are also great for stuffing and baking.  There are about 6 bottoms in each can, although sometimes you get only 5 if they're larger, as it's based on weight.

review/summary: Easy Artichokes
review/text: Bottoms are the best part of the artichoke.  With fresh artichokes you have to go to a lot of trouble to get rid of the choke and the leaves. These are ready to go.  Just drain the liquid from the can - heat and serve - or use them right out of the can without heating.  I like them sprinkled with onion powder and a little salad dressing.  I use a home made dressing of lemon juice, dried mustard and agave syrup.  One review complained that the artichokes were woody.  On occasion, I have found a little woodiness in one or two out of the whole can.  It is easy to cut that part out.  The woodiness is a fairly rare problem.  If you like artichokes but  hate the work and mess of preparation - this is for you.

review/text: While I don't particularly care for the citric and/or ascorbic acid  found in cans and jars of artichokes (Reese has no more or no less than others), my sister, who is an artichoke nut, loves the taste. Gives it a summery tang she says. That these are different from the fresh artichokes she scarfs down doesn't bother her in the least. She is rapidly going through the case of Reese I bought in no time (she really likes the convenience). So, even though canned artichokes aren't my favorite, they rate 5 stars.

review/summary: Mediocre is the only appropriate word...
review/text: One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee.  Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them.  I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it.  It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out.  I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot.  The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves.  While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste.  There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase.  We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets.

review/text: Well you're not going to get truly exceptional tasting hot chocolate from any K-cup but of the varieties I have tested so far, the Swiss Miss comes the closest to approximating the taste of rich, milk based hot chocolate.  To get the best experience, I recommend using the smallest brewing size and then I add additional milk to mine, this drastically improves the flavor and add a little whip cream and it works in a pinch.

review/text: I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews of various K-Cup hot cocoas, but I was pleasantly surprised that the Swiss Miss brand lived up to it's conventional powder-in-a-pouch brother.  I use it on the smaller cup settings, but that seems to be a perfect amount for the kids anyway.  The only "drawback" is that you should run a small cup cycle without a K-Cup just to rinse out the equipment before your next cup of something different.  You aren't brewing here, just mixing, so it does leave a little cocoa in the cup basket.  Not a big deal.  Overall a hit!  Quick, tasty and no mess!

review/summary: Tastes like plastic, waste of money
review/text: These cups are not worth the minor convenience they provide.  The hot chocolate tastes like plastic... I can only assume it's a result of hot water hitting the plastic of the cup.  (Maybe the coffee ones don't give off this foul taste because of the filter inside?  I don't know.)  I can't even finish using the cups in the intended way; rather, I have taken to peeling off the foil, dumping the mix into my mug, and running a cycle of just water through the Keurig.  Nearly as simple, without the nasty taste.  I won't be buying these again.  I'll stick to using the normal packets and running aforementioned cycle of just water.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.

review/text: These swiss miss k cups don't really work, there is at least 1/3 of the chocolate powder left in the k cup. I tried tapping the cup to get things stirred up before placing it in the machine, no luck. The hot chocolate is weak even on the smallest setting. It also has a bit of an aftertaste. I'll keep looking, this one is not a keeper.

The Swiss Miss K-Cups are better, but still not something I will purchase again.  The aroma is pleasant, as is the initial taste.  At 8 ounces, the drink was a bit weak and watery so this is probably best used at 6 ounces.  There is a definite aftertaste of artificial sweetener; while it is not strong, it does linger.

review/text: Okay so I found out about these two weeks ago when my mother brought them home from our local Hanford's supermarket. I have to say is that they taste amazing! I think they out rank in my books the cafe escapes because of the taste quality they bring. Now everyone has a different opinion because it's proven that everyone's taste buds are not the same (even in genetics of people i the same family!), so my opinion could differ due to just our own taste buds.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is, I think these k-cups are great! The only issue I have is this: they need to package mini marshmallows into each box, attached to the bottom of each k-cup lol this way everyone can have marshmallows or not just like the original packages. Other than that, the recipe for this flavor of k-cup hot chocolate is awesome! Worth the money :)

It is very hard to find so when I found them made by Swiss Miss in K-cups it was a Win Win! Shipment was fast and received right on time. Note when making a cup: You should not use a full cup of water when brewing the cocoa because it will be too watery with no taste. But once we got the right amount of water the kids where fine and enjoyed it. I would buy again, good product!

Hot chocolate from a packet is not my favorite, but it is way better than this... and cheaper per cup, last time I checked.

review/summary: Great "wheat berries", i.e. whole kernel wheat
review/text: I recently received a Vitamix Blender, and have been experimenting with using it to grind my own flour at home. Once you have tried *real* whole grain flour, you will never go back! The pricing of this 25 pound bag, with delivery, is better than I have been able to find anywhere, and the grains make a great, strong whole-grain flour. Note that this is not flour, but actual wheat seeds (often referred to as "wheat berries").<br /><br />In addition, the grains are fertile, meaning that you can use them to make sprouted grain. Or if you are a survivalist, you can plant the grains and actually grow a crop!<br /><br />Another main advantage of whole grain is its shelf life. There are reports that 2000 year old grain has been found and germinated! In any case, if properly stored, you can expect a 5-10 year shelf life from whole grain, as opposed to a much shorter shelf life with flour. I purchsed a 5-gallon bucket with a "gamma 2" lid for storing the grain, and I'm confident that it will keep nicely fresh for a long time to come.

review/summary: Great River Organic Wheat - Great grain at a great price!
review/text: I decided to grind my own flour because in our two person household, the bags of flour go stale before I can use it all.  I also store grain now for long term storage because the economy in our area has declined, as a hedge against inflation and unemployment.  I was very impressed with Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Wheat and Soft White Wheat berries.  I called the customer service number before purchasing the grain to ask about issues related to long term storage - when the grain was harvested and how long it had been in storage - so that I could put proper dating for use on it when it arrived.  All the grain was the new crop grain, having been harvested August, 2011.  I had also ordered rye berries, and was concerned how long rye could be stored, using "superpails" with mylar bags/oxygenators/dessicants.  They answered all my questions thoroughly.  They even told me the best days to place my order so that I would have the best selection and price on Amazon!  I was very impressed with their customer service department.  I also had concerns that the grain be clean and free of bad kernels or any mold, mildew, or extraneous matter, as my husband was on the heart transplant list and after transplant suppressed immune response is an issue.  The rye and wheat was absolutely beautiful.  I saw no broken or bad grains at all, no chaff or foreign matter, and the products were essentially dust free.  All in all, I was very happy with the rye and wheat I purchased. Great River Organic Milling normally has free super saver shipping for their products on Amazon. Shipping was easy to track and extremely fast:  I ordered my grain on a Friday evening around 7PM, and by Saturday 4PM the next day I had my grain, even though I had been told it may take 5-7 days to get the shipment.  Great job!  I will be ordering more!

review/summary: So happy I started grinding my own grain!
review/text: This product is wonderful! I don't have anything to compare it to, other than comparing freshly ground wheat flour from these berries and store bought wheat flour. My husband and I were previously buying wheat flour from our coop in the bulk section but had been wanting to get a grain grinder to start grinding our own wheat for nutritional value and freshness. When I grind this wheat to use for bread etc, it performs so much better than the already ground store bought flour. I had much better lift in yeast bread I made a couple weeks ago! I pretty much bake everything from scratch: our sandwich bread, cornbread, granola (that has a little bit of flour in it), desert breads, cakes, hamburger buns etc., so I just keep this in half gallon mason jars on top of some shelves. They look nice and since 8 cups of whole berries makes about 12 cups of flour, it really saves space too. I called several local food stores and could not find anyone who could beat this price. This shipped so fast that I couldn't imagine what was in the box. I will be ordering again!

review/text: This WAS a great product. It was great tasting and it had a crazy low amount of carbs compared to most anything else out there. For people who need to manage their carb intake, this was a real treat and there wasn't much else out there that compared. There is, I found on receiving my latest shipment, a new formula and the carb count has almost doubled from 8g per serving to 15g. This might not matter to most people but for some it can be a critical issue. I imagine it still tastes great with all the extra sugar and milk or whatever they've added but, unfortunately, this product no longer serves the niche it once did. Where it once was this great-tasting, low-carb indulgence, it's now just one of ten million sugary things out there.

You have to acquire a taste for it because when you taste it for the first time, it has a slightly bitter taste. It took me less than a week to start enjoying the taste.

review/text: This is my favorite Chocolate!!<br />I hope they re-stock soon!!<br />Not for Kids or Adults that like milk kind!!<br />Kids usually hate this kind. It's good for you, that's probably why!<br />I also like Dagoba Organic Dark Chocolate - New Moon , 74% cocoa, 12 Units / 2 ozmore cocoa the better for heart:0<br />Don't have Coffee or Chocolate anymore :D

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate
review/text: This is excellent chocolate. However, the bulk price here of over $3 a bar is high. Stores local to me sell it for $2.30, and that's not in bulk.

review/summary: Great for your Health and Delicious Too
review/text: I bought these bars because of their high content of Cocoa and I have been very pleased with them. I drop a piece in my coffee every morning and makes the coffee tastes great. In the afternoon I use another square and let it melt slowly in my mouth as I drink tea.  These are two delicious ways to use this healthy chocolate.
