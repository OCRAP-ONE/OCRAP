review/text: I am a tea-aholic. I tried this tea one morning, just to see what it tasted like, and it was not bad for this type of stuff, if you know what I mean. I actually kind of enjoyed the taste. So I started using it every day and let me say, it made me go regularly. It's very natural, but it actually works in helping you go regularly an is not overkill.

review/summary: Too much cramping for me.
review/text: I purchased this because I am on a medication (Wellbutrin) that has completely stopped everything pretty drastically. Despite that situation, I still experienced alot of cramping the greater part of the next day after drinking the tea before bed, something that I didn't think would happen because of the chamomile, etc. in the tea.  I suppose 'it worked', but it was just very very uncomfortable for me.  I will probably use this again because of my situation and when I have a free day at home of course, but wouldn't recommend for someone with just mild issues.

review/text: This is the best black tea I've ever had that came out of a teabag.  It has a distinct and rich tangy flavor that is almost reminiscent of an expensive bourbon.  Most other brands seem highly unsatisfactory after getting used to this delicious tea, so I plan to keep some around all the time.  It's a little expensive but nowhere near as expensive as going to a cafe or tea house to get a great cup of tea.

review/text: This is a really nice tea and I love the beautiful packaging.  I wanted to love everything else about it but I kept tasting a slightly sour note in some cups... I thought it might be the milk I'd used, but many brands and quarts of milk later, I still notice it sometimes.  It is still really good tea but I will probably go back to Twinings English Breakfast after this box as it is just as good and a bit cheaper, albeit with less attractive packaging.  I also ordered the Harney & Sons English Breakfast tea sachets and those do not have the occasional sour aftertaste but are a bit more expensive for an everyday tea and not quite as good as Kusmi teas for special occasions.

review/text: From the name and the description, I was expecting a creamy drink.  This is just coffee with a little caramel flavoring, barely enough to taste.  I'd rather have plain coffee than this.  I was looking for something really creamy with a nice caramel flavoring.  I finally found it - Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino.  It is exactly what I wanted.  It's sweet and creamy and I don't have to add a thing to make it taste the way I want it to. Great for a special treat to myself. And if you like that kind of drink, I also recommend Cafe Escapes Chai Tea Latte.  It has a wonderful aroma and flavor too.

review/text: Even though there are several hundred different blends now in the K-cup line I have become fond of the Green Mountain brand.  This new one to me has become one of my favorites.  I always drink it black so adding flavored creamers is not something I do.  There is just enough vanilla cream in this to give it some taste and the caramel adds just enough to make it special.  If I am having only one cup, no matter what time of day, this is my choice usually.<br /><br />My wife isn't really a hot coffee fan but we drink it iced, this is one of her favorites on ice also.

review/summary: It's pretty good for certain things
review/text: This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences.  It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour.  Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls.  If you don't mind that, then good for you!  (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.)  I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough.  Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it.  I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it.

review/text: With a son recently diagnosed with Autism, I was faced with revamping his diet to a gluten-free, dairy-free diet.  I tried mixing different gluten free flours (rice, potato, tapioca) myself, but it's not nearly as good as this flour blend. I really think the addition of the bean flours makes the difference. I made chocolate chip cookies (dark chocolate chips--no dairy)with it and served it to my daughter's girl scout troop, and they couldn't tell the difference.  That's all the validation I needed.

review/text: This flour stinks of Garbanzo beans, and I like Garbanzo beans on any other occasion, but for some reason the smell is so strong when ground, I have learned to read the labels of GF products and if beans are the first ingredient I will not but it.  My guess is some people are more sensitive to it then others, it almost makes me gag when the flour is wet.  I do have friends who don't mind it or don't notice it, but me and my non Celiac boyfriend think it's nasty.  Since we love to bake, I have found that equal parts white rice flour and Tapioca flour with a teaspoon of xanthem gum work great in place of flour.

review/summary: Most like Regular Bread
review/text: We used this for Pancakes Christmas morning. Personally I did not like the bean flour at first, I thought it tasted like soap. My non-gluten-free family, however, LOVED it and *insisted* I use it from now on. They said it was not as gritty as rice flour and had the texture of "real" bread. As for the taste, they didn't know what I was talking about. They loved it.<br /><br />I tried this one again, and snuck some into cookies, then tried the Bob's Red Mill GF Chocolate Cake mix with the bean flour, and it's grown on me. I stand corrected and I am actually kicking myself for not allowing myself to grow a taste for it sooner.<br /><br />It's opened a new world of Gluten free baking for me just when I thought I had it all together with the rice flour.<br />I have gone back now and looked at my "Gluten Free Gourmet" book and have a new eye for the recipes requiring bean flour.<br /><br />It took our stomachs minimal time getting used to the beans, if you catch my drift, but after the first few batches of baked goods (about 3 in a week) we have adjusted.<br /><br />We feel better after using this mix because of the fiber and protein, as opposed to all that starch and empty carbs of the the white rice flour. I don't have to pass round the laxative anymore (a common reality of switching to the GF diet.)<br /><br />Make some pancakes (2 cups of the flour mix, 1 tsp baking soda, an egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 tsp xantham gum--thin with water or milk to desired consistency)and ease yourself into it with butter and syrup.  Of course the flour smells like beans (duh), but the flavor of the beans is mild after it has been cooked.

review/text: This is a great GF flour, use it in place of white flour.  Only thing I noticed is sometimes you need to add more than a 1:1 ratio in recipes calling for wheat flour to get the stiffness you need.  Also the addition of Xanthan gum makes for better consistency using this flour.  The back of the packet of flour tells you how much to use depending on the type of finished product you're making.  A bag of Xanthan gum is pricey, but the amounts you need (ie 1/4 tsp for each cup of flour for cookies) is minimal, so it will last for oodles of bags of this flour.  I use the Bob's red mill Xanthan gum too.

I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called "all purpose flour" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit.<br /><br />I tried using these to make cookies, and it was horrible...way too much after taste of the bean flavor. Also, the fava bean thing kind of scares me too - apparently kids should not eat it because of possible health risks if they have certain genetic dispositions. Bob's Red Mill has some great stuff that is gluten free, but this one should be labeled as "garbanzo/fava bean flour", not all purpose.

review/text: Can you imagine drowning in your kitchen and someone throwing you a life-line? This is kinda how I felt when the doctor put my son on a gluten free diet for life and then I discovered Bobs Redmill all-purpose flour. For a mother of five and on a tight budget I knew we could not afford the pre-mixed packages as often. I ran out and bought a small bag to try it out first. Now the wet dough does have a strong beany odor and is very different to work with than regular wheat dough, but the recipes were just simple, and the beany smell was NOT there once it was baked. Ive been using it for pizza crusts, loaf sandwhich bread, pancakes, waffles, corn bread, and banana bread. (lots of recipes on Bobs website) Just follow the instructions-room temp. ingredients, add xantham gum, and pre-heated oven. Ive had no problems and all five of my kids have not complained once with our new baked goods! Then to see it on Amazons subscribe and save I was so happy to save an extra percentage and get free shipping. I am also ordering the Annies GF Mac n Cheese, the GF Nut thins carckers, and the GF Nature Valley Almond Crunch bars. Slowly Im building up my amazon subscriptions and actually my time in the specialty stores reading small print will soon be very minimal. Thanks to Amazon!

review/summary: Useful, but Leaves a Bitter After-taste
review/text: I have used Bob's Mill All-Purpose Gluten-free flour a few dozen times.  It is affordable, easy to use, and it is high in fiber, something people with Celiac Disease crave and desperately need in their diet.<br /><br />I have used it for making pancakes, cookies, and bread.  It has good form and volume.<br /><br />One drawback is having garbanzo bean flour in the ingredients.  You have to use a lot of sweetener:  brown sugar, white sugar, honey, and/or stevia to counter the bitterness of bean flours.<br /><br />Still, it is nice not to have to combine several flours (ie tapioca, sorghum, xanthum gum, and rice flours with potato or corn starch) from scratch.  This product is healthful, convenient, cost-effective, and robust, but the flavor downside may have some people searching his competitors.  There are gluten-free flours that are far better tasting.

review/summary: Good for much, not for all
review/text: This is really a baking mix, and it's not a bad one by any stretch. I'd rather use sorghum, tapioca or corn starch for making sauces or thickening soups, though. What's really nice about Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose GF Flour is that it allows for easy substitution in your Betty Crocker cookbook. I wouldn't recommend it for making yeast breads, though I prefer it for quick breads - muffins, cornbread, and the like.<br /><br />As with any gluten-free flour, you have to make some adjustments, both in terms of the recipe and in terms of your expectations of taste and consistency. Without gluten, baked goods won't hold together as well, so you need a binding agent. Xantham gum is best with this flour, but guar gum will also work.<br /><br />Taste ... you really need a strong flavor in the recipe to cover up the aftertaste. Dark chocolate? You won't notice the bean or tapioca flour aftertaste. Fruits? No problem - I've made delicious blueberry muffins and dark chocolate-cranberry muffins. Sweet taste? Aforementioned cornbread was delicious - especially if you make it with buttermilk. Snickerdoodles? I'd start with sorghum honestly.<br /><br />Consistency - this is a dense, heavy flour. Sifting is essential. If you don't sift, your recipes will turn out still, but they'll be thick and heavy. You'll also need to add extra liquid (milk or oil or egg substitute) to help the dough hold together, rise and gain volume. This rules out yeast doughs for me - I think you can successfully make a bread but I prefer a millet-sorghum-tapioca-potato starch loaf (I also like the slightly spicy flavor of millet).<br /><br />All in all, this should be a pantry staple for the gluten-free household, though keep supplemental flours to experiment with.

review/summary: My go to pre mixed flour...
review/text: I used this flour regularly these days.. When my son was diagnosed with Celiac and myself with lifelong Gluten Intolerance I learned to mix flours pretty quickly. But mixing flours and keeping them fresh is a difficult task with a 5 1/2 year child under the autism umbrella. Initially, the bean flavor of the flour was not my favorite.. But, I have learned to use it under so many applications it is hardly noticeable... I have written down some of my recipes using Bob's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour mix here.. [...] I use Bob's for my Pumpkin and Morning Muffins as well as Vegan Bread..<br />My son and I are Gluten/Wheat, Dairy, Casein, Soy, Corn and Egg free at this point. So, It is very nice to have a mix that is nutritious and readily available with all the from scratch cooking I have to do..

review/summary: Great Texture But...
review/text: Pros: Perfect Texture<br /><br />Cons: Strange Taste<br /><br />I made my first small loaf of bread in my bread machine using this flour yesterday evening (2/18/2010).<br /><br />The result was a light golden-brown, very soft, sandwich-type bread that is easy to slice. I simply loved the texture of how the bread came out.  It's perfect for making sandwiches and toast.  However, it does have a strange taste, which I guess is caused by the bean flour as everyone mentioned.<br /><br />I would've given this flour 5 stars if it tasted better.  I gave it 3 stars because I love the texture so much.  The texture is just what I had been looking for in a gluten-free bread but I'm not a big fan of the taste.<br /><br />I usually buy Pamela's flours which I absolutely love, but when I made her bread machine bread recipe, it was a bit too dense for my liking. Plus Pamela's is a bit out of my budget right now.  I bought the Bob's All-Purpose because it is sold in bulk at my local health food store for $1.99/lb. which is a great buy for celiacs/gluten intolerants on a budget.<br /><br />I'm the gluten-sensitive one in the family but surprisingly, my daughter who is a very picky eater really enjoyed this bread.<br /><br />This flour is worth the buy if you can get used to the taste.

review/summary: Good for baking
review/text: My wife has been on a gluten-free diet the last few years.  We stumbled on this product in the grocery store and have stuck with it ever since.  She mostly uses it to make banana bread, muffins, etc., but also uses it to bread pork chops and chicken.<br /><br />It tastes fine to me, no detectable aftertaste or anything, and it has the right amount of protein so that baked goods mostly rise the way they should.<br /><br />Recently our grocer stopped carrying this, so I turned to Amazon.  It's exactly the same price as the grocery store, and my wife can bake stuff again.

review/summary: Awesome in baked goods!
review/text: After reading the reviews I was leery of trying this flour.  I purchased a single bag to try, and I'm so glad I did!  Generally most of the gluten free flours have very little nutritional value.  I know this is true of regular all-purpose flour as well, but considering I can't have regular multi-grain/whole-grain things I figured that if I could find a gluten free flour with extra nutrition in it, it couldn't hurt.  Generally I've used this in a ratio of 1:2 or 2:1 with regular gluten free all purpose flour; I've never tried using it just on it's own based on the reviews here.  I've been very pleasantly surprised.  It's helped the regular flour retain more moisture in cooking so I haven't had to rely on adding much xantham gum.  I haven't been able to taste the beans or an aftertaste at all.  It might be due to the mixing with other flour, the amount of spice I use in my baked goods, or I just have tastebuds that don't notice or don't mind.  My husband is pretty picky though and he's eaten baked goods using this and hasn't mentioned anything about a bean flavor.  I'd suggest giving this a try if you're willing to mix it up with another flour and if you tend to like spiced baked goods.

review/summary: Great for baking...
review/text: I really do like this flour for baking. Yes, it has a beany flavor, but only at first, it goes away once you bake your items. I can see how someone who is particularly sensitive to that flavor would not like it, though. I myself have had good results with it and just made some *awesome* gluten-free Blondies. No complaints from family members about beany-ness. I made bread with this flour and was not all that happy with how it turned out, but I am new at gluten-free baking, so it may just take some adjustment. I am especially glad that it does not contain xanthan gum, which I will not use because it is made from corn and is at high risk for being GMO. I just add guar gum when needed. But it does so well at baking cookies and muffins that I will definitely make it a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I bought this flour specifically to see if I could make my favorite chocolate chip cookies with it, Toll House.  There is a recipe on the back of the bag, but I didn't use it.  I substituted the Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Flour for the same measurement of regular flour in the Toll House recipe.  Other than that I followed it exactly and I added chopped pecans.  The cookies are delicious and you cannot tell they are gluten free at all.  The only difference I noticed is they tend to fall apart easily if removed from the pan too quickly.  If allowed to cool completely (about 10 mins) prior to removing from pan, they hold up perfectly.  The Bob's Red Mill Chocolate Chip Recipe calls for Xanthan gum which is expensive and I don't feel is necessary when using the Nestle Toll House recipe.  The texture was perfect and very similar to the wheat flour version.  These cookies actually reminded me of the first chocolate chip cookies I ever had.  The batter melted around the chips as they baked, making it look like the chips were poking through the surface of the cookie.  For the best flavor possible always use real butter for chocolate chip cookies.

review/summary: Good quality GF flour
review/text: We recently went GF for health reasons and I stopped baking.  It's been hard.  Purchased Bob's GF All Purpose Flour at store to try along with Pamela's GF Ultimate Baking Mix.  I read the reviews and sifted the Bob's flour before using.  Definitely can taste the bitter/bean flavor if you lick the spatula of cookie or brownie dough, but once cooked I couldn't tell that it was there.  Finished cookies and brownies tasted like they used to with wheat flour.  They were denser than Pamela's for sure, but that's how I remember my brownies tasting.  I really liked it and think it was a great substitute.  Best priced GF flour mix I could find too.

review/summary: BUGGED
review/text: I purchased this flour to make a quick, gluten-free biscuit recipe that a friend gave me and it has worked great for that recipe.  Tonight, I decided to make a peanut-butter pie for my hubbie's birthday.  Feeling lazy, I used the all-purpose flour to make the pie crust (instead of mixing my own flour mixture...which I usually do!).  Well...the garbanzo bean flour so many reviewers have complained about made the dough horribly bitter.  I added some confectioner's sugar to sweeten it.  I ended up with a gooey mass of something that I plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it!  I had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead.  Double the trouble, double the mess!  THAT's what I get for being lazy!  Anyway, the point is, this flour is great for breads, biscuits, rolls, and so forth, but NOT for anything sweet!  Don't use it for your cakes, cookies, pie crusts, etc.  You won't get the flavor you expect!  Perhaps it should be renamed, "Some Purpose Flour!"  Happy baking!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Originally, I emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes.  Well, now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs!  I keep my flour in Lock 'n Lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate (in the same cupboard).  This leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when I got it...  I'll be looking for another flour mix now!

I made cookies with it this weekend and couldn't stand the taste of the batter or the cookie (I was hoping cooking would get rid of the bad taste).  My husband and daughters didn't mind it, but my son and I couldn't eat them.  Be aware that this is an item that can not be returned, so try a bag from the store first.  I unfortunately did not.

review/summary: Only for savory foods
review/text: I made a pie crust for an apple pie out of this flour.  I had to throw the apple pie out.  The flour smells and tastes like garbanzo beans, because that is it's main ingredient.  It worked fine for a curried steak and kidney pie, so I will be only using it for savoury dishes that can be spiced up Middle-Eastern style.  Unless you have celiac disease, I highly recommend spelt flour for sweet baked goods.  It actually tastes better than white wheat.  I usually use whole grain in combination with oats and flaxseed for some healthful muffins, but the white spelt will give you the same baking results as white wheat, particularly if you are making fragile pastry or baked goods with yeast.

I made a batch of pumpkin cookies with this. The consistancy was fine, but the taste was FOUL! Someone else called the taste toxic, and I think that sums it up well. I even tried to make another batch of different cookies to make sure it wasn't something else that was wrong. More horrible cookies...more wasted ingredients. Do not buy this for baking, you'll only end up wasting your time and money.

I cannot stand garbanzo beans in the form of flour.  I like it prepared other ways but in flour it makes EVERYthing taste like it.  I recently made cheese garlic biscuits with it because I assumed that garlic would mask the tast of the garbanzo.  WRONG!!!  :/  It was EXTREMELY noticeable even though I added a lot of extra garlic and cheese.  We ate them because the TEXTURE was nice.  If you have taste issues but like the texture of things, then this baking mix might fly.  BUT if taste is what you are looking for then I would go with Pamela's baking mix or quite frankly, it is easy to make your own.

review/summary: Better than no flour I suppose!
review/text: When my hubby realized he had to eat gluten free, this was one of the first products I tried. VERY disappointed, I can tell you! The baked goods were nothing like I expected, and the beany taste was very off-putting. The bread I made with it collapsed a few minutes out of the oven (as it cooled) and was inedible once cold. The good news is I let it dry out, crumbled it up and used it for breading on baked chicken.<br />I gave up on baked goods for a long while. Then recently I bought "Gluten Free on a Shoestring" and she recommended Better Batter mixes. They are much pricier but taste like the baked goods I am used to.<br />Bob's Mill makes many great products, but I don't care much for this one. Perhaps there are recipes where it shines; I haven't tried any of them.

review/text: After reading the first few chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609611543">Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</a> and after years of joint inflammation (and now difficulty losing weight), I decided to ditch wheat from my diet. Being desperate to get started, I picked up a bag of this flour at a local store as it was the only one available. My husband and I like our pizzas on Saturday night and since the frozen aisle didn't have anything good in gluten free, I decided to make my own crust. As some reviewers said, the bean flavor really ruined the taste! The pizza crust actually came out well and is one of the best I've ever made with any flour texturewise. But I just didn't like the flavor. I plan to use up the rest in another pizza, but this time will add spices like garlic and oregano plus a little more salt and sugar to the crust itself to mask that taste. My advice would be to get Pamela's or Bisquick gluten-free. Both are good and don't have weird aftertastes.

review/summary: Worst flour ever
review/text: I really wanted to love this flour. I really did. I made banana nut muffins, bread, peanut butter and jelly cookies, corn muffins, etc with this flour and it all tasted terrible. Granted, I have to be on a dairy and gluten free diet so things aren't going to taste exactly like they did before but, my baked goods were infinitely better when I was only using gluten free oat flour. I bought a couple of 44oz bags because I love Bob's and I thought I found THE flour that would make baking fun and delicious again. I've thrown the rest away so that was $20 or so down the drain - awesome. The bean taste is so strong it cuts through everything. There is no mellowing whatsoever. I've tried adding extra sugar, extra vanilla extract, extra anything with flavor just to lessen the bean-y aftertaste or make it go away. No such luck. I'm sure this flour is good for something (can't think of anything though). If you don't mind a strong bean-y taste (and the aftertaste really lingers), then go ahead and buy this flour. Otherwise, find something else (and please send me suggestions!!!) or make your own blend at home.

review/summary: Overwhelming bean smell!
review/text: Ever since my fiance has been diagnosed with celiac's, I have been trying to adapt the numerous bread, cake, cookie, and other pastry recipes he loves to be gluten-free. I usually make my own mix, which gives me greater control in adapting the flours to the different types of baked goods (e.g., higher starch content, lower protein). I have, however, gotten a little tired of stocking up to almost 2 dozen types of GF flours, and so I decided to give pre-mixed flours a try. I tried Bob's Red Mill since I've used all their other products and have been really impressed by them. I used this flour mix to make a chocolate cake. When it came time to fold in the flour, the beany smell was so overwhelming it really made me want to barf. I felt so disgusted by the batter, which I have worked quite a long time, and felt I ruined the cake. Since the cake was for my fiance's birthday, I didn't want him to not have a cake, so I went ahead and baked it. The beany smell subsided a lot while the cake baked, and the cake took almost 10 minutes longer to be done )compared when I used to make it with gluten flours). There was an aftertaste, which, while subtle, can be clearly tasted (metallic/plasticky). If baking spiced cakes/heavily flavored baked goods, then I guess this is fine in a pinch. However, for delicate stuff, this GF APF mix will ruin the experience for you

review/summary: Good for baking
review/text: After not having access to a kitchen while in my law school's dorms last year, I was happy this year to have an apartment where I could bake again. Unfortunately, I found out when classes started again that one of my dear friends had discovered over the summer that she has a gluten intolerance. Since I bake to share, I resolved to find a way to bake for her as well. I found Bob's Red Mill flour at the grocery store and figured I'd give it a shot; I didn't realize I'd need xanthan gum, so it took a second trip to the store before I was actually ready to bake. Everything I've made so far has turned out perfectly. I haven't noticed a strong bean flavor at all, even when making a white cake for my friend's birthday last week. It didn't turn out quite as fluffy as I would have hoped, but it tasted fine and was plenty moist. (It was a new recipe anyway, so that could be why.) Overall I've been pleased with the product and its availability. While I kind of wish they'd just include the xanthan gum, they do recommend different amounts for different baked goods so I can understand why they'd sell it separately (beyond the obvious potential moneygrubbing reasons).

review/summary: The Garbanzo flour kind of ruins it
review/text: I love Bob's Red Mill and as a gluten-intolerant person, am very thankful for their products. Over time since I've GF I've learned that some GF flours taste funky, sour or just plain nasty. Garbanzo bean flour fits the bill. It is so overpowering. Other than that the texture of the baked goods using this mix is good. Just be aware of the garbanzo flour, it's a bit much. My search is still on for a good GF baking mix.

review/summary: Dry Bean Insulation Mix
review/text: I like some of the Bob's products, but this one makes a baked good that I would describe as "dry bean insulation". The texture is passable, almost, but kind of mealy. It's not quite crumbly because it comes out on the hard/dense side. It's like foamy-consistency GF stuff, but harder, so it makes me think of that poufy yellow insulation stuff that they use in houses. Hard but foamy, somehow.<br /><br />But the main thing is, the bean flavor is so strong. I can see trying to mask it with other things, but I think it comes through even very strong flavors. For example, we make homemade baked beans (pretty strong maple/bacon type flavor, the way I make them) and have a thin slice of toast with grilled tomato, those beans, and butter on top for breakfast. Even though I am eating this bread with beans on top, I can taste the beans in the bread OVER the baked beans. That's just stupid. I can understand some people who have not tried many of the GF all purpose flour mixes out there might find this mix acceptable, and it's certainly easier to use than making your own from scratch, but I would rather skip bread totally than eat something made from this stuff. My suggestion? Try Pamela's all purpose mixes if you're baking, and try Udi's brand if you don't have the time (they make a genuinely tasty bagel that's not a hockey puck).<br /><br />I even find the bean taste too strong when a cup of this is added to another, non-beany mix, because we ran out. In fact, that's typically the only way we'd use it now, because some got bought by mistake and when we run out of good stuff we forget how much we dislike this stuff and mix in a cup or half a cup to "bridge the gap". I would not consider myself very flavor-sensitive -- I'll basically eat anything, and I actually like beans a lot -- but the flavor is just super intense. Maybe if that was all you could eat for a year you could get used to it, but why bother?

review/text: As soon as I opened this the smell was overpowering. It has such a terrible smell. My youngest and I got the batter for chocolate chip cookies all put together and then he wanted a taste. He always wants a taste of the cookie batter before we put it in the oven. He took one taste and ran to the sink and starting spitting and then put his mouth under the faucet. I decided to take a taste and could't believe how terrible it was. I would avoid this if you are looking for a gluten-free flour. There has to be a better brand.

review/summary: Bean Flours are tooooo strong!
review/text: I like Bob's flours, and I've recently gone gluten-free. I bought this mix on recommendation and I really don't like it. The fava and garbanzo bean flavor is way too strong for my taste. Perhaps I just need to have patience while my palette adjusts. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is just starting off gluten free. I'd rather recommend something that has flours that mimic the flavors of wheat like sorghum, buckwheat, tapioca, and almond, etc.

review/summary: Better-than-nothing
review/text: I found this product in the health food section of the local grocery store.  All I can say is thank God I bought the smallest size before ordering a larger quantity.  This is at-best a barely adequate substitute for regular all-purpose flour.  It imparts a strong bean taste to baked goods.  Is that what you're really looking for flavor-wise?  I don't think so.  Sorry,  this  might be good in savory dishes, but as far as desserts or sweet snacks--it's a dud.<br /><br />In terms of texture, I found it to be too grainy.  But in all defense to the product, most GF flours are not really the same thing as regular wheat flour in terms of texture.  That's why virtually all the GF recipes recommend adding xanthan gum.  And on this point--since they all recommend adding the xanthan, why don't they just put it in the flour to begin with?  Or at least include a packet of it in the box (Heaven knows they charge enough for the flour--would a packet of xanthan gum be too much to ask?).<br /><br />I was hoping I had found a solution to the gluten problem of regular wheat flour in this product.  I didn't and am still ISO an adequate substitute.

review/summary: Great Texture GF but not for sensitive tastebuds
review/text: This all purpose mix lends itself wonderfully to the Bette Hagman's The Gluten Free Gourmet Bakes Bread recipes. I see a lot of persons here have a problem with the strong bean flavour.  This may not be suitable for making absolutely plain breads but rather breads that are flavoured.  When I make hamburger buns I use treacle (or rather molasses)in the recipe. I also use sesame seeds.  My son loves it and I think that it tastes great.  The bread that this will make also has the most wonderful texture.  If you want a softer white bread type texture add some sorghum flour.  You will be in heaven.  Don't hesitate to try it but just use things like raisons and dried fruit, cinnamon or even savoury items.  You just might like it!

review/text: New to the GF world as of 12/10.  Already tired of the bad taste and smell from GF flours.  Bob's Red Mill products are so easy to find that of course it was the first one I purchased and tried.  Using a mixture of this flour with some salt and pepper for dusting chicken turned out really well.  Next I tried using it in muffins and biscuits as I would have my old non-gluten free flours.  Horrible.  I have been doing a lot of research into this and find it to be products that contain fava beans or other bean flours are just not right for substituting for your old non-gf flour.  I just tried Pamela's and loved it, as close to the old way things tasted before being diagnosed.

review/summary: Bad Aftertaste - better alternatives for same $
review/text: Bob's has done a good job making a wide variety of gluten free flours available for those of us with dietary needs. However, this particular blend is not worth the money.<br /><br />I believe it's the fava beans, but whatever it is, one of the ingredients leaves that nasty, "ugh this definitely gluten free" aftertaste. Don't bake with this stuff - no amount of sugar will cover the nasty taste!<br /><br />There are better alternatives -<br />baking: King Arthur Flour and/or Gluten Free Pantry AP flour are really good options. KAF is the expensive one but you will not be able to tell a taste difference hardly at all. GFP is cheaper and still tastes pretty good.<br /><br />general cooking: you can usually get away with using corn flour (masa harina, look for Maseca brand) if you don't want to use real AP flour, which is pretty cheap and easy to find at the grocery. Otherwise, you could use Bob's rice, potato, etc flours and make your own blend. But I wouldn't use this prepackaged one - gross!

It turned out to be cheaper than individually buying all the gluten-free flours and starches too.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with this flour and use it cup-for-cup in place of wheat flour in all my recipes.  I've made many kinds of cookies, cornbread, pizza crust, brownies, pie crust, quick breads, etc. (with the addition of the recommended amount of xanthan gum added in) and they've all been great!  People haven't even know my baked goods were GF until I told them.  :)<br /><br />I haven't had much luck making rolls or breads with this flour though.  They've turned out too dense IME, but YMMV.

Everything I have made with this flour as a replacement in a regular recipe for wheat flour has turned out delicious. You do need to add the correct portion of xanthan gum or guar gum, but the side of the bag gives you the idea of how much you'll need. I have used this to make cookies, bread (you will need to cook the bread longer than the recipe calls for, I have found), muffins, and pizza crust. It has all turned out great. Highly recommend this flour blend. I signed up for subscribe and save so that I never run out. Plus, it is a much cheaper alternative to buying the flour in the grocery store.

review/summary: Good flour, nice taste, but a recipe would help?
review/text: I have tried a couple of the mixes, and they are very cake like, so I thought I'd try again, making my own. All gluten free recipes seem to call for a mix of flours, so at least this gave you the mix, without having to spend a fortune on lots of flours.<br />Recipes - this is the problem though isn't it??? I had tried various of my own flour mixes, and various recipes, and it is always a disaster, which is why I went for the mixes in the first place...<br /><br />Why doesn't the packet come with a recipe? The packet states how much Xantham Gum you need, then says yeasted breads are difficult(!), you MAY require eggs, vinegar, and POSSIBLY more liquid.... May? Possibly?<br />There is a recipe on the website - very similar to a recipe I have already. But another disaster - in the trash.<br /><br />My husband found this<br />[...]<br />and it worked well. Rose beautifully. Still a little cake like, but more like bread than the mixes.<br />But yet again, not like real bread - is it really too much to expect? (The mix I had in England made gorgeous white fluffy bread - 95% the same as 'normal' bread. So I know it is possible to have 'normal' gluten free white sandwich bread.)<br /><br />Bottom line - a good all purpose flour mix. Others have commented on the strong taste - which I didn't notice at all. Tastes to me like normal wheat bread.

review/summary: Not Buying Again
review/text: My husband wanted to buy this for me on a whim, because I am sensitive to Gluten. I should have said no, not until I check all reviews. I actually love garbanzo beans so I thought why not try it?<br /><br />I used only 1/6 of this flour in a Puffed Pear Pancake recipe from Real Simple. I used apples instead of pears and extra sugar/cinnamon. I also added some sugar to the batter to try and help cover up any bad flavor. I am not sure why I thought there would be some, but I did. Maybe it had started to smell funny already?<br /><br />Well, I baked 2 apple pancakes. 1 normal and 1 gluten free. I baked them at the same time in the same oven. That's when I started smelling the yucky smell. I was afraid the good one would be contaminated. Thankfully it wasn't. I have yet to offer the GF one to the rest of the family since they have their own. No one else commented on the yucky smell, so maybe I am just hyper sensitive to it. Maybe you do have to make something savory not sweet to enjoy it. All I can say is I am glad only 1/6 of the flour I used was this stuff. The rest was rice, tapioca, and potato. I am new to making my own baking flour mixes. But I have used specialty GF bread flours to make bread and it was delicious! It didn't rise quite right but the flavor was like french bread. I even eat dry crumbly rice bread and that's okay with me. I have even made white bean muffins when on the South Beach diet and those didn't have a weird, toxic taste/aftertaste/smell.<br /><br />So I plan on trying some other way to use this stuff, but if that doesn't work it is in the trash or I will offer it to a local person who may want to try some free GF flour. Maybe they won't notice the taste/smell.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I used this flour to make chocolate chip cookies with, and threw away the batter it tasted SO BAD. I then tasted the dry flour to see if IT was responsible for the bad flavor. It was. IT was thrown in the wastebasket with the batter.<br />Maybe this flour would be good for savory baking, as opposed to sweet baking. But I wouldn't bet MY money on it.

review/summary: Horrible taste
review/text: Grabanzo bean flour does not taste good in baking anything sweet or in my opinion anything else. I ended up throwing it away. It's interesting how our taste buds differ as I see some people like the taste of this and I can't imagine how it could possibly taste good.

review/summary: Horrible Taste
review/text: I tried to make cupcakes for my wheat-intolerant mother using this flour blend. I was pretty excited, because my previous GF attempts had involved rice flour, and the cakes would come out quite gritty. So I whipped up my batter and just before putting the cupcakes in the oven, I decided to take a taste. This flour produced the MOST FOUL TASTING thing I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. I thought I might be sick and had to spend about 10 minutes brushing my teeth to get rid of the taste.<br />Don't buy this. Save yourself.

review/summary: Absolutely disgusting.
review/text: Can I give 0 stars? Being that this is primarily made from ground garbonzo beans, it tastes exactly like.. ground garbanzo beans. The first time I used this, I made GF pancakes. I almost threw up. They tasted like someone chewed up chick peas and spit the paste into my cast iron pan. No amount of syrup could fix it. The next time I used it, I was running low on rice flour so I used about 1/4 cup of this "all purpose" stuff. Again, ruined pancakes. This stuff is horrible.

review/summary: Great for allegic cat; high in protein
review/text: My cat, who had food allergies of unknown type, really liked this food and could eat it fine from an allergy viewpoint. It is very high in protein (40%). Neither she nor my other cat eat great quantities of it (the recommended feeding for 5-8 lb. cat is 1/4 to 1/2 C per day, and this is assuming an outside cat) as they don't need it. They both free feed. However, it does make the stool of one cat very soft, though still having a shape--so we have problems with feces sticking to her fur and then she rubs her butt on my carpet!! Hence four stars instead of five. The other cat does not have this issue. Due to this issue, I usually mix this food with another food.  Another comment: when one cat was losing weight due to illness, my vet recommended going to kitten food due to its high protein, but this one is much higher in protein than any kitten food I've found.  While it is expensive, they eat little volume of it, and don't use the litter box as much, so I save on both ends.

review/summary: My cats love it and give it 5 stars!
review/text: I normally buy a different brand of grain-free dry cat food but I wanted to try another brand that had some different flavors and came in smaller size packages so I could rotate the flavors more often.  Both my cats love this brand and just dive right into it as soon as I put it in their dish.  I feed it to them in the morning and give them canned food in the evening, but I get the impression from them that they would rather have the dry food all the time : )  I will continue to use this brand in the future.

review/summary: High Quality Cat Food
review/text: Please don't rate this food anything less than maybe 4 stars, and it's a little pricey but this is the highest quality dry cat food I've ever bought and it's excellent. If your cat's don't like it, it's because your cats just have different tastes, it's not the food. All cats are different and respond differently to foods. My cats have digestive issues and can't handle grocery store cat food or any of those foods that have corn and all kinds of low quality byproducts. I bought this food and they have had healthy poops ever since. They love the smell and taste so they enjoy it, it's also much better for them nutritional wise.

review/summary: Food is good, cat likes it, price is just stupid
review/text: My Siberian cat likes this stuff. He's healthy, lean, and active eating it, and I like the 40% protein, grain-free formula. For wilder or hybrid type cats, the protein and no-grain issue seems to be a bigger deal. The ingredients are all pretty sound, so far as I can tell. The stuff doesn't smell bad, has a good texture to it. I've heard vets and breeders say some other brands were hypothetically better (Evo, Wellness, Merrick), but if you look into it - the ingredients are pretty similar.<br /><br />Downsides - the "life-source bits" which are cold-formed vitamins that aren't cooked (which reduces their potency) probably taste like vitamins. My cat is amazingly adept at avoiding these. I have to collect them from his food when he's done and save it to put in his next bowl so it accumulates until he finally caves and eats it. A little concerning though - all the vitamins are in these bits the cat won't eat unless coerced.<br /><br />Also - since Blue Buffalo started running their national TV ads, their price is up 50%+. This stuff is good, it's not that good. To be honest - the cat doesn't eat a ton, the price of the food isn't a big deal - I'm willing to spend a few bucks more a month to have good stuff - but I've seen no evidence this stuff is any better than more reasonably priced (like Blue used to be) like Wellness and Merrick - so I'm looking into switching.

review/text: I've done a lot of on line research looking for the best cat food. I have two adorable kittens, who are now 1 year old. The vet says they are in super condition and I credit that to feeding them Blue Buffalo dry food. I buy it when I can afford it - hence, the 4 stars. The price is too high for me to buy regularly.

review/text: I have a sick and very picky eater and he likes this food! Most of the cat's/dog's food is made with grain and fillers so I was looking for something better for my beloved pet. If you're not sure if your pet is going to like the food, you can order a smaller size. This one works well and I would recommend it to other pet owners.

review/summary: Excellent food for outdoor cats
review/text: I buy this when I can to send to my mother who lives in the country with feral cats that come into her property.  It is expensive, but due to the outdoor conditions and the great appetites that these outdoor cats have (along with our love of animals), I buy this to keep the cats as healthy as possible.  According to my mother, the cats absolutely love this food.

review/summary: Finicky Eater Still Not Impressed 100%
review/text: I have a 10 year old cat who is very finicky. After she got an eye infection, a skin conditions, and lost a significant amount of weight with generic commercial cat food, I did my research to find better food. I tried other grain free foods, but she turned her nose up to them (Wellness Core, Natural Balance). Blue Wilderness is the one that she liked...sort of:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-multiple protein sources (chicken, fish, turkey)<br />-my cat eats it<br />-grain free, high protein<br />-keeps cat healthy w/ shiny coat<br /><br />CONS:<br />-my cat picks out the "life-source bits" which are the little dark things<br />-"caramel" is on the ingredient list<br />-slightly more $$ than other brands<br /><br />Overall, I'll try another grain-free brand because I'm tired of cleaning life-source bits up off the ground and the "caramel" is not an ingredient I'd like to see in cat food. However, this food is still better quality than those commercial brands we all know of.

review/text: I fed this to my cats for the first time tonight, and I was honestly afraid they would choke after how fast the wolfed it down! I've been feeding grain free for awhile and wanted to get them something they would eat, especially since the little one has such a sensitive stomach. Only took away one star for the price, it is a bit high.

review/text: My kitty has been in this brand of food since he was 6 months old, started in Kitten food then to this type after he was a year old. He LOVES it. Great stuff!....but the price, I thought I was getting the bigger bag, at this price it would have been a deal, it was only 2.5 lbs...ouch! So read carefully on amounts!  I get a 6.5 lbs at the big-box pet store for about $22 and they have a buy program; buy 10 or 11 bags of food and the next one is free! He's my baby and he's still worth it.

review/text: The food was delivered rapidly and intact.The new formula might be IS better than the old formula BUT my cats just nibble at it eating a little at a time.Other than that I think Blue Buffalo is a bit overpriced-it is an excellent food.I have bought Longevity for my older cats .I have five 21 year old cats-they just nibbled on this a little at a time.They do not like salmon that much.My cats used to eat this chicken recipe like popcorn.My two young cats 4 and 6 months eat Longevity pretty much-more so than the senior citizens.Them eating this slower makes it lasts a little longer.CATS ARE PICKY EATERS!
