review/summary: Great, Tuscan olive oil
review/text: Although I like to try lots of different olive oils to explore the many and varied flavors, if I had to choose just one, it would probably be Laudemio, from one of the greatest wine estates of Tuscany, the Marchesi di Frescobaldi. Laudemio is produced from early harvested Tuscan varieties of Frantoio, Moraiolo and Leccino olives grown and pressed on Frescobaldi's hillside estate in Chianti Rufina.  What makes Laudemio so special is that it combines the best of the classic, "grippy" style of the best Tuscan olive oil with the softer, more buttery notes more typical of the better olive oils from southern Italy and Spain. That makes it great not only for drizzling over grilled meats and vegetables, but for dipping in your favorite loaf of crusty Italian or French bread.  Clear and intensely green, fruity, full, well-rounded and spicy, this dark olive- green has subtle floral and mineral aromas, and it is full -bodied and peppery, with a very fresh and lively after taste. It is a classic olive oil of the highest quality, and I highly recommend it.

review/text: This company markets shampoos specifically to men and some were available to test. I chose this one instead. I like it. There's no artificial perfumes. What little odor there is I assume comes from the cleaning compounds in the shampoo. It cleans well and doesn't leave any sort of residue or wax in my hair. It simply cleans without intruding. What more could I ask? Well maybe not the lavender shade, but that's a guy thing.

review/text: Seems like a very average shampoo....<br /><br />Item arrived a sticky mess as it leaked out during shipping. The smell is pleasant, texture creamy and perfect consistancy. I've used on my hair for over a week without any noticeable changes for the better. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't appear to make it fuller, but instead feels slightly more fly away. I am also using the matching conditioner.<br /><br />Overall it's worth a try when switching up from your normal shampoo, but it's not going to be my new every day shampoo.

review/summary: My hair loves this stuff!
review/text: I've always been one of those people who roll their eyes when they see ads for hair products that make actual changes to your hair. I mean, it's dead, how many changes can you make to it?<br /><br />Well, darned if I have to quit the eye rolling routine from now on, because this shampoo, along with the conditioner <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>  has changed how my hair looks and feels!<br /><br />I used to have long silky blonde hair. I loved it. Then I turned 40 and this evil gray curly stuff invaded my scalp. Now nearing 50, about half of my hair is still straight and fine, and the rest is grizzled and curly. It is NOT pretty.<br /><br />I did try some different products to tame the evil mass on my head, but nothing really worked, and if it did anything to the curly stuff, it made the straight stuff look like an oily mess, so I had about given up.<br /><br />Fortunately this product was offered to me through Vine, and after 2 weeks of use, I am completely amazed at how different my hair looks and feels. I can't say it's the same as it was when I was young, but the curly stuff is no longer frizzy, and the straight stuff looks good too. I can wear my hair back in a ponytail again without having the sides look like "crazy cat lady" by afternoon. It is wonderful!<br /><br />I don't know if it will work as well for everyone, but if you've got "middle-aged hair problems" I definitely recommend giving it a try!

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: ClEAR hair products market themselves as promoting healthy hair by nourishing the scalp with the mysterious 'Nutrium 10' complex, saying that healthy hair begins with a healthy scalp. I've never had dandruff or other scalp issues, I tried this 'Strong Lengths' shampoo along with the corresponding conditioner because my very long hair has been dry and very  breakable lately.<br /><br />The shampoo is a creamy pink and smells and feels just like the old school pink Herbal Essence (remember when Herbal Essence only came is three colors? Green, yellow, and pink.) It does smell nice and the scent lingers throughout the day.<br />I also liked the bottle shape, flat on both ends, so that you don't have to waste time shaking the last bit of shampoo out of the bottle. This is a common feature on conditioner bottles, but rarely seen on shampoo containers.<br /><br />I've used this product for about 2 weeks now and while my hair isn't worse, it isn't significantly better either.<br /><br />Overall, this shampoo is pretty much on par with any other drugstore shampoo, not better, not worse.

review/summary: Just as good as the more expensive salon shampoos ...
review/text: I use Bumble and Bumble (salon brand) and Dove hair care products.  Quite honestly, I can't tell a difference between the very expensive Bumble and Bumble brand and the cheaper Dove brand products.  Clear Scalp & Hair Strong Lengths did an equally good job of cleaning and "nourishing" my hair as both the Bumble and Bumble and Dove brands.  I have only been using this shampoo (not the matching conditioner ... still alternate BB and Dove conditioner) for about 2 weeks.  I can tell an improvement in my hair, but my hair always seems to do better when I first change to another good shampoo.  My hair does not do well when I change to ANY shampoo, so that is still a good thing that my hair likes the shampoo.  All in all, I would recommend alternating this shampoo with other good quality (not necessarily more expensive) shampoos.  I do plan on trying the conditioner too to see the results with the combination of the two together.

review/summary: Used once, wont finish the bottle But it might just be me
review/text: Disclaimer- my hair is keratin treated and may not be representative.<br /><br />First, I recognize that the shampoo and conditioner claim to make stronger hair in 7 days and that I didn't use it for that time.  But I don't feel that the immediate downsides of this product make trying for a long term benefit a good idea.<br /><br />The bottle arrived open and most of the product was spilled into the bag.  Because it has a pop top it will spill very easily.<br /><br />My hair is fine and quite long (well past the bra line). It is also keratin treated.  Like most people with long hair I care a great deal about it and put quite a bit of effort into it's care.  I was excited to try this product.<br /><br />It lathered up very nicely and smelled good.  My first hint of trouble was that as it rinsed out, my hair was feeling very stripped and was tangling.<br /><br />While this product is meant to be used over time to gain results one of the biggest things to avoid with long hair is dry tangly hair.  It causes immediate damage.

review/text: I really am impressed with this shampoo. I use it and the conditioner everyday and since then my hair is twice as soft and manageable as before when I was using a very expensive shampoo pair (HealthySexyHair). Though I don't think this shampoo is a miracle worker or anything, I do love everything about it. It smells awesome to start, and has a very rich lather. I only have to use about half the normal amount of shampoo to get that really luscious lather and clean feeling, and it leaves my hair silky, clean, and smelling great all day. Also, I have suffered from very light dandruff most of my life and with this shampoo I don't notice any flakes and I don't have to wash my hair everyday because of oil build up. Couldn't be much happier!

review/text: My wife and I recently finished the bottle of Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Shampoo provided to us by the "Vine" program, and found it to be excellent. We liked the clean, mild scent, and the fact that it rinsed away easily.  I particularly liked the moisturized, non-stripped down feeling my hair had after using it, which made brushing and styling easier.  My wife did, too, but also liked that it didn't leave TOO much behind on her hair like some other hair products that she found to be over-fortified with this or that additive.  We highly recommend this quality shampoo, which feels like it should cost much more than it does.

review/text: I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.

review/text: This shampoo does not produce a lot of lather but it serves its purpose well. Seems to be kind to existing hair and leaves hair feeling fresh and manageable. As to the claimed properties of nourishing capabilities that is something, that I suppose, should take continuos use to determine if it helps in any significant way. This shampoo is used daily and so far everyone that tries it agrees it is up there with the competition. The container is easy to open and close and did not detect a strong perfume that could change the whole game, for if your hair is going to smell a certain way it better come with some great properties. I remember using a coconut shampoo that left you smelling like a walking pi&#328;a colada and that got old really fast, for besides the pungent smell of pure coconut it did not add or substract from lesser smelling shampoos.<br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce does not intrude with its own particular scent and it seems to be doing a good job of keeping its users with clean and lively hair. I did appreciate the chance of using it and the jury is still out as to wether it will become the daily shampoo from now on. To earn that loyalty it would have to please greatly by the time the last drop is used.<br />I prefer this one to the ones you usually find at drugstores, like suave and other cheap offers. In the end what one puts on their hair will be the deciding factor how long and how strong that hair remains part of the scalp, specially among men. I have seen some flashy characters that boasted the greatest haircuts, until little by little those hair particles became a thing of the past. Short of entering the world of hair transplants, which anyone would be very surprised how many people have had a patch or two installed to cover some scary open fields, the right shampoo the same as the right soap, deodorant, etc, is an important decision to make. Must not take lightly the fact that one enjoys a heavy flock of hair, for even those that always had thick hair and thought that the blessing of plentiful hair had been bestowed upon them, woke up one day to find entry ways devoid of hair.<br />This product appears safe as a daily shampoo and all I can hope for is that whatever remains upstairs will keep being so for a little longer at least. I thank amazon, like always, for the chance to try the shampoo in the first place and for basically being the finest store in the internet for a long long time. 3.5 Stars.

This has the sort of lid that you press on one side to flip it up, and it must have flipped open a bunch of times rattling around in the box- a lot of product had seeped out and the whole bottle was a sticky mess when I got it. I did not factor this into the review- this is an Amazon issue- but beware!

The scent is mild enough that it didn't bother me and the shampoo seemed to clean well without stripping. My hair feels rougher but I'm, not seeing as many split ends so it may be reducing breakage as advertised. i don't think I'll stick with it. While there is nothing I actively disliked about the product, I don't love the results. With the Clear branded conditioners my hair feels too heavy and without them it's a little dry. This shampoo worked better for family members with a thicker hair strand, my tween liked the weight it added to her wavy textured mid shoulder length hair.

review/summary: Great non-stripping shampoo....
review/text: I do have long hair, and it was such a treat to find a product that's specifically intended for the type of hair I have. That being said, I adored this shampoo & will use it from now on. It DOES have a boatload of chemicals, yet I'm someone who can't seem to make the 100% natural products work at making my hair feel clean. I have tried many, and my hair just looks dirty & dull. With this product, my hair felt clean and yet not so "sqeaky" that it felt stripped after shampooing. Note that I do NOT wash my hair every day. My hair stays clean for about 3 days after shampooing, so that's how often I use it. I also use Therasilk "Moisture Infusing Conditioner" & L'Oreal Everstrong Overnight Hair Repair on the ends as my routine. My hair is coarse & waxy (got lots of it) and I also color my hair every 6-8 weeks.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Hair felt clean without feeling dried out<br />* I got a nice lather as long as my hair wasn't too dirty/oily, in which case I shampooed twice<br />* I liked the scent, yet it may be too strong for some. My hair still smelled clean for 2 or 3 days (depending upon the weather) after shampooing<br />* For the price I feel the quality is comparable with a more expensive shampoo (I've used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi in the past)<br />* A little went a long way, even for my long hair<br />* This shampoo worked well for my color treated hair (I use a deposit only color, my hair is dark but have grey coming in)<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only "con" for me is that the bottle has one of those annoying "permanent" caps that you can't get off to use the last bits of product. I also like to rinse out the bottle before recycling (or the recycle-rs won't take it). I will have to figure out how to deal with that when I'm finished using it.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm happy & will use this shampoo from now on...I'm converted.

review/summary: Seems to do a good job and smells nice without being perfumy
review/text: Having just evaluated all of the CLEAR male hair products, it was time for the women in my house to evaluate the female hair products.  Both the male dandruff shampoo and the female "strong lengths" nourishing shampoo are advertised to feature Nutrium 10, some sort of vitamin nutrient compound that is supposed to make hair healthier and strong.<br /><br />I can't really speak much to if it makes hair stronger, but the shampoo certainly feels good going on and being lathered.  The shampoo itself appears about the same consistency of the male shampoo, a thin runny cream, but this one is pink.  The smell is quite nice without smelling like cheap perfume, and the smells tends to linger without being overpowering.<br /><br />The bottle itself is easy to use - snap down one end and the other end pops up to dispense shampoo.  Amazon had some issues shipping the free Vine samples - mine had leaked.  Hopefully they are more careful when shipping orders.<br /><br />After a few weeks of this shampoo, I'd say hair is clean and smells good, and the members of my family rate it highly.  I wouldn't say anybody noticed any huge improvements due to the Nutrium-10, but it's an effective shampoo that does a good job cleaning hair while smelling nice.

review/summary: Seems to work well on waist long hair - but smell is too strong
review/text: I have waist long hair and work-out on a regular basis. During summer, that translates into a major beating in the hot/humid Florida sun, rain and did I mention the super high humidity?! Needless to say, my hair tends to frazzle fairly quickly with the daily washing, swimming, beating sun...and of course, let's not forget the humidity.<br /><br />So, I try a LOT of different hair products. Some are oily (ugh), others seem to actually dry out my hair, still others seem to attract tangles...and with 3 feet of hair to untangle, that is no small considerations.<br /><br />I gave this a try and it does seem to work fairly well. I also used it in combination with a deep oil treatment to get started (see other review) because my hair was in pretty rough shape right now. You can notice the difference after a week so it does what is claims. However - and this is a big one for me - the fragrance is VERY strong. I find it overpowering. My spouse LOVES IT. In fact, he is was using another bottle and is ready to take over all of them because of the smell alone. Me on the other hand, I find it much too strong. Of course, that is personal preference but if you are sensitive to fragrances, keep this in mind before purchasing the product.<br /><br />Last but not least, despite the additional of vitamins/supplements to enhance the product, I've been moving aware of many of the other harsh ingredients/chemicals contained in this/other shampoo's and conditioners. I did NOT deduct a point for it because once again, that is a lifestyle related choice.<br /><br />Bottom Line - a good product for long hair but those with sensitivities to fragrance will want to think twice.

review/summary: After Seven Days...
review/text: This review is for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner, written after using these products for seven days.<br /><br />I should start by saying that I consider this an inexpensive product. The shampoo and conditioners I am used to cost 3 to 4 as much as these. Because of this, I didn't expect any improvement in the condition of my already very healthy hair after using these products. While I wouldn't consider the condition of my hair improved after seven days of using these products, I was pleased that the condition of my hair was pretty much maintained. Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products, I won't be giving up my usual products. I like to mix it up with my shampoo & conditioner, so I will continue to use these occasionally, but not every day. One of the main things I'm not crazy about with these products is the fragrance. It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent, but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair. I don't wear perfume and rarely use any kind of body fragrance, so it's important to me that my shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair smelling nice. I don't get that with this product.

review/summary: Might work? Pleasant scent, not much lather.
review/text: My wife says this stuff is fine. She says the scent is pleasant, but not AMAZING. It bothers her a little that the shampoo doesn't produce very much lather, but she can live with it. However, she was looking at her long, long, hair in the sun today and she thought "Wow, my hair could be in a hair color advertisement and I would want to get that color." So, I know color isn't relevant to this review, but the point was that she was looking at 4 or 5 year old hair and it was shiny, and smooth and beautiful even though she was out flying a kite in the wind with my kids. I asked her if she thinks this shampoo has made her hair stronger. She thinks that is kind of a subjective thing: difficult to measure. BUT she says maybe so, she has been wearing it down more lately. . . maybe it is a positive reflection on this shampoo.

review/summary: I like it!
review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this shampoo works pretty well. It is smooth and goes on easily.  It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear conditioner, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the conditioner as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

I used it twice and both times after use my head started having a tingling/burning sensation, even after rinsing, and I didn't like it.  There are a long list of ingredients and chemical-looking names that I'm not familiar with.  I was disappointed because I like the easy-to-use bottle style.

review/summary: Seems like an excellent shampoo.
review/text: Not sure how much if any nourishment my hair is getting from this shampoo and I don't have any dandruff. But it does a nice job of cleaning my hair, leaving it tangle free and somewhat conditioned. I was using Pantene Pro-V and this shampoo compares favorably to the Pantene. I like the way the bottle is made and the easy open dispensing.<br />So far I like the way my hair is coming out after shampooing and it does seem a little better than when I started. I have used most of the bottle and while I have seen a little improvement, there hasn't really been that much of an improvement.<br />I would say this shampoo would be worth trying as it does a nice job of cleaning, smells nice, bottle is easy to use and relatively inexpensive.<br />Keep in mind that they make so many shampoos because what one person likes, another will hate.

review/summary: I think there's a conditioner in this shampoo
review/text: It's not marketed as including conditioners, but my hair feels like it does after using a conditioner.  So if you have fine, thin hair, you may not want to use this, as conditioners will weigh your hair down.<br /><br />I like it.  A little bit gives a lot of lather.  The scent is clean and pleasant, not perfumey.  It's too early to tell if it will really strengthen my hair.  I'm doubtful, because I'm older (67) and my hair has been thinning for years.<br /><br />I don't see that my results are much different from my regular shampoo (Pantene), but I'll probably switch.  It does make more lather than Pantene, so I'll be able to use less, and I like the light conditioning.  The ingredients list several natural oils, so maybe that's where the conditioning comes from.<br /><br />Five stars because it lathers nicely, rinses clean, and smells good.  There's not much more to ask from a shampoo.

review/summary: Fine shampoo for a decent value.
review/text: This seems like a fine shampoo.  After using it for several weeks I am probably not going to continue using it.  I have long, thinner hair and like to use sulfate-free products as they seem to give me more volume and texture.  While I wouldn't say there is anything particularly wrong with this shampoo- i.e. it cleaned my hair, I did not feel that my hair became longer or stronger any more than with a usual value brand shampoo.  It did not have a particularly strong scent or anything and I didn't feel it made my hair split more or did not clean it decently, I just prefer a brand that gives my hair more body as well as strengthening it.<br /><br />It was okay.  I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this particular shampoo.

I wash my hair daily as I commute by bike in 100 degree temps, and I need to. I have been using an Avon product for many years, and both I and my wife have been happy with what it did.

review/summary: Nice scent and texture
review/text: I've had long hair all my life, so I was attracted to the idea of strengthening long hair. Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy has a creamy texture and a pleasant smell and color (love the monochromatic thing with the bottle). I like the addition of vitamins and lipids to nourish the scalp. I used it alone, without the conditioner -- I don't know how much of a difference that makes, but the product should be able to stand on its own.<br /><br />I used the shampoo for several weeks before writing this review (in fact, the bottle is nearly empty). Did it make my hair stronger? Possibly, but if it did it's not overly apparent. The comb goes through my wet hair easier right after shampooing, which is nice and certainly cuts down on breakage at that point. Overall, it seems to be a quality shampoo that I would use again.

review/summary: The Jury's Still Out
review/text: When I saw this shampoo available to Amazon Vine reviewers, I requested a bottle. After a horrible color treatment years ago that burned my scalp and forever changed not only the amount of hair on my head but its texture as well, I'm always interested in shampoos said to be good for hair "prone to breakage." The fine print, though, indicates that the shampoo does all these great things, including restoring the scalp's natural moisture balance, only when used in conjunction with the conditioner, which was not sent to me.<br /><br />After using the shampoo and my existing conditioner for a couple of weeks, I bought the Strong Lengths conditioner. I've used it a few times, and so far there's not much to report. My scalp does seem slightly less itchy than it is prone to, but then again, it's not wintertime, when the heater runs nearly constantly and dries out my skin and scalp. I've not discovered the oiliness from using the shampoo that other reviewers have reported, but oily hair is not an issue for me in general. Neither the shampoo nor conditioner are expensive, so buying the conditioner as well wasn't a hardship, but I disliked the asterisk about needing both the shampoo and conditioner to experience the shampoo's true efficacy.<br /><br />I plan to report back in a few more weeks about how well both products work together, but I can't say much about how the shampoo works on its own. Yes, it cleanses my hair as promised, but if it's being nourished, the jury's still out.

Also I received the shampoo courtesy of Amazon Vine but if I had actually paid for the product and lost a big portion in transit I'd be very unhappy.  Overall I feel like the shampoo leaves my fine hair almost too soft so it's not holding it's style terribly well.  It smells great and feels wonderful to put my hands in but isn't quite giving it any volume or lift.  I would not spend the money on this version of the shampoo in the future.

The smell alone makes you want to try it.  It reminds me of the old "Salon Selectives" brand.  Anyway, my hair does seem smother and less frizzy.  It is shiny and I got a compliment on it the other day which I hadn't received in a while so it must be working.  It is comparable in price to Pantene as well.

review/summary: This is a keeper.  Smells delish.
review/text: This shampoo smells so clean and subtly fresh all day long!  I love it! Love it!  You only need the smallest little dab to get a really good lather worked up.  I am on several medications that have made my hair very weak and almost a year and half ago it fell it out in large chunks.  My hair is fine, wavy and likes to tangle with itself.  It is prone to breakage.  I sleep on satin pillowcases, with a satin head wrap on.  I baby and pamper my hair and spend a lot on products that will strengthen it or keep it in shape, I'm a product junkie for better or worse.  I try shampoos and conditioners frequently and return to my old standbys.  These is a keeper for me.  I used it for 3 weeks before coming to a conclusion.  I had my scalp 'cleaned' before I started.  I go to the beauty college and they do a deep scalp treatment and clean your scalp of product buildup.  Three weeks later according to my hairstylist I still did not have any build up to scrap.  So my head was very clean leaving the hair follicles free for growing.  I had about 10% less breakage according to the beauty schools breakage test.  Which for me, is a plus and improvement, I am trying to grow my hair out, I can't do that if it is constantly breaking.  For conditioners I need something that has some power in the shower to detangle effectively and leave my hair smooth and tangle free.  Some of the more expensive conditioners do not have the thickness or something in the cnditioners to really soften and separate my hair.  This conditioner really worked without me having to double dip and use twice as much conditioner.  For the price and the smell and the noticeable improvements I say yay!  How does a shampoo and conditioner get a 5 from me....no breakage at all.

review/summary: Fine shampoo for the $; not a huge difference in my hair
review/text: I received a bottle of the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and have been using it exclusively for the past 3 weeks. I wash my fine, shoulder length hair almost every day; I've been trying to move to every other day, as it's better for your hair.<br /><br />Second on the ingredient list is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which may have less chemical impact than the similar sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), but is still an allergen for many people, and could be why some reviewers are noting hair loss with use of this product. Interestingly sodium chloride (salt) is one of the ingredients. Most shampoos don't have added salt, so I thought it was a curious addition.<br /><br />I did not notice any strengthening properties. It actually seemed like my ends might be slightly drier than normal (nothing a little shine serum couldn't fix). My hair felt very clean the first week, but my scalp has started to become oilier than usual (sometimes at the end of the day, my scalp looks like I haven't shampooed for two days).<br /><br />In terms of chemicals, this shampoo is too new to be included in the Environmental Working Group cosmetic database, but the biggest issues are the fragrance (parfum) and the DMDM Hydantoin. Other chemicals that would score as moderate (4-5s) include the sodium lauryl sulfate, Zinc Pyrithione, Laureth-23 and Laureth-24. Poloxamer 407 is slightly lower risk, but has some bioaccumulation concerns.<br /><br />Overall, it didn't seem terribly effective at giving me stronger hair. But it's not the worst chemical load of "conventional" shampoos, and it's a decent price. I would consider purchasing it but it would not be my first choice of shampoos.

review/summary: My New Favorite Shampoo
review/text: Within only a couple weeks after starting to use this shampoo (along with the conditioner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>), I have noticed a big difference in the softness, strength and health of my hair. My hair tends to be very dry and this shampoo-conditioner combo has worked wonders.<br /><br />My daughter also loves it because it's such a clean product (without all the dyes etc. that can weigh down fine hair), leaving her hair shiny and silky. She kept stealing mine so I had to get her some of her own.<br /><br />The packaging states it has nutrients for the scalp and the hair and I believe it. I trimmed my hair right before I started using it and it has definitely helped prevent split ends. It's every bit as effective as the shampoos I've paid premium prices for in salons.<br /><br />I'm liking my hair more than I have in a long, long time, and am looking forward to seeing the results after a few months.

review/summary: So far, so good.
review/text: I've heard that there truly is no differene between cheap shampoos and those found at specialty salons/stores. I've tried both and it is probably true. That said, this new Clear Shampoo is certainly on the cheap side, and so far, I like it. It has a pleasant smell and it goes on thick, with a consistancy of conditioner. It lathers very well and washes away quickly. It cleans my hair and I guess I can't expect much more than that. So far it has not weighed my hair down at all, and I have pretty long hair. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone.

review/summary: It cleans :)
review/text: I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and have a few pros and cons. Pros: use a small amount, lathers well, smells nice, cleans hair well. Cons: font on bottle too small (word "shampoo" should be larger so you can differentiate between the shampoo and conditioner easier), seems to make my hair fall out (another brand did this as well) but not sure if it's the shampoo only or a combination of shampoo and conditioner.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews. I like the product but don't like losing my hair. Since I have a lot of thick hair, it hasn't affected me much but I don't want to continue losing it just in case.

review/text: I used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner for a week.  This shampoo is made for people with long hair, so I wanted to try it.  The smell is very clean, and the shampoo isn't all watery like a lot of other shampoos.  The first day I love how it makes my hair look.  It gives my hair a volume it doesn't usually have, but by day 2 my hair is flat and oily.  This shampoo and conditioner may work better for you, they just didn't work with my hair and scalp.

Since I tend to use good products, this actually means it appears to be a decent shampoo.  It just didn't rock my world in any way.  For the price, it is a nice choice.  Certainly better than some of the drug store cheap shampoos that dry out your hair.

review/text: This shampoo is a cream shampoo that claims to nourish the scalp, but the second ingredient, sodium laurel sulfate, is a known scalp irritant. The shampoo is also tinted pink, as is the matching conditioner. I don't like using hair products with dyes because they stain my hair. It is also heavily scented. I won't use it again, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else.

review/summary: Effective but not for everyone
review/text: I ordered Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty hoping that it would control my flakes.  The shampoo smells great, not overpowering, lathers well, and leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean. Unfortunately, it wasn't very effective at controlling flakes in the week and a half that I've used it.  My husband loves it though as he's found it to be very effective against flakes.  I think that in terms of flake control, it will depend on how strong you need the formulation to be. I'll have to stick to Nizoral & Neutrogena's anti-dandruff shampoo myself.

The only bad thing about it, was how it was shipped, in a bubble wrap manilla envelope. Being shipped like that, caused the bottle to leak a bit, not a lot, but I did have to rinse the bottle off before use. Other then that, it's great.

review/text: I am an activer person. That means I wash my hair (at least) once every day. With that daily ritual, it takes an inevitable toll on my hair. In an effort to combat breakage, get my tresses clean and just try a new product, I ordered the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY system, through Vine. First of all, this product smells fresh, and it has a creamy consistency. I felt it cleaning my hair, right away, and it didn't feel like it had the stripping quality so common in some fortified products. It rinsed clean and my hair felt protected. We shall give this a week (like it says, on the bottle). I am satisfied, so far.

review/summary: Decent Shampoo.. Bad Packaging and Bottle Leaks in Shipping
review/text: First, like others have mentioned, mine arrived in a plastic wrap in a package with its lid open and shampoo all over the interior of the plastic wrap. Not only was it a mess to open.. but 1/3 the bottle was already gone. Next came trying the product.. so far 1 weeks time and I will update again after a month goes by. When I first put some on my hair and begain to lather I stopped and made sure I used the right bottle.... its like a cream, and doesn't feel like a shampoo normally would feel. I thought I grabbed the wrong bottle! I'm mixed on how the product feels, though it did leave my hair nice, but my other shampoos still do better. I tend to use various products and never the same shampoo when I run out. Its almost as if my hair gets use to a product and it no longer works well, so I mix it up.<br /><br />I do like the smell to the product and don't find it overwhelming as others suggested. I did not find it dulled my hair (I do have highlights)My hair did feel clean, not oily or dirty looking as others have experienced. Think this is a try it out and see kind of product. Everyones hair is so different so each review is based on the persons kind of hair really. My hair is normally not oily, but is flat and below shoulder length with highlights. I saw no major changes compared to other products so for that reason its OK. I do not like the cap to the bottle and again how its packaged. Nothing like getting a product and loosing 1/3 of it and having a huge mess..... perhaps if you want to try it try it at a local store.

review/text: This shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft, but I can't discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market.  It has a light, pleasant scent -- not too perfumey -- and it lathers well.  I would use it again, but it's nothing to get super-excited about.  Regarding the claim about getting your hair stronger in seven days, I honestly can't say I noticed that.

review/summary: Smooth, rich and silky, but worth the price?
review/text: I have never been one to seek out specific shampoo brands.  I purchased whatever brand was on sale.  As long as it lathered up and did its job, I was happy.  The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty shampoo proves there is a difference.<br /><br />First of all, the shampoo is far richer than other brands I've used.  It comes out of the easy-to-use dispenser in thick ribbons.  When it's massaged into the hair, it creates a luxurious feel -- an experience far removed from the routine shampooing I had always done.  In fact, I was inspired to do more scalp massaging than ever as I lingered in the shower.<br /><br />It has a faint scent, not an overly perfumed one, and I liked that.  I can't really confirm the fact that it has strengthened my hair, as I've never had a problem with "breakage."<br /><br />My wife used it and was pleased with how smooth her hair felt after the shampoo was rinsed out.  She has used several kinds of better shampoos over the years, and she reported that the Clear Scalp & Beauty shampoo compares favorably.  Neither of us used the shampoo in conjunction with its companion conditioner, which further leads me to believe we saw no appreciable difference in our hair being strengthened.<br /><br />The big question:  Would I seek this product over others in the future?  Perhaps.  I do like its rich texture, so that might lure me back.  However, a premium price might easily point me back to more economical products.<br /><br />Conclusion:  This is a good product that lathers better than many shampoos, leaving the hair smooth and easy to manage.

review/summary: Good shampoo, but the conditioner's the real find.
review/text: I've been using the Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy shampoo and conditioner for a couple weeks now, and my hair has never been healthier. I have a great mass of very long, very fine, very straight hair which has a tendency to get very static-y and has absolutely no body. From the very first use, this system made my hair feel much fuller, much smoother, much richer -- all around much more beautiful. I have never seen such an immediate or thorough effect, and all without any feeling like there was product weighing it down. However, after mixing and matching (using the shampoo and conditioner together, using the shampoo and a different conditioner, and using the conditioner and a different shampoo) I've come to the conclusion that most of the work is being done by the conditioner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>); the shampoo with the conditioner is a *little* better, but not so much better that I feel like I have to spend the extra money on it. The conditioner I recommend without reservation; the shampoo is just a nice bonus.

review/summary: It Does A Good Job, But ....
review/text: I gave this product to my girlfriend to try since she has long, color treated hair.<br /><br />When I first got this, a lot of the product was all over the plastic bag that it came in. Be warned, they sent it in a padded envelope and the shampoo was everywhere.<br /><br />From there, to me it has an interesting fragrance, nothing horrible, but nothing that I just have to use either. The first time I used it, I had to use a bunch of shampoo because I just couldn't get it to lather. After that, it was back to the normal amount to suds up my hair.<br /><br />When I first used it, I noticed that my hair felt a little drier and stripped. This is something that I notice every time I use a different brand of shampoo which I thing is just the feeling of the built up old product getting washed off my hair. With repeated use, this feeling went away.<br /><br />I also used the corresponding conditioner. Within the first couple days, I noticed that my hair felt thicker and softer. The ends of my hair still have the remains of some bleaching and are drier than the rest of my hair. They felt smoother after a couple days of use.<br /><br />The only negative thing I find is that my hair gets greasy faster with the use of this shampoo. The only thing I can think of is the extra nutrients that are supposed to help the scalp is just adding too much to my all ready normal scalp.<br /><br />Over all, this is not that bad of a product. I like how my hair feels softer and seems to have more volume without drying out the ends further. Using the conditioner does help the ends too, more on that on the other review. But I do admit that I wouldn't get it again just because of how greasy my hair gets with it.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a product that will help your dry hair, this is one to look into.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Lives up to expectation
review/text: Obviously everyone has different types of hair, and shampoos will affect every hair type differently. So, for clarification's sake, my hair is:<br /><br />- Plentiful, but very fine and therefore easily broken.<br />- Straight with a small amount of natural body.<br />- Lacking in volume.<br />- Easily weighed down.<br />- Oily.<br /><br />Because of the nature of my hair, it stays healthier when it is kept short. But, stylistically I prefer it long. So, I thought this shampoo (and the conditioner that goes with it) wouldn't be a bad thing to try. **Note, I did use both shampoo and conditioner previously that were geared toward strengthening hair.**<br /><br />I have used it for three weeks, and I'm pleased with the results. I have noticed less breakage over the past couple of weeks and I've also noticed less hair falling out in the shower or when I brush. Although it is costlier than my typical shampoo choice, I think it just might be worth it to at least alternate between this brand and a less expensive brand. And yes, I did notice a difference within the first week (the brand claims seven days). In fact, I noticed a difference in manageability within about three days, although it was probably closer to two weeks before I started really noticing a difference in the strength of my hair itself.<br /><br />I will say that most of what I noticed is related to the conditioner, so I will write a review of that separately. But, I can also say that leaving this step out and just using the conditioner with a different shampoo is not as effective. So, the pairing of the two is essential for the best results.

review/summary: Terrific hair products for fine hair!
review/text: I've been using CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce and CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce for three weeks before writing a review, just to give them a good test, but there was a noticeable improvement in my hair after the first shampoo.  For several months, I had been getting hairs caught in my comb when combing out my wet hair.  After using these products for the first time, there was only one hair left behind in the comb.  After shampooing and conditioning a couple of times, there were no longer any hairs in the comb at all.  I've waited three weeks to see if these products would accumulate on the hair strands, because my fine hair just collapses under the weight of product build-up.  But there doesn't seem to be any build-up at all.  They leave my hair manageable, soft (but not limp) and very shiny.  I was surprised that neither product is clear (both are pearly in color.)  Be advised it takes very little product to work up a rich lather, so start out small and add to it or you will be rinsing for a while.  I really love both these products.

Not really, but...no noticeable difference between this and any other shampoo in terms of impact - less dryness for sure, lathers well and has a not-so-overpowering fragrance.  Ingredients list mention more "natural" components than most others but is not an organic shampoo - perhaps, this price point is meant to reflect "not organic, but not a chemical soup" segment.  Overall, slightly over-priced for its value. No real differentiation with any of the other products to warrant a premium.

In fact I had gotten sunburn on my scalp in the part of my hair and this felt very gentle on that tender spot. So if the price suits you, it would be okay.

There isn't a compelling reason for me to switch to this one.  If you're happy with what you're using, stick with it.  If you aren't give this a try.

review/summary: Good so far.
review/text: So far, so good.  The subject:  blonde fine, straight hair with no split ends.<br /><br />(BTW: no shampoo or conditioner can fix split ends.  Only cutting can fix them.  You can prevent them, not fix them with shampoo and conditioner).  But I digress.....<br /><br />This hair has a personality of its own that includes having to be washed every night or it will be greezy.  Yes, greezy; not greasy.  The bottle says it takes up to seven days to see a difference so we may have to do an update.  The shampoo has a nice smell; nothing too perfumy.  It rinsed out fine and did not seem to strip my hair.  My hair is soft and looks clean.

review/summary: The Nose Knows
review/text: Certain fragrances put my sinuses in a spin the minute my nose invites them in. That's just what happened the moment I smelled this shampoo.  If you happen to be sensitive to odors, I doubt you'll want Clear Scalp.  I don't know what the chemical is that bothers me, but it's a synthetic throb of a smell that's become less common as fruiter scents entered the market.  It's hard to describe, but years ago, Clairol's after-coloring conditioner had it, as did Pantene.  (I sniffed the latter in the market today -- like Clairol, it no longer contains that odor.)<br /><br />To be fair to Clear Scalp, I'm an extreme overachiever when it comes to having a picky nose, but my encounter with this particular product ended with me popping a sinus pill and a couple aspirin after getting a dab of shampoo on my hand.  (I rinsed it off quickly but the odor clung to me for hours, faint but twinge-inducing if I got my hand near my face.)  Consequently, I didn't dare use it or the conditioner on my hair.  I'd have to give it one star.<br /><br />My husband, however gives it four stars, knocking one off because he doesn't love the fragrance. (He doesn't actively dislike it, but prefers coconutty scents.)  He loves what it does to his hair -- and I can see (and feel) why: his hair feels silky and thicker because the shampoo (and conditioner) give it more body.  It looks good.<br /><br />As for the odor, he there wasn't a trace of scent left tonight, nor are my sinuses bothered when I sniff his hair.<br /><br />The shampoo definitely does nice things to your hair, but I'd suggest a test-sniff before purchasing.

review/summary: Seriously Damaged My Long Hair
review/text: I used this product for 10 days.  Loved the scent, at first my scalp did feel clean and healthy.  By the end of the first week my hair began to change.  It seemed I could see scalp through my hair in full sunlight (noticed in the rearview mirror in the car).  I had noticed my hair was becoming fly away, which generally only happens in the dead of winter, never in the summer.<br /><br />After day 10 it was obvious something was very wrong.  My hair stands from root to tip were much thinner, half thier  normal volume.  My healthy hair was now baby fine!  It was clear that the cause was topical since the effect was every piece of hair, the entire length of each strand.  I had  not changed or added any other product, process, or activity in my routine other than using this shampoo.  I did not use the companion conditioner, I stuck with my usual conditioning product during this trial.<br /><br />This product stripped away the cuticle and actually reduced the thickness of my hair.  I did not actually lose hair (no bald patches, no extra in the brush, no breakage).  Just seemed to eat away at the hairs but left them intact.  This was not a welcome effect as I have light, fine hair to begin with.  There is no way to reduce the damage, other than discontinue use and let the hair grow out naturally.  This will take time since my hair falls at the middle of my back.  Yes, others have noticed the loss of volume and how thin my hair looks.<br /><br />Doing a sink test with the remainder of the bottle - washing a test clipping of my daughter's thick, coarse hair with it daily for a week to watch it break down the hair.  There are a lot of chemicals in this product and something in the formulation is causing damage!  I noticed other reviewers mention fly away hair, loss of volume, and hope they stop using it before it reaches the point mine has.

review/summary: Works well on my hair
review/text: Generally, I use a non-shampoo method on my hair. I'm willing to try shampoos, but most shampoos seem to cause a lot of split ends compared to the baking soda/apple cider vinegar method.<br /><br />This one has been exceptional so far in that my ends aren't splitting. I have hip length, medium thick, fine, straight hair. It's normal, which means other than the tendency to split, it's neither dry nor oily. It's also not dyed.<br /><br />I use this shampoo as instructed. Massaging it into my scalp, then shampooing the length of my hair using a dollop a little bigger than a quarter, then follow with with the matching conditioner. I don't heat process, and use a wide tooth comb to detangle.  My hair is clean, and well moisturized. It's really soft and manageable all the way down to the tips. I don't know if there is less breakage, but there are less split ends than I'm used to with shampoos and conditioners. This is going on my list of acceptable shampoos.

review/summary: My hair is clean.
review/text: After I chose this product for "Vine" I realized that it will take way more than one bottle of shampoo to determine whether it decreased breakage, unless I count the hairs in my brush before and after using it.  I used it and it worked like shampoo.  I have no complaints.<br />I noticed that it is available through subscribe and save for a very reasonable price and it gave me an idea.  My very hair-enhanced daughters use literally gallons of shampoo and conditioner.  If you're swimming in waters originating in Montana and note when you get out, your hair is cleaned and conditioned, you have my girls to thank for it.<br />My idea is this - if their shampoo comes through subscribe and save, they will have to make it last until the next shipment.  So I will be letting them try this  product to see if it meets their standards.

review/summary: Clear Shampoo
review/text: This lovely scented shampoo is very concentrated. I used the amount that I regularly use for my chin length hair and it lathered into a rich, luxurious foam that was thick and I could immediately feel it coating my hair. I really had to rinse to get it all out. It left my hair very soft and weighed down, so much that I had to deal with fly-away and static all day long. One thing that I really liked was the fragrance, I closed my eyes and breathed in deep while cleansing my hair. I just didn't like how it weighed my hair down.

review/text: The discovered the Columbian-blend Starbucks Coffee about a year ago; I've tried ~6-8 different Starbucks blends, but found that the Columbian strikes a perfect balance in flavor and boldness.  Very flavorful but not overwhelmed with that bold espresso bitterness you get in something like French Roast blend.

review/summary: The Best Colombian Coffee you can get - from Starbucks!
review/text: Having tried many Colombian Coffees including Specialties; there just isn't any that comes close to the one that my old Colombian friend who resided here for awhile while attending University and as Hospital Intern before returning back home; having tried Colombian Coffee from her own homeland. I just couldn't find anything that came closest except Starbucks Colombia which is only a Medium Roast Blend but close enough to what I had drank from what she bought over from her own Country in Colombia.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn from her she was disgusted here in "Americas" of what they had deemed as Colombian coffee when it was merely a mixture of this and that, showing me the labels; that was when I began to start reading coffee labels.  Furthermore, she even indicated that while they do grow coffee beans in Colombia, but a small percentage of them are actually pure Colombian. So much did I learn what the Colombians did, With her being gone, no idea if she has returned back to the USA or is stuck in Colombia. But one thing she taught me that I never had forgotten was "READ THE LABELS". I was even surprised by some of the expensive, imported 100% Colombian coffee were not, but rather a mixture of this and that with Colombian coffee being at the very bottom of the list! I guess the saying still rings true, "if it's too good to be true, it prolly is..."<br /><br />Not so with Starbucks Colombia Coffee!<br /><br />Whenever I drink this, I remember her brothers, her families, and of course her - whether I am at Starbucks or at home. To some, might find this rather strong, but I never use the exact dosage, I use less for that reason - for it is so rich and full of flavor, there is no need to waste it. I keep mine sealed, and yes, in a Freezer Zipped Bag to keep its freshness.<br /><br />I also use this for Iced Coffee as well during hot summer dog days of the months, it is refreshing.

review/summary: Starbucks Columbia Coffee
review/text: This coffee variety (Columbia) offers a nice alternative to the Pike Roast which the company uses as its default blend at their coffee shop locations. When traveling thru O'Hare Airport in Chicago I'm usually a customer of the MacDonald's for coffee, since the Starbucks in the United Concourse only dispenses Pike (except at seasonal times with Holiday/Christmas Blend). I keep the unopened bags in the freezer to prevent the ground beans from oxidizing.

review/summary: Bold - just short of a French Roast
review/text: I like this coffee. It is NOT a French roast but as  another reviewer said it is Bold and has some good flavor with no "off" tastes. The beans are roasted to a dark brown, not the oily black, typical of a french roast. Yet it is similar to a french roast with a nice strong flavor<br /><br />I was very disappointed with another Boyer's selection - their "Denver" blend - which I found so bland that it was almost tasteless.<br /><br />This is a great buy and I would recommend it. The vacuum sealing seemed far better this time when compared to the Boyer's "Denver" blend I tried a month earlier.<br /><br />A minor point - the bag is not as easily resealable as most bulk packaged coffees and you may want to store it in a container rather than trying to reseal the bag.

review/text: Boyer's Rocky Mountain Thunder Has a Bold and rich flavor.<br />It's a dark roasted coffee bean. We grind our coffee beans fresh<br />at the start of the week. I grind the beans very fine, almost like powder to draw that Bold And Rich Flavor from the beans. Don't have to use as much coffee when the beans are ground fine. We purchaced a bag of this coffee about two years ago while in Colorado Springs. When we returned home and needed more coffee I could not the Boyer's brand any where. I went online and found that Amazon stocked Boyer's Coffee. I'm a Happy guy again.

review/summary: 14 cans arrived damaged
review/text: 14 out of 24 cans arrived dented, due to inadequate packaging (boxes were shrink wrapped to a cardboard tray and then thrown in a shipping box with a small amount of butcher paper).  Dense material like canned goods should be surrounded with packing peanuts in order to arrive undamaged.  Needless to say, I will not order canned goods again through Amazon.<br /><br />This is not the end of the story.  Amazon's standard policy on damaged food is 10%, or 20% maximum discount.  In this case, 58.3% of the food  arrived damaged--and no way was I going to pay for what I won't use.  After 1/2 hour on the phone, the customer service manager granted me an "exception" and allowed a refund of 58.3% of my purchase price.  But I should not have had to waste so much of my time insisting on it.<br /><br />That said, Harmony Farms dog food itself is a great product.  The reason I'm willing to pay almost $2 per can is that it's made in the USA (no danger of melamine, etc.).  So there you have it.  Good product, but you'll probably be happier if you find a place to buy it locally.

review/summary: Shiny Bouncy Hair
review/text: When a shampoo is really creamy I tend to think it is going to weigh down my hair. Such was not the case with this luxuriously lathering shampoo. It deep cleaned my hair and scalp and seemed to leave each strand a little more nourished. After I blowdried my hair I could really see an increase in volume. My hair was also shiny and quite bouncy. One thing I noticed while using this shampoo is that you need less conditioner. I also had to learn to use much less shampoo than I normally use. Just a quarter size amount in your palm is all you really need. The mild floral scent is also lovely.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
