review/text: I have a 14 year old terrier that can't chew the really thick rawhide strips anymore.  Also, he's always had pretty bad breath.  I find that he's able to chew most of these pretty easily and they do help with his breath.  The only drawback is that the Chlorhexidine coating on the strips tends to stain the carpet so you have to watch that.  Also, the price on Amazon was about 1/3 what they charge at my vet so that's a big plus also.

The only thing he likes to eat more appears to be flies.

And, Amazon prices are about half what it is at the Vet's office for twice as much.

review/summary: Great product but uneven quality control
review/text: After spending over $600 to have my English cocker spaniel's teeth cleaned, I began looking for a product that would help eliminate or delay having this procedure done again.  On the recommendation of my veterinarian, I purchased a bag of these chews on Amazon (the prices are just too high at the vet's office).  My dog loves them!  He begs for one every evening after his dinner (dry kibble).  They are non-staining on the carpet and paws.  These chews, along with 3X a week tooth brushing with C.E.T. toothpaste, will hopefully keep his breath sweet-smelling and delay having dental work done any time soon.  My only complaint with this product is that in the same bag of 30 chews, you will find some of them to be very thick and others to be very thin.  It would be nice if they were more uniform in size as on some evenings my dog finishes his chew in just a few minutes and other evenings he gets to settle in with a good long chew-fest.

review/summary: Lab swallows these whole
review/text: I have five dogs and have been feeding both the medium and large sizes of this product for several months.  I have no doubt that it cleans their teeth.  However, I have two problems with this product.  One is with the sizing.  In the large size, there are always plenty of chews that should be considered medium.  Since I pay extra for the large size, I expect that they should all be large.  Also, there are often ones included that are way too thick, and can't be chewed in a reasonable time.<br />The other problem is with my old black lab mix, Fargo.  He chews for awhile and then proceeds to swallow the whole thing.  Invariably, it gets caught in his throat and I have to fish it out.  He resents this as he believes I am trying to steal it.  I have discontinued using these and am looking for another product that works equally well but is less apt to be swallowed whole.

review/summary: Bad  Tooth Tartar: all but gone
review/text: I have a Rescue Weiner dog with teeth that had very bad tartar from front to back. Simply said, they were total brown. The vet suggested scraping which costs about $90.00. She sold me the large size (bag of 15 each) for about $18.00. Foxie the Weiner dog loves them. I also gave her Cow knees fron the butcher shop. (You can bake the knees to get rid of the grease and rancid smell.)The combination of the two has cleaned the dogs teeth remarkably in about thirty + days. She no longer needs to have her teeth scraped. I searched many internet sources for these products. With the $25.00 minimum Amazon supersaver shiping I saved about 45% off of the vet's cost and about 20% to 30% from many online vendor's.I saved $ by buying the large size, then cut them in half with a sharp knife or poultry shears.To keep you dog from vomiting the chew, use the large or extra large size. Take the chew away after 15-20 minutes before the dog can soften the entire chew, swallow it whole and gag/vomit!<br /><br />  Bob Howard, Seattle Wa

review/summary: UNSAFE - choking hazard - try VeggieDent chews instead
review/text: Our vet recommended getting "C.E.T. chews" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being "C.E.T chews" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the VeggieDent chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews.

review/summary: Throw That Beef-Flavored Toothpaste Away!
review/text: Let's face it, the finger-brush & beef-flavored toothpaste is a nightmare.  My sweet, gentle dog, who seems ok with just about anything that comes her way, drew the line at the fingertip toothbrush.<br /><br />She loves these chews though.  I know because when I give her a treat that she's not crazy about, she'll eat it and stand there looking at me like she's waiting for something better.  If I give her a treat that she likes, she'll trot off happily to the other room to enjoy it. When I give her these chews, she takes off like a bat out of Hades, and she stays occupied longer than with most other chews we've tried.<br /><br />Plus, they really do help keep her teeth healthy & clean, and the vet even mentioned her healthy teeth during her last visit.  Great product.

review/summary: Doesn't have same effect on humans.
review/text: This seemed (at first) like a cheap alternative for tooth brushing, but after a few weeks without substantial results I'm beginning to have my doubts. I've received numerous complaints regarding bad breath from my girlfriend, and have discovered a noticeable increase in salivation as well as unsightly hair growth. I've read that many dogs have choked, gagged, and even puked while eating these hygiene chews. Unfortunately I can report the same problems during human consumption. This is mainly because they are a little too big to be swallowed whole, and sometimes when you're eating especially vivaciously they'll tend to slowly clog your throat if you forget to swallow often enough, triggering your gag reflex. It does merit three stars however, because they taste DELICIOUS. The taste itself is worth the negative side-effects. I've seen no reviews so far covering effects on humans, so I just thought I'd throw in a few of own my personal experiences.

review/text: These dogs chews are the best for my three dogs!  I've noticed that it has cleared up the plaque in their teeth. The trick is to buy the chews that have the "Chlorhexidine." I highly recommend this product to any dog parent. However, one thing to keep in mind is that not all dogs' stomach may agree to the chews. My other dog that lives with parents can't eat these chews because it upsets his stomach.

There are many of them that are too small or way too thick so you end up having to throw them away.  They really should be the same sizes and density but unfortunately they are not.  Some of the chews in this pack really belong to the 51+ pounds pack.

review/text: My dogs love these chews...must have one every night.  However, I am continually disappointed in the quality control with this product.  I have ordered numerous bags of these chews and the variability in size between bags is amazing.  Sometimes you will get a bag that has thick chews that are  suitable for my big guys, other times the chews are paper thin and twisted.  They do help keep teeth clean.  Don't leave dogs alone with them because they can be choking hazard.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K8Q">C.E.T.

review/summary: Hextra chews = STAINS
review/text: this was my first time buying the hextra chews for my two dogs. they like them but i had no idea that it would leave stains on my rugs, carpet and furniture since the product description had no warning of this. i read some reviews where others didn't have this staining problem so maybe i just got a bad batch? even so, i wouldn't recommend the hextra chews just incase and would suggest getting the other version, C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces.

review/summary: Same as the pros sell!
review/text: This is our first on-line purchase of the CET HEXtra chews after getting them from the Vet for years.  Our 21# Scottie-girl prefers the large, as do we.  I don't care for the smaller size in a chew like this.  I'd rather be able to see it while she's chewing.  I reckon the chlorhex-a-stuff gets chewed/licked off pretty quickly and it's certainly a distinctive aroma.  Our Scottie-girl has a collection of these in various places around the house and she picks out her 'favorite' from time to time.<br /><br />While we have found a skinny-er-than-normal chew occasionally(one or two per bag), they are usually still large enough to call 'large', I suppose.  The problem with the really thins ones is their propensity to go 'limp' rather quickly.  I usually nab these while the young lady isn't looking and dispose of them straight away.  As such, she will get one or two 'outings' with the skinny ones and in the trash they go.<br /><br />The savings over our vet's price is about $10/bag; so I do feel a little less guilty when ordering from the 'zon for such a savings.  I could see us doing this about half the time if the prices stay the same.  I'm still happy to support our vet with retail purchases since the office has been very kind and helpful with our little 'girl'.<br /><br />Product was as described and delivered in a timely fashion...two paws up!

review/summary: Bad Breath gone in days!
review/text: My dogs were in desperate need of some breath freshing (as well as teeth cleaning). I have been using these for about 4-5 days now giving each of my two dogs one after dinner every night and I have noticed a difference in their teeth and breath already! Also if you are worried about a finicky eater- DON'T. My rescue dog doesn't like raw hides or any chew toys but he actually chews and finishes these and in about 15 minutes! I plan on making this an after dinner ritual from now on! I wish they were a little cheaper so it may be more of an every other day ritual :)<br /><br />***Update: So my golden retriever just had his annual exam and this is the first time that our vet has said his teeth looked great! He usually pushes us to have a dental cleaning and again...this is the first time he has not told us that Ramsey needed a dental cleaning! I am just amazed at the amount of tartar that this has removed. Other than a few brown spots around his gumline on his back teeth his teeth are white and shiny! Oh and that knock-you-out bad breath is a distant memory!

review/summary: DANGER TO DOGS
review/text: My dog was chewing on these chews and since they seemed thinner and smaller than the last batch, I kept a close watch on him. Last night he started choking and gagging as he tried to swallow the partially eaten, soggy chew.<br /><br />I first tried to give him the Heimlich, then had to pull the part of the chew sticking out from his throat out! There was blood all over his blanket. It was very traumatic to say the least. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! Get Greenies or something else that's not a choking hazard.

review/text: I have purchased these a couple of times before, my dog loves them and they help his breath greatly (if only briefly). However, the last time they seemed to be so flimsy my dog gagged on them because they bend so easily. I buy the large size and although they are big enough, they are definitely not thick enough for a large dog. The last bag I bought is pretty much sitting around and these are waaay too costly to purchase again unless they improve them. I did read the same in other reviews, wish I had listened :(

review/text: I have a 3yr. old female border collie and she absolutely loves these treats! I got her the one with the chlorhexidine since I know it will work on reducing her calculus and it has! I have been giving her these 2x/daily after her meals and she chews it up right away. I agree that any type of treat you should supervised your pet accordingly but knowing my dog she's very smart and knows not to swallow it whole- she takes her time chewing and licking the taste. There is a strong smell to these treats which make them more attractive to the dog but honestly the smell isn't that bad. Overall it really does work and I'm so glad that Amazon offers it at such a great price and speedy delivery! =) Will definitely be buying more for sure!

She loves the taste and smell of them (I don't mind the smell either), and I love even more that they don't leave stains on my furniture like typical rawhide chews do.  I did not give 5 stars only because they can be choking hazards if your dog is not supervised when eating these.  But as long as your mindful of watching your dog while they enjoy these treats, I have nothing bad to say!  It's a great preventative to bad breath and bad teeth!

review/text: The chews really seem to do the job.  My Lab mix  will turn his nose up to the typical rawhide chew.  He really likes and looks forward to getting his C.E.T. HEXtra chews.  He can hardly wait once he hears the bag.  His breath isn't bad at all. Even though he was a rescue dog his teeth were in pretty good shape.  The vet from the rescue gave him a clean bill of health.  Too soon to take him to my vet for a check-up.  I will know in a few months what my vet thinks.  But just looking at his teeth for an 8 year old dog they look pretty darn good.  The only down side is the sizes of the chews are not consistant.  Some are big and thick some small and very thin.  I purchased the large dog chews and many were just bite size.  This next bag is for X-tra large dogs hopefully it will have more unformed sized chews.

review/summary: CET pet Chewies... and the "Company"
review/text: I would never retract that the product seems to be excellent for our pet... and she really enjoys them.  I guess my now somewhat jaded view of the firm itself is from the fact that we did purchase a bag that was indeed problematic for our dog.  After incurring over $1,300 in vet bills to discover that base cause was that new bag of Virbac Chewies... Our contact with Virbac was friendly from a customer service standpoint... but the net result was not one dollar of help toward the .. for us... rather substantial vet bill. It seemed to be a management attitude of .... "there is no way our product could have had anything to do with the spewing diarhea.... so just go away"<br />Needless to say... we will find an alternative to Virbac in the future...<br /><br />It's really a shame... because before that bag and since... there has been no problem.  However.... as a small business owner... I cannot support a firm that has such a black and white attitude toward such matters.

review/summary: Healthy chew to keep your dog busy!
review/text: I bought both the CET HEXtra premium oral hygiene chews and CET Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to switch off so my dog doesnt get tired of chewing the same thing over and over. I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Like anyone has mention well with any kind of chew treats remember to take it away when it gets small or it can be a chocking hazard.

She eats about 3 per week. She will take in in her paws, lick and chew it away for about an hour. (We offer her one every day, but sometimes she doesn't feel like eating it, sniffs it and walks away). At her checkup 2 months ago, our veterinarian said her teeth are in excellent condition and recommended waiting until her next check-up in 6 months to reassess the need for teeth cleaning.

I wish they were  a little thicker or tougher so that she'd get more of the teeth cleaning benefit that chewing provides.

review/summary: Clean Teeth
review/text: This product is great. The cost to have the vet clean my 3 dogs teeth was outrageous so I tried these. I first bought these chews at my vets office for twice the price I paid here. I give each dog one chew daily and I no longer have to have their teeth cleaned!

review/text: I have three dogs, and they can be picky about what food and treats they like.  When offered these chews, though, there is no hesitation at all.  And the dogs always chew them up right away, they never get stashed for later.

review/text: My dogs love it and the great thing is that it doesn't upset their stomach and it does not give them the runs.  Great for teeth and gives them something to do.  The only concern is that you need to watch them because they can choke on it when the piece gets small.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE these Chews!!
review/text: My dogs absolutely love these chews and pick them over anything else! They have never choked on them and they last awhile (depending on the size of your dog). My Lab likes the large size and it takes about 5 minutes, but my King Charles Spaniel takes about 15 minutes to chew a medium. Their teeth are also pretty clean, but I do brush them about once a week, so I am not sure if it is from the chews. Enjoy!!

review/summary: My dog LOVES these bones and so do I....
review/text: These bones really freshen the breath and clean the teeth.  My dog was a rescue whose teeth were beyond gross.  After having them professionally cleaned, he still had terrible breath.  After giving these on a regular basis - his breath is much more pleasant.  I usually buy these from my Vet at a greater expense.  Glad to find these online for less money, more convenient, and don't have to wait for a Vet appt to get them.  I bought 3 more bags since this order.

review/text: I've been giving one of these a day to my dog for the past 2 months. She previously had a bit of tartar build-up on her back teeth despite a very healthy diet and daily compressed rawhide bones. Before, my vet recommended a yearly teeth cleaning (which I'm too paranoid about to go through with!). But the last time my dog and I went to the vet, the vet was really impressed with how clean my dog's teeth were -- almost all the plaque is gone! Yay! It's fantastic to be able to do something that's SO quick and SO easy and prevents your pet from having to undergo anesthesia and a pricey $600+ dental cleaning procedure! Plus, my dog loves these chews.

review/text: Even though these chews are advertised as suitable for "large dogs", they are not.  80% of the pieces are too small and thin to be safely chewed for more than one or two minutes by my puppy who is not even 5 months old.  Even though my pup seems to like the taste, I can't risk his health and safety on these improperly sized chews. Look for something else to provide to your dog to satisfy his urge to chew.

review/text: Our Black Lab has been eating these since we got her 4 years ago.  They are a dental hygiene product and very effective.  Labs would eat all day long given the opportunity so her HEXtra Chew in the morning after breakfast and a plain C.E.T. Chew at noon helps to keep her appetite satisfied without adding many calories.  Helps satisfy her chewing instincts, too, although she has learned to chew them pretty fast.  One hint is not to give them toward the end of the day as our dog occasionally used to barf them in the night.  Great product!

review/text: I have a very active lab that loves to chew.  He really enjoys these treats, but I have to ration him -- he gags on them all the time.  I usually give him this treat when he's sitting on the back porch relaxing and chewing up a tennis ball.  These really seem to improve his breath... but he inevitably pushes it too far back in his mouth until he gags or throws up.<br /><br />I haven't seen any real difference to his teeth - no reduction in plaque or tartar.... but I keep hoping.

All we have to say is "do you want a chewy?" and she starts jumping and twirling in the air with excitement!  Recently, she spent a few days with a dog sitter who didn't know about this particular brand... after seeing our dogs reaction she went online and purchased some for her two dogs.  I highly recommend these as safe and easily digestible treats that provide a good work-out for your dog and help keep their teeth clean and fresh smelling at the same time!

review/text: Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.

review/text: I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like "Pop Tarts" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.

review/text: I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster "pastry" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of "frosting" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much "sweet cardboard".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.

They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.
