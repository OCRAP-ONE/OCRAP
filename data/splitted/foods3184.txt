review/text: This is the dearest Mirin I've used.  I say dearest because there is nothing<br />offensive in it's taste..  no chemical tastes and a perfect balance of sweets,<br />salts, and alcohol.<br /><br />It sweetness and saltiness are "just right" nothing<br />to crazy -<br />Reminds me of "carmel" almost "butterscotch"<br /><br />It's so nice that sometimes I'll heat a little bit up on the stove in small<br />porcelaine cup, like you would with saki, just to get tuned into the<br />flavor I'm using in the dish.. (and it's just really nice to sip ;)<br /><br />I won't comment on the price because money is irrelevant when your looking for<br />the best product to fuel your passions!<br /><br />matt

review/text: If you do much japanese-style cooking, mirin is on the grocery list. In the southeastern mountains of Idaho, one 10oz bottle is [...] bucks...IF it's in stock. Mirin is mirin (to me, so far) cost is the factor. The mega-bottle and free shipping seals the deal.

review/summary: Really? Do Dogs Eats These? Not No but Hepher No!
review/text: I'm sorry I do not know what kind of dog the wonderful reviewer has, maybe a real cow dog? But my dogs will not touch these! Period. Well, actually a few did but it was with disgust and only long enough to drag them away from their bowl or bed and deposit elsewhere. Seriously; my dogs run now when they see one. They think it's a snake or something I guess. So if you have a dog like most us humans that like most of us have one that doesn't take too well to animal ears unless they are warm & running then do not waste your money on these.

review/summary: A MUST for balsamic vinegar fans who grill!
review/text: I LOVE to grill!  And when I do, I'll grill any vegetable in the house that's not moving.  My only problem with grilled veggies is that there are seldom leftovers for the next day when I do this really simple, stupid recipe:<br /><br />Try those mini-sweet peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, onions, garlic, artichoke hearts, thinly sliced sweet potatoes, etc.  Slice/clean them to chunky stir-fry size.  Marinate them in olive oil and this amazing fig-balsamic vinegar glaze.  Grill them on a wok-for-the-grill -- saves skewering them (no matter how well you do it, they still fall off!).  Remove when done to your liking.  Then drizzle more of this glaze and then add salt and pepper to taste.  You will get raving reviews from your guests.  The problem is that once you put it on the plate (and I have a HUGE one), everything disappears before you, the grill-master, gets a chance to nibble some!  So keep aside what you want, THEN give the rest to your guests!<br /><br />I've done many meats grilled with this as a finishing glaze -- even moose and bear.  (Hey, I live in Alaska, and we have great road kill up here!)  I've even grilled "chicken in foil", a favorite of the pu-pu platter, and with only the addition of ginger and soy to the glaze, and I have a winner!!  I just have to make PLENTY of it.<br /><br />If you don't like any of the above recommendations, whine to me in any subsequent reviews.  I grilled all the above on charcoal, not gas, so there might be that missing element of smoky flavor, but I still get great results even with my George Foreman grill.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: My wife and I are not coffee drinkers, and I can't stand herbal teas, but we get cold just like everyone else out there.  When my wife gets cold she relishes a good cup of hot chocolate, but let's just say that hot chocolate and I do not get along.<br /><br />I came across Steven's Gourmet Wassail - Citrus and Spice - a couple of years ago, and I love this stuff.  This wassail is sweet, but not as sickly sweet as hot apple ciders can be.  I like the fact that I can pop a mug of water in a microwave for 1.5-2 mins, add the wassail powder, and be sipping immediately.  The citrus flavor is also one I like when I am not feeling on top of my game...like when I'm dealing with a head cold.  And there is just enough spice to give it a little twang, but not enough to overpower the citrus.<br /><br />All in all this is my clear hot drink of choice.<br /><br />If you are like me and you don't get along with hot chocolate this might be a new favorite.<br /><br />5 stars hands-down!

review/summary: This Product has NEW LABELING
review/text: When i first received this product from the seller, it was in the new label format which does not contain the big blue words FOR COLIC. Instead it states "Fast Management of Colic" in smaller blue lettering. Blue Baby Fund inc contacted me quickly when i made a request for return and eventually I WAS WRONG in my initial assumption that they sent me the wrong product. My son since birth had problems with breast milk and regular milk for infants. He literally looked like someone was stabbing him in the stomach from gas and other complications from milk. We did heavy research until we found this enfamil and what a big difference it made. Honestly, a babies colic can break up a marriage from frustration. When you love your child so much and will do anything to help your baby, you will fight with your spouse to figure out what to try to help the baby. Thank God we found this product. My son has been on it from about 2 months until present day (9 months). Its expensive but worth every penny. Hes had constipation maybe 3 times between 7 months and 9 months. A little apple juice or prune juice mixed with water solves that. I have no complaints except the pricing, but it is what it is. If your baby is cramping up try this milk and see if it helps. God bless. Thanks again BLUE BABY FUND INC!

review/summary: Mmmmmm, Yum!
review/text: My wife picked up a canister of Gerber's Graduates Lil' Crunchies (Cheese flavored) and they were an instant hit with our one-year-old boy. Now we always have cans sitting around in the house and car. When he gets whiney, a Crunchy will almost always catch his attention. He loves them!<br /><br />In shopping around, we find that the Crunchies are available in a variety of flavors, but our boy always greatly preferred the cheese variety, so we continued to purchase them. Then, one day we found the Cinnamon Maple variety and decided to pick up a canister. Wow! They really hit the spot! He begged for more, even more than for the cheese ones. Mmmmm yum! OK, now we have another kind around in addition to the cheesy ones.<br /><br />Personally, I don't see what the big attraction is. They're nice and light-crunchy and practically melt in your mouth. They taste slightly like a very lightly flavored cinnamon roll with a slight emphasis on the cinnamon. If it were my choice, I'd favor the cheese variety.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Unlike the other flavors, they don't have that gross smell! These smell amazing! It's like when you first walk into a Yankee Candle store or a scentsy party. I love that aspect, as well as how much she enjoys these healthy snacks. She has gone through just about every snack they have for her age, and this is one of four things that she will happily chow down on. I would be lost without these

review/summary: The Best Hot Cereal Ever
review/text: I've been using this product since the early '70's, and when it disappears from the grocer's shelves I get upset as a baby who wants his pablum! I'm glad it's available online. Buckwheat is closest to animal protein of all the grains, and the grain in its various forms has been a staple in Europe and Asia. The cereal cooks quickly and can be used in a variety of recipes. Best of all, it's a tasty alternative to wheat, oats and rice. You've probably had kasha, made from the roasted groats which have a strong, nutty flavor. Cream of buckwheat is bland, I mean good-bland, because it won't turn off the kids and lends itself to various sweeteners. Though it's not shown on the Cream of Buckwheat box, it works as an "instant" bowl of hot cereal: Follow the measuring directions for a single serving, put in a microwaveable cereal bowl 1/4 c. cereal to 1 1/4 c. water. Microwave on MEDIUM (I use power # 6 or 7 of 10) for 4 min., interrupting once or twice to stir. Important: Do not cook on high, or the mixture will boil over! If you need to cook longer than 4 min., make sure you reset the power for medium. If desired, add milk (I use soy) and sweeten (I like maple syrup).

review/summary: Yummy gluten-free breakfast cereal
review/text: This cereal is delicious! I used to eat steel-cut oatmeal, but my doctor put me on a gluten-free diet. This is a wonderful substitution for my steel-cut oatmeal. In fact, I like this cereal better than steel-cut oatmeal.<br /><br />Like most people, I don't have a lot of time in the morning to cook breakfast during the week. So, I make a big pot of this cereal on the weekend and store the leftovers in the refrigerator. I add a little vanilla after the cereal has been cooked. Bourbon vanilla compliments this cereal well.<br /><br />I reheat the cereal in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. Then, I sprinkle on a little cinnamon and add a sliced banana. It fills me up. Also, this cereal is tasty plain.

review/summary: Absolutely perfect breakfast
review/text: I love the organic Cream of Buckwheat.  It makes an absolutely perfect, gluten-free, protein/carb balanced filling breakfast.  I make it with 1 cup Silk Pure coconut milk (80 cals, 45% DV calcium, 24% DV Vitamin D), 1/4 - 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup buckwheat, bring to a boil and let it simmer 10 minutes.  Stir in "warm" spices (I use a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardomom, tumeric for its anti-inflammatory properties, cloves) and it's absolutely lovely.  The coconut milk is sweet enough (6 g sugar) that - for my taste - it doesn't need for agave, maple, or other sweeteners...and I have a huge sweet tooth.  Sometimes I'll add fruit (banana, peach, berries, whatever I have) and it's even more filling.  Highly recommended.

In my opinion, it has a better flavor than plain old oatmeal and it's wheat and gluten free, which is a bonus for people who need to avoid wheat or gluten products or who are on a low-glycemic index diet such as South Beach.<br /><br />I like the versatility of the cereal - you can easily flavor it to be sweet like oatmeal or savory like grits and it's delicious either way.

review/text: I am gluten free (and have other allergies) and I use this as a hot cereal.  I do cook it in the microwave sometimes.  I have actually used it mostly as a savory cereal - with sausage.  Sometimes i mix it with corn grits.<br /><br />Recently i've also put it in a multigrain slow rise gluten free bread, and it was really good.  I havent liked the flavor of buckwheat flour, but I love the flavor of this buckwheat cereal.

review/text: This cereal is great! We cook it and throw in berries or apples and cinnamon and it is tasty. The boxes came with a recipe for buckwheat and cauliflower soup, which may not sound good, but it is delicious and filling. It's really a pretty versatile food. Better for you than oat meal or rice.

review/text: While the product seems O.K. the expiration date is in code.  After 5 days of calling the customer service 800 number to find out the expiration date and getting a full voice mail that was unable to to take messages.  I looked up and called the main number at my expense.  When I explained what I had been encountering the woman said "just a minute" and promptly transferred me to the same full (now for 6 days)voice mail.  When I called back and explain again the situation the woman got very rude and and asked me "what the heck I needed to know the expiration date for anyway".  I simply ended the call and decided this was a "consumer food company" I would never deal with again.

review/summary: An Earl Grey Tea for Earl Grey Tea Lovers!
review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best Earl Grey tea!
review/text: Within seconds of immersing St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea bag into steaming water, the enticing, aromatic blend of Ceylon tea and the all natural flavor of bergamot, a citrus fruit, wafts gently above your tea cup.  The uniquely pleasing taste of St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea could be due to its 100% certified organic status - no chemicals or preservatives to interfere with its taste.  Each tea bag is hermetically sealed in a foil-wrapped container which retains its flavor until tea time.<br /><br />From St. Dalfour's site:<br />"Does it taste great and is it as healthful and nutritious as possible? These are the principles which are at the core of each line of St. Dalfour products. A simple philosophy. For simply fantastic food. The quality of our products depends on each ingredient, so we travel wherever necessary to source the finest raw materials. Products are released to market only after they have attained and surpassed the most rigorous standards. In this age of finding shortcuts and cutting costs, we remain guided by only one criterion: offering our consumers in over 90 countries worldwide the very finest all-natural products and ensuring that they are worthy of the St. Dalfour name."

I know rancid oil when I taste it, and this is the worst I have ever tried to eat. The package expiration date is October of this year (2011), so I guess they just always taste this bad. Either that or they have been exposed to extreme heat or something. Either way, there is a NO RETURN policy on them, so my advice is DON'T BUY THEM!<br /><br />I use Amazon a lot, and this is the worst product I have ever had from them.

I am going to have to start shopping at Amazon!<br /><br />It is so easy to make, and yeah - if you had seen my video reviews you would have noticed the chopsticks *laughing* - would that give you a clue? HINT HINT HINT?<br /><br />This is really great stuff, honest to goodness where you would would almost nearly say "Your Mom made it" - but of course, not easy and quickie for those at work; but for those at home, it's great, even adding in or tossing in some veggies to thawed out already cooked shrimp and leave in bowl for another minute will warm it up and you'll have yourself a nice hearty meal on top of everything without having to make a mess.<br /><br />What makes this so wonderful is - for Caretakers caring for someone to those who live alone; one would be pleasantly surprised how much they can become creative with this by just tossing in or adding in just a few more items and *BINGO!* you're all filled up without any dishes, pots, pans, and everything else to clean up.<br /><br />It's light, full of flavor, and filling; and if you added more - such as at home, it could very well be your biggest meal of the day for the "Young at Hearts" where at dinner time you'll be finding yourself making yourself a sandwich or a small T.V. Dinner because you would still be full from that hearty lunch!<br /><br />:)

review/summary: Tasty and surprisingly substantial.
review/text: Directions are simple: simmer the (dry) sauce packet in 4 cups of water for about 30 minutes.  Add shrimp if desired.  The rice (about 1 cup dry) is in a separate packet and cooked separately.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly thick, rich soup with a very full round flavor.  There are hints of spicy but not more so than the spiciness of something like white pepper.  It is definitely not too salty.<br /><br />After tasting it for purposes of the review, I added some chunked yellow onion, red bell pepper, celery, sausage, and simmered further; also some canned crab.  Made for a pretty good soup.  Doing it again, I'd be happy to cook this with whole crab or shrimp, but my personal preference would be to leave out the canned version; I like whole crab, but don't really care for all the (Gullah-brand high quality) canned crab meat stirred into the soup.<br /><br />Directions say it "serves 6."  I think this is true, particularly if some additions are made.<br /><br />The product sells for around $8.00.  I was given it as a gift.  It seems pricier than similar mixes, but really does make more food and includes the rice.  Even with the additions, this is a very quick meal and is as tasty as anything else that could be made in the same amount of time.  I'd buy this again just to add a little easy variety to the weeknight menu.

review/text: My Dobie, Max, has never passed up a chance to gobble up whatever food he is given. Until now. He absolutely refuses to eat this Eukanuba. I have tried mixing other dry food that he really loves with this Eukanuba. What he does is push the Eukanuba out of his food bowl onto the floor and eats the other food. The only way I can get him to eat any of this dry Eukanuba food is to coat it with canned Eukanuba wet dog food, especially chicken. He will eat all the coated dry food but if there is any that did not get completely coated he won't gobble it down as he does the completely coated stuff.<br /><br />Eukanuba told my wife that this food is made in the USA and I really hate to give it one star. But I can only judge it by what Max thinks of it and that is one star. If I were judging the canned food it would be 5 stars but this review is for Eukanuba Custom Care Healthy Joints and the best I can do is 1 star.

Additionally, they appear to use pickle juice along with (or instead of) vinegar, giving the flavor profile a heavy note of dill which I found unpleasant.

review/summary: LOVE these chips - warning on shipment damage
review/text: I have been a huge fan of these chips for over a year.  Always available at Safeway for $2.99 a bag.  I settled on these after looking at the nutritional info for every single corn chip in the aisle, including normal chips and "health" chips.  You will NOT find a lower fat, higher fiber chip without paying double the price for a "health" variety.  Just get these and you are much better off in your wallet and taste buds!<br /><br />Since my local safeways seem to have stopped carrying the standard corn chips, I looked to Amazon.  The price cannot be beaten, especially with free prime shipping, but I will warn others that the handling of this shipment caused lots of damage to the chips.  I would realistically say that only about 10 chips in the bag were still intact triangles.  Since I use these with my homemade salsa to scoop, this wasvery annoying.<br /><br />I'm giving this another from Amazon shot since I don't have another local purchase option, but wanted to warn others.

I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

The Signature Creama works so well with these liquid creamers! I first put the cream in the cup and then add the disc to it. The result is a flavored coffee with a really light foam on top. Also, I have not seen Tassimo cream based beverages in a fat free variety yet, so this is a great alternative. I use fat-free half and half and the fat-free french vanilla. Very very good!

review/summary: Excellent Every Day Coffee
review/text: UPDATE:  6/30/08...18 months later, thousands of 'brews' later...and still just as thrilled as the day I met Gevalia Signature Crema Blend coffee!  For summertime cooler...and much cheaper than the $5+ versions sold at Dunkin****** and Star***** try this:  Brew Crema, add International Delight French Vanilla creamer, and pour over ice in tall glass.  With single-brew systems, no waste & instant service!  Now pocket your savings, add the gas money you didn't spend...and voila, you just paid for your next 16-count package w/ free shipping from Amazon.  Enjoy.<br /><br />FIRST POSTING:  I have had my Tassimo machine for 5 months now, and I am thrilled.  As a coffee nut, I used to brew several pots daily in my Farberware.  Problem is I can only drink fresh coffee!  I had to pitch the pot and start over for each cup.  Tassimo is a true value if you and your household drink coffee, tea, hot cocoa, etc. all day and night.  Tried all of the coffee blends (well over 20) made for this machine, and the Gevalia Crema and Crema decaf. are the best all around med-bodied coffee.  I'm actually on Amazon to order more...and decided that I'd throw my 2 cents in!  Enjoy.

review/text: We love this crema coffee.  It has much more flavor than the regular coffee Gevalia makes for Tassimo.  It has a nice cream froth on top - not too much.  To make it extra special my husband adds a shot of espresso to it.  Enjoy

review/summary: Much too Bitter
review/text: When I purchased this item, I thought that I was going to get a coffee with cream, but that was not the case.  The coffee itself was much stronger and bitter, and the "cream" or crema was just some powdered stuff that created a milky foam on top of the coffee, but did not change the color or flavor of the coffee at all.  I would not purchase this item again.

review/summary: Very weak
review/text: Based on the reviews here, I had high hopes for this coffee.  I realize it's a mild coffee, but it is really lacking taste and just seems very watery.  I tried making a smaller cup, which did help a little, but I'm still disappointed.  I won't be purchasing this one again.  I wonder if this is typical of Gevalia t-discs, cause I was disappointed in the Gevalia Capp as well (the Maxwell House is WAY better).

review/summary: Watery and lousy...
review/text: I'm a huge fan of almost every variety of hot beverages the Tassimo makes...  this is not one of them.  If you make a full cup, it tastes very lackluster and watery.  The head of foam is very thin and disappears very quickly.  Both of these problems can be improved by making a smaller cup, but even so, it still doesn't hold a candle to other flavors.<br /><br />If you want a GREAT cup of Tassimo crema, go for the Mastro Lorenzo Crema.  HUGE improvement in taste, and the foam is nice and thick.<br /><br />Tassimo makes lots of great drinks...  but skip this one.

review/text: I'm giving this 2 stars because possibly this is just not to my liking for my taste buds.<br />I do not like my coffee with this kind of biting almost citric after taste.  It simply gives me sour stomach and my stomach doesn't get that way easily.<br />I enjoy a strong cup of hearty bold flavor once in a while, but this is too biting for me.  Adding sugar? No help.  It also seems watery. I try to focus my t-disc investments into the flavors I love, and purge the losers.  With a full box remaining I'm going to need to toss these.  Also misleading picture on the cover, which gives the impression of a milk based mixture. Their "Crema" is simply whipped bitter "air".

How could this one-step brewing process and small disc produce a decent cup of coffee?  Needless to say I was surprised and extremely satisfied with this product.  Gevalia Latte and Cappucino discs are surprisingly good as well!

review/summary: its a nice MILD coffee
review/text: I recently got my Tassimo machine as a bridal shower present. I'm still trying out all of the different coffees available, but so far this is my favorite. This coffee is very mild (as it states on the package) but has a wonderfully smooth taste. I also love the layer of foam, it just adds a little something. :)  Typically I brew a cup, then add a little bit of flavored creamer and some milk because I like my coffee to be very creamy, but not super sweet. The mild flavor of the coffee blends really well with the creamer, you get this perfectly creamy, foamy, flavored coffee. yum!

review/text: I love this Gevalia Signature Crema Coffee, with or without froth added.  As a stand-alone, it's smooth and rich and flavorful, much more fully structured than anything I've had at any of the coffee chains. As a latte or with flavoring, it can be even richer.  I was highly skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but take it from someone who makes wine for a living and has developed a critical palate, this beverage is outstanding.  I never thought I could get this level of quality at home without spending outrageous amounts of money on Italian equipment.  The bang-for-your-buck is right here.  Thank you, Gevalia!  Bye, Starbucks.

review/text: I came across this in a grocery store last winter, brewed one hot cup, and put it back into the pantry only because I felt too guilty after spending money on it to throw it away. I was surprised that the flavor actually had a sourness to it. I found the tang of the tea very off-putting in a warm format. Why then, did I give the product a 5-star rating? This summer I started drinking iced tea and found that green tea with jasmine made a great cold cup, so I decided to give this a whirl. Delicious and refreshing!! I brew 6 bags in 8 cups of water with 1/2 cup of sugar melted in. The tang, when chilled, gives the tea a nice fruitiness. I will definitely buy this again.

review/text: I bought this to use with my Mr. Coffee Frappe maker. The package doesn't state how much to use other than "two scoops". It doesn't say how much two scoops is, so it takes some experimentation to get the right amount. I finally found what works good for me:<br /><br />ice to the fill line, 1/2 cup milk, squirt of Torani chocolate syrup, and 5 TBSP Mocaffe powder. The frappe maker uses 3 TBSP of coffee and 1/2 cup water to add the coffee to the frappe mix. The result for me is just as good as what I used to pay $3-4 dollars for at coffee shops. I bought this hoping to save some money at work on coffee drinks, and I absolutely love the results. Soooo good.

review/text: I have been a long time customer of Big Train iced coffee powders (specifically the espresso powder). I decided to try the MoCafe and to me it is ok. It  doesn't have the crisp coffee flavor that Big Train has, more subtle. The best way to put it would be to say it's like McDonald's coffee compared to Starbucks. The flavor is more subtle. With that said, it does blend to a flavor that is good for a frap. I will most likely use it occasionally until it is gone, and continue with Big Train. Also, the bags aren't that big compared to Big Train, less bang for the buck.

I pour tons of it in the bottom of a mug (about as much as can possibly dissolve in the coffee), pour the coffee on top aggressively (to reduce the need for mixing), and enjoy. It probably can no longer be called coffee at that point. I think it tastes like one of those expensive fancy pants "italian beverages" that people richer than me buy every morning. But I don't really know because I am not affluent.<br /><br />And if you buy 6-packs of CoffeeMate on the Internet, you probably aren't either.<br /><br />Enjoy life.

review/text: Turn your morning or evening coffee into a chocolate treat with this tasty creamer.  Rather than paying for those expensive mocha drinks at the coffee shoppe, make your own with this chocolate creamer.
