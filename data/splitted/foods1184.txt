review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: When I ordered a large amount of these books to share with child care providers, I was greatly disappointed in what arrived for the amount I paid. I was expecting a larger book, not the 4x5 inch book that was delivered.  It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.

review/summary: You'll use it once, you'll use it twice
review/text: One of my earliest memories is of this book.  My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.

review/summary: The story is great, the softcover book is disappointing
review/text: I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.

review/text: This copy is smaller than I expected (mostly because I didn't pay attention to the listed dimensions of the book). Maurice Sendak is a wonder, and this little book of months and rhymes is absolutely silly and so much fun to read. I remember it fondly as a child, and I wanted to make sure I had it for my little one's book shelf. Very cute way to teach the months of the year (not to mention celebrating my own personal love of soup) and beautifully illustrated in the way only Sendak can.

The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!  It came from this little witty book.  :-)

Santa Clause put this under the tree. Since then, we've read it perpetually and he loves it.<br /><br />First, this book taught him the months of the year.<br /><br />Second, it's a pleasure to read. Well suited to 1.5 y/o old to 4+.<br /><br />Very few children's books are worth owning. Most should be borrowed from the library. This book, however, deserves a permanent spot on your shelf. Sendak's best.

review/summary: MMMM chicken soup....
review/text: Summary:  A young boy describes the usefulness of chicken soup with rice for each month of the year.<br /><br />Evaluation:  With Sendak's creative repetitious and rhythmic words, children will enjoy and learn to read the story of a boy who loves chicken soup with rice!  Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.

review/text: Be careful when you are in Amazon's gluten free foods area.  I was looking for gluten free oats and went into a section that said "more gluten free food" and it took me to a "grocery" area that had things besides gluten free food.  I did not realize it took me out of the gluten free area and ordered Bob's Red Mill Oats.  When I received them and opened the box, I realized they were not gluten free.  Since it will cost me even MORE money to send back, I am donating them to a rescue mission for the poor but I am very upset at the money I spent and not getting gluten free oats.  Be advised,  always check each page you go to when looking for gluten free food as changing from one page to another can trick you into buying something you can't eat.  Very disappointed with Amazon.

review/summary: Incredible
review/text: These peppers are incredible on any sandwich or hoagie and mix well in spreads and sauces. They're decently hot, but have amazing flavor to boost any sort of dish. Not sure about paying about $5 a jar though, but if you can find this elsewhere, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Good product but expensive
review/text: After much trial and error I figured out that my older cat developed an allergy to chicken (it sounds ridiculous - I know).  After putting her directly on this food I saw immediate improvement, and within 2 days she appeared to be a perfectly healthy cat - no more liquid poo!  Normally you would want to gradually mix a new food with previous brand for several days so you don't upset your cat's stomach - I did this at the recommendation of a vet.  After a few weeks I could see a noticeably shinier coat and her attitude improved over the next few months. You do have to pay careful attention to how much of this food you feed your animal.  Remember that the directions are Guidelines not rules.  This food is rich in calories, so whole it looks like you are starving your poor cat, it's just not so.  My only gripe is that the product is expensive.  You get what you pay for, but this can really push your budget.

review/summary: Our cats like this food & I like the ingredients list
review/text: Our cats have been eating this food for about 7 months now - we switched to it when we merged households with a cat who eats Evo's turkey & chicken equivalent. The cats all seem to like the food, they are healthy with no issues, and I like that there is NO ASH, and no grain in this food. When I review the ingredients list, it's all stuff I'm happy to feed my cat.

review/text: I love Innova EVO pet food and so do my two cats. Very healthy, great quality food and I was glad to see that Innova EVO's dry cat food line have expanded on their formulas (more variety: e.g. chicken, fish, etc.). My only gripe was that the shipping made this a much more expensive item than if I had purchased it directly from my local downtown pet store!

review/summary: HORRIBLE!
review/text: I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina.

review/summary: Thank you for the research "Busy Mom"
review/text: First heard about Xylitol at my dentist's office. The dental hygenist was telling me about<br />a study that was done and that Xylitol helps with preventing cavaties.  My husband and I are<br />trying to avoid sodas and sugary drinks.  Instead this summer were drinking alot of ice tea and more<br />water.  I do like to sweeten my ice tea a little.  I remembered about the consersation on Xylitol<br />and thought about how it might be worth trying for the iced tea.  When I looked it up on Amazon I<br />read the reviews.  "Busy Mom" did a great review with all of her research.  I too did not want<br />anything that came from China, that sold me, so I am only buying the Emerald Forest Xylitol.  What I<br />like also is that it has no aftertaste.  I use just 1/4 measuring cup of Xylitol in making a<br />2 qt. container of iced tea.  You can bake with it also.  It's a little expensive, but much better<br />for keeping your sugar levels down.

review/text: Do you need to review Jell-O?  Normally no; but this is a special case.<br /><br />I ordered one 24-pack of the peach sugar-free Jell-O.  Of those 24 boxes, three were empty!  No inside envelope, and of course no product.<br /><br />While Amazon has always made good on any problem I've had, I felt that complaining about three boxes of Jell-O was really not worthy anybody's time.  However I did want to write this review so that others might be wary.  My suggestion: do as I will do from now on - check all boxes and let Amazon know if their customers are getting ripped-off, and then write your review to indicate the problem.  Eventually, the manufacturer will find that bad reviews don't help sales very much.

Add in the S&H and it comes ou to way more expensive.

review/text: How much more can a sane person say about Jell-0? It seems to have always been around, it is a low carb dessert and in my case, sugar free. You can not fall madly in love with Jell-o. You can eat it and congratulate yourself for your moderate intake of dessert. This particular Jell-o is of the peach variety and since water is its main component it is somewhat refreshing to the palate. Give it 4 Stars for its healthy connotations. Besides that, it has to be one of the most boring edible items known to mankind buy hey, when you replace a Key Lime Pie Dessert for a bowl of Peach Jell-o you are basically winning the fight against obesity and other caloric dramas. 4 Stars, if only for its clean cut reputation!

review/summary: I did not like this
review/text: I bought this to get a lower cal food for my cat who eats dry food at night. We were feeding blue buffalo wilderness chicken. My cat did not like this as well. It sort of had a dusty feel to it and besides that it was more calories per cup than the food from blue buffalo. The final straw was that it made his poop very stinky. A smaller thing I did not care for was that the bag did not have a zip lock thing to reseal it, so you had to cut it open and then either use a clip or put the whole thing in a plastic bag. I did not even finish the bag and will not buy it again.

review/summary: Yummy! Hope Organic Valley can lower the sugar even more
review/text: I was hesitate to buy it because of the bad review I read here but my son really loves milk with strawberry flavor. I used to buy the strawberry flavored milk from PediaSure. However, it's way too sweet and it's not organic. I decided to switch to organic milk since my son is eating better now. So far, Organic valley contains the least sugar compare to other organic milk such as Horizon. Horizon contains about 31g sugars while OV has about 24g. I tried the milk myself before I gave it to my son and I like it. I hate Pediasure although my son loves it but I won't mind to drink OV myself. Although the taste is nice, I hope OV can add even less sugar. 24g sugar is about 6 small packs of sugar. It's still little too much to a young child. However, I believe this is the best organic milk I can find on the market so far. I'm happy my son is drinking his milk every day and enjoys it.

The Organic Valley had good reviews and said that it was less sweet and it is 1% milkfat vs. 2% in the Horizon.  I purchased 2 cases and tried a couple of the milk boxes from each case ( I always try a product before giving it to my children).  The milk had such an off chemical taste, it was disgusting.  I had 4 of my children each take a sip to see if it was my taste buds and they all agreed with me.  I will never buy this product again and will stick with Horizon Organic milk products.  I am giving this product 1 star only because I have to rate it, I don't think it even deserves 1 star.

review/text: Ordered this in June of 2012 and the expiration date on the package was for November of 2011. Just like to know what I am getting before I order things. Especially when the total cost for a single pack of biscuit mix ended up being $6.78...ouch! Some may say "why not return it?" Honestly, then that would be putting the liability on me, now wouldn't it? It is the seller's responsibility to make sure their products are of quality; are what they describe; and are not out-of-date. I do not feel like going through the big long hassle of returning this product...so, just warning all of you to make sure you ask about the expiration dates before buying products of this nature.

review/summary: What a waste of money!
review/text: I should have read the reviews on these!  About half of the chews in the bag were the thickness of a pencil.  It took my dog no more than 2 minutes to chew through one of these.  These sticks are probably cheaper at Petco.  The only reason I ordered them was to bring my Amazon order over $25 so I could get free shipping.  What a waste of money!

review/text: Flossies are the all time favorite of my Aussie and Corgi, but Flossies are expensive. Bully sticks can be foul smelling and dirty. My dogs love these just as much and there's  no stink or mess in the house. I buy them when there's a 4 for price of 3 deal and stock up. If your dogs have been spoiled by Flossies, try these.These are made in USA.

The bag has a slight smell but I can't smell the individual bully sticks when she's chewing it or when she's done.  Would buy again.

review/summary: These are not bully sticks, nor do they last long
review/text: The other reviews are correct that say these "beefy sticks" aren't to be confused with "bully sticks".  While this Smokehouse product has similar pricing to bully sticks, they simply aren't bully sticks.  They aren't long lasting at all.  Because of the high price of these beefy sticks and they're more of a quickly consumed treat rather than a long lasting chew, I took 2 stars off the rating.<br /><br />My 30 lbs sheltie girl ate hers in less than 3 minutes and she's a lady-like eater, not a gulper.  But both shelties of mine do enjoy these beefy sticks greatly, so it gets 3 stars for what it is, a treat or a very quick chew.  I just won't buy them again.  True bully sticks are the way to go if you want something that will occupy your furry chewer's time.  A really thick bully (I buy the full 36" bully canes, otherwise known as "walking sticks") will take my kids nearly 2 hours of steady chewing to get a few inches off of it.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a quick chew that's rather expensive, these Smokehouse beefy sticks are just that.

review/text: I didn't realize these bones were so thin. I had assumed they were chew bones, but instead were actually a treat. If you are looking for something to occupy your dog for an hour, these aren't it. My 11 week old puppy chainsawed through one in no time. I really needed something to keep him chewing for a while, something that wasn't my couch or shoes. I'll keep looking...

review/summary: Tasty and attention-grabbing!
review/text: At least, I assume they're tasty, based on how our pup goes nuts about them. I haven't tried them myself, honestly. I mean, I like (nay, LOVE) jerky, but eating a pizzle stick is probably crossing a line, even for me.<br /><br />But for Margot? They're magic treats from heaven. We didn't want her chewing rawhide, because it can get caught in their throat or digestive tract, and these are a fantastic alternative. They've really helped in her pen training - she no longer whines like crazy when its time for quiet and she can't sit next to Mom and Dad. Now she gnaws on this and eventually falls asleep. We still watch her while she's eating them (she doesn't get them when we leave the house) because we're paranoid first-time parents like that, but they seem to be a lot safer than rawhide.<br /><br />The only real issue is how fast she goes through them - Amazon, you need to make these a Subscribe and Save option ASAP!

They are too expensive to be used as an every day 5 minute treat, but I do buy them occasionally now, and trying to find something else to replace them! She hates everything else!

review/summary: My puppy adores them!!
review/text: I am not sure of the dog size of the others who have reviewed.  I know many state their dog eats right through them and fast!  That is not the case for my 14 week, 10 lb Cocker Spaniel mix.  Bodhi loves them and they last days for him!  Days! They have been great to help with the constant puppy chewing.  Yes, when I found these I was look for "Bully Sticks."  These are lighter in weight.  But you know what.  I ran out the other day and went to the pet store to buy a couple bully sticks.  He hates them.  Hates!  He won't even chew on the bully sticks.  So I would say if you have a bigger dog like a lab these may not be for you.  But for smaller dogs they are perfect!  And they don't stink either!

Although my dogs love these just like the "other" brands, the width of these is barely pencil size and doesn't save me any $$. Very disappointing; I will be sticking with the "other" brand on Amazon. The are stickered MADE IN THE U.S.A, so I'm not sure what the review stating they were made in China is about?? Also, the package is labeled PIZZLE STIX, not Beefy Sticks.

After eating one had soft stool & the other full blown nastiness!  The dog that got it the worst has a delicate stomach & is on a low fat diet for this reason... I think they might be OK for dogs with tougher tummies.

She LOVES them and they are natural and good for her so I don't mind paying a little more than I would for some other treats.  She's picky and turns her nose up at a lot of biscuits and other treats. I like these treats for my dog, but they are just a treat, not a bone or "steer stick".

review/text: If you just really have to have an ESE machine and want good espresso you can't go wrong will illy.  But if you don't care about having a true espresso machine with a yucky portafilter that you have to keep clean then you should just go for the iPerespresso pods and machine instead.  I have compared these literally side-by-side and the complexity, intensity, and body of the iPerespresso shot just totally blows away the ESE shot, not to mention there is ZERO cleanup, but you are stuck with the pier pods, but who cares.  for 10 cents more a cup you get a truly perfect shot every single time of great illy espresso.
