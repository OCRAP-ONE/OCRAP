review/summary: Excellent taste!
review/text: The first time I used the Kinnikinnick Graham Style crumbs, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that they made an excellent pie crust that tasted just as good as regular graham cracker crumbs. I served the pie to members of my family and never told them that the crust was wheat-free. They loved it and couldn't tell the difference from a regular graham cracker crust. This is a great wheat and gluten-free alternative that I will use again and again.

review/summary: These Graham style crumbs have STYLE!
review/text: So last night I made a key lime pie with a graham cracker crust.  I served it to my non-gf significant other, and guess what? He had no idea it was gluten free.  And guess what else?  He ate the ENTIRE PIE!!!  The crust was delicious - perfect taste, perfect texture, in a word: perfect.  It's hard to find these on the store shelves where I live, and they appear to be out of stock frequently on Amazon...frustrating for a constantly-cooking woman like me. I'm picky about gluten free foods, and honestly there are other Kinnikinnick gf products I truly despise.  These, however, will become a staple on my shelf - the Graham Style Crumbs with STYLE!

I highly recommend these for any recipe that calls for it.

review/summary: Did not work for me
review/text: Full disclosure - I never tried using other crumbs, so maybe it is not about these ones in particular... But I used the whole box trying to figure out how to make it work, and it did not turn out fine a single time. I tried the recipe on the box, googled other approaches, used liquid/soft butter, prebaking/no prebaking but still the pie crust came out rock solid and did not get out of the pan. So it seems like it's easier to make the pie crust from scratch.

The only drawback, as far as I'm concerned, is the lack of flavored coffees to choose from.  Out of the 2 companies that make a vanilla flavor for the Tassimo, I prefer the Maxwell House because it has a richer vanilla flavor.

I have been obsessed with low and no calorie foods for almost a decade, so I'm pretty good at dealing with the taste of these types of foods. I made a beautiful spinach salad with mushrooms, tomatoes, and beets. Then I put this dressing on, and COULD NOT EAT MORE THAN ONE BITE. Extremely upset with this waste of money.

review/summary: BETTER than candy!
review/text: The Keen-Wah Decadence bar is CRAZY GOOD.  The first thought I had when biting into it was Rocky Road ice cream!--SUPER rich & chocolately, and you get this explosion of textures in your mouth of chunks of almond, and the crunchiness of chia seeds. The chocolate is just right, not too sweet, but sweeter than dark chocolate.  The best part is, THE INGREDIENTS ARE ALL ORGANIC, Gluten-Free, VEGAN, and Non-GMO.  I've been searching for some great vegan bars this past year, and would definitely say that this one, along with Vega's newest line of protein bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0UFQO">Vega Sport Protein Bar Single - Chocolate Coconut</a> (which I also reviewed) are the BEST tasting, and contain quality ingredients. Way better than candy....<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:<br /><br />-Almond butter, coconut nectar, Peruvian cacao powder, chopped almonds, cacao butter, Peruvian cacao nibs<br />-Chia seed, sprouted quinoa flour, brown rice protein powder, Himalayan sea salt<br />-Chocolate Coating: dark chocolate (evaporated can juice, cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, soya lecithin)<br /><br />**UPDATED - 7/21/12<br />SCORE!!!  For some reason, I decided to Google these, and found them on Walgreens.com! WAY BETTER DEAL than ordering on Amazon-- 2 for $5  OR $27.99 for the 12pk. + Free {everyday} shipping $25 or more. Apparently they're sold in-store & online, but none of the stores near my house carried them.

review/summary: Excellent for Healthy Candy Bar Substitute
review/text: This bar is amazingly good, and has a lot going for it in terms of being a healthy treat. The best thing is that is that it doesn't taste "healthy." It tastes like a treat. Compared to a chocolate bar of a similar size it has lower total fat, lower saturated fat, lower sugar conntent, and about the same number of calories. And it has 4 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein. If only it didn't have evaporated cane sugar in the dark chocolate coating it would be perfect! These bars are expensive, but I think they're worth it!

review/summary: Best Vegan Bar!
review/text: The Chia bar may just be the best vegan bar I have ever eaten! Firstly, I was thoroughly impressed with the texture: The combination of Almond Butter and Coconut Nectar as the first 2 ingredients, is heavenly.  At 195 Calories per bar, it isn't wimpy.  A healthy dose of good fat, great Carbs and a respectable 6 grams of protein are on offer here.  But nutrition aside, what matters the most is taste.  No matter how healthy or unhealthy a bar is, it must taste good.  This bar is so yummy! It is like a healthy candy bar, but not in a traditional way.  Most 'healthy' bars try to be like candy bars, but fail miserably.  As a solid, good for you bar, this one hits the mark! Now, I need to order more before I run out.  By the way, I don't work for the company, etc...

review/summary: A diabetic's dream!
review/text: I've been using xylitol for a few years now.  It has many health benefits and dental uses, do a web search for yourself and see how great this stuff is!  It's an excellent sugar alternative for those of us with diabetes.  We can indulge our sweet tooth without the negative consequences.  Until recently I didn't know that so much of the xylitol on the market was made in China from corn that is likely genetically modified.  Sorry, I'm not about to put those mystery granules in my body.  This product by Health Garden is made in the USA from birch.  Sure, you're going to pay more for this than you will for the other stuff, but at least you know what you're getting.  This sweetener tastes identical to sugar, though the granules are a bit larger (not a problem, just an observation).  You can use it exactly like you would use sugar, but be warned, xylitol is dangerous for pets, so if your furry companions have a sweet tooth, don't give them anything made with xylitol!  Also, too much xylitol will loosen your bowels.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol and your body does not process it like it does ordinary sugar.  My only question is, why did the price go up $15 in a week?  The 10 lb. bag was $39.99 when I ordered it last week, now it's $54.99.  That's quite a jump.  I'm glad I ordered it when I did.

I hope that HEALTH GARDEN accepts my heartfelt apology for the initial 'bad review.'<br /><br />I went on a 'rant' because of the message I received from the HEALTH GARDEN website concerning an order I placed with Health Garden for their 'Kosher Birch Xylitol' at which time I noticed a "CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.<br />WE DON'T KNOW WHEN OR IF THIS ITEM WILL BE BACK IN STOCK" message. (Please see all that ranting below.)<br /><br />I guess I DID NOT check my email closely enough to 'see' that my order of 30 lbs. of Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol had already sent me a 'shipping' order that my order was placed and would arrive on Oct 2nd or 3rd which it did!<br /><br /> I did not 'notice' until AFTER, I posted this 'rant.' My bad, because that shipment arrived the day after I wrote the following 'bad review' again, please see my initial 'rant', again.<br /><br />Although I have yet to try Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol but am excited to get started because after researching a gazillion Xylitol products, Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol got the best reviews on every 'review' site I researched.

review/text: Although bearing only a fairly marginal resemblance to the sweet traditionally known as Turkish delight, these are pretty good. The inside is a semi-reasonable facsimile of traditional Turkish delight (although far softer and less chewey in texture) which is then coated in a very think outer layer of milk chocolate.<br /><br />As chocolate bars go... uh... well, they're low-fat, I suppose! I think the innards are pure gelatin and sugar.<br /><br />Do be aware that these come in a variety of packs containing different numbers of bars. At least as of the time of writing, these do not all work out at the same cost on a per bar basis. So it may well be worth your while doing your homework before deciding which deal is right for you.<br /><br />Enjoy in Moderation!<br /><br />Theo.

You will definitely not be disappointed. This company has excellent customer service to deal with and the items always arrive ahead of schedule.

I have to say that this company is far better priced than any I looked at for the quantity and price...at least this size was. Yes, You will wait longer than you think you should because this comes directly out of India via their slow-ass parcel post. I had forgotten about it when it came, and was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. Packaging kind of sucked, but held together with no leaks of any peppercorns.  And the product is what it says it is...the Premium Tellicherry Peppercorns that is desired by most pepper lovers...so go for it...then forget about it. If you really forget..then you'll eventually be surprised to get the package when it comes.<br />If you don't forget about it you're setting yourself up for a frustrating wait...so just order, have faith, and eventually it'll be on your dinner table when you least expect it. And you'll notice the flavor difference the first time you use it if you've never had this premium pepper before...

review/text: These were packed in a very thin plasic-y bag, with no insulation between inner and outer packaging. The package arrived smashed with peppercorns leaking out. I am using them, but I hope there was no contamination anywhere along the line.

review/text: The title of my review really says it all. These are delicious. I blended them with some white, green, pink, and szechuan peppercorns in my grinder for more of a zesty, peppery taste. All the other peppercorns I purchased came from the same company. I'm still enjoying them, I'm sure you will too!<br /><br />Good Luck!

review/summary: A real Gold - Gold not Yellow!
review/text: This Wilton pearlized gold sugar looks like very pretty real gold. I was a little worried that in person this sugar would look like a yellow, mustardy gold.  It doesn't.  I used it to sprinkle on whipped cream so the color was important to me.  I also used it to rim some champagne glasses before adding Champagne, St. Germaine, A touch of ginger-ale and a smidge of fresh lemon juice.  The drink was of course delicious on it's own, but the gold sugar really took it to another level and made it beautiful and a topic of conversation. Surprisingly, a little goes a long way, so while this was a little expensive with the shipping cost, I'll find many uses for it.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free option, portable and tasty
review/text: One of the difficult parts of dealing with Celiac disease is finding foods to safely eat while on the road.  In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully.  By bringing our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick.  While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is!  If it really is GF and free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick.  This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.<br /><br />This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is about the right size to put on a Subway or Wendy's salad if you prefer your own dressing.  My wife takes this in her lunches too.  If you don't need the packets, you can save some money by buying a larger bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you.  You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.<br /><br />In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:<br />Italian Salad Dressing<br />Ranch Salad Dressing<br />Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing<br /><br />As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is the best Italian dressing we have found.  It has the traditional Italian dressing glavor and a good consistency.  If you don't mind calories, and sugar, a great GF Italian Dressing is from Kens Steak House.  I like using the Kens Italian when marinating (since its good tasting and less cost) and then the Walden Farms for salads since it has less calories.<br /><br />It's amazing that these Walden Farms dressings can taste as good as they do with no calories, no sugar, no gluten, and even no fat!  Not all of the dressings taste great, but this flavor is really good.<br /><br />4 stars as one of my wife's favorite dressings.  Not 5 simply because of the much higher price per serving of the packets.<br />________________________________________

I am a bloody mary enthusiast and on several occasions had gourmet bloody mary's served with bacon crumbles, which I have come to like.<br />Prior to purchasing, I negelected to read the ingredients label... had I realized this product contains MSG, disguised as Autolyzed Yeast Extract, I would have never made the purchase.<br />Since I already had it, I went ahead and decided to at least give it a try.... big mistake! It tastes horrible... nothing like bacon, at all. More like meat tenderizer and cajun seasoning.<br /><br />I highly recommend all of the other Demitris products, this one however, you should leave on the shelf.

review/summary: High-impact berry flavor
review/text: I love all varieties Dorset Cereals, which are quite simply the best mueslis I have ever eaten. This mix is no exception. What sets this variety apart is the cranberries, which give the cereal a strong tangy overtone. The cherries and cranberries are relatively small in the ingredient mix but are big on the overall flavor.<br /><br />With 50% total fruits, nuts and seeds, this is a dense, high-flavor muesli with no added sugars. It is not my favorite variety among Dorset Cereals, since I generally prefer nutty mueslis to highly fruity ones. I actually prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269FEIG">Simply Delicious</a> variety, which has just 30% fruits, nuts and seeds and a more earthy flavor. But all varieties of Dorset Cereals have a spot on my shopping list, and this one makes for a welcome change of pace.<br /><br />Highly recommended! You can't go wrong with a Dorset Cereals products, and if you prefer a strongly fruity muesli, you will absolutely love this one.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, crunchy breakfast cereal. A fave
review/text: We regularly have different Dorset Cereals for breakfast and can thoroughly recommend the brand. They make really top-quality muesli and cereals which achieve the difficult trick of being tasty and nutritious. The levels of added sugars and salt are kept to a minimum; Dorset Cereals tend to get their flavour by including high proportions of fruit, nuts and seeds.<br />(A word of caution, however! This does mean that they contain a reasonable level of fats and sugars, but in natural forms rather than processed artificial types. So the calorie count can be quite high, if you are watching your weight BUT this is offset by the low glycaemic impact of the food. Dorset Cereals tend to take quite a while to digest, can be very filling, and leave you feeling satisfied for a long time. You just need to watch the portion size...)<br />This variety is a really tasty one; I adore the more fruity flavours and you can really taste the cranberries and cherries even though there's only a small amount of them in the recipe. The flame raisins are in a lot of Dorset Cereals and add to the overall chewyness and the different types of flakes mean that each spoonful is interestingly varied.<br />This cereal is around 7% fiber, 10% protein and 63% carbohydrate overall. It's naturally quite juicy - unlike some mueslis which can be really dry and dusty - and the fruit makes it very tasty, so you don't get bored by the end of the box.<br />One of our favourite flavours.<br />9/10

If you prefer a milder ginger flavor SinA may be too strong for your liking.<br /><br />I find the 2 ounce box to be a convinient size to carry with me.  The pieces are individually wrapped in foil and dusted in tapioca to reduce the stickness.  Each piece weighs about 6 grams with about 3 grams sugar and 3 grams fiber.  Each box holds about 9 pieces.  There are no peanuts in the ingredients, but SinA is produced in an Indonesian facility that uses peanuts.

review/text: this is the rice i've eaten since a child, with every dinner, every holiday; unless we were at a restaurant, we at this, and only this, brand of rice.  my parents moved to NW Florida, where this isn't available. it shipped quickly, and my parents (my dad especially) is thrilled to enjoy this style of rice again...sticky like sushi rice, softer than jasmine rice, and goes with everything you'd use mashed potatoes for (Boton rice and gravy is the BEST!!!!). now i'm 31, partnered, and my partner hasn't eaten mashed potatoes in years, and makes rice before even figuring out what to make for dinner. just like i did, growing up. LOL  5 stars!!

review/summary: Yummy on everything...
review/text: I was unsure of this product until I tasted it at a open house.  It was so good, I was glad I had tried it.  Taking some home, I found it great on crackers, but also with tuna/albacore (it's better than just plain onions), it's good with eggs & meat etc.  It also, makes a great house warming gift. This is one item that you'll say "How could I have ever lived without it!"

review/summary: This soup is great in SOOO many ways!
review/text: This soup is absolutely great! It is fat-free and low in calories (only 180 for the whole can) yet fills you up.  Talk about an efficient way to get your vegetables!  I love the taste although I confess to adding bacon bits and dried onions with a little hot ketchup to spice it up.  So efficient as well.  Two 1/2 minutes in the microwave and you've got a nutritous snack.

review/text: I stocked up with a case of this when I was in Thailand.  No time to be overly picky but I am very happy with the flavors this adds to thai-style dishes.  Adding in some scallions (finely sliced) and strips of sliced tofu is good stuff.  Mixing in some finely chopped cauliflower and stir frying the beef about half-done prior to adding in the seasoning and water gets some powerful results.<br /><br />Wrap in whole lettuce leaves for a nice treat that only has about 350 calories and 7 total carbs.

review/summary: OOOooooo!
review/text: So far, this syrup has been absolutely amazing. We've received several flavors and have enjoyed each one immensely. We have an embarrassingly large collection of their product.<br /><br />There is no way to explain how good this is, it has a depth of flavor that is impressive.<br /><br />Yes, this sounds like a paid advertisement...but it really is that good!<br /><br />We have the holiday collection, dark chocolate, French vanilla, and the Tiramisu syrup.<br /><br />I'll condense this review to cover all their products since they are ALL top notch.<br /><br />Holiday Collection:<br />(Chai, Cinnamon, Eggnog, Nutmeg, Gingerbread, Pumpkin Spice)<br /><br />The cinnamon is so powerful, you can smell it before the packaging is opened! I think it will make an excellent accent to a cup of coffee, but the flavor is so powerful it might not be a good single flavor with strong coffee. We use Sumatra Mandheling coffee we also bought here that is excellent.<br /><br /> ** Coffee Bean Direct Sumatra Mandheling, Whole Bean Coffee, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)<br /><br />The Chai is complex, I don't know if we will use it.<br /><br />Eggnog is very yummy, but we haven't used it yet. I will be working on a recipe to use this. Since our use is mainly as coffee flavoring, it might be less useful than some others. My current evil plan is to make a diabetic friendly eggnog for Christmas season using it, I may post a recipe if I succeed.<br /><br />Nutmeg is a strong flavor no matter what form. Again, it may be an ingredient instead of a main flavor.<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice is excellent, I combined it with chocolate syrup before we got the Amoretti dark chocolate syrup. Odd combination, but everyone loved it.<br /><br />Tiramisu is amazing. A single drop tastes like a whole slice of the dessert. I had some and then drank some water to see what the flavor did. It didn't dilute like sugar syrup does, it simply changed subtly into a more complex flavor. My husband tried it in his coffee and it blended beautifully, but didn't stand out as a flavor so he wasn't kicked on it as a coffee additive.<br /><br />When he isn't drinking the flavoring straight from the bottle and making contented noises, it is a real adventure to play with in coffee.<br /><br />We will be back, regardless of conspicuous consumerism, for some other flavors I want to experiment with. My husband and I may find some blood in our caffeine level by the time I'm done...but there will be some new recipes resulting from my painstaking research. As well as four German Shepherds with corn rows and the spice rack alphabetized. Can you end up duplicating bio-luminescence from too much caffeine?

review/text: So I had a coupon for Torani syrup and ran to the store to get some. I made my own latte and added the Torani vanilla expecting to replicate my usual drink from a local Starbucks. Um..it tasted bland and like I added sugar at best. Luckily I had ordered this syrup and when it came I was happy to give it a try. I was very excited to see it COMES WITH A PUMP and the vanilla FLAVOR IS AUTHENTIC AND RICH and very very tasty. I only use about half a pump and my drink has great, strong vanilla flavor.

review/summary: OK, but not the best
review/text: This is OK for a quick lunch.  It is one of those products that you can keep in a desk drawer if you have a microwave in your break room.  It is not my favorite.  It comes with everything premixed, so you cannot adjust the amount of teriyaki sauce.  The plastic film top was a little difficult to peel off which is not good with a hot meal.  It does leave a spicy aftertaste.  It is listed as having 13 grams of protein but is a little low on fiber with only 2 grams.  It is high on sodium with 930 mg.  It is listed as 270 calories.  It has a shelf life (expiration date) shown.

review/summary: Not Bad @ All
review/text: This product isn't that bad. So far its the only dish from this series from Hormel that I have tried and its pretty good. For my taste it is a little sweet and like another reviewer remarked there is more sauce then needed so adding more rice is not a bad idea. Maybe adding some mixed vegies would be good too. As I tried this for office use that wasn't an option for me. Still, this is not a bad product and the flavor was good and since it does not need refrigeration this is a great product for office, on the road or any other situation where a refrigerator is not an option. I can grab this product, throw it in my backpack and go on with my day.<br /><br />Portion size? Well for me its not bad. Sure, I have days where I could certainly use more but that's why packing an apple, crackers or other snack/side item is a good idea.<br /><br />[My office does have a refrigerator but I work in an office where things sometimes disappear but most of the time its full of who knows what.]

review/summary: Surprised; good teriyaki flavor for this kind of product
review/text: Well I was quite surprised by this.  I gave it a try but really expected it to be inedible.  Actually, considering what it is, it's not bad.  What surprised me the most was that the teriyaki sauce wasn't just the typical overly salty soy sauce that so often passes as "teriyaki sauce" anymore.  This product's sauce isn't overly salty and it captures that subtle citrus flavor that real teriyaki is supposed to have.<br /><br />I've only eaten two of these so far, and each one was rather different in what ingredients were in the mix.  The first one contained quite a lot of crispy nice baby corn chunks, and a fair amount of chicken.  The second one was lacking in pretty much everything but rice; it had about four chunks of chicken in it, and one chunk of baby corn.  Each time, I doctored it anyway (first time with extra chicken, second time with pineapple chunks).  The product is saucy, but not too runny.  The chicken  chunks were reasonably bite-sized and the texture wasn't rubbery or mushy.<br /><br />I view this product as an instant teriyaki rice which I can cook in 1 minute in my microwave and add whatever I happen to have or feel like to it.  I think I will buy the product again for this convenience.

The teriyaki is nicely sweet and savory. The chicken does have a slightly odd texture, almost tofu-like, but still tastes good. I particularly like the chunks of baby corn, which somehow manage to retain their crunch.

review/text: Hormel has came up with another shelf stable product. Of course to make it last over a year on the shelf it has to have lots of preservitive ingredients. I sampled one and found they are very salty and tastless. I bought these thinking they would sell in my little store (I sell mostly to senior citizens) being convienant for Senior Citizens to prepare a quick dinner. I was wrong. They are still on the shelf, and I will probably wind up trying to get rid of them at a loss or give away.

If you are using this to color royal icing, once the color dries it is several shades darker than it was when first mixed! Don't add too much red or you'll end up with a dark, bloody color when dried. (If that's what you're going for, though, then have at it!) :)

review/text: I purchase these small treat balls as a quick reward for a good girl treat.  They are small and easy to carry in a pocket.  I use them mostly as a reward when out walking with Misty.  I have a small dog so these are just the right size for us.
