review/summary: Bonsai
review/text: The product came well packaged, and because of Amazon Prime in less than 24 hours.  I would recommend this to anyone thinking of getting a plant such as this.  The pot is a dark terracotta brown with the proper drainage holes.  Not the best looking pot, but good enough that I won't try to replace it in the near future.  It's sitting at the window sill of my office, hopefully it will be able to get enough light.  I contacted a local bonsai shop who said that it should do well as I'm in a Eastern facing office and get plenty of direct light in the morning, and decent light during the remainder of the day.  No leaves have fallen off, however from what I understand I can expect them to, as bonsai's are fickle and usually don't do well during the shipping process.  Hopefully I don't kill it.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: When the tree arrived the leaves were green with a brownish tint, however, I figured since it came in a box that it just needed some light and water. Unfortunately, less than two weeks later the plant is dead and Amazon will not give a refund or provide a replacement since they say the provide no guarantees. Extremely disappointed.

review/summary: Beautiful, Awesome, Buy it!  You won't regret it!
review/text: I ordered this Brussel's Golden Gate Ficus Bonsai after much research since this is my first Bonsai.  Ficus is suppose to be one of the easiest to care for and good for beginners, and it is most suited for indoors which is where I wanted mine. I was so impressed I just had to review in case anyone else out there needs help deciding on a Bonzai.  Here is my experience... I ordered this plant on Monday, the day after Christmas (a present to myself? hehe)  The earliest ETA given was January 4th. It arrived on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2 days later, in a big box marked live plant!  I opened the box and it was filled to the top with packing popcorn.  I carefully scooped the popcorn out until I saw little green leaves poking through.  Once I removed about half the popcorn, I carefully opened up the bottom of the box and slid the box up over the plant.  It's planter was securely packed in card board and tape.  The planter is nice and shiny ceramic like in the picture.  The plant was moist and has fine moss growing in on top of the soil.  The plant itself is absolutely BEAUTIFUL.  Full, green leaves, which it only lost one leaf while unpacking it.  It's trunk is lovely and thick and curved, and it has just two very slight wire scars, but not real noticeable.  It is in very good health and about 15" tall including the pot.  It came with some basic instructions on how to water and how much light, and it said that it could loose up to 20% of it's leaves while adjusting to it's new environment and not to worry if it does, it will make a come back once it adjusts.  It has not lost any more leaves since that first one in the one week that I have had it. This tree makes me feel warm every time I look at it and I am going to try to keep it happy and healthy for years to come.

review/text: I ordered one of these bonsai trees for a family member. It shipped in 2 days, and arrived in perfect health! Not one leaf was lost in transit. The soil was still moist when it arrived, but I watered it anyway and placed it in a sunny window. There were some marks on the tree from previous wiring, but it's not enough to make me want to return it.<br /><br />In any case, I would definitely recommend this tree and company to others. This tree makes an excellent gift, especially because it's a great size, reasonably priced, and ships very well.

review/summary: Safe Arrival, and Tree Looks Like Photo
review/text: 1. My Golden Gate Ficus bonsai tree from Brussel's arrived safely despite the ahipping box showing signs of rough handing in transit; The packing was that good!<br />2. Delivery was in in a fast two days from time of order!<br />I am happy to say that my tree looks much like the online photo; That is  not always true when ordering something as unique as a living plant; you do receive the correct species, but the styling is often different than expected. Since these Golden Gate Ficus "are each hand wired by the Chinese"",I am guessing that most of them look much like the online photograph.<br />4. I recommend ordering Brussel's bpnsai through amazon.com.

review/summary: Bonsai Tree seems almost dead
review/text: When I got the tree in the mail half the leaves were already brown and crispy. I hoped that with water and sunlight I could nurse it back to health but it has now been almost a week and the leaves are almost all dead. I keep it watered and in sunlight but it seems to only be dying completely rather than coming back to full-health. I want to contact the seller but I can't find any information of how to do so. Does anyone have any tips for my bonsai or of how to get a hold of the seller? This would be greatly appreciated. I love the shape of the bonsai and it is so fun to have I just wish it would stay healthy! Let me know if anyone has any suggestions or information for me, thanks!

review/text: As others have said, I was leery to buy a plant online, especially in the dead of winter in IN.  And, although mine did not come with any peanuts in the box, it was still packed well.  The tree was very cold but was obviously not frozen as it is doing quite well after a week.  I was really impressed by the overall shape of the tree...even better than the one pictured.  I am probably nuts but I just ordered a Kingsville Boxwood tree from the same vendor, even as a new winter snow storm is coming throught IN.  I hope I'm not tempting fate!!

review/summary: One week later and it is still alive!
review/text: I was thinking how empty my room was so I decided to liven it up by getting a Bonsai Tree. I read that Ficus is the best and most durable indoor bonsai tree so I bought one from Amazon.<br /><br />It came in a box filled with styrofoam packing peanuts. The tree arrived with most leaves green, and the soil and pot covered with plastic. The tree was held to the pot so I only needed to pull the tree (by the trunk) out of the cardboard box.<br /><br />The only problem I have so far is pest living in the soil. What I do is fill a container with water and dish washing soap. When the tree needs watering, I dip the pot in the container. (Besides killing the pest, I read somewhere that the dishwashing soap helps the root absorb water. And, It doesn't hurt the tree.)<br /><br />Low maintenance tree and pleasant to look at and have around.

Will definitely order from this vendor again.

review/text: I was very disappointed when this ficus arrived.  Many leaves had dropped off but the worst part was that there were so many leaves which were blackened with some sort of insect infestation in the plant.  Rather than going through the trouble of repackaging it and delivering it to be sent back... I placed it in new soil, spread powered insecticide in it and put it in a larger pot and will hope for the best.  I was very surprised that this plant was delivered in this condition.  I ordered this because of the many positive reviews even though there were some also complaining about the problem I mentioned.

review/summary: I love my little tree, BUT....
review/text: This is my very first Bonsai tree and I was thrilled when this beautiful little tree arrived after only 3 days. However the longer I look at it the more unhappy I am that it came like it did. I'm going to be brutally honest here. The packing on this tree was exceptional, I don't think it could have been any better. The soil and pot were wrapped and the soil still damp. Not one leaf had dropped and there was new growth that must have happened in the shipping box. The tree was nestled safely in packing peanuts and looked wonderful. That's the good part. Saddly this review can not end there. The pot was cracked clear thru. I contacted seller telling them that this must have been sent like that, as I could see no way it could have been damaged in shipping due to packing bening done so very well. I was offered 3 options to chose from. Exchange, at no extra cost (return my lovely little tree? nope, no way), full refund (again, return this tree that I love the look of, again, NO) or a partial refund that would barely cover half of the shipping of a new pot IF I could find one like the one it came with, that adds to the wonderful over all look of the plant. Needless to say, I still have my tree. Today I was looking it over to see how I might like to see it look in say a couple of years. I was very unhappy to find a deep groove all the way around the main trunk, slightly over 1/3 the way up. I found another just above the second bend in the trunk. I thought it bad that this little tree had such bad wire scars on it. But as I looked closer I saw that BOTH of these "scars" had enbedded RUSTED wire in them. If it had not been noticed this could and most likely would have killed this lovely little tree. I thought these were "trained" by knowlegeable people. The add states "Grown in Chinese nurseries under carefully controlled conditions"  Don't they know that you don't use wire that will rust to wire a Bonsai tree? Shame on them.

review/text: The little "tree" certainly looked healthy; yet the "trunk" was really weird - a bulbous "v" shape coming up to a top that had no branches, just a puff of stems with leaves.  Had it not had a confined root system in a small pot with a wire it had grown around, I would have sworn someone had just chopped off a bush, let it sprout back and then dug up the plant and called it a bonsai.  I took it to work to make sure it wasn't just me.  Everyone agreed it was weird and ugly.

review/summary: totally tasteless
review/text: Actually, I bought this to kill ants based on my google results for natural ant poison.  The ants ate it with no ill effects of course.  It's cheap and it does cook up fast but it has no flavor or substance to it.  You can add all the seasoning you like but there is still no corn flavor behind it.<br /><br />Maybe this is normal for refined, instant corn products but the Arrowhead Mills organic whole grain cornmeal is absolutely delicious.

review/summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

review/summary: Loyal Earths Best Customer
review/text: I absolutely love Earths Best foods. They have the largest variety of organic foods at the best prices. The 'gourmet' flavors are slightly more expensive at my grocery store, so I thought I would give Amazon a try. The order was perfect. My son (8 months) absolutely loves the gourmet flavors.  I also like the consistency of these flavors. It is 'mid-range': not too watery (like Earths Best Chicken & Rice flavor) but not too thick.

review/summary: Love the product but cheaper at BRU
review/text: I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!

review/summary: Favorite baby food set!
review/text: So far this has been my favorite baby food to serve my 10 month old.  We do a lot of homemade baby food, but being a busy mom of 2 I also buy a lot of jars now.  Will only do organic brands, and really like Earths Best brand because of their good combos and I like that they come in a glass jar.  I really like the gourmet meals pack, my baby liked all of the ones in this pack right from the start, even though he didn't love some of the plainer vegetable or meat dinners.  So I've been willing to pay slightly more to get the gourmet meals set.  Good way to get good protein sources into babies too.

review/text: My son has yet to refuse anything made by Earth's Best. Granted, he eats all his food but these are interesting combinations. The ingredients are simple--veggie, water, meat. Some absorbic acid. I highly recommend the product.<br /><br />I do not, however, recommend buying it here. The "regular" price that is crossed out is absolutely absurd. I have not seen this product over $10 in any store. Perhaps that's the price in NYC.

Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good.

review/text: My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These "gourmet" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!

review/text: I just received a box of these and almost half of them were either frozen and thawed, or packaged wrong. They weren't a creamy consistency at all, but chunky and watery. I have used Earth's Best for quite a while and never had any like this. We did just have a snow storm and it might have come through some icy conditions, but I had to throw half of them out. The other half looked fine. All the lids popped open, so the seals were fine. I have no idea what was wrong, but I won't be ordering these again.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Purchased for my 6-month-old & as you know babies tend to fluctuate in their interest for what they're eating. My baby enjoys this gourmet food however he does not like the Tender Beef Spinach . . . no matter what I've tried in changing the flavor (such as adding a fruit as a side dish), he still won't eat it. It's strange because he loves spinach, go figure. I've tasted all 4 flavors & they taste great to me. I rated 4-stars for this product only because my baby did not like nor would he eat the Tender Beef Spinach (even though I enjoyed the taste).

Our 10-month-old particularly enjoys the Sweet Pea Turkey Wild Rice and Tender Beef Spinach varieties.  It can be difficult to find baby food with iron-rich beef that our baby actually likes, so we're happy with this one.

review/summary: Am shocked at the contents!
review/text: I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating "Earths Best Organic"!

review/summary: improper seal = botulism risk!
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).

review/summary: I'm not impressed
review/text: I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews.<br /><br />From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more.  This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.  You can currently get two bottles of this exact product on eBay for $12.

review/summary: Good balsamic for a good price
review/text: We love balsmic and use it more than any other vinegar but the stuff called balsamic we find in our grocery stores is dreadful. For years I bought balsamic from Wms. Sonoma but they had it on back-order the last time I needed it so I ordered the Lucini from Amazon which came promptly.  The Lucini is yummy and the price is right.  It's an exaggeration to say I use it every day, but only a small exaggeration.  This is the one we'll use regularly from now on.

review/text: OK, this isn't the Balsamic Vinegar, aged 25 years, costing hundreds of dollars, that you can put on ice cream. However, it won a taste test at America's Test Kitchens among 10 year old balsamic vinegars, and it is REALLY GOOD!!! I made the salad dressing for Easter dinner from it, and it was extremely well received, even with our fussy group. (One family member had just been to Italy and had tried the 25 year old variety there. She said this was surprisingly good.)<br /><br />I will definitely buy it again.

review/text: Lucini Grand Riserva Balsamico is not real balsamic at all.  There is no ingredient list on the label, which makes it suspect immediately. It is far too acidic, and tastes like any cheap vinegar in salad dressing.  This is the worst 'cheap' imitation balsamic I have ever tried.  The four dollar Trader Joe's 'balsamic' is better than this.  At least they have the honesty to put the ingredients on the label.

review/summary: great product, but ....
review/text: This is my favorite balsamic vinegar. I read about this brand in cooks illustrated in their comparison, so I decided to check it out. I finally found somewhere I could buy it so myself and my roommate did a taste test with the 3 or 4 balsamic vinegars we had around the house. Well this one was head and shoulders above the others we had and in fact made some of them seem terrible by comparison.<br /><br />Now for the bad part, for such a great product the container is awful. If you can manage to use this without having it leak out around the cap and get all over your table and cabinets you are a better man than I. Yes, my only gripe about this product is the style cap they use on it.<br /><br />I swear I would give this product 5 stars if it did not make such a mess everywhere I use it. Maybe the company owners will read this and fix this minor problem. I guess they want the metal cap to convey some sense of style or prestige, but from my point of view it sucks.

review/summary: An excellent oyster sauce
review/text: Having tried many different brands over the years, I can safely say that Amoy Oyster sauce is one of the best oyster sauces on the market. It is manufactured in Hong Kong and is better-tasting than competing brands like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAX46I">Panda Oyster Sauce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU58">Lee Kum Kee</a>.<br /><br />Oyster sauce is a very versatile condiment that you'll find in many Chinese kitchens. It is the not-so-secret ingredient in many Cantonese/HK-styled stir-fry dishes. If you've never had oyster sauce, try this one first. Though it's called oyster sauce and contains oyster extracts, it doesn't really taste like oysters. It's got a flavor all its own. This brand is more liquidy than others and pours easily out of the bottle.<br /><br />It is perfect over steamed vegetables, as a marinade for meat or a dip for boiled chicken, fish, and white meats. For grilling, you can marinate some pork chops or chicken wings overnight. For beef, I usually mix some oyster sauce with corn starch and a little rice wine, then stir-fry with julienned ginger and vegetables like snow peas, carrots, and mushrooms. Another dish I like to make using oyster sauce as a flavoring agent is steamed chicken breast (cut into bite-sized pieces) and dried shiitake mushrooms. In a pinch, you can even pour some over plain rice and eat.<br /><br />Amoy also makes outstanding soy sauce.

I am a type-2 diabetic who loves pasta but I can't eat regular pasta without my blood sugar going sky high.  However, with this pasta I can have a large serving and my blood sugar stays much lower.  The taste is great, it is the same as regular pasta and it also is a pre-biotic which is good for the digestive tract.  I just ordered a 12-pack because it is the only pasta I will be eating from this point forward.  I highly recommend this product to diabetics and non-diabetics alike.

My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

The chopped stuff at your everyday grocery store is good for a little salty proscuitto like flavor in dishes but not for slices just to enjoy.<br /><br />I understand why people think Jamon is awesome, but the melting in your mouth with extreme grease/fat over your lips and fingers really sets home the fat content more than that Kobe Beef flavor burst and easier swallow.<br /><br />In the high end Jamon, you can really taste the acorns in the meat.  The nuttiness really comes through and it is very good.  The Iberico Paleta -> you don't get the nuttiness and it's a little tougher.  The Serrano really has much more meat and I preferred the flavor profile on it more than the other two.<br /><br />While I would rate the Iberico Bellato around 4 out of 5 stars (minus 1 for the heavy greasy feeling and fat), the price is ridiculous.  I would say it would be appropriately priced around $15-25/pound.  Given that is 4-6x lower than it's actual price, I had to take at least 2 stars from the product.<br /><br />You're better off with the SM Proscuitto.  It's delicious and you get 4x the amount without the heavy grease.

review/text: Just add some rum, blend it together, and you will have the best drink ever for those really hot days. I bought 3 bottles for a party I was having and it didn't come for a week later. Give yourself more time for shipping. They say 4 or 5 days don't buy that like I did..Big Train Pineapple Coconut Smoothie Is the BEST Drink you can make from home. Enjoy !!!!!!!
