review/summary: Doesn't mix easily with water
review/text: I hate drinking plain water so I've been using liquid stevia to give it some flavor.  My first experiment in using stevia as a flavoring agent was the Sweetleaf brand in the lemon version. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AG7X6C">Liquid Stevia by SweetLeaf - LEMON-DROP</a> It was more expensive and a little bitter so I tried this NOW brand.<br /><br />The NOW Stevia Extract Liquid in the Lemon Twist flavor doesn't mix as well in water.  It's thicker and I think this is due to the fact it contains vegetable glycerin as the first ingredient.  It's messier when adding drops to my water jug; when I stick the dropper back into the bottle it runs down the side if I'm not careful.<br /><br />The NOW Lemon Twist isn't as bitter as the Sweetleaf brand but that's the only positive I can say when comparing the two.  The Sweetleaf brand interspersed into the water and didn't settle on the bottom of the glass like this NOW brand did.  As I finished my glass of water, all the lemon flavor and alcohol (12%) was on the bottom and it didn't taste so great.<br /><br />So the NOW brand may be ok if you are using it in yogurt or something not liquid-y, but I can't recommend putting this in water.  I tried shaking up a jug of water sweetened with the NOW brand and it eventually settled on the bottom of the jug also.<br /><br />The NOW stevia is organic and vegetarian/vegan, but that doesn't matter to me, but it may to you.  I also didn't see any reference to this being low glycemic like the Sweetleaf is.  But it does contain no sugar, so maybe it's still low glycemic, but not stated that way.<br /><br />It also takes more drops to flavor the same amount of water, so in the end this isn't at all cost-effective compared to the Sweetleaf brand - I'm going back to Sweetleaf after this bottle is finished.

review/summary: Not just a side -- Add stuff for a quick main dish!
review/text: While I still serve Near East rice pilafs as a side dish, I now fix them for a quick and healthy weeknight meal! For most of them, I cook as directed in my small rice cooker (Cuisinart CRC-400 4-Cup Rice Cooker). Five minutes after I hear the water starting its boil, I add a cup of cut-up cooked protein (leftover chicken, turkey, chickpeas, beans, whatever) and a cup or so of chopped veggies (fresh broccoli, carrots, onions, frozen peas). When the rice cooker light tells me the rice is done, so is everything else! (If you use a long-cooking whole grain pilaf, you will want to add these ingredients later in the rice-cooking cycle to avoid over cooking.) I guess you could also mix the meat and veggies in after cooking them separately, if you prefer. This is enough to serve three adults (unless they are really, really hungry.)<br /><br />You can find recipes at the Near East website for other ideas.

review/summary: Amazingly salty (in a bad way)
review/text: I bought this salmon, attracted by the "Skinless & Boneless" label (I usually buy the alaskan salmon from Crown Prince).<br />Let's just say that this was a huge mistake. This salmon has 630 mg of sodium per can, and while that doesn't sound like much, the salmon is amazingly salty. If you intend to use it in your cooking, perhaps this would be alright, however, it is impossible to eat as is. This salmon also smells less like salmon, and more like some other kind of fish (which really does not appeal to me much - if I wanted some other fish, I would have gotten it).<br />Basically, right now I'm stuck with 11 cans of salmon that I really have no use for (the first can that I opened made it quite clear that it's the last can I would open). Unfortunately, I don't have a cat. Will look for a food drive to donate this expensive disaster.

I have arthritis and fish oil is recommended and seems to help. I have, however, been concerned about contaminants in fish and read somewhere a couple of years ago that Pacific salmon had less contaminants.  I couldn't find it readily available in stores and when I did it was very expensive.  I bought my first can of the Skinless and Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon in a store and loved the taste but did not like the price.  Looked for it on Amazon, found it, and now buy a pack every month on a standing order.  I highly recommend the salmon and purchasing it through Amazon.

A few drops from a fresh bottle will completely overwhelm any other flavors and sensations.

The vapors will blind and choke you.}<br />You can add a splash of it to any large pot of soup or stew, of any ethnicity, that "needs something".<br />You can carry a bottle with you in your purse or pocket to fundraising dinners, music camps, Little League awards banquets, church socials, Pesach/Chanukkah celebrations -- anywhere where you might be expected to eat stodgy grub with relish -- and employ it with inspiration.

review/text: Obviously, Robyn Bell doesn't know anything about seaweed.  Hijiki is a black seaweed and it is supposed to look black and like tiny little nettles.  It's delicious if you make it properly.  I've had this hijiki (even sometimes make my mom make it for me just so I won't have to do it myself--she likes feeling needed) many times and it is especially delicious on a hot summer evening when you really don't feel like cooking--just stick some rice in the cooker, get some of this premade out of the frig, you can add some sliced/diced inari tofu shells and chow down.  After you soak it and rinse it (to remove some of the salt and to rehydrate it), you mix it with the dashi-soy sauce-mirin sauce (so common in Japanese recipes).  You can add edamame to it too to give it some protein.

review/text: I happen to be drinking an Orange Zevia as I write this review.  :)<br /><br />I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Natural Orange is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and root beer, however all their flavors are yummy!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either.<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good. It has an odd bite to it that I assume comes from it getting too warm.  It alters the beverage and cooling it in the frig does not reverse it.

review/summary: If Stevia is bitter for you, then this is the better tasting Zevia drinks
review/text: Because of my genetics Stevia will always be bitter to me. I've tried other artificial sweeteners and stevia is by far the worse in bitterness no matter what brand I try.  I get no sweet taste at all. However, I have to limit my sugar intake, and sometimes I just get tired of other drinks, especially the carbonated ones. I like the orange Zevia because with the bitter Stevia taste it reminds me a lot of the "bitter orange" or lightly sweetened orange sodas that I got in Europe. I haven't tried the lemon or lime flavors, but I imagine the citrus lends itself well to the bitter flavor.

One case had a can that had ruptured, soaking the inside of the box, and the cardboard had begun to mold as a result.  Yuck.  It was not a particularly hot day when it was delivered, between that and the mold I'm sure the can burst long before it arrived at my door.<br /><br />Another case not only had a ruptured can, but was missing one as well!  One of the four sixpacks had only five cans, and an empty plastic ring where a sixth should have been.<br /><br />Maybe the packagers got thirsty.

review/summary: orange soda!
review/text: When I was a kid, I loved Orange Crush.  Now, I don't drink soda with sugar and diet sodas contain a chemical sweetener of some sort that generally taste like crap.  Not this one!  It contains Stevia which is a plant that is naturally sweet but calorie free, no diabetic impact, etc etc.  It also uses Erythritol for sweetness which is a sugar alcohol.  I like the taste, it doesn't rot my teeth, and it doesn't make me sluggish or fat.  The one downside is the price.  Economies of scale rule the beverage business, and Zevia is a small player.  The product benefits offset the price in my mind and using Amazon Subscribe & Save offsets some of the cost.  That is certainly the cheapest way to get Zevia.

review/summary: Not as Good as Cola or Root Beer Flavors
review/text: This is the first Zevia flavor I got to try.  I didn't really want it but it was all Amazon had in stock and ready to ship for Prime members (more on that later).  I was so eager to try it I popped a can open right when I got it in the house.  My initial thought was that it was gross but I thought I could get used to it by the time I get through the entire case.  My wife tried it at room temperature and she hated it.  She didn't touch anymore orange or the black cherry I got later because of that first taste.  She's since had some nice cold root beer and cola Zevia which she was impressed with.  My nearly three year old son also had a taste test of the orange flavor.  He's not a soda drinker so maybe that had something to do with his reaction.  He drank about an 1/8 of a can which surprisingly all came back up on my kitchen floor about two minutes after he drank it.  He said he didn't like it.  Ha.  Out of the four flavors of Zevia, orange is my least favorite.  I will not be ordering it again due in part to its taste, which I would say is okay, but also the price for it.  I am willing to pay the price for now for a couple of the other flavors, but not orange.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Orange is an okay tasting soda.  I will not be purchasing any more of it even if it's all Amazon Prime has in stock.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Not Overly Sweet!!
review/text: OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness.<br /><br />Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my "go to" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/summary: Better than Sunkist and Orangina!
review/text: Ever since I learned about the dangers of sugar and chemical sugars, I have avoided them like the plague.  Then when I accidentally discovered an online ad for a "stevia-sweetened" soft drink named Zevia, well, let's just say I was hooked.<br /><br />Zevia is an alternative to diet soda that is sweetened with my two favorite sweeteners: erythritol and stevia. Wow! There is no calcium-removing phosphoric acid like you'd find in regular toxic sodas. And the taste is great! I've only tried the Orange and Natural Twist flavors with Orange being my favorite so far. I hear they came out with a new root beer flavor so that makes a total of four different Zevia sodas to choose from.<br /><br />Diabetics and those with Candida will welcome this new alternative to soda. I know me and my father sure did. Can't wait to open a nice cold one right after I write this review. Ahhhhhh!

review/summary: great price for very good product
review/text: If the price is too good to believe, well it's not.............  these Shitake are superior to supermarket brands at about half the price (which includes shipping).  Cap sizes are in the 1.25 to 1.75" range and are very uniform in shape.  Trust me, a pound of dried mushrooms is a LOT and at this price you can use them in just about anything; hint, save the soaking water, filter thru a paper towel or coffee filter in a strainer and use like wine, stock or water in soups, braises or reduction sautes.  Great flavor and can be substituted for porcini or cepes when you don't want to break the bank, though they're really best suited to asian dishes.  The reason they're so much cheaper is that they're cultivated where porcini/ceps are gathered in the wild; kind of like the difference between wild salmon and farm raised.<br /><br />10/28/11<br /><br />Please be advised that this product may or may not be the same as I purchased at the time of my review.  The vendor is entirely different and I have no confidence the product is from the same source or is in any way similar other than  by weight. I also question amazon's policy of using my review to promote a different vendor and likely different sourced product from that which I shared my experience with.<br /><br />*************<br /><br />After I posted the above revision amazon added back in the original vendor which I had experience with.  I don't know if this was coincidental or a result of my additional comment, but to ensure this doesn't become a continual issue, let me state that my purchase was made from JR Mushrooms & Specialties and that I stand by the review of the product they provided.  Any other vendor is likely to source this product differently and therefore my review should only be considered when purchasing from JR.

review/summary: Great Value for Shiitake and Great Quality
review/text: Since these Shiitake mushrooms seemed a great value, I thought I would stock up and ordered two pounds.  Well,that turns out to be a lot of mushrooms,  One pound equals about 5+ quarts of dried mushrooms, packed tight but not broken.<br /><br />The shiitake's range from medium to large size, with some larger than I expected.  All in all it was a good selection of various size and they all look quite nice.<br /><br />They come packed in a sealed plastic bag that shipped well, so I'm not quite sure what the concern related to pachaging by a previous reviewer was based upon.  You could not re seal the original bag, and I would not expect to do so, but transfering to zip lock bags or quart jars as I did works well.  I store other mushrooms in  glass quart jars as well and this method keeps them dry on your pantry shelf.  I would suggest you order these if you enjoy Shiitake Mushrooms in your stir fry and soups.<br />Great Value

I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....

review/summary: Quantity of tea included
review/text: I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/summary: Superb Green Tea, Organic, Excellent!
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: a bit disappointed...
review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...

review/summary: Vanilla Honeybush
review/text: Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/summary: Tastes exactly like regular Stash Green Tea
review/text: I was worried this was going to taste "less" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!

review/summary: Very strange flavor
review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/summary: Delicious and Refreshing
review/text: I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
