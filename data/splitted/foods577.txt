review/summary: Mi-del Honey Grahams
review/text: Great price for these crackers, which are becoming harder and harder to find in local stores.  I like them because they are not so full of sugar, as are many Graham crackers and my kids love them.  Only disappointment was that about an eighth of each package was crumbled into little pieces, so they don't see, to ship very well.

review/summary: USED To be my favorite graham cracker!
review/text: I wrote the company to tell them about how I did not like the changes they made a couple of years ago to this product.  The texture and quality are different and the packaging has changed, and NOT for the better. This WAS our family's favorite graham cracker. They told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way.  Too bad, they lost a customer. Also, the last case I received went rancid before the expiration date.  I store these in my pantry, which is cool and dry.  Not sure why that happened, but it was a waste. They also arrive very cracked and broken, due to the way they are packaged. I won't be buying these anymore.

review/summary: Healthfood not junk food, but why no 6-pack??
review/text: This is a great, whole grain, no refined sugar version of Graham crackers. This is the traditional version, even tho it is not what most of us grew up on. I enjoy MiDels, and don't have to feel guilty. Kids can put jam on theirs to make them sweeter. They don't really have a kid level of sweetness otherwise. What I want to know is, why do I have to get a 12-pack? I won't eat that many in a year, and where do I keep them?? Can't we get these in a 4- or 6-pack??

review/summary: Real Graham Crackers
review/text: These are the only graham crackers I've found that taste like graham crackers should taste.  They aren't coated in sugar. Real graham crackers. Simply delicious. Great ingredients, too.  They really do have honey, NOT corn syrup with a mention of honey way down in the list.  So, NO corn syrup, no cane sugar, etc. Recognizable ingredients, not a bunch of chemicals and fillers.<br /><br />One comment to Mi-Del would be that they need to improve the inner packaging.  The plastic container sleeves crack and don't protect the crackers.  So, I've found that a few are often broken.  But I still give the crackers 5 stars for taste and quality.

review/summary: good, healthy snack will assuage hunger pangs
review/text: No, these don't taste like regular grahams. They taste a lot like wheat germ and whole wheat. They are an acquired taste for many people. They are quite dry so if you like a dry shortbread cookie, you'll probably like these. I really like having a bag of them in the car, for when I get really hungry. They satisfy without making you hungrier, which some of the other mentioned WW grahams (esp those bunny ones) do! Yes, they come in broken a lot, even from the market, but that's because of their dry nature, not Amazon. However, I do agree with a couple of reviewers who claim the taste has changed over the years. I agree. I wrote the company & they said it hadn't, but they probably changed/improved the oil or something, for the ingredients are all really healthy ones.

review/summary: good for a snack
review/text: They good news is that they can be part of a healthy snack. Spread 1/2 TB Smucker's Natural Peanut Butter between two Mi-Del Grahams and you've got half of a mid-morning snack. Do it again for the other half of the snack. This snack has 245 calories from 11.5g fat, 31g carbs, and 10g protein.<br /><br />The Grahams are healthier than common graham crackers and expect them to taste that way too. They are good, but they are not sweet. They also crumble easily. Expect about half of them to be in pieces. The plastic packaging crumbles easily too. Remove them from the box carefully or you'll have crumbs everywhere.

review/summary: Not Supposed to be normal.
review/text: These grahams are beautiful.  They are simple, slightly sweet, subtly healthy and a delicious supplement to their hydrogenated counterparts.  I would choose these grahams over any other "natural" graham on the market.  It is sweetened with honey and molasses only, so no refined sugars or evaporated sugar juice.  Warning.  These are not intended to be super sweet, they are intended to be like the original recipe for what we have come to understand as graham crackers.  Our taste for this type of food has overdeveloped into a need to have sugary snacks.  I promise you, if you compliment these with a good chunky peanut butter you will not be disappointed.  This could possibly be my favorite snack in the history of my mouth.  I truly recommend these, and if you need a little extra sweetness, top with PB and some good quality (low sugar) chocolate chips.  So, don't knock these for being unsweet.  That is the purpose and they are a great snack.

review/summary: Only graham cracker with fiber
review/text: I like these graham crackers because they have whole wheat which is very important to me.  The taste is ok because I add peanut butter to them.  I liked them better before they changed the recipe.  As long as they keep the 3 grams of fiber I will keep buying.  I feel they are the best of what's available.  Make sure you check the date when purchasing because they have no preservatives they get rancid quickly.

The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, "Will it taste good?". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!

I was surprised to find fresh chili oil on my fingers when I opened the package. I thought this was a good sign and it was. These peppers taste fresher and spicier than any I've bought at the grocery store. We'll see how long they stay that way but so far so good.<br /><br />UPDATE August 2012: I have noticed that the peppers stay spicier in the fridge than at room temperature. So if you like to keep a little dispenser at the table, you may want to only fill up 1-2 week's worth.

review/summary: red peppers for the rest of my life
review/text: Okay so theres a mountain of red pepper flakes in this bottle and I don't think I'll ever use even half of it.  The pepper is really good and has a mid-high 'heat' rating - atleast to me.  I eat medium to hot foods regularly - pizza, sausages, burgers, pasta.  Pretty good buy compared to buyign tiny jars of red peppers at the grocery store and the freshness of these flakes is great.  I thought the jar that the peppers came in could use some redesign however - part of the lid can be opened for a spoon and the other side has 3 rather large holes to sprinkle flakes on your food.  I wish they made the lid with smaller holes to distributed flakes better, as it is now I get a ton of flakes dumped out on my food (not always a bad thing).

review/text: This Red Pepper looks great and the price was fine. The shipping was great. It is probably not as hot as I would like it to be. No real differance than your store bought Red Hot Crushed Pepper. So I will have to order another brand for my next order. Like I mentioned the Quality looks great and the Color is Rich Red which means that it is Fresh but not as Hot as I would expect. I usually buy the McCormack brand at the store and somtimes it is really hot and other times it is not... So I wanted a good quality Hot Crushed Red Pepper that would also be Hot. This is Hot and the quality is GREAT GREAT!!!! But not any Hotter that McCormacks, so why buy on line if you can buy it in the store??? I will try another brand online and hope it is Hotter?

I've tried dumping on the sriracha,s, the habanero sauces, the chili garlic pastes, etc.  But I'm also dumping on tons of salt and vinegar and other off elements that I'm not looking for (sugar?).  If you want hot, and convenient, pile this stuff on whatever you are eating and enjoy.  My favorite is a bowl of plain brown rice (from the big container in the freezer) with a dash of soy sauce, a small handful of unsalted peanuts, and tons and tons of crushed red pepper.  Wet dishes/soups tend to activate it even more, or make your own paste with just water.  Mmmm, life is good :)

review/summary: Best EVOO
review/text: I'm an EVOO snob. I was introduced to Corto Olive Oil and since trying that brand and tasting the flavor of California olives in this EVOO no other has even come close to comparing. I was on my last few drops of Corto and was truly sad because who can really afford to buy a $53.00 bottle of olive oil? I was in my local Key Foods and I stopped by the oils section and saw this bottle. It stuck out from the rest of the oils because it was in a small area, compared to the shelves and shelves of Bertolli, etc, and it said "California Olive" on it! I got excited... saw the price, $7.99. I decided to give it a whirl. The second I opened the bottle... BAM. The fragrant aroma that had once only been found from Corto permeated the air. I froze... and did a taste. It is an EXACT replica of Corto olive oil at a FRACTION of the cost. I don't think anyone can truly understand how excited, and how THRILLED I am to have found this brand. Well done C.O.R. You have a new loyal customer.

review/summary: extra virgin olive oil
review/text: this is a fantastic oil at a very budget minded light price, it is great for making dips, sauteing; I heard about this product on a NPR segment of a book review, "Extra Virginity" the author used this and one other that I noted as being the real deal, great olives, processed correctly for the best health benefits...I bought the book and the more expensive Castillo de Canena Arbequina Olive Oil (see my review, a very good oil also) and this wonderful California Olive Ranch oil, both are terrific and I will continue to use the California oil on a regular basis because I love supporting the farmers of the USA...

review/summary: A great olive oil from  California Olive Ranch
review/text: I was looking for an olive oil that was from California.  It had to be fresh tasting and fruity, and not go rancid too quickly.  I found just what I was looking for with California Ranch Oil.  It is  wonderful...I would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Excellent but Price?
review/text: I first heard about this on America's Test Kitchen where it won a blind taste test against a premium Italian brand and so we tried it, and verified that it was excellent and remains so to this day.  But the Amazon price is beyond comprehension, $18.88 when compared to in-store price of $7.49 and on top of that, and for reasons that are totally uncler, the store is marking it down by an additional $3.50 so that the price came out to be $3.99.  And to anticipate a quesiton, I checked the "expiration" date and it is off until late 2013.  Even if there was no discout, the $7.49 regular price is a bargain, at least compared to Amazon.  And this is good olive oil, the olives are grown and harvested in California with processing on site.

review/summary: "Curiously Strong"
review/text: This olive oil had an extremely strong "raw green" taste to it, and lots of bitter undertones, but no peppery finish that I could detect. Honestly, to me it tastes exactly like how fresh mown grass smells lol. Not everyone seems to be a fan, but it's fairly cheap as far as OOs go, so I recommend picking up a bottle at locally if you're curious and looking for an oo with flavor that can compete with strong tasting foods...<br /><br />I personally liked the flavor of this oil a lot; It was delish drizzled over tough artisan bread with a little goat cheese on the side - the strong flavor held it's own with the cheese.

review/summary: A bad bottle?
review/text: I found this product to be quite displeasing. It's very bitter and tastes of unripe fruit; think "green." That is the only flavor, nuance or otherwise, I could taste. It also caused a formidable burning sensation in my throat. To this product's credit however, its viscosity and mouthfeel are among the best I've tried.<br /><br />I am a true lover of olive oil, and use it nearly everyday. Often, I'll just have a spoonful by itself. I like to try all brands I find, as I enjoy the variety of tastes and textures. To me, this product didn't even taste like olive oil.<br /><br />Since I bought it at Wal-Mart, it might be safe to assume this product was mis-handled during shipment. The packaging date is nearly a year ago, even though I purchased it last weekend. I may try another bottle, at another time, purchased from a reputable grocer.

review/text: The good news - the cookies are tasty and fresh. The bad news - the most current packaging (summer 2010) means the contents are powder by the time they reach you. In the past, Salem used a well-padded interior honeycomb packaging which protected the cookies. The newest packaging offers virtually no protection, and the cookies are mostly reduced to crumbs and powder.<br /><br />These cookies are very thin, paper-thin, and crisp. It's hard to eat just a few!

First, they are paper thin, well maybe not paper but perhaps potato chip thin. Which makes them as addictive! They also have a little more bite on the end of the flavor. To me they are my favorite cookies! I can see having these with ice cream, whipped cream or just all on their own. They are the best!

review/summary: Great flavor and organic too
review/text: These dried onion flakes have a flavor and aroma that's a combination of fresh and slightly toasted, with just a hint of sweetness. In short, they're great.<br /><br />And 16 ounces of dried onion is quite a lot of onion. Keep it in airtight containers to keep the flavor fresh for a long time.

review/summary: Great Onions
review/text: I'm on my second order for these Frontier White Onions. They smell and taste great. I find them so handy for meatloaves, soups @ stews,and all sorts of casseroles. In an air tight container, they last well to the end of the bag. I've used the store brands, and the dollar jars, of onions, but these are a far greater quality. They're simply great.

review/summary: Tastes as good as potato chips!
review/text: If you just want good-tasting dried onions, then you might give this product 5 stars.  These dried onions taste as good as potato chips [organic, no salt added] and you would be willing to eat this product by itself without any other food.  However, I'm very concerned that the healthful phytochemicals in these onions have been severely damaged and mostly lost.  The "sting" in these onions is completely missing, indicating to me that Frontier either used "sweet" white onions deprived of sulfur instead of the organosulfur-rich regular white onions - or - Frontier dried regular white onions in a way that destroys too much of the highly beneficial phytochemicals.  The fact that the product we actually receive has been chopped up too finely instead of the nice, large chunks that we see in the photo also increases the odds that the healthfulness has been damaged.

review/text: When I lived in the Tampa Bay area, Joffrey's Coffee was everywhere, but then I moved north and couldn't find anything that tastes like Angel's Kiss. It's a little nutty, a little sweet. Chocolatey. It really is divine flavored coffee! Joffrey's is a superior coffee roaster, and most of their flavors are out of this world... but hands down, Angel's Kiss is my favorite. And, you can get it ground, or in whole bean!

review/text: My dog is very finicky on what she will eat.  She seems to like the Pedigree canned wet food but I wanted to make sure she had hard to keep her teeth clean (other than feeding treats of course). Even though she may not really eat this dry food, I will still give it 5 stars because Pedigree is a good brand of dog food. Item came at time expected. Would recommend ordering.

review/summary: Great for Senior Dogs/priced too high
review/text: My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart.

review/summary: My dog loves it, so do the cats
review/text: I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.

review/summary: My senior dog looks forward to her meals again.
review/text: One of the problems senior dogs often face is a decreasing appetite. This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.

review/summary: Doggie's Change of Pace
review/text: I've been using Harmony Dry Dog Food for the past 2 years with great success. However, the last bag had a rancid oil smell upon opening. Not sure if the Texas heatwave OR a recipe change was the cause. BUT my pooch ate it, just not with his usual gusto. Making gravies to enhance it pushed me to find some healthy "mix-ins". Searching the internet for reviews and pricing of various brands, led me back to Amazon and Pedigree on sale. I've been mixing this with his Harmony. He eats the combination heartily without digestive issues. Based on his favorable response I've purchased other Pedigree brand items (dry and wet) on sale through Amazon's Warehouse Deals with equally favorable response.  I won't give up on Harmony Dog Foods BUT I'll have other options as well so my fur-baby doesn't burnout on it.

No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as "wholesome" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? "Food Pets Die For", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it.
