review/summary: Brought my German Shepard from a wonderful breeder and they highly supported Canidae.
review/text: I asked the breeder "why Canidae"? I never even heard of it. She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie, like now and noticed a differance in various ways. I am happy to see I can now buy the product online to get my dog back on tract.

review/summary: Was a little nervous trying it, but my dog does well on it
review/text: I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.<br /><br />The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.

review/summary: Affordable Premium Food
review/text: We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.  I'd love to feed them Orijen or Taste of the Wild, but they are very cost prohibitive.  I'm glad this one fits the bill without draining my bank account.

review/summary: Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half
review/text: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.

review/summary: WARNING!!!!
review/text: I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html

review/summary: Good food for our dogs
review/text: I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.

review/summary: still a wonderful food
review/text: My dogs started on Canidae 3 years ago. All of them had a dramatic change in energy and coat. They have done wonderfully on the food since. There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.

review/summary: Canidae Lost Another Loyal Customer!
review/text: Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???

review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.

review/summary: Great dog food.
review/text: I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.

review/summary: CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!
review/text: If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the "customer service representative" if you can call her that, simply said "if you don't like it then don't buy it." And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any "stickers" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.

review/summary: Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula
review/text: Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.

review/summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower
review/text: I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.

review/text: I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc.

review/summary: Great Food!!!!
review/text: I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.

I tried several brands of breadsticks, and Alessi Sesame Breadsticks are the best!  Many other brands are too dry, hard, and flavorless.  Alessi Sesame Breadsticks are light, delicately toasted, and crispy. They are easy to chew unlike some brands that feel like you are biting into a concrete brick.  Alessi's Breadsticks are really delicious, and they are made with healthy extra virgin olive oil.  I wish more grocery stores would carry this brand. I'm so glad that this excellent food is available through Amazon.com.

review/text: I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them. Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.<br /><br />I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.

review/text: As Susan Fong described above, these breadsticks are fantastic -- light, crispy and very tasty. Having tried many brands, I've been buying these exclusively for years and highly recommend them.<br /><br />EDIT (07/25/12): Following about a year in which I didn't order these, I received another shipment this week. And I noticed that Amazon (or Alessi) seems to have made an attempt to address the broken bread stick issue by placing the retail boxes in a more substantial outer box. However, it didn't work very well. Although fewer bread sticks are broken than before, the percentage of broken sticks is only "down" to about 50%. So for anyone who plans to serve these to guests (instead of merely snacking on them like me), I would strongly suggest paying a little more and getting them at a local supermarket.

review/text: Over the years I've really enjoyed the crunchy breadsticks I have eaten in restaurants, but until I bought these breadsticks, somehow I had never gotten around to purchasing any before. These came to my attention through one of Amazon's "if you bought this, you might like this" recommendations. It was quite a gamble springing for a dozen boxes of this product merely because it has a lot of positive reviews, but fortunately I won the wager because I really like these breadsticks.<br /><br />For my taste, they are too bland to eat alone (most likely because I've lately been eating a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00452H3MM">Blue Diamond Almond Nut-Thins</a> which are filled with flavor and taste incredible right out of the box). However, these breadsticks really shine when I use them for the main purpose they are commonly intended for, as an adjunct to soup or salad.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase.

review/summary: Good balanced taste.
review/text: I would say this is avg in the Korean Snack world taste wise.  It is not too sweet, it is not salty, it is not spicy, it actually does NOT contain MSG! (maybe that's why it's not THAT addictive like some crazy snacks)<br /><br />If you like something that has a little more sweet kick to it nongshim's own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK7S">Nong Shim Honey Twist Snack, 2.64-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a> is pretty good.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts, a full package contains 280 calories (50 from fat) but the most important ingredient is that it does not have MSG.  Have in mind that most of the asian snacks do contain MSG... they are so good... haha.  It's a good snack to have around for those mid-afternoon munchies, my fingers get slightly sticky from eating them but all in all a good snack.

review/summary: Wonderful, sun ripened goodness
review/text: I was very pleased with the product. The fruit was well ripened and semi-dried to provide a delicious alternative to sugary snacks. My emphasis and reason for buying the product was to give my family the nutrient value of the fruit at a time when fresh fruit was difficult to come by or at least very expensive. This product allowed me to accomplish that goal with its wide variety of seedless and pited, well preserved fruit. A tasty and cheifly beneficial treat for the bleakness of winter. Thank you and God bless you! >&lt;>

review/summary: It's Better If You Don't Look at the Ingredients
review/text: I purchased this same product from Costco recently. The taste was alright; nothing particularly special, probably a solid three stars. I felt it was a little heavy on the dried plums (that's what we call prunes now, thanks to the boys in marketing for that one), but otherwise it was a respectable mix of fruit. My problems with this product began when I looked more closely at the ingredients.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, directly from the package:<br /><br />California Pitted Dried Plums, Dried Mediterranean Apricots (Product of Turkey), Dried California Peaches, Dried Pears (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apricots (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apples (Products of Chile, China or Argentina), Medium Chain Triglycerides (from coconut and/or palm kernel)* and Natural Flavoring. Sulfur Dioxide and/or Sodium Bisulfate and/or Potassium Sorbate added as preservatives.<br /><br />* Adds a trivial amount of fat.<br /><br />I have two main issues with this:<br /><br />1. The apples are not from the United States. To be clear, I don't have a problem with imported fruit; it offers consumers year-round availability of things that otherwise might only be available for a couple months. But why are we importing apples into the U.S.? Don't we grow, like, a bazillion of these things every year? And from China no less? If I visited China, it would be risky for me to eat the fruit... is it somehow okay when it's dried out and sold here?<br /><br />2. There's fat added to fruit. Sure, it's a "trivial" amount, but why is this even happening at all? It's fruit, it doesn't need fat added to it, especially in triglyceride form.<br /><br />Now, neither of these issues are the end of the world... but I feel like I can do better. I noticed the availability of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAUKP4">Mariani Mixed Fruit</a>, made by the same company, but without Chinese apples or triglycerides listed among the ingredients. Do they have two lines of the same product? I'll probably just stick with getting my dried fruit at Trader Joe's... their stuff is pretty reliable.

review/summary: A Problem With Prunes?
review/text: Italian Plums have always been used to make prunes. When allowed to ripen on the vine (tree), these plums are out of this world. The skin of this beautiful dark purple and oval-shaped plum contains very sweet, slightly firm flesh surrounding a small seed that doesn't cling. All this is what makes for a delicious prune when dried.<br /><br />I noted the other fruits do come from other countries, but so do many of the fresh fruits we purchase in markets and we usually don't know where they came from.<br /><br />I can't imagine that dried fruit from Costco would necessarily be a better product, especially if it's a house brand. I've noticed lately that some of their products have deteriorated in quality, i.e., baby wipes, bath tissues, to name a couple.

review/text: Even rinsing in water doesn't get rid of the chemical tongue sting from apple pieces. It wouldn't hurt Mariani to look for other ways to preserve their products, marinating in sugar being one way that comes to mind. I mean, this is a question of once bought, never repeated, for consumers. Mariani could yet snatch success from the jaws of failure by changing their preservation methods.

review/summary: Zero stars for flax seeds, 5 for salt, pepper, and cinnamon
review/text: **UPDATE Mar 25, 2012: I found a spice grinder here on Amazon that does flax seeds: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU">Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black</a>. If you're looking for a good flax seed grinder, take a look at my review of the Krups grinder.**<br /><br />I purchased this grinder specifically to grind flax seeds two tablespoons at a time. It works... if you've got all day. I put two tablespoons of fresh flax seed into the grinder and twisted...and twisted....and twisted... After about a minute of grinding I had a litte bit of flax seed dust. So I tried grinding with various coarseness settings. Same result: very few of the seeds were ground. Desiring to be "fair", I filled the grinder with as much seed as it could hold, thinking the added weight of seeds would push the others into the grinding wheels to produce more ground product faster. Nope. This grinder still produced little product for the effort. Finally, I decided to stand there and grind away for as long as it takes to get my two tablespoons of ground flax seed. My wrists began to ache after 3 or 4  minutes and I still didn't have quite the two tablespoons full, but it was enough to get on with breakfast.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I put some sea salt rocks in this grinder and wow!  It grinds sea salt like a champ. Then I put some peppercorns in this grinder and wow again! It's great with peppercorns, too. I wish I'd known this before I bought the two expensive salt and pepper mills I already own.<br /><br />With my curiosity now out of control, I broke a couple of cinnamon sticks into shorter pieces and popped them into this grinder. it works well enough for those rare occasions that I need freshly ground cinnamon. Wanting to be thorough, I covered a couple of sticks of cinnamon with a paper towel and crushed them with two or three whacks of a hammer (a meat tenderizer would work, too) and put the pieces into this grinder. Phenomenal! It did a great job of grinding crushed cinnamon sticks.<br /><br />Summary: If flax seed is what you want to grind, don't buy this grinder unless you have plenty of time and strong wrists. If you're looking for something that looks great on the casual dining table and happens to do a great job of grinding salt rocks, peppercorns, and crushed cinnamon sticks at a great price, buy this grinder. I wanted to give zero stars to this grinder because it does a terrible job of grinding flax seeds. But because it does a great job grinding salt, pepper, and cinnamon AND is reasonbly priced, I give it 5 stars and plan to buy two more.

review/summary: Great for cumin seeds!
review/text: This is a nice spice grinder to keep on your counter.  I have only used it for cumin seeds so far and it is fantastic for that.  You will never buy pre-ground cumin again.  It does require a lot more turning that you would expect (maybe 40 turns for a 1/4 teaspoon), but it's worth it for freshly ground spices.<br /><br />24Apr2012 - I am removing a star because the number of turns required for grinding is just too high.  I ended up replacing this with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L0OOQM">OXO Good Grips Pepper Mill</a> that has a crank.

review/summary: Good for Spices!
review/text: I was looking for a non-electric grinder that could do spices. I read the reviews and went back and forth on three different options, but I ultimately decided to go with this one. Works great! It is a perfect size and seems to be well made. Most importantly, it's able to grind up my cumin seeds very finely (powder). I also put in already somewhat well-ground dried thyme and it could even grind it more finely. It was not difficult or straining to use. Perhaps 20 turns and I had a teaspoon of thyme, which doesn't seem like much trouble at all when it is so easy to turn. I definitely recommend for spices.

review/text: Wonderful, wonderful little grinder for grinding everything from whole rosemary, to whole thyme, to coriander seeds.  Granted this little grinder is operated by hand but it easily grinds up your herbs and spices to add fresh into your cooking which I love, just with a few turns of the wrist.  The grinding mechanism is a very sturdy ceramic and steel mechanism and holds up great.  I have several with different whole spices in them.  I love them.  Very good quality, I did a lot of research before buying.

The grinder overall is a little bit small and harder to hold/grind with than the similar Ikea ones.  Overall I like it and would recommend as a pepper grinder.<br /><br />A note about the company name "Linden Sweden" is a US based company with no association with Sweden besides the word "Sweden" in their name.  The grinder is made in China.

review/summary: not impressed
review/text: i have to say that I am not in love with these spice grinders.  I have flax seed  in one and course salt in the other.  In order for me to get salt out of the ceramic grinder, it takes a tremendous amount of strength to turn  the top.  its very slippery and almost impossible to turn.  the surfaces are very smooth so my hand just slides around the jar. what really is disappointing is the fact that the salt falls out in one very small area.....so i get a big sprinkling of a large amount of salt on just a small portion of the plate.  no matter how fast i move the grinder, it still ends up in one small pile, which is way to much salt.<br />it takes FOREVER to grind flaxseed in these!  i will return these....and stick with the old fashion cheapie wooden pepper mill.

It adjusts grind size easily and the ceramic blade is great! So today I am back for another one to keep in my picnic basket, and we will use it for pepper.

review/text: My cat, I suppose like a lot of cats, is a very picky eater!  She loves the Felidae dry cat food but only the chicken, turkey, lamb & fish formula.  She doesn't seem to like small round hard nugget pieces of dry food.  This formula is in a tiny flat bone shape and seems softer for her to chew.  The whole grain formula is smaller hard round nuggets, so she doesn't like them, but other cats may like it.  I feel it is a healthy cat food for her and since she has been eating it for awhile now, she doesn't have the fur balls so much like she used to.  I am thankful it is sold on Amazon as it is hard to find and I hope they are able to keep on selling it!  The shipment from this seller was delivered fast, which is helpful when you forget to order it soon enough.  A very satisfied customer and cat!

review/text: I love McCann's regular steel oats cereal but in our busy world, it's nice to be able to have an instant oatmeal when time is short.  Because of all the positive reviews relative McCann's instant oatmeal, I ordered it.  I swear, I must be living on a different planet because I found this product to be anything but delicious.  It was gummy, almost paste like, and very bland.  At first I thought I made it wrong so I read the instructions again and made another bowl.  Unfortunately, it wasn't any better.  You can doctor it up with some fruit or a tinch of butter and brown sugar which helps but it still does not have the nutty conistency that McCann's regular steel oats have.  I actually prefer Quaker's Instant Oatmeal over McCann's instant brand.  Since I have quite a few boxes, I am giving them to family and friends. I guess I'll just go back to making McCann's regular steel oats when I have time to cook them.  They are absolutely wonderful.

review/summary: Best Instant!
review/text: In trying to have a healthier diet, I decided to start eating oatmeal and found McCann's Instant - delicious!  Comes out perfect every time and has a hearty taste and nice grainy texture.  When my local supermarket stopped selling it, I tried other stores and finally other brands which in no way compare.  So glad to find it on Amazon. In my opinion, McCann's has the best, regular flavor instant oatmeal.

review/summary: McCann's the best by far!!!
review/text: I have tried them all just about literally! from nature food stores, the major brand that begins with Q (you know it) and just about every store brand. The Amazon price for this places it just a tiny bit more than buying store brand and below just about EVERY name Brand I have seen. The taste, texture and quality over the years has not changed at all! It is EXACTLY what I want in an Oatmeal and I can pretty much assure anyone that tries it would agree! Easy 2-minutes in the microwave (I use 2-packets) and a drop of milk and it cannot be beat. Try it, as the old commercial for cereal said, Even Mikey Liked It!

Plently of fizz if you are used to drinking that because of soda. I like the flavor of the lime very much. A flavorful way to get your 8 glasses of water a day.

review/summary: Can't get enough!
review/text: The Donsuemor Madeleines have been an absolute favorite of my family for over a decade.  They're so rich and flavorful that every time I think of them, I want some.  My mom's entire side of her family gobbles them up whenever we can get our hands on them, and we were all delighted this year that my grandma showed up to Christmas with Madeleines to hand out.  Luckily, she kept it a secret and passed them to us quietly, or she might have been mobbed!<br /><br />Every time I go to San Francisco, I come back with a big box (I buy 2, but the other one never seems to make it on the plane home...) I'll definitely be buying them now that I found them on Amazon!<br /><br />These are the same Madeleines you find at Starbucks, so if you want to try them out before you buy, go there.  But do buy them, they're amazing!!!  Especially the ones that are dipped in chocolate.<br /><br />A tip: if you want the Madeleines to taste their best, eat them within 3 days. If you can't scarf down 60 in that time, pop any unopened 3-packs in the freezer and they'll stay fresh for a couple months.  Otherwise, they'll still be good, but not as good as they could be.

review/summary: This stuff is great!
review/text: After battling severe Gastritis from a reaction to NSAIDS, I thought I would never go near a cup of coffee again.  I used Cafix for a while, and did like it as a good substitute, but it just wasn't coffee.  We've been using HealthWise for a few months now, and we really like it.  It's real coffee without the acidity, and easy on the stomach.  It seems to be a bit "drier" than full acid coffee, but it still seems to have a lot of body, and no bitter flavor.  It's also great to be able to return to the ritual of brewing a pot.  Spooning something out of a jar just isn't the same.  If you have issues with coffee acidity, give this a try.  We have not been able to find it in stores, so I order it from Amazon.

review/text: We've come a long way from the strong coffees we use to enjoy. This one is mild & you'll have to play around with the amount of spoonfuls per pot that is OK for you. I followed the instructions & the 1st time it was TOO WEAK! It looked like ice tea! So I put more spoonfuls in it & it's better. Your tastbuds get use to the change.  I have IC & drink some, not much & have no problems. My husband has really enjoyed it. He was getting too much acid in the mornings & it was messing up his digestion, (like starting out the monring with Tums!) He has really enjoyed the change. The 3, 12 oz. cans went fast so ordered more, decided to try hazelnut.

review/text: Two years ago I had an acid reflux "event" and was told to go on a low acid diet.<br /><br />I initially quit coffee, but I mean really, it turns out life is meaningless without my jolt so I found a solution in this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is weaker than other ground coffees, so either add more, or set your machine to "strong" setting.<br /><br />I also have toast with my coffee. This is what my ENT told me to do as it helps with those who have acid reflux.<br /><br />It seems every year there are conflicting reports on the risks ro benefits of coffee. Let me tell you this: Drinking coffee is fine unless you are the type that gets the jitters. Just dont smoke and you will be ok. Also, there is some eveidence that coffee prevents Alzheimers, but I do not know much more about that.

review/summary: Best Mild Curry.....easy to use, store, pleasing to all
review/text: Yummy, yummy!<br />This curry paste is now my favorite. It is easy to use, store, and best of all it is delicious! Pataks Curry is very mild....not super spicy like many others. My husband likes flavor and a little spice so this is his favorite as well. I can use the one jar for about 4 meals which is a great deal.<br /><br />I have found that is it so simple to make a "stir-fry" with a protein like tofu, chicken or even salmon and then add veggies such as carrots, or potatoes. There are many combinations and just about any typical veggie taste great in this sauce (love cauliflower). I think it is best kept simple with 2 or 3 ingredients.<br /><br />This sauce is great for an easy meal with guests, throw the rice in the steamer, make the curry stir-fry, and add another side dish and you are set. Our friends love it!<br /><br />Pataks also makes other great sauces but this is my favorite to keep on hand at all times.

review/summary: Delicious curry paste
review/text: This is my favorite curry paste, but many groceries only stock the hot version, which has different spices and a different taste. I am glad I could get this online.

review/summary: Delicious Healthy Snack
review/text: I am not a huge potato chip fan so I was suprised by how much I love with these Lentil Chips!  They are light, healthy and absolutely delicious!  Also nice that they are Gluten Free and can be easily shared with my Gluten Free friends.  My kids also love them!  Favorite is Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper, but also like the Parmesan Garlic.  My father really likes the Cucumber Dill too.  Try them!  You'll love them too.

review/summary: Great steak seasoning
review/text: When we picked out our new Weber Grill at a local bbq store, I asked the salesman what his best steak rub was.  He answered quickly that it was "John Henry's Pecan Rub".  I bought a container of it and it set on the shelf for several months.  Having been a long time bbq smoker and griller, I have several favorite steak seasoning, but I am always looking for new tastes.  My Weber grill has a "seer" feature that allows for 700 degree heat.  The first time I tried the "John Henry's Pecan Rub", it was on a porterhouse steak.  I brushed a little olive oil on it and covered the steak liberaly with the rub.  The grill was at 675 degrees and I "seered" both sides for about 3 minutes.  Took it off and let it set for 5 minutes.  It had a mild chared look on the outside and was a perfect midium rare on the inside.  After my wife tried it she said "this is the best steak I have ever eaten".  Each time I use it I get the same remarks.  It is a great seasoning and I have ordered more.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised...
review/text: Ok, so I've been harsh when reviewing these energy packets from eboost, and I was all set and ready to bash the Orange flavor today, but when I put the glass to my lips and took a sip I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors were far more focused than with the Pink Lemonade and the Acai Pomegranate.  In fact, I also didn't get that `faux sugar flavor' in my throat this go around either.  I still find the ratio of packet to ounces of water to be a tad unsatisfactory (it doesn't produce much of a drink in the end) but I much prefer this flavor to the other two.  There wasn't the chalky aftertaste either, which was a BIG issue with the others.  It still isn't my favorite drink out there, and I don't feel that `boost' they are promoting, but at least this flavor gets the taste right.  For a second there it actually felt like I was downing an orange soft drink; for a second.
