review/summary: Great tea - great delivery - great cost
review/text: The title says it all. One of my daughters introduced me to this tea three years ago and I've been hooked ever since. She says you cannot drink this without milk, soy or cream.  I say you can but it's excellent with soy milk.  Well I guess the title didn't say it all.  Enjoy! Oh yes - the delivery thru Amazon was much faster than I expected.

review/summary: Tasty tea!
review/text: I'm glad I found PG tips tea. It's delicious with just that little bit of bite that I enjoy. I bought the 160-count boxes, pack of four to an order and when that ran out I placed the same order. Now I have a six month subscription for PG tips tea. My daughter figured out that that much tea allows for three tea bags a day which we can easily use - especially since I gave her a box of tea. She was delighted to get it as she is now hooked on PG Tips Black Tea. For anyone wondering about my "nickname", Coffee Break, I will say that yes, I do love strong coffee in the morning, but as much as I enjoy coffee I need soothing tea in the evening.

review/summary: Why Can't American Companies Produce This Quality of Tea?
review/text: I discovered this brand of tea when I made a trip to Britain. While visiting friends I'd met via the internet they introduced me to this delicious tea.  It's stout without being bitter, producing a real brace from cold, damp weather or a relaxing cuppa in the evening.<br /><br />It works not only as a hot tea, but makes the greatest ice tea you can imagine.  We like our ice tea on the strong side so P&G brand works perfectly in our tea maker.  Whether you drink your tea sweetened or unsweetened you will enjoy glass after glass (or cup after cup).<br /><br />Prior to finding P&G available through Amazon, my friends in the UK sent me "care" packages with huge bags of tea in them.  When we are out anywhere, I can no longer order tea.  I'm spoiled; American teas are anemic by comparison so I would rather drink water than to drink an inferior tea.

review/summary: A Robust Cuppa
review/text: There's a reason that PG Tips is arguably the most popular tea in England; you get a full flavored robust cup of tea every time. If you prefer weaker teas, purchase a US brand like Lipton. But if you want the rich golden color that black tea produces and the full flavor eschewed by the pyramid style tea bags, then this is the tea for you. Knowing we can get PG Tips through Amazon will ceratinly free up suitcase space on our trips to England.

review/text: I'm a green tea lover, but like drinking a strong black tea in the morning with some soymilk in it.  This tea brews a stiff beverage that is accompanied well with some sort of milk or milk substitute, and a bit of sweetener (I use Splenda).  The pyramid bags don't have strings just to let everyone know, but I have to use a spoon anyways to stir.  I brew mine for only about a minute and a half with boiling water straight off the stove.

review/summary: Great Tea - Robust taste with a smooth finish!
review/text: This is undoubtedly one of the best teas I have ever had the pleasure to taste.  Although I live in the USA I tend to enjoy a very robust cuppa of tea.  I sometimes buy "specialty" teas from one provider or another and do enjoy them.  For a tremendous daily cup of tea, PG Tips is the best tea that I've tasted.  The pyramid bag allows more room for the tea to steep and the tea blend is robust enough to tolerate a little milk and still have a nice strong flavor.  It feels silky in your mouth and has almost no astringent edge at all.<br /><br />I also really enjoy Ahmad English Breakfast tea, but PG Tips has me covered for every day tea.  I've been drinking two to four cups a day brewed with my Zaraphina tea maker suite and the tea is perfect!

review/summary: The best workhorse tea you can buy....
review/text: By "workhorse," I mean that PG Tips Black Tea is the perfect tea for daily consumption; it's consistent, well-flavored, and perfectly pitched for taking with a little bit of milk and honey. It's perhaps a bit pedestrian, but frankly pedestrian is what I look for in my daily tea. The triangular bags are really more of a gimmick than anything else, but they're fun nonetheless.<br /><br />Two notes, though: 1) Don't let the tea steep too long. If you let it go longer than a minute, you'll notice the difference in "sharpness." 2) This deal is for a LOT of tea. You could safely give a whole box or two away as a gift and still feel like you've got plenty of tea set aside for the apocalypse.

I usually buy Twinings, but for an everyday tea without extra spices, I prefer the taste of the PG tips.  Good thing, because 4 packages * 160 bags is a LOT of tea.  I brew it for 3 minutes & add milk and Splenda.

review/text: I lived in U.K. briefly as a child and my mum is English.  She of course is a great tea lover. I love my coffee just as much as my tea but PG Tips challenges that dual love at times.<br /><br />This tea is phenomenal.  If I were on a desert island and could choose one tea of all that is out there I would choose the PG Tips.  It has a lovely, satisfying flavor that has me finishing every cup to the last bit - even if it's gotten cold.<br /><br />It is an excellent tea.  Everything I want and expect from a good pot and/or cup of tea is there.  Thank you for the great Gold Box sale on this set recently Amazon!  It gave me an opportunity to share as a gift some of these boxes.

review/summary: 5 star tea, 3 star service from Amazon
review/text: We love PG Tips and were worried that when we moved to the US that we wouldn't be able to find a cost effective way of getting our teabags.  We use on average 6-8 teabags a day so we really couldn't afford to buy an 80 count box from World Market at $7-9 a piece.  We were thrilled when Amazon started carrying the 2 pack of 240 count boxes with free shipping.<br /><br />So imagine how irritated I was to come back to re-order more teabags (after ordering the same thing from Amazon for over 2 years) to find that they no longer carry that size and that they have pawned off the same exact 2 pack to another company who wants to charge me almost $6 for shipping.  (The new company even have the Amazon "2 pack" symbol on their image which means that Amazon has probably got this company doing fulfillment now.) Shame on Amazon.com - what's the purpose of free shipping or my prime account if you've got someone else selling your product that's going to charge me shipping?<br /><br />So I've had to go with the 160 count pack of 4, but I wouldn't preferred to just order my usual so I don't have open bags going stale.<br /><br />A small rant, I know, but I look for Amazon to be dependable when every other online retailer is not.  Please bring back my 2 pack of 240 count...

review/text: With multiple food allergies in our home, we are always searching for healthy treats that fit into our diets.  These are by far my favorites.  They are NOT moist cookies, but crunchy ones.  No eggs, so not light and fluffy.  Low in sugar, they are not sweet.  I love the fact that they are made with quinoa flour, a far healthier choice than most other gluten free cookies that have zero nutrition to offer.  Not health food by any means, but a tasty treat.  Individually wrapped is great as well.

review/summary: What did I just spend my money on???
review/text: Ok, maybe I have just been spoiled by some gluten free cookies, I dont know but these were terrible.  I mean they were so dry and had no flavor at all.  For only 5 grams of sugar in two cookies I should have known but I at least thought that they would have some kind of flavor from the quinao and chocolate chips.  They claim to have a nutty flavor but I did not detect that at all, they tasted like a a bunch of raw flours mixed together with a few chocolate chips scattered about. At 6 bucks a box at my local health food store I feel as though I have been ripped off.  There are far better gluten free cookies out there, and you could make them better yourself as well.  I ate one and was just so let down, I really wanted to like them.  I ended up eating another one because I wanted to make sure that they really did taste terrible, and I was right.  The second cookie prooved just as bad as the first one. 140 calories in two cookies and they are a bit bigger then a silver dollar.  I have to say though that I  love how they are individually packaged and also the packaging that they are in are recyclable. If you like a dry flavorless cookie then this would be your thing.  I dont know what I will do with the rest of them, maybe wash them down with some almond milk or put them into a vegan parfait of some sort.  Or I could give them to people I dislike so they will have a horrible cookie experience.  Cookies should put a smile on your face and make your tummy happy but these just about choked me to death from how dry they were.  I would suggest that you look around your local health food store and buy one box just to give them a try but only if you have money to throw away. I would suggest any of the cookies by "Enjoy Life Soft Baked Cookies" Now those are some amazing gluten free cookies.

review/text: I spent an hour one day tasting a variety of expensive olive oils at the St. Lawrence Market in Toronto and came home with something very pricy that tasted like car grease.  The following day in exasperation I just hauled something off the shelf at our local supermarket and it turned out to be fantastic.  Masserie di Sant'Eramo (the "flavourful" kind, not the "delicate" version) always gets compliments and it's very difficult to find; no other supermarket in Toronto or where we live now on the west coast has it, at least to my knowledge.  I was delighted to find that it's available through Amazon since I had given up hope of finding it anywhere other than at Loblaws in Toronto.  Strongly recommended!

review/text: I've been using Masserie Flavorful Extra Virgin Olive Oil for well over a year. I can dribble a little of it over almost anything (except dessert) to add a lovely flavor. Even though one isn't supposed to waste good olive oil on cooking, I do cook with it and find it does nice things to vegetables and fish. It's good in place of butter on toast. Since olive oil is heart healthy and this one is not overly expensive, I probably use it more than anything else in my kitchen.<br />It is hard to find, so I'm delighted that Amazon makes it available.

I have always loved Caribou's coffees WAY over Starbuck's (Starbuck's is AWESOME for growing roses, however), and this one is just perfect for us.  It's not overdone, just a smooth, rich blend of some of the most awesome beans available.  If you put your nose close enough to your Keurig, this one is a delight to smell after you pull down the handle and it pierces the top. Ahhhhh!  SO LOVE this stuff, highly highly recommend!

review/summary: I don't have to travel to Minnesota
review/text: The best coffeehouse in the USA is Caribou Coffee. That's just an opinion, but an opinion I'd challenge anyone to test. When I go to the Mall of the Americas in Minnesota, the first place I stop is the Caribou Coffee shop. I don't like Starbucks coffee at all, and usually look for any alternative.<br />Buying these Caribou coffee pods aren't up to the in house experience, but still enjoyable (not as good as grinding and brewing your own with their blend either). This coffee pod is filled (possibly overfilled) so it's not a wimpy coffee at all. If you're looking for a great strong coffee on the mild side Daybreak may be a good option for you. My best advice is to wait till it's shipped and sold by Amazon for the best price, but if that isn't an option, you may want to get your caffeine fix with an alternative seller.

review/text: This is one of my favorite coffees. I used to buy it ground in bags locally but they stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light and not bitter at all. Beautiful caramel/nutty undertones give it a very nice after taste. I just wish this wasn't as expensive. I've recently been hooked on Tully's Kona Blend because I can get it locally at reasonable prices.

BY AFTERNOON I JUST USE 1 K CUP AT 8 OZ OF WATER FOR MY AFTERNOON COFFEE BREAK. IT IS SO HARD TO FIND LIGHT ROAST COFFEE. THE MEDIUM AND DARK ROAST COFFEES LEAVE A BITTER AFTERTASTE.

review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for almost 2 years now. I've tried tons of k-cups from companies including Green Mountain, Timothy's, Folgers's, Coffee People, Gloria Jean's, etc. This is by far the best coffee I've found. I normally brew on the larger cup size (9.25 oz) and it is the ideal cup of coffee. Not too strong, not too weak. The aftertaste is pleasant and not bitter. I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone and everyone.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup coffee
review/text: Taste is a personal choice and I prefer light roast coffees. My favorite brand is Peets, but until Peets gets into the K-Cup market this will have to do. This brew is light and not bitter, however I do detect a slight, stale flavor. However this stale flavor is common in nearly all ground coffee, including the tail end of a bag of my beloved Peets coffee. I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk. This has happened when I run out of milk (cow, soy or almond) and I just don't feel like using aspartame (Nutrasweet).

review/text: My current preference in coffees is more towards milder brews...especially at the start of a day. Daybreak morning blend gives me what I need in that first morning coffee: a definitive coffee taste, the caffeine kickstart, and the reassuring coffee smell that lets you know another day has started...<br /><br />It does so without being overpowering or bitter. I also enjoy this in the evening while reading, watching TV or sitting around and talking. You get what you need from a cup, but in moderation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for your K-Cup rotation of flavors...

review/text: I bought my wife a Keurig machine a year ago and we've tried a lot of cases of coffees, teas, apple cider, hot chocolate... you name it and we've probably tried it.<br /><br />So far, this is one of our all time favorite coffees.  It's rich, has a wonderful aroma, and it's flavorful without being bitter.<br /><br />It's a little stronger than Coffee People Donut Shop but just about that same type of coffee.  We love them both as do many of our guests and visitors.

review/summary: grounds in the coffee
review/text: the coffee tastes good when there aren't grounds in the coffee. i thought first time i made the mistake somehow...i don't know how since you just plop the kcup in the machine, but now it's happened for like 1/2 the kcups...it's terrible and a waste. this has never happened with other ones. i have other ones from different companies and it never happens, just with these caribou daybreak morning blend ones. :(

review/summary: Best coffee we have found
review/text: My fiance and I dont seem to like the dark roast coffees and medium roast k cups (except for the Dunkin Donuts one) that much so when we say this at the grocery store and saw that it was a  light blend that we hadn't tried yet we figured why not. We are glad we did.<br /><br />This coffee smells so good when it is brewing so we knew that was a good sign when we made it later that night after we got home shopping. Then we tried it and basically fell in love with it and don't drink anything else now in the mornings. We do have an iced coffee that is different on the weekend but that's another review.<br /><br />I highly recomend this coffee to anyone who like us feels that the bold and medium roasts are just too strong. This isn't at all and is just an all around very good tasting coffee.

review/summary: Wife loves it, too mild for me
review/text: My wife loves this Caribou Daybreak blend, I don't because it is too wussy! I know, a strange word to describe coffee but it has NO kick at all! At the other end of the spectrum, I also don't like espresso blends because they are too strong. I suspect this blend might be good for iced coffee, though.

review/text: The Caribou Daybreak k-cups are my favorite blend so far. They taste great and aren't too strong. I typically use the travel mug setting and drink it black, but it still tastes great using smaller cup settings. I find that a lot of other k-cups taste a little too strong, but these are very good!

review/summary: Shipping not as promised
review/text: The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!

review/text: Aroma-4<br />Great nutty smell that will be pleasing in the morning.<br /><br />Sweetness-3<br />There is defiantly a sweetness to the coffee that lasts the entire cup.<br /><br />Acidity-4<br />This is a light roast with near medium roast flavor. A nutty taste is the most surprising, pleasantly so, aspect of the flavor as it's not commonly this strong in a coffee so lightly roasted.<br /><br />Body-3<br />Good body for a seemingly very light roast. Not watery but not full out creamy.<br /><br />Bitterness- 5<br />This is a very smooth coffee, no overpowering bitterness.<br /><br />Aftertaste- 4<br />It leaves an after taste of a darker roast, but not harsh and bitter. It's a pleasant reminder of the coffee.....until the next cup.<br /><br />Overall: 89 (out of a possible 100)<br /><br />Scoring Summary:<br />(90-99) Very Awesome Coffee<br />(85-89) Very Good Coffee<br />(78-84) Just Average Coffee<br />(50-77) Just Poor Coffee

review/text: I had ordered the sweet and sour Charms before and was very happy with them.  So I was very disappointed when the sweet pops arrived.  A large amount of them were not only broken but shattered.  Also, all but about 10 of them where cherry.  Don't get me wrong, I like cherry.  But other flavors were supposed to be in there.  I only got one watermelon and one blue raspberry.  I will not be ordering from this company again.
