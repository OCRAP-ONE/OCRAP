review/text: This little surf-board shaped crackers are perfect for baby.  Our daughter started eating them at 5 months (on advice from pediatrician).  After she figured out how to get the cracker in her mouth, she loved them.  You don't need teeth as baby can suck on it and it dissolves quickly.  Now she is 10 months old and stil loves them.

review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: My son is 7mo and has has 4 teeth already.<br /><br />I thought these would help with teething but when I gave them to him, he put it in his mouth, bit off a huge chunk and then proceeded to gag on the huge chunk (it doesn't melt as fast as needed I guess).  I had to reach into his mouth and grab it.<br /><br />These aren't biscuits--they're more like airy wafers that take almost zero effort to break apart.<br /><br />Although it won't crumble into smaller pieces that your child could choke on, you still have to be worried about the possibility of having your child bite off a mouthfull size and then have it get stuck.

review/summary: LOVE THESE!!
review/text: I originally got these for my son because we went to the store and I had forgotten his pacifier.  He was getting fussy and I thought these would distract him.  They definitely did the trick!  He was able to hold the rice rusk in his hand and take bites. He was 11 months old at the time.  I probably could have given them to him when he was younger. He did have crumbs on him but they were white so they wouldn't stain and they could brush off easily.  I love to pass these to him when in the car, shopping etc.  It is the easiest snack of all the snacks that we have tried.  We've tried several differnet flavors and so far he likes them all.  I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Great product! Especially if you are avoiding gluten!
review/text: Since gluten intolerance runs in my family, I have decided not to give my baby any gluten for her first year. I found this product because of that desire. I tried the original flavor first, then the banana, my baby loved both, especially the banana. They are great because they dissolve in the mouth, so you can give them to a baby that is a little younger and not have to worry. She makes a bit of a mess, but since when does anything involving baby feeding clean? I love these and so does my little Autumn!

review/text: My daughter LOVES these treats.  My sister in law had given me half a box because my nephew was too big and eating other snacks.  I had to run out to buy more because she absolutely loves them.  My baby is 9 months now, and these have really helped with her learning to chew larger bites of food.  They melt in the mouth a little so you don't have to worry about choking.  They have a great banana flavor that is not too sweet.  I could not find these in my supermarket and the price here is better than target, especially if you use the subscribe and save!

review/summary: My Babies LOVE These!
review/text: I bought Mum-Mums for my (now) 6 yr old daughter when she was an infant, and I buy them by the case from Amazon for my twin 9-month olds now.  They have been eating them since they were about 5-6 months old.  THEY LOVE THESE.  We just bought the Banana Flavor for the first time.  When they see the box, they get so excited.<br />One of the great things about Mum-Mums are that they are not messy.  You can give them to them in a stroller, or in a shopping cart, or carseat, and there is no mess.  They melt so quickly - great for babies without teeth.<br />The few stores that carry Mum-Mums are always out of stock of the Infant ones, so I have resorted to buying them buy the case on Amazon, which is actually a better price, and I never have to worry that the store will be out of them.<br /><br />I noticed that one reviewer gave these a bad rating because they are a product of China, and not Australia as the Product Description says.  I am pretty sure that all the Hot Kid products come from China, not sure why it says Australia, but I wouldn't let that deter you from purchasing.

review/summary: A staple for gluten-free kitchens
review/text: This is the rice flour for gluten-free cooking.  Unlike other rice flours, the super-fine grind is not gritty so baked goods can have the same smooth finish as those made from wheat flours.  If tightly wrapped, it keeps indefinitely in the freezer so one can afford to buy it in bulk.  I also highly recommend Authentic Foods' superfine brown rice flour and gluten-free flour blend.  My wheat-eating husband says the cinnamon rolls I baked with it are the best he's ever eaten, wheat or no wheat, gluten or no gluten.  If you've been disappointed with other brands, as we were, you really should try this.

review/text: I still remember the first time I made GF chocolate chip cookies from this flour...they rose, they looked amazing, and for the first time in our allergen-free diet, they had the texture of traditional baked goods...I was sold!<br /><br />I love this flour, (and here's the soapbox) but I just don't understand the extremely high shipping cost.  I requested it at Whole Foods and was told they stopped carrying it/ordering it because of the shipping cost.  I don't know much about those things, but I do know it arrives in a box, no special packing (sometimes a bit battered and beaten up), standard shipping.  I've checked out the weight on some shipping sites, and even factoring that in, the shipping cost is high.  I really wish they would lower it so I could afford to buy this amazing product more!<br /><br />P.S. After filing this review, I received a $2.75 refund for shipping costs!  Woo hoo!  Thank you Authentic Foods!

review/summary: the only chamomile tea i'll drink
review/text: I'm so glad I decided to try this tea. As a child my mother bought chamomile tea often and I tried drinking it several times throughout the years, hating it every time. THEN, I tried Numi Sweet Meadows(that's what this tea is now called) and WOW, I liked it. Actually, I loved it! It has a sweet lemony taste that keeps the chamomile from being overwhelming. It's easy to drink and is very relaxing. As far as price, which I noticed some other reviewers complaining about, I think it's worth it if you know anything about Numi. They use organic ingredients, recycled materials for packaging, and their tea bags are made from natural fibers. They're committed to being a green company and I'm willing to pay extra to support that! You get what you pay for.

review/summary: A lovely but pricy herbal tea
review/text: I first tried this tea recently and enjoyed it very much, finding that it had the unexpected bonus of settling my stomach. The flavor is light and herbal, and you can use each tea bag at least twice for a satisfactory cup. The only thing that holds me back is the price- I wonder if it is the lemon Myrtle (I believe an herb from Australia that made its American debut in this tea) or just the high price of organic herbs. Traditional Medicinals also has an organic chamomile tea (single herb) that costs a little less, if this is a concern. Personally, I wish Numi would offer a large, reasonably priced box of their assorted herbal teas through Amazon Grocery because although I would like to order multiple boxes of this tea, six boxes is quite a lot of one flavor. However, I can recommend this tea flavor for anyone who enjoys chamomile tea, and I do think the lemon myrtle adds an nice touch.

review/summary: Just put some cinnamon in your coffee
review/text: Not a favorite of mine, but I don't really like cinnamon in my coffee.  I purchased a Donut House variety pack and this came in the box.  Friends of mine who do like cinnamon in their coffee have tried it and thought it was good.  The coffee brews a bit weak, as well.  I do love the regular Donut House flavor, as well as the Chocolate Glazed Donut (yum!).  Overall, I think people that like a light brewed cinnamon coffee would love this.

review/summary: Not bad coffee. Horrible price
review/text: Let me start off with the coffee itself which is pretty good. I will say that these coffee's (green mountain and such) have really huge swings. I've bought cases that were wonderful and the next will have a burnt aftertase or be noticably weaker in comparison so realize that these reviews may be reflective of the wild inconsistant nature of the brand...<br /><br />Now for the major point; 1.04 a cup!? I know K's have gone up quite a bit recently but not that much geez. This brand is a staple at "Bed Bath & Beyond" so you know and is 10.99 up from 9.99 for a box of 18, which is .61 a cup. But hey if ya don't wanna leave the house go for it. Oh wait you can order if from them online as well... oh well I tried gimme my star back.

review/summary: Seriously Delicious!
review/text: I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I'm writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a "soft" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!

review/text: This is a Light Roast coffee with only a faint cinnamon like flavor. I brewed this In my B40 at the 7.20oz mug size. Adding a sugar substitute and liquid creamer and it created a mellow flavor with at best a very slight cinnamon flavor. I was expecting more. I will try this coffee at the larger 9.25 mug size and report back.<br /><br />I brewed a cup at the larger 9.25oz lever and still no real desirable cinnamon flavor. But as a light roast coffee alone, it has a nice smooth flavor with low acidity; just wished they'd would have put just a tad more cinnamon in it

review/text: As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you.

review/summary: Total misrepresentation as far as flavor is concerned
review/text: This is the first time I have taken the time to review something on Amazon.  This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is cinnamon roll flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of cinnamon roll while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no cinnamon roll flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad "Chocolate Glazed Donut", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another "flavored" coffee.

review/text: This is one of my favorite coffee flavors. It's delicious. Great cinnamony flavor. I dont understand how other reviewers say there isnt enough flavor. Maybe they're brewing too big a cup ( too much water ) for their taste ? All I can say is I use a pretty big mug and I taste lots of flavor. I would have to say its all about personal preferences and what you're used to. I also dont get how some others say they dont taste cinnamon roll flavor, thats all I taste ! I love flavored coffee's but I also like dark bold coffee's, but if dark bold is all you like then this one probably wouldnt be the one for you as it's not a dark roast. Another reviewer compared this to Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry k-Cups....there's no comparison in my opinion, this Cinnamon Roll is much better. More cinnamon roll flavor and not as acidic tasting as the Timothy's. I highly recommend this flavor. My whole family loves it as well.

review/summary: More like essence of Cinnamon then Cinnamon Roll
review/text: I don't like coffee and this K-Cup is one of the reasons why. It doesn't taste anything at all like a Cinnamon Roll. I need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it.  It kind of reminds me of taking medication. I only bought this coffee because I am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all I can have in the morning. Maybe it is because I can't have any creamer, but just adding Truvia doesn't help the taste of this coffee. With that said if you love chocolate then you will LOVE Donut House Chocolate Glaze Donut Flavored coffee (with a couple packs of Truvia it taste like eating a Chocolate Glaze donut) and Donut Shop Coconut Mocha (OMG...this taste exactly like Hershey's Mound Candy Bar...I feel guilty drinking it, LOL).

Otherwise, it kind of tasted like bad coffee with a hint of dirt. I tired it on all the settings, too - 6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz, and they were all terrible. I won't try this flavor again, or other novel flavors by Green Mountain.

review/text: I usually drink light roast and sometimes medium roast. This coffee seemed very bland to me. Not only is the cinnamon weak, there is not much coffee flavor.

review/summary: Just the right touch of sweet
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig and have been very disappointed the the availability of different types of coffee in my local stores, so I came to Amazon. The Cinnamon Roll coffee is AMAZING! Just enough cinnamon to make it different but not to take away from the reason I drink coffee- the flavor. I can see myself keeping this one in stock.

review/summary: Smells and Tastes exactly what they say. The flavor is subtle and elegant.
review/text: The flavor and smell doesn't so much as hit you over the head, but elicits an emotional response through one's olfactory senses. Brewing the coffee creates the warmth and smell of a donut shop on a cold's winter morning. Mind you, this is not for those who are looking to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer of donuts. The flavor is subtle and elegant. It's flavored coffee - not a Latte, Cappacino, etc..

review/summary: This flavor is "Ok" but it tastes and smells more like Gingerbread than Cinnamon Roll
review/text: When I brewed a cup of this coffee, I had my husband smell it (without knowing what kind it was) and he said it smelled like Gingerbread.  This definitely tastes like Gingerbread coffee, not Cinnamon Roll and I would say the flavor is "Ok" but not great.  I would not recommend this.

review/text: I like my coffee strong.  At 6 oz water brew it is on the slight side of strong.  I must say it does taste very nice- smooth flavor- but if I close my eyes and try VERY hard I do  detect the slightest (and very distant) taste of cinnamon.  My friend could not tell me it had cinnamon in it when she had a cup.  Could it be that the flavor is only in some of the K cups? Simply, a nice cup of coffee (average to good).

review/text: It actually has a mild taste of a cinnamon roll!  I was somewhat skeptical but the product managed to deliver as advertised.  The cinnamon taste is not overpowering and there is even a slightly unctuous buttery taste just as one would get from a real roll.  I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Cinnamon Roll?! Are you kidding me?
review/text: Yeah, NO. A big no to this one. After enjoying Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry k-Cups for some time, I decided to venture out and try a new cinnamon k-cup. Big mistake! This sucks so hard it's not even funny. There is absolutely no cinnamon here! It's like drinking burnt gas station coffee where you start hating yourself more with every sip, but for some reason you just don't stop. I usually add a little bit of half and half to my coffee and nothing else. Welp, not even half and half PLUS a packet of stevia could save this mess. Tell you what, go love yourself by not buying these hot messes of crap. Try Timothy's instead.

review/summary: Nice, But Expecting More Flavor
review/text: This is a light roast coffee, so if you are used to the larger brew size, you may want to reconsider.  The cinnamon roll taste is subtle, and leaves no aftertaste as some flavored blends do.  With creamer and sweetening, it is a nice brew with a great aroma.  Just don't close your eyes and expect a tasty cinnamon roll in your mind.<br /><br />Worth it, but with the right expectations.

review/summary: Like it but pricey
review/text: This product has a hint of cinnamon in it but not what you would expect by the title. It adds a little step up from regular coffee k cups but for the price I would expect more flavor. I personally would rather by regular green mountain k cups and add flavored creamer to it to get the real full affect of cinnamon roll.

review/summary: Smells great and that's about it...
review/text: I had never realized how popular Dunkin' Donuts coffee was until I saw all these "donut" k-cup coffee clones.  I've tried Dunkin Donuts, Donut Shoppe and Donut House varieties.  The Donut House flavor is the mildest/smoothest of the 3 with a muted bitter aftertaste and, of the 3, I like it the least.  The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a "cinnamon roll" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.  It did make for a stronger coffee taste but the flavor tasted the same, maybe slightly more bitter.<br /><br />It's not a bad coffee, and I kinda like the milder flavor for evening drinking but if I get it again, I'll stick with the Donut House plain flavor.

I wish I had read and believed the 1 star reviews!<br />So disappointed - and the odd thing is - my dad smoked a pipe when I was young, used cherry tobacco - and this tastes like this pipe used to smell!<br />Now I'm stuck with a whole box - so what I do is brew some really strong coffee and then add this to it. It's not spectacular - but at least I don't feel like I've wasted all my money!

review/summary: Iced Please
review/text: I like flavored coffee and when I first brewed this, I was disappointed by the lack of cinnamon flavor. It was too little/weak. As a regular hot cup of coffee, this k-cup fell short of my expectations. But brewed and set aside to cool and then adding ice made this cup of joe much more delicious. The cinnamon flavoring really comes out. If you also felt this coffee was at first "meh", I would recommend trying it over ice and hopefully, it will become "yum" to you too.

review/summary: Very good Coffee, but not quite the same as a Donut shop
review/text: This makes a very good cup of coffee.  Not bad when you consider the price of the K-cup.  But I could not rate this a five star just for several reasons. First it is not quite as strong as a good donut shop coffee should be, the cinnamon taste needs to be a little more flavorful, and makes a great cup if you do not use the largest cup feature on the coffee maker.
