review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I found this in June at walmart, I didn't know that anyone actually sold this drink or the name Arnold Palmer, a coworker started me drinking half tea--half lemonade when we would go out for lunch.  This version is soo good.  When I saw it again I was afraid to buy it because it had "lite" on the bottle and I hate the way diet drinks tastes so I only bought one.  When I got home on let it chill in the fridge and drank it with dinner that night I knew that it was the same one that I had at walmart.  I looked online and found its a blend of real sugar with splenda.  You cannot taste the splenda at all...this is such a brilliant idea for those who want lower calories and lower sugar in a beverage without sacrificing taste.  I found these in gallon size at walmart and I bought every one they had because right now its really hard to find this drink.

review/summary: Thank you Posh Salt Co for great customer service
review/text: I ordered a the salt cooking slab as a gift for my son, and included was a little blue draw string salt sampler in a tiny glass that was totally crushed/broken.  When I mentioned this to Posh Salt, they sent me another one in the mail unexpectedly.  That was a very nice and unexpected gesture of great customer service.<br />My son enjoys the 8x8 salt block to cook upon, just as the directions indicate, and the food tastes incredible!  It will work in the oven in the house, but is so much better on the covered grill outside.  Just make sure you thoroughly heat it slowly, no salting of the meat needed!  Enjoy...

review/summary: With guests or family..  a fun way to gather together for mealtime.
review/text: We heat it in the oven at 500 degrees for half an hour and then we place it in the center of the table. We gather round and put our own chosen beef, scallops, shrimp or chicken on it to quicly cook.  Of course, you would have to be old enough to understand it is hot enough to seriously burn you if you were to touch it so young children should not be allowed near it.  I find that thick Beef has to be prepared as thin strips or smaller pieces to be well done. It cleans up easy after it cools: just wipe it with a warm cloth of water and a little lemon juice and let it dry. The size slab you buy depends on the amount of food you want cooked at the same time.  We love it.

review/text: I gave it a two. If your food has liquid contents, it makes it too salty.<br />I heated it in the oven and on the stove top as directed and placed food<br />on it as I saw on the picture. It did not cook it thoroughly. Maybe its<br />me, but it is bothersome and a waste of time. I have it wrapped and put<br />away in the pantry. I lost money on this item. Save your money.

review/summary: Saved my cat's life twice?
review/text: About 6 months ago, I found out that my kitty has kidney disease. He was extremely ill, and I was planning on putting him down if he got any worse. About that time, I got a few different cans of Friskies food. He liked the Senior Meaty Bits best, and would eat almost a can a day. He made an almost full recovery very quickly.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and my kitty gets very sick again. He's worse this time, has trouble walking, and won't eat anything consistently, which makes the disease even worse. I was actually planning on where he would be buried. I tried to feed him meaty bits, and he absolutely loved it, but he would just lick off the gravy. I decided to try putting it through the food processor, and sure enough he gobbled it all down. I guess the meaty bits were too hard for him to chew in his weakened state.<br /><br />Now it is the only food he will eat consistently, and he begs for it. I know it is meant to help with urinary infections, but I wonder if it helps with kidneys too. I am so relieved to have found my product, and I hope my kitty will be eating it for years to come.

review/summary: Solved my cat's urinary problems
review/text: At about 3 years of age, our cat would have bladder infections several times a year (straining at the litter, staying there for 5 min+ at a time, only a little urine and it was blood-tinged).  We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food.  After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general.  For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection!  Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.

It doesn't always happen, but in this shipment it was the case.  It's not due to the packaging, as they were very well packaged. They apparently choose dented cans and as these cost more than in the supermarket, I don't appreciate it.

I shop their sales and purchase by the cases, I buy the ones that say Super Saver and get free shipping right to my door. What was once getting very hard for me is now made possible again. My cats love all the flavors and have a huge selection to choose from. The packages are easy to open and so are the cans. I wish the meat and gravy ones could come in bigger cans but I can't complain just smile and open 24-40 cans a day.Thanks Amazon and Friskies for making me part of your family  :)

Product received was in small chunks not the spears shown in the picture.  The sugar coating is the major taste here with just some cantelope coming through.  If the product was in spears the sugar coating would not have been as overwhelming.

review/text: This is pretty dang good chili. You get a suprisingly generous serving. I mixed mine with a serving of Dreamfield elbow macaroni to make some chili-mac and I ended up with a fairly large plateful. Best of all, it was ony 9 net carbs and maybe 20 with a salad on the side. How often is the main course lower carb than the side salad?  There is also a chicken version available. It has 5 net grams of carb.<br /><br />I ordered a bunch from a different but fairly reputable nutrition website. It was $1.30 cheaper per box and shipping for 24 boxes was under $5.<br /><br />I don't see how anyone would expect to ever be able to sell this at this price and with shipping nearly twice the price of the product. At least the shipping doesn't multiply drastically as the quantity increases. Good luck to them though. It's a fine product.

review/summary: Tasty Low Carb Chili
review/text: First, let's be clear.  There is a big difference between fresh, home-cooked chili and that from a can.  In the category of canned chili I like Dennison's best.  This Homestyle's brand is thinner and a little more bland than Dennison's but I like it and I will continue to buy it.  Based on taste alone I would have given it 4 stars when compared to Dennison's but the 4g of Net Carbs gave it the extra star for me.  (Compare that to 54g Net Carbs in a 2-serving can of Dennison's Chili Con Carne with Beans.)<br /><br />I have a low carb lifestyle and I lost 70 pounds in 10 months living this way.  I drove by a Wienerschnitzel a few days ago and got a craving for a chili cheese dog.  I almost went in but made a choice to stick to my low carb lifestyle.  As soon as I got home I Googled "low carb chili" and found this Homestyles brand.  When it arrived I made my own chili cheese dog (without the bread) and it was great.  I highly recommend this to anyone cutting their carbs.

review/summary: Would be better without the salt
review/text: I love vinegar, and vinegar flavored foods.  I was looking forward to enjoying fries (chips) and other foods with the great vinegar flavor w/o getting them mushy using actual malt vinegar, but I can't add too much of the powdered malt salt w/o the dishes getting too much salt.  Basically, if you're making the foods at home, or can order them with no salt added, it's about perfect, but if you were to add them to, say, McDonalds fries, they become too salty.<br /><br />There are other reviews pointing out the salt component isn't very large, but any amount is too much for me.  I wished they'd offered just the powdered vinegar, which I can only seem to find in bulk.  Having said that, it's still a good product, esp if you can get around the salt issue, like by cooking your own food.

Even before dinner.<br />These cookies are good heated or at room temp.<br />Recommended for holidays, parties, refreshments.<br /><br />Amazon seriously needs to get the oatmeal raisin version of this cookie in stock immediately!!!

review/summary: Ginger-riffic
review/text: I first had it in a beer at a PF Chang's restaurant several years. It was such an unusual and different flavor, that I had to find out what it was. After some digging around on the web, I found the maker/distributor. I contacted him directly and had two bottles shipped to me. I only ever used it in cheap light beer (Bud Select) to dress it up a bit. It brings even the cheapest of beer to life. A little goes a long way so a bottle should last you a long time. I'm really glad to see this more readily available now. I only wish I could get it at my local liquor store or grocer so I wouldn't have to pay shipping.

review/summary: Great Customer Service! Fun to Try!
review/text: I ordered 30 of these little guys for a backyard party at my house. Ethan was really great about getting these to me exactly a day before my party so they wouldn't spoil. The price is great for fresh miracle fruit, which is hard to find online.<br />The experience turned out to be pretty unique. Everyone ate the fruit at the same time and then had fun trying a smorgasbord of fruit, veggies, chips, etc. These things really work: wine started to taste like syrup, lemons were sweet, bitter beer tasted smooth. Maybe it was all the hype surrounding these things in the media, but I didn't think they changed the taste of food THAT much. Especially not enough to warrant the kind of reaction I saw from some people on TV. And they lasted about 30 minutes, so take note: order double for guests if you're having a party. All in all, it was definitely a fun time, just don't expect it to be an over the top experience.

review/summary: Top Notch - Great Product, Wonderful Experience, Excellent Vendor
review/text: Ethan's Garden is an excellent vendor.  I received an e-mail shortly after my Amazon order confirming that I would be available to pick up the package as soon as it arrived so that we could tweak the shipping date if I wasn't able to be there.<br /><br />The berries arrived the next day with very clear and informative instructions.  We followed the advice for storing them and tried them out with an assortment of food the following day.  What a fun experience!<br /><br />Here's what we found:<br /><br />- Grapefruits are absolutely amazing.  They win in my book for "best improved taste."<br />- Both lemons and limes are bright and sweet, without the pucker face!<br />- Radishes are reduced to the taste of a "dense" water chestnut, with no "bite."<br />- Yellow onions taste like sweeter onions, but don't sting the tongue.  They did affect my nasal passages, however. :)<br />- Salsa tastes bizarre.  The tomatoes come out extremely sweet and "take over" for the other notes in the salsa.<br />- Beer tastes less bitter and tequila tastes less pungent.  Because the berries alter the tongue, you still get the raw effects of alcohol on your throat, etc.<br />- Pickles tasted fruitier.<br />- Tabasco sauce tasted sweet and less hot.  Similar with alcohol -- you still know you're consuming something harsh!<br />- Raw sugar tasted like ... weird sugar.  Maybe smoother.  Hard to explain.  :)<br />- The berries themselves didn't cause any reaction or stomach discomfort for us.  However, beware of the odd mixture of foods you try, your belly might not like such a harsh combination of acids. :)<br /><br />Here's what we recommend:<br /><br />- The berries are actually very tiny (maybe the size of a large raisin), and you definitely want to be delicate when pullling the pulp off of the large (in proportion) seeds.<br />- Use Granny Smith apples as a "palate cleanser" between trying different things.  We also tried tortilla chips, but that seemed to alter the flavors a bit.<br /><br />Great vendor and great experience.  Thanks, Ethan's Garden!

Great price per berry couldn't find any better price (located in the U.S. too)and with my shipment there was actually few more berries than I ordered.

review/summary: Fruits are amazing, service is great!
review/text: I ordered, asking the fruits to be delivered four days later, and Ethan's Garden confirmed this quickly over email. The fruits arrived at the right time and in mint condition...I mean berry condition. They were of great quality and came with tasting suggestions and planting instructions. The berries are said to go bad after a few days, but they also come with freezing instructions.<br /><br />I did get conflicting shipping information from Amazon after placing my order, but it all happened just like the description said it would, and the delivery was made on the right day. Shipping was already included in the price.<br /><br />You might balk at the price, but assuming the berries truly go bad so quickly, if you want fresh berries, you're going to have to pay for overnight shipping, so it's definitely worth it. And I was very satisifed with the overall level of service from Ethan's Garden. If you want to order miracle fruit online, I doubt anyone could do it better!

review/text: Feeding an addiction to ginger/honey tea and chocolate over the last 3 years has lead to a severe overgrowth of candidias (yeast)throughout my system.  Hence at present I've undertaken a serious change of diet to kill off as much as possible. I purchased fresh MIRACLE BERRIES to help with the sweet cravings.  I'm thanking my Creator for such a berry.  It really works.  And Ethan Gardens is a fantastic vendor to do business with. So helpful, and quick and ready to accomodate. I also purchased the tablets, but of course the fresh berries were much more to the point. I've also purchased seeds to grow and look forward to the good results this summer.

review/text: Ethan was really great about getting the berries to us on time for the party. I also called him with some questions before I ordered and he was very helpful and easy to talk to. If you are going to order some miracle berries I would definitely get them from him.<br /><br />The miracle berries are awesome. I suggest eating them the day you get them or the day after. I ate them the day I got them and it the effect lasted for at least two hours. I tried them again a day later and it only lasted for about 45 minutes which is plenty of time to taste. Some friends tried the berries 2 days after we got them and the berries had little effect after that amount of time. They said it didn't last more than 10 min.<br /><br />This is a really fun idea for a party. And Ethan's Gardens is the place to get them!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: First off, email Ethan's Garden the specific date you want your miracle fruit to arrive.  The berries don't have a very long shelf life, although it can be extended in the fridge or freezer.  I hadn't used all the berries until a week after I received them, and by then they seemed to lose a little potency, but I only kept them in cold storage some of the time.<br /><br />I had these for a party, and it was a great experience.  I've had miracle fruit (berries and tablets) before, and I suspect that the effect lasts longer if the surface of the tongue is disturbed less.  The faster you eat things, the faster the effect seemed to wear off, so take your time and enjoy it for the upper part of the 30 minute - 2 hour range.<br /><br />Also definitely better than the tablets.

We had a bit of trouble with the shipping and so when we received our first batch, there were a few spoiled fruit. I contacted Ethan and said that we were interested in purchasing another batch, but explained to him the issue we had with the first order. He immediately said that he would give us 10 free miracle fruit in addition to the 15 in the order already. Again, trying the fruit is great fun and Ethan is definitely the guy from which to get them.

I needed the berries on really short notice and Ethan was able to get them to me on time, for a very generous price. Imagine getting the type of service that you want to tell everyone about; this is the service Ethan gave me. There was no part in the transaction that was difficult, barring the complicated amazon storefront where it is hard for me to leave him great feedback. Although I could go on, I think it is sufficient to say that there is no vendor I would rather do business with.

I had about 10 people over and we tried different fruits, vegetables, drinks, and sauces. The things that tasted especially sweet were lemons, limes, rhubarb, tomatoes, strawberries. My friend and I had the exact same qoute after eating strawberries "That's the best damn strawberry I've ever had." Didn't make too much of a difference in blueberries or on beer for me. Definiely a fun experience."

review/text: These berries were a great time for myself and my boyfriend [who is an executive chef]. We found that the best things to eat after eating the berries were vinegars [white wine, apple cider, balsamic] hot sauce, limes, and grapefruit! We had to eat  several berries though to keep achieving the taste changes as we were overloading out taste buds trying so many items but I received several extras so that was no issue. The only complaint for me was I have a heightened sense of smell so it was not as drastic of a change for me taste wise as my sense of smell was still smelling things normally. Still worth the money and we plan on using the berries again in the future!

review/summary: excellent almonds--but they do have fat
review/text: Diamond Harvest Reserve Whole Almonds are some of the best almonds out there! These come in a resealable bag so you can keep them fresh after you've used some for a recipe or eaten a portion; and they're at their best until the expiration date printed on the rear of the package. In addition, keep these refrigerated so that they stay fresh as long as possible.<br /><br />Almonds contain fat; in fact 140 of each 170 calorie serving comes from fat. On the brighter side, there are no trans fats, no cholesterol and no sodium. The lack of sodium is important since some companies package their almonds with a fair amount of salt.<br /><br />This product is in contact with the same factory equipment that processes tree nuts or peanuts. If you are allergic to any type of nut, ask your doctor before eating these almonds.<br /><br />The reverse of the package has a recipe for toasting whole almonds; and the company offers customers a website and a mailing address if they have questions about these almonds.<br /><br />Overall, these are excellent, tasty almonds by Diamond Foods. I highly recommend this brand of almonds for people who want almonds to snack on, to cook with or to eat as part of a diet.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Update:<br /><br />This is not the same juice as Florida Natural Premium Juice that comes in the 59oz bottle.  This juice is from concetrated apple juice.  All of the Florida Natural Juices I have bought in the grocery store are fresh pressed from US fruit.<br /><br />I was disappointed with this product.  This juice is okay, but just okay. I gave it 3 stars because of the price and the apples are from South America.  If it had apple concentrate from China, I would not buy it.  This is not anything like the Florida Natural juice I buy at the grocers.<br /><br />The Florida Natural juice in the grocers refridgerated section is the only real apple juice, made in the USA from USA growers, left on the market.  If you know what apple juice is supposed to taste like, you will appreciate this juice and it's fresh apple taste.<br /><br />I have gone back to buying from the local supermarket.  The fresh Florida Natural is absolutely great.  I would not recommend the non-refridgerated juice such as this.

review/text: My husband went to a Seventh Day Adventist boarding school back in the 40s and of course, Choplets were on the menu.  We are not vegetarians but love them as a breakfast side instead of meat or on a bun for lunch. I dredge them in Vigo Italiam Bread Crumbs and lightly fry in a bit of oil. Up until about a year ago we could, at times, buy them at two grocery stores here in Tampa, Fl.  I had never used Amazon before but a friend suggested I look on this site.  What a pleasant surprise to not only find Choplets but find them at about 2/3 the grocery store prices.  Even better, shipping was free.  I have made two other purchases since late Dec. and am looking forward to shopping Amazon for hard to find items in the future.

When I first started ordering them from Amazon about 3 years ago, they were $36.00 for a case of 12. Each time I order, I find that the price has increased. A case is now $70. As a couple of previous posters noted, I too have received many dented cans. At $70 a case, I no longer find dented cans acceptable. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase these. I think this product is absolutely delicious and I have been enjoying them since childhood, but I will not order from Amazon solely based on principle.

My mother's aunt and uncle started the family eating them back in the 1950s or 60s...before I was born anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.<br /><br />After opening the can draining the juice (do not discard), we first flour them, then dip them in egg (egg and water mixed with a whisk) and then bread crumb them.<br /><br />We then fry/brown them in a frying pan with canola oil.<br /><br />I personally don't like them with the juice, but if you don't want the breading crisp, you drain the canola out of the frying pan, place the choplets back into the pan and pour the juice from the can into the skillet.  Let them simmer for a few minutes.<br /><br />Our side dishes are generally noodles or mashed potato.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Mmm Vegetarian Foodstuffs!
review/text: Like with the Linketts I've been eating this stuff since I was a very small child due to my grandparents being vegetarian.  I love almost all of the Loma Linda and Worthington products.  It's too bad I can't order the frozen foods from here as well. ;)<br /><br />To the person who said they can't cover up the taste no matter what they try..  It's not meat.  It was never intended to taste exactly like meat.  Same goes with any of the Worthington and Loma Linda vegetarian foods.  It's a very aquired taste.  I've found that people either like it or they don't, there's no real middle ground.

review/text: I grew up with Choplets.  My mother use to fix them all the time.  She would roll them in flour,lightly brown them on one side with a little butter/veg. oil mix, then flip them over and pour the juice over top. Heat them for just a minute and flip back over.  They are ready to eat.  They remind me of a fried mushroom. For a vegetarian dish these are excellent.

review/summary: What's up with the price?!?
review/text: I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much, that fast, would be laughed out of business. This is is shameful. Get these prices in line, Amazon (or, if Worthington's responsible, get them to get their prices in line or drop the product).<br /><br />As far as the product? It was dropping in quality, anyway. It had gotten much slimier and, simultaneously, a strong grainy taste started overpowering the rest of the flavors (sort of like skunky beer).

review/summary: Great Meat Substitute!
review/text: I have been eating these as a child.  I usually bread and fry these, but they can also be fried without the breading.  They can be cubed and tossed into soups, goulash, etc.  Thinly sliced, they can be eaten cold on salads.  I like them as left-overs, after they have been breaded and fried:  I eat one cold in a sandwich with lettuce, tomato, sprouts, etc.  My kids eat these, too.  They are a good source of protein with dinner.

review/summary: Best Meat Substitute Ever
review/text: I'm a carnivore from the word go but, back in 1972 my Mom found these in a store in MI and fried them up for us. My brothers and I went nuts for them.<br /> Back then they reminded Me of fried Morel mushrooms but the taste is a little different and the texture is  more toothsome. Anyway, I couldn't find them for a long time, then a few years ago I found them at Walmart, who promptly quit carrying them! I was so happy to see Amazon had these and at a reasonable price. They are best coated with your favorite coating and fried for 3-4 min. per side. You can obviously make sandwiches out of them, but I prefer to eat them as a main dish. Highly recommended!

review/text: I grew up loving choplets. My mom dipped them in egg then breadcrumbs & fried in a bit of oil. YUMMY! We couldn't buy them in Nebraska where I grew up, so when we went "back east" every year, she would buy many cans to take home & dole them out over the next year until she could stock up again. I loved them & begged for them as a child, my brother hated them & still hates them. I used to be able to buy them at an Albertson's in TX 10 years ago, but haven't seen them anywhere in years. I am glad I found a source for my comfort food fix! Thanks amazon!

review/text: I have been eating these since I was a kid, growing up in a meat and potatoes house with a mother who was raised Seventh Day Adventist.  They are high in protein and don't need anything fancy to prepare them.  We just heat them up in their own juices in a skillet, serve with mashed potatoes and corn.  My kid loves them.  Maybe they are an aquired taste but definately should be given a chance.

One of the best perks of this product is that they tend to pick up any type of seasoning you put on them. I'm a long distance runner, and choplets helps me curb my craving for too much meat. Overall I would have to say that it is an excellent product. No complaints here!

review/summary: Great Concept, Bad Balance of Flavour
review/text: I saw this on the shelf at the local market and immediately jumped on it, since I love Simply Organic's other spice blends.  The label makes things sound very promising - tomato, onion, garlic, pepper, demerara, cumin, and hickory.  Sounds to me like a great rub for grilling steaks and ribs or even the basis for a quickie sauce if mixed with some vinegar and oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the amount of hickory flavoring in the mix is about 5-10 times as strong as it should be.  You can't really taste any of the other wonderful ingredients, even if they are fairly well rehydrated.  The amount of salt in there is a bit startling, as well.<br /><br />Come to think of it, this blend, though fancy and organic, tastes uncannily like BBQ potato chips.  It's honestly a bit remarkable they managed to reproduce that artificial flavour using all natural ingredients!<br /><br />If you love love love smoky flavour, then grab this and use it to rub down some pork chops before grilling them, but take care you don't use too much, and that you baste with a nice, sweet and spicy sauce afterwards.
