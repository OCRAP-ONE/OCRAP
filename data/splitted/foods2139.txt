review/text: I really like the taste of this dry milk.I use it since I'm lactose intolerant. However, it's really difficult to mix.<br /><br /> i tried a whisk as per the instructions, but finally had to resort to a blender. Other than this drawback, it's really good.

review/summary: Great for cheesemaking and daily use
review/text: I bought this milk for making mozzarella, ricotta, and paneer cheese (which it does very well) and have ended up using it for everything.  I mix up a quart at a time in a blender for daily drinking and add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream.  A hint for mixing:  put 1/2 the water in the blender, add the milk powder and pulse blend a few times before adding the remaining water.  Once blended, it can be very foamy.  Stir cream in with a spoon and allow to sit in the fridge for a day before decanting into a glass bottle.

review/summary: Will never allow myself to run out of this!
review/text: I wanted an alternative to what is disguised as milk in the supermarket but I also don't have much faith in the so-called organic milk they sell either.  I found Bob's Red Mill on Amazon and have never been sorry we tried it.  My family loves this milk, we never run out of milk and it never spoils because it doesn't last that long.  It is a challenge to mix, as someone else stated, but I just use my Magic Bullet with all the powder in the first run and it mixes great.  Whatever is stuck to the sides comes off in the next whirring of filtered water.  Wonderful product.  I have also ordered several other Bob's Red Mill products and I am just as pleased with those.

review/summary: good milk
review/text: Bob's Red Mill powdered non fat milk is far suprior to the supermarket brand.  Perhaps it has more milk solids.<br /><br />I like it.  I prepare a drink with  2/3rds cup of water, 3 tablespoons of powdered milk, 3 tablespoons of no calorie vanilla syrup, and five ice cubes.  Put it in my Hamilton Beech mixer and come up with a thick shake.  Good source of calcium.  My latest bone density test showed an improvement over the one I had done three years ago.  I will continue to purchase this item.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: I had read the reviews, decided to order this despite some other peoples views and I am so glad I did! This doesn't have the horrible smell and taste of the instant powdered milk. This product tastes just like milk, using reverse osmosis water straight out of the tap, room temperature. I have a Vitamix so lumps, dissolving issues that others complained about, were non existent. This milk is so creamy! How can it be non fat and so creamy? It seems creamier than the whole milk I buy. I see some serious yogurt and cheesemaking in my very near future. Buy this, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. I'm going to test this on my teenagers, bet you they can't tell the difference from the $4-$5 gallons of milk I buy daily, either. Thank you Bob!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I tested this milk on my teens, they suggested I add a teaspoon or two of sugar to every gallon. I did, and now they beg me to make it. Very creamy, very good milk with a lot less calories than the red cap milk I normally bought. I was wondering what another reviewer meant when he said there was foam underneath, I know what he meant now  &lt;laughing>.  If I put a higher milk powder to water ratio, it makes terrific cream for my coffee. I ordered this milk to be delivered monthly as well.

review/summary: Good milk, but very fine powder--be prepared
review/text: We get a case of this milk every month, for yogurt making and baking. For yogurt I use it 1:3 with water instead of 1:7 as recommended. We strain the yogurt afterward, but it's already nice and firm when it's first made. The taste is rich and creamy--excellent!<br /><br />Two warnings. This is not instant milk. It's a very fine powder. So don't dump it into a bowl--it will disperse in the air and get everywhere. And when mixing, use vigorous whisking or a blender, as others have said. So measure carefully and gently, and mix well. It's definitely worth it.<br /><br />Second, this milk is not fortified with vitamin D like liquid milk is. Plenty of calcium, but if you are watching your vitamin D, especially in winter here in the dark north land, make sure you have other sources and are getting some sun.<br /><br />Those are the only drawbacks we've found. There isn't much savings over liquid organic milk (if any) at our local prices. But the flavor is great, it doesn't take up room in your fridge, and the shelf life is great.<br /><br />Oh, and if you make your own yogurt and are used to scalding your milk, there is another huge advantage. No scalding. Just mix with 100-110  degree water and some plain yogurt as starter, and you're ready to go. Incubate six hours in a well-insulated container, and you're good to go. As I said, we strain it through cheesecloth afterward, but that's only if you want a more Greek style. Then we blend with maple syrup/fruit syrup, or sugar syrup. Blending gives a very nice, smooth consistency.<br /><br />Without the need for scalding and then cooling the milk, this is a very easy process. We make all our own yogurt now.

review/text: I love this milk!!  Like many others that wrote reviews, I don't use very much milk and was looking for a more economical way of buying it.  This really fits the bill.  I think it tastes great and works well with cereal.<br /><br />Some folks mentioned they had trouble mixing it.  I found using a Tupperware Quick Shake container (holds 2 cups) works well.  I pour in 1 3/4 cups of water and 1/4 cup of powdered milk.  Then all you have to do is give it a quick shake and chill.

review/summary: Great milk, and I am a HUGE MILK DRINKER
review/text: Let me start by saying I am 62 and have been a huge milk lover my entire life and if it were not for the calories I would probably drink a half gallon a day. Maybe that is why I have only had one cavity? Anyway, I know milk is fattening so I have at least restricted myself to skim after gradually going from whole to 2%, to 1%, to 1/2%. But I was still concerned about all the hormones in milk and wanted the added convenience of long term unrefrigerated storage for camping and emergency food supplies. I was skeptical of powdered milk but decided to take a chance with Bob's based on the good reviews here. What a surprise to find that I like this milk BETTER than my store bought skim. It tastes just a tad creamier than skim. Did I say I love this milk? When this 4-pack is gone I am getting on the automatic delivery and figure the cost per quart is going to be 82 cents. So not only is it BETTER than my store bought skim but cheaper and LESS calories still. I mix it in a blender with one cup of warm water for about one minute before adding the rest of the water and blending for an additional 15 secs. Perfect. I do it at night, stick it in the refrigerator and in the morning all the "head" has disappeared and I have cold milk for my cereal. Those complaining about mixing difficulty should just go buy store milk. It is NOT an issue with me. I highly recommend this milk.

review/text: We stopped using non dairy coffee creamer a couple of years ago and started using dry milk instead. I recently decided to try this one as it was 'Bob's'. I read the reviews so when it came, I got out my magic blender. I pour a cup of hot coffee into the blender then the dry milk and give it a whirl. I then add it back into the rest of the coffee pot and stir! It's so frothy and creamy tasting, I'll never go back to instant dry milk again! Now I mix some up and put it in the fridge to use as milk and it's great too!

review/summary: Powdered MOO Juice
review/text: It has been a number of years since I was a real milk drinker. During that time I had sort of switched to evaporated milk for my milk needs. It doesn't go bad in the time it is open and cold or hot cereal without some milk is impossible to choke down. I had tried the dry milk you buy in stores and have found it impossible to choke down even on cereal. All varieties in the store seem to say "Instant" which means they dissolve easily, weigh nothing so they fill up the box, and stink to high heaven even if they age in the bottle after mixed for a few days.<br /><br />I searched in the local stores to find a bag of Bob's milk to try it out, to no avail, so I decided to take the plunge and order from Amazon. The milk comes in the same sized bags as all of Bob's other products -- 4 per case-box. I read one review that said it tasted a lot like fresh cows milk. It has been a long time since I have tasted fresh cows milk, but Bob's milk may taste more like fresh cows milk than the manufactured stuff you buy in the mega-mart. Now you might find that taste offensive, but compared to evaporated milk or even store bought, it isn't all that bad. It does have a slight taste of the evaporation process, but is very drinkable on its own.<br /><br />When I first got the milk I weighed it out, to see about making it in other containers rather than the quarts. I found that it weighs light, meaning a slight half cup really is more suitable for about 750 ml, which is the stainless steel water bottle I mix it in. I add a little water to the bottle, pour in the dry milk, add some more water and shake it up really well, let it rest and shake it again. After each shaking it gets pretty foamy, so once the foam then dissipates I top off the bottle with water.<br /><br />I don't make foo-foo coffee, but it might even work there, again different from store bought milk but no more strange than soy milk, just different.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a real milk product, with a long shelf and pot life, I would recommend Bob's Non-Fat Dry Milk Powder;

review/summary: Good nonfat milk powder
review/text: This is the first time I can remember buying Dry Non-Fat Milk Powder but I thought I'd give it a try considering that a gallon of milk at the grocery store is nearing 4.00.  So after reading the reviews on this one I figured I'd try it.  It mixed well in the blender, I added 1.5 cups of water to 0.5 cup of milk powder, blended it for a little, and then added 2 more cups of water to blend.  It came out fine, but at the bottom was lumps of foam.  Not really a con but I guess it all foams up down there where you add the powder.  I will try mixing it different ways to see if I can get rid of the foam or something, but it's not a huge deal.  It smells like that fresh milk you get from the farm, it doesn't smell like the over processed store milk you buy.  I really don't mind it because I am sure it will just taste fine with my cereal and other things.  For the price of this milk, you get a good deal.  I made a quart and it doesn't even look like I put a dent in the one 26-ounce package.  This stuff can last about 2 years on the shelf.  If this continues to work out, I will never buy expensive milk at the store, this stuff is probably better for me anyways.  So all in all, I gave it a 4 out of 5, because of the foam and because I thought it would taste exactly like the store milk that other people said, but it is a little different.  I am pretty picky when it comes to taste and everything.  I think non-fat and skim milk are two totally different kinds of milk.  I used to think they are the same but I could be wrong.  Skim milk is my favorite.<br /><br />EDIT:  The foam has gone done once refrigerated as I expected so that is good.  Finally took a taste of the milk and it's not at all what I expected.  I guess I just don't like the taste of Fresh Milk but if YOU do then this is the stuff to get.  I guess I can use it for baking or something else or maybe even as cereal milk.  We will see.<br /><br />EDIT(2):  I had the quart of milk in the fridge for a little over 4 hours now.  I added ice cubes to it, about a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and just a couple pours of regular skim milk.  The taste is sooooo much better and tastes like a Vanilla milkshake.  I am so happy with this taste and I suggest you do the same thing if you want it to taste good.  I really think just adding the ice and let it get really cold helped the taste the most though, and the Vanilla was just icing on the cake.  I don't think I needed to add the couple pours of regular milk but I thought I'd give it a try because of what some websites said.  But overall I am now happy I bought this stuff because it's gonna save me so much money than buying a Gallon of milk for 3.75 a gallon and have 1/4 of that be spoiled, etc.  Now I can just make milk whenever I need it and not worry about it.  I suggest you do the steps I have as well.  Don't judge it by how it tastes right after you mix it because if you did, you'd give it a 1 star rating like I was going to.

review/summary: Excellent Product - saves time (and probably money)
review/text: We are into our third box and both my companion and I really like it.  It is very easy to mix into the blender (which takes out almost all the lumps). I then put the contents into a two-quart plastic bottle (due to the foam, a one quart is too small) give it a good shake and stick it into the fridge - wait an hour or so to get cold and it is all set. Great in coffee, on cereal or even straight into a glass. It reminds me of the milk that we drank at my uncle's dairy farm in Michigan.<br /><br />If you always buy milk in gallon sizes at the supermarket, then this product will not save you much money (especially if the milk is the store brand and/or on sale) however, for people like us it saves running to the (expensive) convenience store late at night to purchase milk (costing 2-3 times as much).

review/summary: Great for making yogurt
review/text: I purchased a box of this a few months ago after reading all of the reviews, as this seems to be the most economical non-instant dry milk that I can find. I use it mainly for yogurt, baking, and cooking. I like having powdered milk on hand when recipes call for milk. I've drank it by itself a few times and thought it was pretty good.<br /><br />I always mix it in the blender (I don't have a wand blender) unless I'm adding it to boiling water for hot cocoa or hot milk. The blender method removes all of the lumps, but also makes the milk extremely frothy on top. When I'm making yogurt I have to scoop off most of the bubbles.<br /><br />This powdered milk is much denser than the instant kind I used before. I use 2/3 c. Bob's Red Mill milk powder with 3.5 c. milk plus about 2 T plain store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. I usually don't like plain non-fat yogurt from the store, but I find yogurt made with this non-fat milk powder tastes great. If you make your own yogurt, I highly recommend this as a very economical and tasty alternative to starting with milk.

review/text: This powder milk is more cost-efficient than regular liquid milk. The taste, once suspended in water, is delicious, especially when frothed. The powder dissolves (more accurately, suspends) completely in water if you add it once the water has started whirling in the blender. I have been successful at mixing it completely without any residue by means of a blender, frother, or Moo Mixer. The resulting milk's taste is excellent, although it is not identical with liquid milk. Once mixed in with cocoa or coffee, however, there is no taste difference that I can detect.

Then pour in the rest of the measured water, mix up and pour into the container. That is it.<br /><br />I had only used the instant type in the past and never liked drinking that one plain. Ok for coffee and cereal, but had a strange taste.<br /><br />This powder on the other hand I actually like drinking plain.

So I was pretty sure that I would have to get use to this milk.  I have never tasted dry milk before.  I bought this primarily for cereal.  I mixed it in a 2 litre soda bottle, mixed very easy with a little hot water, the powder and heavy shacking for about a minute.  It foamed up really thick, so I put it in the fridge for 8 hours, then filled the bottle the rest of the way and shook it up.  I added a touch of sugar and poured it into my cereal bowl.  Its not quiet as thick as real milk, but the flavor is good.  I am stocking up on cereal and this milk for a staple food, due to coming economic problems and I love that this milk has a 2 year shelf life.  2.5 years if refrigerated. Excellent product.

review/summary: Tasty but needs blending
review/text: I bought this product because I like Bob's Red Mill products. I didn't read the package when I first used it thinking I could just make the milk a cup at a time. The milk got clumpy and settle at the bottom. It does say on the package to put in a blender. I like the taste enough to just make a quart at a time, use the blender and put it in the fridge. Great tasting milk!

review/summary: love bob's red mill products !!!
review/text: very very very good stuff. great quality and delicious milk. cant say enough good things. as far as problems mixing, i haven't had any. not gritty, not chalky. just delicious. i even mix it in my coffee in place of powdered creamers.. so much better tasting and healthier. bob's red mill products are a godsend to me and my health.  thanks amazon.<br /><br />follow up.. i have been using a shaker bottle to mix the milk. no lumps. (really anything with a tight lid will work) and best part, it can get a little frothy so it tastes great in coffee and gives it that creamier texture.

review/summary: cheaper in bulk
review/text: This non-fat milk product is excellent.  It is easy to mix (with a mixer or blender) and tastes fine.  It is not vitamin D fortified, which matters to me.  Quality and delivery are excellent (I love Amazon).  I use a fairly large amount of dry milk powder & have been ordering it through Amazon's subscription program.  I was absolutely satisfied except I thought I could surely find it for less money.  I did, and I'm about to tell you about it.<br /><br />This product is about $.43/oz from this vendor on Amazon.  I was able to find it at $.13/oz at an LDS Storehouse.  It is practically unacceptable except in terms of quality and price. I use enough of this that I bought 25# in bulk.  The LDS storehouse will allow you to repackage it in their facility in #10 cans that will last for 20 years (which I'm sure is important to some people).  It is worth the inconvenience and hassle (and it is both, although it is also educational) because I can save so much (70% reduction in price if I buy 25#).  you can also buy it in individual #10 cans (about 4#) for a little less than $9.00 per can.<br /><br />So here's the bottom line.  This is a great product, convenient and delivered to your door at a reasonable price.  But if you get nuts about it, you can find it at a significant savings.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I used to be a big milk drinker; then suddenly, I just stopped -- lost my taste for it.  However, I still needed milk occasionally, and would buy it, use a little for whatever, then the rest would go to waste sitting around in my frig.  Not any more!  I just mix up a little of this great product whenever I need it (usually half the recommended amount) and keep it in a glass jar in the frig. I use my immersion blender and it works great. (The powder is a little clingy, so try not to get it anywhere.) I haven't been brave enough to actually drink a glass (and never did like drinking skim milk anyway), but it's perfect for use in cereal, coffee, and cooking.<br /><br />Milk has gotten so expensive, especially if you are buying organic because you are concerned about hormones and additives.One $10 bag of this product is going to last a long time and save me soooo much money!  Bob's Red Mill is a great brand and you can hardly go wrong with any of their stuff.

We drink it by the gallon. We mix 14 cups of good water and 1 1/2 cups of powder milk. It is a little weak, but we love the taste and how long it lasts.

review/summary: fantastic...dry milk powder...(big upgrade from powdered milk)
review/text: I am the only one in my house that uses milk. I also make my own yogurt. This product is terrific. I use an immersion blender in a quart jar to mix up the milk it takes seconds. The immersion blender makes quick work of it. I use someone's suggestion here to make yogurt. I just warm water to 110 degrees blend it with yogurt (as a starter) and the powdered milk I am using a 3:1 ratio which makes a nice thick yogurt. I might even reduce the amount of powdered milk. This is a great product.<br /><br />I will buy again. If you're having issues blending the fine powder spend $20 buy an immersion blender which you will use for many many things...I use mine several times a day for one thing or another. The quality of this milk is great, definitely  decent for drinking, excellent for cooking or making yogurt.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Convenient, Economical... Love It!
review/text: As many reviews say, this powder milk tastes like fresh milk. I don't notice any bad smell or aftertaste that always repulsed me when I was a kid and my mom tried to get me to drink powdered milk. As a single person household, it's rare that I can finish off a gallon of milk before it goes bad and I love the idea that I will no longer have to lug up that 8 pound jug of milk up my 31 stairs to my house. I also like the idea of being able to make cheese and yogurt with this powder.<br /><br />Right now, I use this milk for my cereal and my protein drinks. When I want to mix up a protein powder drink, I use 8oz of filtered and chilled water, 1 scoop of protein powder and 2 tablespoons of the powdered milk, cut up a banana into my mixing cup and then use my hand blender and give it a whirl.<br /><br />To reduce on cleanup, I might make 32oz of milk using the hand blender mixing cup add 14 oz water and 1/2 cup of powder milk give it a whirl for 15-30 seconds and put it in a 32oz/quart Rubbermaid leakproof container and then fill up to the 32 oz level and give it a few shakes to finish mixing the quart milk. Then using the my same utensils make my protein drink and one cleanup for two uses.<br /><br />Using a bottle and lots of shaking, I found that it doesn't always fully dissolve the powder until the next day as some have mentioned, but to me, it's not much of an annoyance. If I feel like drinking the milk straight, I might sometimes add a packet of Splenda to 32 oz of the prepared milk and then it tastes better than fresh milk, without adding calories.<br /><br />For my daily use at home to save time, I now make up 10 ready to mix dry protein drinks Baggies at one time. I measure 2 tbls of this dry milk and 1 scoop of my Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate or Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powders. then I simply measure 8 oz of filtered water, coarse chop 1 whole banana and grab a Baggie of my Chocolate or Vanilla pre-measured powder and add it to my hand blender cup and blend it for about 30 seconds to make a delicious, super high protein drink!<br /><br />This product can be awesome for extended backpacking trips of 5-25 days where you can rarely consume enough calories or protein. Most menu plans provide lots of carbs and not so much protein.  For backpacking where you can burn 5,000+ calories a day, I would drink a double load for a quick breakfast drink using a shaker bottle but no fresh bananas of course.<br /><br />Great stuff, save a few bucks by subscribing and after trying it, you can always cancel your subscription if you find this product is not for you.<br /><br />I might try the Saco brand when I run out of the milk, just for comparison, but I cannot imagine that it could taste any better. I have tried other store brand instant non-fat dry milk that was fortified with vitamins A&D bot that gives that reconstituted milk the off flavor and smell.

review/summary: Do not use for cheese making; allergy alert - not pure powder.
review/text: It may be a great buy for people who don't make cheese and have no food allergies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. I relied on a positive reveiw, hoping to make cheese with this milk.  It does not act or taste like pure powdered milk should.<br />It does not make a curd at all.<br /><br />Additonally, the powder has some inclusions in it, small purple seeds (grains), when dissolved in water- it becomes soapy, and tastes soapy too.. Probably mixed with one of those "gums" or "beans" to give a no-fat product a more "creamy" (comes out as soapy) flavor.<br /><br />I give it one star, because the producer of this milk does not indicate the full ingredient list of his milk and tricks customers like me into buying it relatively cheaply, but with a no-return "catch".

review/summary: Non-Instant dry milk from Amazon
review/text: I make yogurt from our fresh goat milk.  It requires some dry milk.  Our local supermarkets have all switched to instant, it does not work, it is an inferior product, made for the "Instant" world.  The Bob's Red Mill is just what I had been searching for.  It smells and tastes good.  The 4 pack sold on Amazon brings down the cost of my yogurt.<br />Even thought the milk has been heated before adding the dry milk, I sometimes have had difficulty getting the small limps out.<br />Maybe in cold milk this doesn't happen, but in hot, boiling, it does.  Other than that it makes a great product.  before finding this product on Amazon, I was ordering non-instant dry milk from a dairy in Wisconsin, from there to the PNW, the shipping was very expensive, so, way to go Amazon!

I couldn't believe how good it taste.  It doesn't taste like other powdered milks.  I bought one and then turned around and bought a box of four.  I love it.  I didn't know powdered milk could taste so close to the real. I will definitely keep this on hand.  Sometimes I don't make it to the store and I do love my milk.  I can make this and not feel like I am being cheated from drinking the real thing. I think it doesn't take as much to make this as it does other brands.  But regardless, it is worth every penny to me due to its real-like flavor of milk.

review/summary: Bad aftertaste, but easy enough to blend. Doesn't taste like normal milk.
review/text: I used to drink several cups of bottled 2% milk a day.<br /><br />With this powdered milk, I can barely manage to drink a cup a day. Ew. It's not tasty.<br /><br />This Dry Milk Powder tastes a little off, and has a bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm happy it's available with Subscribe & Save, though I regret spending the price on something that just doesn't taste like normal milk. I've tried different variations on water/milk measurements. I've added ice, sugar, everything I can think of. Still, I can't manage to drink a whole glass of this stuff. And, I've tried tons of brands of bottled milk over the years and never found one I couldn't tolerate.... until this stuff.<br /><br />Maybe I'll use this for baking. I would only drink this as "normal" daily milk if I was very desperate. This stuff just doesn't taste right, and leaves a gross non-milk aftertaste.<br /><br />I'll reluctantly give it 3 stars because it's on Subscribe & Save, because it's easy enough to blend, and because it doesn't make me gag. But, no, it doesn't like not "normal" milk and I really don't care for the taste at all. Ew.

review/summary: 5 stars like all the other reviews! Only $1.72 for a HOT meal!
review/text: I was very impressed that ALL the reviews for Chef Boyardee Mini Ravioli (14.25 oz) were FIVE stars. Never having had Chef Boyardee anything, I thought all those 5 stars meant it was a safe bet. I was right! Wonderfully delicious and a very handy lunch or dinner to have on hand! They are shelf stable, so now I keep a couple of these in my desk for emergencies - like too busy in the am to make a lunch, or a lunch meeting gets cancelled. I nuke it 2 minutes in the bowl, spread it on a plate, and nuke it two more minutes, which concentrates the delicious sauce even more. This is a generous portion of ravioli - I counted 28! - and serves two at 240 calories each. (Also comes in smaller container of large ravioli: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MICPSA">Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli, 7.5-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 12)</a>.) CONTAINS SOY.

review/text: This is the perfect meal on the go product to take to work. There is no need for refrigeration or for a can opener and the meal heats right in the bowl. Each bowl has a generous portion of delicious ravioli and just the right amount of tomato meat sauce. The container has a pull tab metal lid that is vacuum sealed and a plastic lid that remains on the bowl during heating to avoid splatters in the microwave. Heats in about 90 seconds and is very filling. It has a long shelf life and has about 380 calories per bowl.

review/text: The Weinland (Wineland) gummies have everything a person could want in a good gummi: chewy, soft, flavorful and sweet enough without it tasting like you're sucking on a sugar cube or a spoon full of corn syrup.  Some of these have a flavor of light citrus (orange, lemon or lime, but none overpoweringly so), some are obviously green apple, others taste more like various types of wine grapes.  Of all of the gummies I've tasted so far, these are definitely my favorite!  If they had a few less in the citrus and apple flavors and more in the wine-like flavors I would be happier, but I'm not going to complain, because they are all good!

review/summary: THE best powdered cheese out there...
review/text: You have no idea. I've researched cheese powders for 7 years (all provoked when the original Kraft Grated Cheddar was pulled from production and rocked my world). This newer version is not QUITE as pure as their grated cheddar was (that was a gold can, and it was borderline-illegally heaven), but this one is close.  It's certainly better than any of the myriads of powders that "claim" to be cheese (which are predominantly fillers, sodium, food coloring, anti-caking agents and preservatives...and taste like it). If you're looking for the best tasting cheese powder out there, this is it. It's great on popcorn!

review/text: This is the only kind of "cheese food" (as it used to be advertised) that I will eat.  But the price is now insanely too expensive (over $3/bottle after shipping as of 07/2009).  Since they moved to plastic bottles a couple years ago, I have empties coming out my ears.<br /><br />I have not been able to find this cheese, anywhere but Amazon since February 2009 (when I paid $2/bottle).  But, after seeing the current price I decided to refill my old bottles using the packages from Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner boxes.  It takes 3 packages to refill, and you get about 20% more.  I've been able to buy the boxes on sale for 50 cents, so the refill only costs $1.50.  The price is 61 cents/box at my local warehouse store (still only $1.83/refill).<br /><br />Great product being priced out of existence.  Now what to do with all this excess macaroni???

review/summary: Mostly it's just salt, still not bad!
review/text: Not quite the same as the cheese powder in your box of Kraft macaroni. This topping is a fine alternative to salt, but does not add a great deal of non-salt flavor. This is very similar in taste and texture to, for example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAYJIU">Reese Popcorn Salt</a>, which is finely pulverized table salt, but Kraft adds whey and powdered milk and a ton of orange coloring to make this salt seem more like cheese. It gives it a slightly sour taste, which might sound unpleasant, but actually does the trick beautifully compared to the much plainer "salt with dye" cheese sprinkles I've tried in the past. Still... If you're truly interested in cheese flavor, use finely grated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264OMUM">cheddar</a> (lightly sprinkled, it will melt like butter on piping hot popcorn) or go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001650XUK">grated parmesan cheese</a> (or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E55Z46">powdered version</a>, which, when sifted finely, makes the ultimate cheese topping, since it is, of course, actually cheese) for a fuller flavor. Another popular alternative, if you want to stick to powder, seems to be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016LZT8">Barry Farms dried cheddar cheese</a>, although I have never tried it myself. :)

review/summary: Grated American Cheese......Delicioso!
review/text: When I was a kid there used to be a grated American cheese product that was put out by Kraft.  I don't know if it was available everywhere, but it was always at the local A&P in my town, and I came to like it better than any of the fancy grated Parmesan or Romano cheeses.  It came in the very same 3 oz containers like here on Amazon.  Something of a pain for I liked it so much I didn't care how much it cost, I just wanted it all the time. (It would have been nice if it came in larger sizes). There was simply nothing like its flavor on pasta.  It was easily distinguishable by its yellow/orange color, and its much tangier, richer cheese taste.  My father, along with many others considered it junk compared to grated Parmesans, but I didn't really care what was in it.  I only knew it gave pasta a whole new flavor that was as deliciously cheesy in a grated form that was available.  A long time ago it disappeared from many local stores.  My father used to tell me that they stopped making it because only two people would buy it.  Me, and the guy that invented the stuff.  But according to the reviews here I see I am not alone.  This product is essentially the same thing as the grated american cheese of my youth in the very same small 3 oz containers.  And I am happy to report that it is just as fabulously delicious as I remember it.  Ordering 12 at once will not see it go bad here.  We have spaghetti at least once in a week in my house and I load it with this stuff.  I am a self confessed grated cheese fiend, but nothing compares to this  topping in my opinion.  It's not pure, it's not really healthy, it's not aged all that much, it's just plain delicious.  It can  be compared to chomping down a hot dog smothered with mustard and ketchup and enjoying it immensely, and someone telling you there is no real food in it, or good for you. You don't eat hot dogs everyday, and you won't eat this that often either.  If you like grated cheese like I do, I would strongly urge you to try this grated american cheese product.  Its the most flavorful grated cheese topping around, and I recommend it.  My only reason for taking one star off is the price.  With shipping its a little pricey, but still worth every cent.  It's really hard to find in stores, and even when you do they tend to run out.  It seems to be always here on Amazon, and I say give it a delicious try....

review/text: I found this product once at a local supermarket, but they no longer carry it.  My children REFUSE to eat Mac and Cheese without extra "sprinkles".  I couldn't be happier.  We love the product, and we received it very quickly.

review/text: I looked on Amazon for this product as I could not longer find it at my supermarket.  I use this when I make Mac and Cheese and find the product to be tasty and easy to use.  I also use it on popcorn.  I don't know why it is so difficult to find this at the supermarket but as long as I can purchase it on Amazon, I'm good.

review/summary: Cheese Please
review/text: I was tired of having to buy extra boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese just for the packets of the powered cheese and I couldn't find the cheese separate anywhere. I bought the 12CT and gave some to my mother and daughter. I have used it so far in my macaroni salad and popcorn and it was excellent. I will be buying this again!!!!

review/summary: Will Order Again!!
review/text: Can't find this cheese in the stores anymore so was relieved to find a supplier who carries the cheese. The product wasn't out of date and shipping took a reasonable amount of time.

review/summary: Expiration Date
review/text: I just found this stuff again.  I bought it on here a few years back and then could not get it after that.  I guess I should have kept looking.  I just bought a dozen of these and  was a little surprised by the expiration date.<br /><br />I really can't believe that this processed stuff would actually go bad.  I think that if you keep it stored in reasonable pantry conditions this stuff should last years.<br /><br />The guy who had the idea of just using the stuff in the box, made me feel kind of dumb when I did the math. When I run out next time that is what I'm going to do.

review/summary: Tough to find
review/text: I'm not sure why Kraft is so selective with where they sell this product. It use to be readily available at any store. The product is used for homemade mac and cheese recipe.  The product is great, although a bit pricey by the vendor. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Kraft Mac & Cheese Topping
review/text: We LOVE this little blue shaker! I shake it on mac & cheese, sprinkle it on popcorn, stir it into casseroles, etc.<br /><br />I ran out and couldn't find it locally, so I'd been searching for a retailer for weeks when I thought about checking Amazon.com online. We're so glad you have sellers with a supply of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topping. THANK YOU!

review/summary: childhood love
review/text: I have loved this topping since I was a small child. I couldn't eat my spaghetti without it and I still love it now on my pasta, potatoes, popcorn and whatever else I can put it on. I think the only reason I got the pack for such a reasonable price is because the expiration is 4/12.  I doubt the cheese will last that long in my family but it would be nice to have a later expiration. Other than that, completely satisfied.

review/summary: Great Product, Fast Shipping
review/text: I ordered this product a week before my mom's birthday because it is her favorite topping for popcorn and it came the day before her birthday. I was impressed with the fast shipping and the product was exactly what I expected. I can no longer find this product in the grocery stores in my area so I was happy. But you have to use this product frequently to use it before the expiration date (mine gave me a little over 2 months to use it).

review/text: Great product on rigatonis with real butter and carmelized onions.  Can't believe the hike in price from a year ago! I'm going to try buying up boxes of mac and cheese and emptying the bags into a container as suggested by another shopper.
