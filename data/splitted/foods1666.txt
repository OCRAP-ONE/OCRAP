review/summary: MY DOGS AND MY CLIENT'S DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS!
review/text: I own a pet sitting business in Austin, TX. I first tried these trets on my dogs. Belle (very picky about her treats) absolutely loved them. Cassie loved them as well. I then began giving them to a couple of my client's dogs. Even the dogs that did not usually like treats, loved these. None of that 1/2 chewing & then spitting out over & over again. I have not had any of the dogs that I have offered these healthy, tasty treats turn them down. Usually, if I give one of these treats to a dog or dogs in my care, the treat is gone before I can turn around. Amazing!<br />What I like about these treats is that they are (when given in moderation) healthy. The only problem that I have is getting the dogs to listen to me when I tell them that there will be no more treats until the following visit.<br />These make great training treats. I almost want to believe that a dog would do anything for one of these treats. Love at first bite!

review/text: I am a Canine Behaviorist and last week I used these treat in my Basic Obedience Class.  They were a hit with all 8 dogs in my class.  The dogs would do anything for these treats.  These are what I call a "high" value treat.  The dogs can chew them quickly too and you can break them into really small pieces.  Love these!  Will be adding them to my list of recommended training treats.

Living in a sub-tropical climate (Houston, Tx) lends itself to the affects of rampant allergy symptoms and the like.  These little drops are the perfect antidote against feeling awful and boosting ones defense against "The Houston Crud."  Highly recommended as such.

review/summary: They are great!  Packaging could use some work though
review/text: I am a tea fanatic, 4-6 cups a days of all sorts of loose leafed teas from local tea shops around town, and grabbed these at a local grocery store last week to try out.  I am also a fan of honey, all sorts, although I prefer local/organic raw honeys over the mass-produced cheap kind.  I will be travelling for Christmas this year and portable honey sounded great!  First impression was that a box of only 20 was a tad expensive - you can buy a bottle of very quality honey for the same price, but the bottle would last you much much longer.  However, I still bought it and tried it out, and here are my impressions:<br /><br />CONS:<br />-  Some of the drops had oozed/leaked and the inside of the box was a tad sticky.  Also, some of the drops were sticky.  Not impressed with the packaging job.<br />-  When popping open 1 serving of the honey, it wasn't solid like a hard candy would be, it was a tad gooey, and I had to dig it out with a spoon to get it into the hot water because it was stuck to its container.  It didn't just pop right out.  It says on the box that you can hold this honey in your hand... no you can't and I wouldn't recommend it!  haha<br />-  As previously mentioned, a tad pricey for only 20 servings<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Perfect portion size for 1 cup of tea if you like your tea just mildly sweetened.  You will need 2+ drops if you like it very sweet<br />- Flavor is very good and you can taste the lemon.  It seems like a good quality honey was used.<br />- Great for travelling IF you put the drops into a Ziploc bag or other leakproof container, as some of them were sticky, so something must have leaked somewhere in the box.  It's a "peel off the foil and pop out" sort of container for each drop, so if you throw these loose into your purse and something pierces the thin foil, you're in trouble!<br />-  Directions for use were spot-on.  It says to drop the honey in hot water and stir for 30-60 seconds.  I was stirring for almost 60 seconds!  It's such a solid piece that it takes some working to get it all to dissolve, and of course the hotter the water, the better.<br /><br />This was an impulse buy and I will probably only save the use of this honey for when I am travelling since it was so expensive per serving. The honey tasted very good and seemed of good quality but the packaging had some issues.  I haven't tried them as throat drops, but it sounds like a great idea!  I will probably stick to my raw honey in the jar or bottle for everyday use though... these are just a novelty for now!

These satisfy that crunchy, chewy texture craving that I get.  I don't have any issue with gluten intolerance, I just am trying to find low-calorie snack alternatives to other fat-laden treats.  These fulfill that role for me.

review/text: I got these as a snack treat to add to my daughter's lunchbox at school.  She's on a gluten-free, dairy free, and soy-free diet, so we're very restricted.  I got a package of this at the store and before my shopping trip was over, I realized that we were waaaaay overdue on dinner time and both her and my stomachs were rumbling.  I pulled this out of the cart, opened it and shared a marshmallow bar with my daughter.  We were in heaven!  I'm not gluten-free, but this was on par with just about any kit-kat bar, snickers bar, reese's cup delicious guilty pleasure that I indulge in from time to time.  Sweet and delicious.  Just watch out -- while they're tasty, they're still packed iwth lots of sugar (7 g per bar) even though the source is from organic brown rice syrup and cane juice.  These are also kosher OU parve.

review/summary: Terrible, dry, nothing like a real marshmallow treat
review/text: So many times I've bought a case on Amazon.com instead of trying "just one" because many items aren't sold around here.  Luckily I found one at a local store after having the "case" of these on my wishlist for months.  Ugh.  It's dry, tasteless and how they came up with peanut caramel as the flavor...?  It's flavor is like a light, tasteless peanut butter that is so sweet it nearly gags you.  I like sweet things and love real marshmallow treats but I've been switching everything to organic and natural products.  I've tried other brown rice marshmallow treats from other brands and liked them but this was absolutely terrible.  I'd never recommend this to anyone.  :(

review/text: I'm a huge fan of brownies and chocolate, but live in Japan, where real brownies pretty much don't exist. So I was excited to find this product. It promises to have the taste of brownies, and it's from America so of course they should be good.<br /><br />But they were extremely disappointing. They're bland and boring. You can hardly taste the chocolate, only a burned flavor I'm going to assume was the toffee. The other flavors might be better, but Toffee Chip is not good at all.

review/summary: Works great and taste yummy!
review/text: I was very excited to try this marinade, if for no other reason than I have been wanting to get a marinade injector.  The one that comes with this product is actually very nice - I haven't used another to compare it to but it was easy to snap the needle on the syringe and use.  It's definitely not a cheapy, one-use item - I have saved mine and will reuse it often!  It was easy to use and worked very well at getting marinade inside the chicken.  As for the marinade itself, my family loved the very real buttery flavor mixed with a "creole-light" spice.  I say light because I was honestly expecting it to be a bit spicier or intense, and I would have preferred it that way, but the nice thing about it being a bit lighter was that my 7yr old was able to eat the chicken I made with it.  I used it for chicken breasts, not a whole chicken as the bottle states, but it worked very well - I'll bet it would be delicious on a whole chicken.  And kind of fun to use too!  One tip: if you don't think you'll be using the entire bottle (I didn't) at once, you'll want to pour the marinade into another container to draw it out of with your injector, otherwise you'll be dipping the needle you just had in raw chicken back into the bottle every time you refill it.  I made 4 breasts and used about 1/2 the bottle.

review/summary: Perfect and easy to use
review/text: My family has used this for years on our Thanksgiving turkeys.  We typically inject them the day before and let it marinade overnight.  Then we deep fry it after rubbing the dry spice on the Turkey.  It seriously makes the best turkey, my family and friends rave about it.  If you have any reservations I promise you won't be disappointed.  The turkey always turns out moist and very flavorful, not to mention the ease of use.  I have read reviews that say the needle is reusable and it is, but it really is not that great.  My wife and purchased a nicer one from Crate and Barrel and since we use this stuff so much it was definitely worth the $30.  It is also great on chicken of any kind and I have used it on duck as well.  All of the above turned out great.  Just make sure that if you are roasting your poultry to dump whatever you don't use in the pan with it while roasting, it works great to baste as well.  Hope this helps.

review/text: I had this on hand for Thanksgiving -- all of our local friends have said "no good Southerner does a turkey without Tony Chachere's injectable marinade" -- but we opened it early as a quick marinade for some plain chicken breasts. The injector was easy to use (go length-wise on boneless breasts), and in no time, we had compliments from our dinner guests! Don't think I'd use this on chicken that says 10 or 15% sodium solution (we didn't & ours were just right), guessing that the double sodium combo might be too much? Sprinkling with Tony Chachere's dry spices gives it a tasty kick, but any dry rub or even garlic powder & pepper would do.

I cooked some garlic, carrots and potatoes with the chicken and it flavored them nicely as well. I would definitely use this again, and it will be great on the Thanksgiving turkey. A+

review/text: My husband and I tried this product last week, on a whole chicken. My husband did the "injections" and he said it was an easy process. We didn't add any additional seasoning, so we could get an idea of how we liked the marinade, itself. We thought it was pretty good! The chicken was very moist and, overall, we liked it. Next time, I think I would add Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to the exterior of the chicken, for more flavor. We had some in the house but, like I said, we really wanted to see how we liked the marinade. My only complaint is less of a complaint than a tip... be careful not to inject too much marinade in one spot! I took a bite of chicken breast and there was a large bubble of marinade in it. It was not a pleasant sensation!

review/text: I used this on boneless, skinless chicken breast.  It was easy to inject the marinade using the supplied injector. I put it in the thickest part of the chicken breast and baked it in the oven. Even after baking for a long time (I like my chicken very well done), the meat was still moist and flavorful.<br />This product contains 0 calories, so that is a bonus.<br />The flavor was pretty mild, I would have preferred it a little stronger. The instructions suggest to use Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, which I didn't have, so that probably would have helped. I would definitely recommend this product to use to keep the meat moist and then add a little seasoning for extra spice.

review/summary: Disappointed with the amount of sugar
review/text: I just tried this for the first time this weekend. I was an artist at a festival and it was supplied to the musicians. I liked the taste OK (a little too sweet) but when I read that each can contains 28 grams of sugar, I think I know where everyone was getting their energy from. There's no need for so much sugar. Mate is a great drink just plain and in my view, it's not a great plan to subvert all its health benefits with the equivalent of almost 3 Krispy Kreme donuts. I realize that a lot of people might not like it without all the sugar, but a lot of us would like it just fine unsweetened and our insulin levels and the size of our posteriors would thank Guayaki. I would give an unsweetened version 5 stars.

review/text: If you haven't had this larger type of couscous before, it's a nice alternative to Italian pasta.  The package does lack cooking instructions, though.  It takes about 30 minutes or so to get it just right (cooked all the way through but not mushy).  I like to prepare it as I would risotto (sauteed, then boiled), but it's good just boiled, too.  Add some mushrooms, onions and a little olive oil, and you've got a delicious side dish!

There is no added salt, sugar, gluten/wheat, and dairy. The only ingredient is brown rice. I am used to bread chicken for baked nuggets and to mix with crab for crab cakes or stuffed mushrooms.

review/summary: Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!
review/text: Mike's Hard Lemonade is just what the name implies - alcoholic lemonade. Each bottle contains 11.2 fluid ounces of lemonade and is 5% alcohol by volume.<br /><br />the packaging is fairly attractive. The black and yellow blends well, and the box has some  interesting little quotables on it. The bottles are clear with a lemon skin effect on the base of the neck. Black and yellow labels adorn the glass, and the screw off cap is black and silver. It's a nice looking bottle, and suits the cloudy lemonade it hold within.<br /><br />Mike's Hard Lemonade has a very natural lemon taste to it. It is quite tangy, but no to the point that you cringe. There's a slight alcoholic aftertaste, but what do you expect? It isn't overpowering, but it is there. As with most lemonade, the drink is quite sugary. sometimes I have to force myself to finish the bottle because near the end, the alcohol and sugar mixture is tiresome. However, mixed with tea to make a lemonade tea, I can easily consume more than normal.<br /><br />Mike's Hard Lemonade isn't a drink I want to have all the time, but once in a while it's pretty good.

review/text: I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.

review/summary: You couldn't pay me to drink this!
review/text: I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.

review/summary: Almost Undrinkable
review/text: After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.

review/text: Even though everyone talks about Natural as the most popular ZICO flavor, this is by far my favorite.  it's light, refreshing and has about 40% less sugar and calories than other flavored coconut waters because ZICO doesn't add juice and puree like the other brands.  By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear).

review/text: Summary:<br />This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.<br /><br />Pros:  Bottle looks cool?<br />Cons:  Price, from concentrate.  Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.

review/text: I drink a lot of coconut water.  The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.

I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.

This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either.

review/summary: Tastes like coconut water from a fresh coconut stored in a plastic jug in the trunk of your car for a few days!
review/text: I've spent at least a hundred bucks on the old Zico boxes.  Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.  I just got a shipment of the new bottles, took a swig and almost spit it out.  Tastes like plastic.  I gave it a few more swigs, and now my stomach hurts.<br /><br />I immediately logged into Amazon so I could warn others not to buy this crap.  I'm closing the bottle, putting it back in the box and sending it all back to Amazon.  I will never buy Zico again.  YUCK!

review/summary: now made from Concentrate, "natural flavor" added..yuk!
review/text: Coca Cola now partially owns Zico. So, now it's made from concentrate, has added "natural flavors" and is packaged in plastic. How to ruin nature's perfect drink for profit. This was my favorite, now I will not buy this "new formula" again...Looking to find another like Zico used to be. Don't know yet if the Zico tetra pak is still the "old formula"..also..rumor has it that Pepsi is looking to buy Vita Coco..so will be keeping my eye on this, too

review/summary: Worst coconut water EVER
review/text: I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.<br /><br />This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.

review/summary: What have they done????
review/text: I'm from the Caribbean and now live in the United States.  Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their "new" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.

review/text: I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.<br /><br />I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing.

I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.

review/text: My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!

This Zico with Passion Fruit is my favorite and seriously helped my through some HORRENDOUS morning sickness.  It tastes fresh and crisp with no off flavors or aftertaste.  I would put the 11 ounces on ice with a bit of chilled water in a huge cup and sip it all day, adding more water as the day went on until I was just drinking water.  If I tried drinking plain water I would retch immediately so this was a great help.  Also nice to get some electrolytes to help with dehydration.

So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor!  I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out.

review/text: Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.<br /><br />ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).<br /><br />After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks.
