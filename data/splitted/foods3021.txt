review/summary: Starbucks Via - Just like a cup of fresh Starbucks!
review/text: My husband and I have been coffee drinkers for many years.  We have bought and brewed just about all of the best coffees out there, including Starbucks whole beans.  We tried instant coffee, the usual brands to see if we could tolerate it, instead of waiting and watching the percolator, so it would'nt boil over on the stove.  The usual brands were tolerable.  That was until we tried the real deal...Starbucks Via Ready Brew Coffee.  I'd say that it is just about the best cup of coffee from Starbucks ever!

review/summary: the best instant out there for me
review/text: I have to admit I'm a coffee snob, owning a semi-comm espresso machine at home and am heavily into all that coffee voodoo stuff.  Although I think Starbucks coffee is just so-so unless buried beneath lots of caramel and other stuff, I really like these VIA instants for some reason.  Maybe it has more a french press taste and experience than other instants that draws me to them, I don't know.  I do know that I will take these quick and easy to use instant packs over the cafeteria coffee any day.  Before folks get all on me about my contradictions, it's a personal taste thing.  I love apples, too, and eat tons of them, but hate applesauce.  The same goes with these things...I hate liking them, but I do.

review/summary: Less than 50 cents a cup
review/text: I bought this coffee pack for my parents because they can only drink decaf. This is perfect for them, especially when on the go. The price was the most appealing part because it comes down to about less than 50 cents a cup, where if you go to a Starbucks a cup of coffee is more than double. I recommend this item if you have no preference over freshly brewed and instant coffee.

review/summary: Great Instant Coffee
review/text: As usual, Starbucks does a great job with coffee. One pack of the Italian roast can still make a pretty good 16oz cup of coffee. It's better as 8oz - 12oz but you can get away with 16oz. I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it.

review/summary: Starbucks in West Africa.
review/text: I live in West Africa, where there are currently no Starbucks stores and our grocery stores do not sell Starbucks coffee. It will probably be a least 50 years, and I don't plan on being here in 50 years. So, when I took that first delicious sip of Starbucks Instant Italian Roast Coffee...it hit the Starbucks-craving spot. The flavor is so much better than any other instant coffee I've ever tasted. Here's the thing--it's still instant coffee. But, it actually tastes almost exactly like regular brewed coffee. It's an expensive cup of heaven...I'll be saving mine for special occasions. Because, in West Africa, you have to savor the luxurious moments in-between mosquito attacks and power cuts.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing
review/text: I love this coffee.  It is so quick and easy to whip up a cup and it tastes great.  I use it at work, home, camping, road trips, etc.  Pick up a small electric kettle and you can have it just about anywhere on trips as long as you have access to water and electricity.  I have used it on cruise ships when the coffee is terrible or at conferences for the same reason.  They usually have hot water for tea, so I just use one of these.<br /><br />One note of caution though, it is smooth but don't drink it too fast or else you will be seeing through walls.  Then again, sometimes seeing through walls could be kind of fun.  What I mean is that to me, it has more of a kick to it than regular coffee.

review/text: I like my coffee strong and rich, and can't stand the typical watery cup of coffee served in cheap restaurants, and I can never get consistent brews when I make it myself. Most instant coffees are disgusting. The Italian Roast is a great alternative. It really caters for people like me, who like it stronger than average. I wish the cost would go down a little so I could make it a daily beverage.<br /><br />I also drink the decaf version, which is just as good.

review/summary: SHAME ON AMAZON
review/text: Shame on Amazon for enhancing their financial facts (list price $50) on this product. First, Starbucks list this item for $35.95 so there is no $21.05 savings. Next, add in the shipping cost and your saving is further erroded. The bottomline is that Amazon is not rewarding you with a 42% saving....With that said, I love brewed coffee and drink my coffee black. For an instant coffee VIA brand is probably one of the best on the market. The Italian Roast is labeled "extra bold" by Starbucks and indeed it is. This is not a very smooth coffee and has a robust taste. If you like a medium taste (ex. Colombia) you might want to give thought before buying the Italian Roast. Even though the Columbian is medium this coffee still has a rich flavor. An if you prefer a strong coffee (as I do) this is not the one. Last thing for those who drink brewed coffee (and especially black coffee) every morning. The VIA is NOT a substitute brand for your every morning coffee. This is fine as an emergency when freshly brewed coffee is not possible. Oh yes, I have purchased the VIA direct from Starbucks and the grocery store, the "use by" stamp on the coffee has been from four to eight months (grocery store). So, the shelf life the buyer sees depends on how long its been on the shelf of the seller and when you make the purchase. Would I purchase this product? Yes, but I would compare prices (at the grocery store-no shipping cost, Starbucks, etc.) before I purchase from Amazon.

review/summary: Favorite Afternoon Instant Coffee
review/text: I have ordered Starbucks VIA Decaf several times and am always pleased.  Being a chocoholic, I combine it with a "low"-calorie instant cocoa to make myself a mocha.  (So I order decaf to "offset" the extra caffeine from the cocoa &lt;grin>.)<br /><br />While the product on the first shipment had an early (as in about 4-5 months) expiration date, that has not since been the case.  (The early expiration date didn't matter at the time since I went through the product within a couple of months.)  In fact, I have 8-9 months before the expiration date on the latest shipment, which is good because I stocked up on the caffeinated version when it went on "sale" at Costco before the holidays.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus in this latest shipment was a sample of Blonde Veranda Blend.  Cool!  (I don't have an automatic drip coffee maker so I need to dig out my Keurig filter basket to try the coffee.  But I'm looking forward to it.)

review/summary: This coffee has saved me more than once
review/text: Recently at work, we've been looking to cut costs and save money, and so the first thing to go was decent coffee.  The swill that they're serving now is an abomination to coffee, so I finally went out and bought a pack of these 50 Starbucks Via Italian Roast instant coffee.  Starbucks Via is pretty good, I mean, it's really good for instant coffee.  I am fortunate at work we have a hot-water maker thing that works well and gives you piping hot water, which dissolves this coffee dust in a matter of seconds... barely requiring a stir.<br /><br />THe coffee is strong and tastes similar to the Starbucks Italian Roast you might get from the store;  not the same, not as robust, not as "burnt" (something that I personally prefer), but still pretty damn good for instant coffee.<br /><br />Having irregular sleep patterns, this coffee has spared me the embarrassment of falling asleep in countless meetings.  It works, it tastes good, it holds cream well.  Only drawback is it leaves this muddy residue on the bottom of your cup.  But, that ain't all that bad.  It's not Sanka.

I've used a half-packet for a small cup. It's very rich and flavorful, there is not another instant like this.  My husband drinks strictly decaf, and it's usually a Starbucks Via Italian Roast.  During our recent relocation, living in a furnished apartment with an inferior coffee maker, we both used VIA for the duration.  The Amazon price is lowest I've found, but I'd pay full-price if necessary, it's worth it.

review/text: I was worried after reading some of the reviews saying the exp. date on this coffee was bad, but I ordered anyway because it's such a fantastic deal. When I got mine it says it doesn't expire for another year! I mean make sure when you order it's from Starbucks and I'd say your good. It's such a great buy and comes in a very nice pop open box thing that makes it simple to grab a ready brew in the mornings and pop it open and pour it into my hot water. I own a Keurig so I just make it brew hot water and then I use these, it's so much cheaper than k-cups and the taste is the same great Starbucks taste I get at their stores! The colombia blend is my favorite blend at Starbucks, it offers a nice bold flavor but it's not too strong and the finish is just fantastic, I recommend Baileys Caramel Creamer to add to your cup of coffee of Colombia, you will have to buy the creamer at your local grocery store though since it needs to be refrigerated. I can't say enough about how great of a buy this is, the only thing I would change is making it a Amazon Prime item, I am a Prime member and love the free 2 day shipping, but had to pay shipping on this since it wasn't prime, other than that, this is my new favorite must have here on Amazon!

review/text: I first tried this product at my local grocery store after seeing it on Amazon. I would highly recommend this if you have the option - tough to spend this much money on something you might not like. That said, I think this is a quality product and the value is there if you end up enjoying it. I would call it a 2-3 of 5 on the spiciness rating - it makes me sweat a bit, but it is pleasant and the spice definitely does not overpower the other flavor (I will say that I am usually somewhat sensitive to heat). The package says that their are 2 to 3 servings per box - as a meal, I eat the whole box, but it could easily be 2 servings. Each serving is ~100 calories, so I don't feel too bad about pouring the whole box over a serving or two of rice and digging in. In all, it is a great product that is a much better value on Amazon than purchasing individual packs in store.

review/summary: Tasty Mushroom Flavor. Much Better Than Canned Things.
review/text: I picked up several gourmet varieties of soups at my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and one of them was Imagine Creamy Portobello Mushroom Soup (16 ounce carton). The carton is slightly different than the one shown here, but right on my carton it says "New Package, same size," so I think it's exactly the same product. I made the soup up with some Garofalo whole wheat bow tie pasta. Mmmmm. It was good. Real nice and creamy and with an tasty mushroom flavor. I would have preferred some visible evidence of it being a mushroom soup, but the flavor was certainly excellent. This was quite good. Much better than canned things I've had in the past.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This soup is only edible which isn't much of a compliment.  I found myself using it then trying to disguise it's taste (note the word "trying").  It's not worth it.  Try Amy's instead if you're not gluten intolerant.  It's blows the other c of m soups out of the water.<br />If I were you (and gluten intolerant but okay w/ dairy) I'd grab a carton of chicken broth, saute a box of portobello's, toss them into a blender to get the consistency you want, heat it and dress it up w/ whatever flavoring you desire.  Thicken it if you like.  The trick that makes it tasty is to add a cup of whipping cream at the very end and then just heat through.  It will knock your socks off!

review/summary: Great for people on liquid diet
review/text: If doctor puts you on a liquid diet, whether it's before or after surgery, this soup is one of the best options for it. There's lots of flavor and it surely beats in quality pretty much any other soup sold in cans. Also it's nice that that Amazon sells small packs of this soup, which are useful for a one time meal. You don't need a fridge for an unused portion.

review/summary: Give it some help.
review/text: Delicious soup if you add a few key ingredients.  I use about 10-12 baby portobello mushrooms and slice into thick slices, adding them to the soup at the start of the heating process.  Also you can add to the taste with a few herbs and spices.  I use some black pepper and basil or thyme.  I can't find the soup in any of my local stores, however, and can only buy it online.  Seems strange and a very major inconvenience when I have to buy 12 cartons at a time.

review/summary: great taste, but. . .
review/text: NOT instant, as the package says. To be fair, the package does also have, in somewhat smaller and less prominent print, a detailed statement telling the buyer that microwaving/cooking will be necessary. BUT if you just look at the package front, you'll get the impression you can make this like you make instant oatmeal. Not so.<br /><br />I hate using microwaves, so that was a big turn-off for me.<br /><br />All that said, the stuff is delicious and definitely warms me up and fills my tummy, keeping me from getting hungry better than most oatmeals do.<br /><br />The texture is thicker and heartier than regular instant oatmeals, kind of a cross between a light muesli and oatmeal. I make mine, add about 2 ounces of organic skim milk, and I'm good to go. The sweetness is light and wonderful, no overly-sugary yuckiness.

review/text: Kashi Brand oatmeal is truly different from many others I've tried.  The Go Lean Instant is not an oatmeal with the usual hot oatmeal texture.  It's not thick and pasty as many other brands are.  It's got a nutty consistency and a thinner base - it doesn't feel like food that's been chewed for you.  It wins in both texture & taste categories!

review/summary: Love this cereal...
review/text: I am not a breakfast eater, and not a particular fan of oatmeal.  I decided to give this a try as it had a greater amount of protein than most cereals of this nature.  It is very lightly sweet (not like Quaker's etc), and a teeney bit chewy texture, which I find I like. I sometimes cube a little apple and throw into the microwave first for 30 seconds, then add the cereal to it to cook. I really, really like this cereal so much so that I have it on 'Subscribe & Save', as it is the best value.  Besides which, I don't have to go chasing it down in the grocery stores.  Sometimes there, sometimes not.  Prices are also much higher in the store, unless it is on sale.

review/summary: Kashi Oatmeal
review/text: I like eating this Kashi oatmeal and the Quaker Oats one.  I like the Kashi one because it is naturally sweetened with honey and cinnamon and not a whole bunch of sugar like the Quaker Oats one tends to be.  Also this oatmeal has more of a nutty (or different) flavoring to it over the Quaker Oats.  I also noticed that it seems to take just a bit longer for this oatmeal to cook versus the Quaker Oats, but that doesn't bother me.

The Kashi is 150 calories and the raisins add another 130.<br /><br />I used to be able to find Kashi hot cereal at Walmart and Target, but now it is only stocked at Kroger. It very rarely goes on sale and the regular price is nearly $4 a box! I started ordering it by the case from Amazon's Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: These are *not* sproutable oats!
review/text: I have been searching for unstabilized, organic, raw oat groats.  When I contacted the company to see if these were sproutable, they assured me that these oats were completely untreated- of course they would sprout!  Well, the company seems to be ignorant of the whole stabilized<br />/unstabilized oat dilemma, even after I explained it to them.  I bought 5# of these and, unfortunately, like so many other "raw" oat groats on the market, these will not sprout- they have been stabilized!<br />So if you are looking for sproutability, and I would encourage you to do so since soaking/sprouting creates a dynamic boost in nutrients and flavor, in addition to neutralizing the anti-nutrients which are in *all* seeds, nuts and grains.  This is an important factor in protecting and healing the gut.

review/summary: Great flavor, way too many husks
review/text: First the good news: These groats have great flavor -- rich, nutty, slightly fruity, and just a little sweet. For many years, I have been eating steel cut oats, mostly from Honeyville Farms. (See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN4XY">Steel Cut Oats CAN, 4.38 lb.</a>.) Steel cut oats are so much better than smashed oatmeal and groats are even better. I don't know if these groats are a different variety of oats or if it's just that they are whole groats, but the flavor is distinctly different from the steel cut. I love the steel cut, so this is not to denigrate them, but these groats have a much more complex flavor that I really like.<br /><br />The bad news, which I hope only pertains to this supplier, is the number of husks. Sometimes it's only 1-2/bowl. Sometimes it 1-2 in every spoonful. There is also something gritty from time to time. This really detracts from enjoying the rich, nutty flavor.<br /><br />Groats require a lot more cooking than steel cut and they absorb at least twice as much water. My cooking method for steel cut is to bring them to a boil in a 2:1 water:oats mixture and then leave in the frig overnight. That barely gets is started with groats.<br /><br />So far, the best method I have found is to simmer them in a 4:1 (water:groats) mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until almost all of the water is absorbed or gone. I use the microwave with 1/2 to 3/4 cup groats and 4x the water. I bring it to a boil and then simmer on low power. I usually set it for 30 minutes and then check. When almost all of the water is gone, I put them in the frig overnight (covered). Sometimes they are too dry the next day. I'm still experimenting with the details. I like the microwave because I don't have to be right there to make sure it doesn't go dry and burn. And if it sits a little while, that just continues the softening process.<br /><br />I tried cooking them in my rice cooker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G30ESY">Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel</a>). I used one scoop of groats (~3/4 cup) and, based on the results above, filled the pan to the 2-scoop level (double the amount of water). I set it to be ready at 8:30 the next morning. When I woke up, the house had a nice aroma of something cooking. It was a little like when I cook rice and a little like peanuts. Pleasant. When I opened the rice cooker, I found that the groats had expanded more than with the other methods. I added milk (half and half) and raisins and reheated in the microwave. The oatmeal was just about perfect. The groats had expanded to at least 2-3 times original size and were tender and soft, but still much more chewy than the steel cut. The yield was about 1.5-2.0 cups. Absolutely delicious, very filling, and completely different from steel cut oats.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. This really messed up the rice cooker. It cooked overnight, so I was not there so watch it, but I imagine that it bubbled up through the steam vent in the top. There was dried (cooked on) oat residue on the roof of the cooker and all inside the lid. I had to take it apart to clean it - about an hour. Do NOT try this at home. ;-)<br /><br />I imagine a slow cooker would work better, but I don't have one to try.<br /><br />I also want to try Moon Glough's suggestion of toasting them first.<br /><br />I also tried putting them in the food processor just to compare that with the steel cut. I tried several times with varying amounts of processing from just barely to almost a powder. They all came out like mush and tasted bland. It's a puzzle to me why the taste should be so much different.<br /><br />I love the taste, but am rating this product only 2 stars because of the husks and grit. It takes away too much of the enjoyment and it is not attractive if you are not eating alone. I'm going to try groats from other suppliers, including Honeyville farms. I hope someone has better quality control.

review/summary: Rich enough to replace coffee, amazing as that sounds!
review/text: My husband and I tried this tea because it was on sale locally (4.99 for 80 ct. bag) and it surprised us by becoming the TOP favorite for us both. It is rich like an Assam, malty, comforting with sugar and a dash of Half & Half for me, plain or with a little sugar for my hubby. I would have to say it is by far the smoothest yet heartiest cup of tea that we've ever enjoyed, and when the coffee runs out for my First Cup O'The Day, I'm switching to this tea for the gentler eye-opener.<br />Plus, the frugal gourmet within knows it's cheaper than coffee even if you use the bag once only. Hubby has a 2-cupper size mug and gets 2 quite hearty cups from 1 bag.<br />It is a bit odd to me to rave over a tea, but this is how I feel about it. If I opened a real tea room (instead of just a virtual one as I have now,) this tea would be the House's "Signature" Cup. It is impossible (given the time) to drink only one cup and not have an immediate refill. A perfect autumn-winter tea especially, with a nice round flavor that can stand up to spices and/or alcohol. In fact, I just talked myself into another cup right now. Cheers!

review/text: I absolutely love this chocolate. It is the only kind I'll eat because it's organic and made with sugar cane juice.<br /><br />I ordered this product on August 3.  When I came back to order it again after 21 days the price had increased by $9.  Unfortunately, they have priced them out of my range because that makes them $3.67 per bar + shipping.<br /><br />Too bad because these chocolates are YUMMY!

review/summary: Love all HappyBaby Tots!
review/text: My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!

review/summary: Convenient, healthy
review/text: My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones.

review/text: If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.  Also, it continues to be an easy way to get super foods into our toddlers without the preparation of the fruits and vegetables!  We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone.

review/text: My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.

review/text: This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it. If you have problem with this blend being to runny I solved it by using Boon spoon or Plum organics boon spoons for pouches which made it breeze to feed the baby.<br />My son loves all the other flavors he tried as well ( pear; pear & peas & broccoli; apples & cherry; banana & blueberries & beats ), he did not like sweet potato & apricot flavor, it was too tart and sour for him, but I contacted Happy Baby customer service and the next batch should have more sweet potato to help with the sour taste, but if you can buy just one pack and try it you might have a baby that likes it either way.<br />Most of all I love the packaging, it is perfect since we travel a lot and it is so much lighter then glass jars and easier to pack as well.

review/summary: Too sour for my baby
review/text: We tried this flavor when my son was almost 6 months and he wouldn't eat it. It is too sour even for me. I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well.

She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it!  She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering.  I like fresh mango, but for some reason the smell of mango baby food is just awful to me!  Other than that, a good product that I'll be ordering again.

review/text: I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.  She did try it, but gave it back to me after one bite.  Later, I tried to feed it to my baby with her oatmeal, and she didn't like it either!  I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor.

She likes applesauce anyway, but I thought I might be able to get her to eat some veggies if I could find them in a squeeze pouch too.  This fruit and veggie mix is perfect -- she gets some green veggies, but it really does taste just like pears!  I've tried several flavors, and this is her favorite by far.  My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too.

He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!

This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!

review/summary: Tasty & Nutritious in one easy to administer pouch!
review/text: My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

Anytime my 15 month-old twin boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their antioxidants and nutrients.<br /><br />It's especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage.  For the teethers, it's helpful to place a few pouches in the fridge.  For the picky eaters, it's helpful for us to administer a swig of this inbetween bites.  These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy.  If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food.  The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all.  Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later or if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack.  No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: My toddler LOVES these!!!  She begs for them the moment we get into the car when I pick her up from preschool.  The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's "break into them").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are WAY more expensive!  The taste is just as great!  Buy these!

review/text: The last couple of days, my son has been more of a fussy eater.  We even gave him pizza and he had a few bites and was frustrated by bite 5 or 6.  These had just come in the mail and I cracked one open.  He HOUSED the whole pack! That's a lot to be said for a child who eats a couple ounces at a time!  If I need a failsafe food, this flavor combination has done it!  5 Stars ALL THE WAY!

review/text: My daughter seemed to really enjoy the taste, but it made a huge mess because it was so watery.  I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Great Flavor but VERY thin
review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/summary: AWESOME Products
review/text: I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed.
