review/summary: Not for household consumption
review/text: Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.  Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee.  I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail.  DO NOT BUY this product.  Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices.  I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product.

review/summary: Usually good flavor, but thhis time it had terrible taste.
review/text: This is not the first time I order Lavazza Supercrema, and usually I liked it for my everyday espresso.<br /><br />However this time item was out of stock for a long time and I canceled subscription but forgot to cancel that particular order that was lingering until the product became available. Anyway, I ordered Grand Tiera as I couldn't wait for Supercrema and I got my initial bag of Supercrema unexpectedly but it was still OK as I had guests and beans were going like crazy until I got a big surprise when I brewed the first cup with these beans.<br /><br />I thought it must be something wrong with my machine or the water filter, so I tried to brew the other Grand Tiera beans that were almost over and the espresso was OK. Now I don't know how to return this full bag of Supercrema that is completely useless as Amazon policy doesn't allow returns on these items.

review/summary: Takes too long to Arrive
review/text: The item is as described by the opinions of the other reviewers. A more major issue is that Amazon ships it via the US Postal Service which can take (an already shelved product) 3 -7 days to arrive. Hey, this is coffee, and it only has a limited life to live. Taking into account that it's a large bag for home use we still must keep it allive for a few more weeks till were done with it. It's been 5 days since they shipped it, but I still don't have it and now I wonder how old it will become when it finally arrives. Amazon needs to use an alternate shipping methode

review/summary: For espresso as it was intended...
review/text: Traveling through Italy we always found good espresso and cappuccino; it seemed to be a matter of pride to make coffee properly.  The coffees we ran into most often were Lavazza and Illy.  For some reason, many here believe that espresso must be made with a very dark roast, explaining why one often  encounters espresso in our coffee shops and restaurants that is burnt tasting and bitter.  What is really wanted is more of a medium roast for good espresso and cappuccino.  I've used the Lavazza Super Crema in a DeLonghi espresso machine with excellent results.  Intense flavor, not burnt or bitter, and with good, three-layer separation of the crema.  Recommended.

review/summary: Not illy but affordable
review/text: Nothing compares to illy but based on value, this is a very good compromise.  From Italy, so not like your "over ripe" american roasts.  Subtle and slightly sour so you'll have to play around like everything else with the grind and the proportions.<br />Definitely a good buy especially if you sign up for the 15% discount for regular shipments.<br />Don't know if I'll use it all up in a month but that's what's the freezer is for.<br />Using a cuisinart burr grinder and a keurig k-cup machine for daily coffee.  Seems to work best on fine grind, with a little packing in the cup.  Middle cup size because small makes it a bit too sour for me.  No bitterness or burnt taste.<br />Using a Krups pump espresso maker for espresso.  Perfection.

review/summary: Excellent Northern Italian-style espresso
review/text: This makes an absolutely wonderful espresso. Rich, flavorful with chocolate notes and a nice lingering aftertaste. As the name suggests, the crema production is excellent.<br /><br />It's also, like most Lavazza beans, a pretty forgiving bean. Even if you don't hit the exact right temperature or are a bit off in your grind or dose, it will still produce a decent cup. Of course, if you nail the prep you'll get an outstanding cup, but it's not as finicky as other beans I've used.<br /><br />It also blends well with Lavazza Dek if you want to do a half-caf.<br /><br />Although I use this mainly for espresso, I also tried it as a pour-over and in a french press. Both turned out very nice, especially the french press.<br /><br />As with all Lavazza beans, it is a medium roast, which is the classic Northern Italian style. If you want a dark, oily bean, you won't be happy with this. I greatly prefer a medium roast since I never use milk in my espresso, and the medium roast allows all the flavors to come through without the heavy, burnt taste that's typical with dark roasts.<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/summary: Superb Whole Bean Coffee!!
review/text: I took a chance with this coffee and decided to try it based on the good reviews. I am very happy I did. Lavazza is rich in taste and is GREAT overall. I brought the 2.2 pound bag to work and all my colleagues who drink coffee complimented positively on its rich taste. As an Espresso, one would think it wouldn't be as strong as non-Espresso coffees, but this stuff has been stronger than most other coffees I've drank - and I drink coffee often. Other colleagues have said the same.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Lavazza - Gets Better With Age!  Tastes YUMMY After 2 Days!
review/text: This was my first time trying Lavazza Super Crema and I must say I was very disappointed the first day using these beans.  No matter what dose, tamp and temperature I brewed this espresso at on my Starbucks Sirena machine, I would always get a rather sour, almost "cheesy" tasting shot.  The beans were kept in an air-tight mason jar, after opening the bag, and they stayed in there neglected on my shelf for two days.  I was not looking forward to trying another espresso shot with them but when I finally did try again the taste was so much better!  Almost chocolately with a very nice layer of crema (I always use the non-pressurized basket in my portafilter).  It made a very good latte and I was very pleasantly surprised at how much better the flavor was.  Today, four days after receiving the Lavazza, I brewed two shots in my Sirena and each had a terrifc flavor...almost like gingerbread!  I never tasted espresso like that before.  It was incredible and I must say that these beans are getting better and better the longer they are sitting in my mason jar. I highly recommend the Lavazza Super Crema but, keep in mind, that the flavor is not that great the day or two after you first open the bag.  Let them sit for two days before pulling an espresso shot and the taste will only get better the following days.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Bitter, bitter, bitter
review/text: I allowed myself to be convinced by some of the glowing reviews of this coffee, but now regret it. The argument about the oil being inside the beans rather than oozing from the surface is wrong - the oil is long gone. These are some nasty little dried out brown beans. They produce an espresso (made with an old Pavoni with the traditional slot-machine arm) that is on the lower end of what I find acceptable, and they are probably unsuitable for any other method. Right now, for instance, I have a cup made with a French press, and it has very little deep coffee flavor, but instead a bitterness that sets my teeth on edge and a burnt toast aftertaste that is lasting way past its welcome (I used less than one measure of beans and water at 195 degrees F). I think the review objecting to black beans is just wrong - I have had any number of black roasted, oily beans that make better espresso while also lending themselves to other methods with good results. Among the bulk brands available on Amazon, I would prefer the Coffee Beans Direct Italian Roast Espresso to these beans, and the price is also better. Neither of them come close to Peet's, but that's another price point altogether.

review/summary: Reordered coffee - better quality
review/text: I used to work for a large Dutch coffee company and was in the food business for 20 years. I pride myself on having a good sense of taste. About a year ago I began purchasing Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee to make coffee lattes which I have been making at home for over 15 years. The coffee was amazing having a sweetness and without the heavy roasting you find from a company here in the US. It made for great drink.<br /><br />Previously, I rated this lower because the sweetness and the flavor seemed to be lacking. But, this last batch is much better so I increased my rating. Hope the quality continues as it had in the past.

review/text: This is pretty darn good coffee, although I should mention that I'm not an expert and I'm not overly picky. What I do know is that it tastes great and works superbly in our Breville espresso machine.

But for me, this has been about the best of the $10ish per lb coffees, and it's what my roommates usually ask me to get more of.

review/summary: Makes great espresso! A little light if you like dark roasts.
review/text: This was the first coffee that I bought through Amazon, and I have to say I was quite pleased with the taste and consistency. I like a medium espresso roast (burnt-tasting Starbucks is too dark for me), but this one was just a little too light for me. It wasn't a problem though, I just brewed longer shots for Americanos, lattes, etc. I recently switched to the Pienaroma from Lavazza and gave it a try. The Super Crema was a much fresher roast, and in the end pulled better shots from my machine. After about 3 weeks, the Pienaroma I had tasted completely stale and sour and I could hardly get any pressure when brewing it. Enough about the Pienaroma though. If you're looking for a great roast that you can't go wrong with, choose the Super Crema. You'll get a great smooth velvety taste every time! You may even be tempted to drink straight shots like I did (and usually never do).

review/text: I have used several brands of beans roasted specifically for espresso, but this is the one I have really enjoyed.  The flavor is rich and full.  It produces a nice crema when the grind is right as well as using the right pressure when compressing in the porta-filter.  I am using a Rocket Espresso Cellini now which seems to be doing a nice job with this bean. I did try Velton's coffee beans as sold by Seattle Coffee Gear.  They were very good as well but seemed a little too light for my taste. I prefer the Lavazza for the rich flavor pleasing as espresso or in a latte.

review/text: This coffee has a great aroma and makes an excellent cup of French Press, but I wasn't very impressed with it made as espresso in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG">DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker</a>.  It did have a nice head of crema, but was too mild and slightly bitter.  And for all of the "you-probably-made-it-wrong" people: I tampered it with 30 lbs of pressure, ground beans with my Capresso Infinity burr grinder, pulled 2oz shots in 22 seconds with about 1/3" of crema on top.  I played around with grind and tamper a bit, but nothing seemed to help.<br /><br />I wound up mixing it 50/50 with Starbucks Espresso Roast, and the combination is phenomenal!  There are qualities about each I like, but mixing them together made one of the best shots of espresso I've ever had.  It's smokey, earthy and chocolaty... I'm drooling as I write this.

Starbucks does that because their coffee is harsh. I drink this espresso straight or with a dash of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and some splenda. Saves time and money and still tastes great.<br /><br />I haven't tried the other Italian espressos, so I can't compare this to those, but I have been really happy so far.

The roast is lighter than previous coffees I tried yet the flavor and body was fully up to par without any hint of bitterness.  I have used this blend to make espresso, cappuccino, regular (American) coffee, and lattes and received excellent reviews from friends and family.  I was so impressed with this product that I get automatic monthly shipments. (Which, by the way, reduced the actual cost of the coffee and included free shipping).

review/text: This is one of the best espressos from Lavazza.  I use this one everyday.  It leaves a beautiful crema with no bitter taste.  I have a Saeco Odea, and it seems to only like Lavazza beans!  The beans are never burnt and always comes fresh.  I highly recommend this for any type of espresso drink.

review/summary: Very good, but not super robust
review/text: I do not have a huge amount of espresso bean experience.  I've been grinding my own beans for drip coffee for many years, but just started my home espresso operation.  Compared to some other beans I've tried, the Lavazza beans were distinctly less oily.  There's a bit of "chaff" or "husk" during the grinding process.  This may be perfectly normal, but I was more accustomed to oily beans that maintained a bit of heaviness.<br /><br />The flavor is good and balanced, although not at all aggressive or robust.  (This could have something to do with my process, I really can't speak to that.)<br />Pulling a double to make caps or macchiatos, the flavor is very satisfying.  However, the additional milk in a latte bumps the need to at least a triple shot.<br /><br />No burnt flavor at all.  Crema is easy and consistent.

review/summary: The best brand for real cappuccino
review/text: I used a new bag of this to try in my brand-new Breville Barista espresso maker today.  The results were fantastic!  The coffee came out with that golden brown crema, touched with chocolate, and made for a superior drinking experience.  Not bitter at all!  I was so impressed I cancelled previous coffee subscriptions of other brands and will now claim this as my #1 whole bean for perfect cappuccinos.<br /><br />Lavazza's Crema e Gusto is still my #1 for ground coffee.<br /><br />Even upon opening the bag I was overwhelmed with the dark golden coffee beans.  The aroma isn't as robust as Italian roast, but the coffee itself was smooth, not bitter, yet rich and flavorful.<br /><br />The price and quality can not be beat.  I've had more expensive coffee beans that didn't even come close to this.  Please look at the attached images I included showing the golden-brown crema of these beans after they have been grinded and brewed in my Breville Barista Espresso machine.

review/text: After using Gevalia espresso beans for years, I decided to try something different.  I read all the great reviews for these beans and was excited to try them.<br />I wish I could say something positive.  Upon opening the bag, the beans were dry and not oily at all like I'm use to.  I ground some beans and made my first couple shots. Flavor was blah.  I thought maybe I didn't get a good grind or brew.  No such luck.  All other shots are the same.  Lacking flavor and actually not very much crema either considering this was the super crema.  Maybe I just got a bad bag, don't know.  I guess I will try another brand or try the other Lavazza beans.

I read several reviews before purchasing this brand, and am extremely pleased with the way the coffee tastes.  Sooooo much better than Starbucks.  I can't believe the difference!  However, I should have purchased a smaller quantity since it is taking me quite a while to use up a 2 pound bag.  I understand that coffee should be used up fairly soon after the bag has been opened.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, excellent service
review/text: If you think that espresso means that your coffee beans are charred black and that the coffee should taste burned like Starbucks', then this coffee is not for you. Instead, if you are looking for a rich taste, aroma, and crema, I can recommend this coffee very highly. If brewed right, this coffee will have very rich undertones, without bitterness, and with a hint of chocolate. I have tried Illy as well, and while do I like the Illy, I prefer this Lavazza variety (the Illy is also more expensive). For those who haven't tried the Lavazza yet, I suspect that quite a few among you might like it, especially if Starbucks' taste is too harsh for you.

review/text: For a latte person like myself, this Lavazza coffee is pretty good. I've made it my morning coffee.  I have found other coffees that I liked better, but they're usually pricier. For example, illy coffee is good and all but I think the price is a bit too high, and there are other good coffees that are even more pricey. This Lavazza bag is a good size bag of coffee at a reasonable price, and the coffee tastes pretty good (if you like a less bitter coffee). The shipping is quick too, overall a good purchasing experience.

review/text: This roast of Lavazza beans is a wonderful tasting medium, which appeals to a wide variety of people. Bold flavor, but not bitter or burnt tasting. For those who like their beans especially oily, these are not, so you may not enjoy this as much as others that are. Lavazza isn't kidding with they call this their Super Crema espresso. There is a good amount on top of every shot pulled using these beans. The bag I received was very fresh, so I had no problem with a earlier expiration date, that a few others had mentioned. These are a great choice if you're going to be serving several people, and are interested in something that would appeal to everyone.

review/text: The Lavazza Super Crema does make nice crema and is a nice tasting lighter coffee. You need to go to finest grind on my Krups Espresseria to make espresso with a stronger flavor, which then has a slight harshness in the taste. Overall, not as rich or as mellow as the Peet's Mocha Java we regularly use. All in all, the Super Crema a very good, but not great cup of coffee.

So I trusted the reviews here and went out on a limb and ordered the 2.2 pound bag of Super Crema and I have NOT been disappointed! I actually look forward to getting out of my cozy bed so I can enjoy a few demitasse cupfuls of this delicious crema! I hope it stays on the Amazon market  so I always have plenty on hand and don't have to search for another trustworthy brand of everday (for me) espresso.

Lavazza is a household name in Italy, and one of the most trusted brands when it comes to coffee. To top it, the Subscribe-and-Save from Amazon makes this coffee a great deal and I don't even need to worry about restocking when I go to the grocery store. I would highly recommend it.

Amazon has a competitive price for Lavazza and now I get it delivered monthly for an even better price. Anyway, after trying a variety of beans my first order of Lavazza Super Crema arrived and I was amazed at how smooth it was - almost like hot chocolate - no bitterness. One warning, it takes so good and is so smooth that you can easily become over-caffeinated! Now I have added another Lavazza coffee to my menu, a Decaffeinated Espresso Ground, that comes in 8 oz cans from Amazon.

review/summary: Not as good as their "Top Class" in my opinion
review/text: I love Lavazza, but I think their super crema beans don't have quite as enjoyable a flavor as their "top class" beans - at least when it comes to pulling straight shots of espresso.<br /><br />If you are making lattes or an Americano or something, then I don't think the difference would be noticed. Myself, I think the Top Class beans have slightly more flavor. Crema production seems to be about the same in both cases. I'm using a manual lever machine (an old La Pavoni), so it may not product quite as much crema as a pump machine.<br /><br />The Super Crema is still a good bean, but again, the Top Class seems to edge it out as far as producing a really smooth tasting shot of espresso.

review/summary: Flavor has changed...it is now terrible!!
review/text: I have been drinking this flavored coffee for over a year. Up until now I have loved it. But the last package I got ( in the new packaging and labeling scheme) is absolutely terrible. The aroma is wrong and the taste is now sickeningly sweet. What used to be a slight hint of vanilla now hits you in the face like a wet glove. The coffee's flavor is absoulutely awful. I am sending it back for a refund immediately. So far the other Gevalia coffees I have are still really good but this one is a disaster after the formula for was apparently changed.

review/text: My daughter likes this. It tastes just like anything Swiss Hazelnut should. Still has good strong coffee flavor but seems to need less sugar. Maybe it's just the smell, tricking us but either way I guess less sugar is a good thing. If you like Swiss Hazelnut flavored things you will like this.

review/summary: Changed product!!  Tastes awful!
review/text: I have been drinking Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut for Tassimo for YEARS (at least 5) and have been on a subscription plan for delivery.  Just opened one of the newly packaged products.  Not only has the packaging changed, the product has changed immensely!  It used to be a flavored coffee, pretty much unsweetened, but now it is LOADED with a sugar substitute and tastes positively disgusting. I'm sensitive to sugar substitutes, so a little WARNING about these changes would have been GREATLY appreciated.  I now have several packages of this coffee that will end up in the garbage.  It's been so sad to see the decline of number of products available for Tassimo, but now to see what little they have left starting to change for the worse - I guess it's time to switch to Keurig (as much as I really don't want to).  I have cancelled all further subscriptions for this product.

review/text: About 1 out of every 3 disks is bad & to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse? Tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the "original" post office package has been opened? How do you know a product is inferior if you don't open it? Tassimo refused to credit my credit card for unordered merchandise while their website was under revision, refused to pay for unordered return package because the outside envelope had been opened so I could see what was inside, etc. I'm stuck with the coffee maker until it no longer works. Their customer service was argumentative and their responses to my problems were not uniform resulting in serious delays & confusion.

review/summary: SWILL Hazelnut
review/text: This used to be a fairly decent flavored coffee, but the last batch I bought tasted like someone had dumped half a vat of cheap vanilla extract and half a vat of bad artificial sweetener in it.  Five phone calls to Tassimo "Customer Service" (worst in the world), one phone call to Kraft Customer Service (Tassimo's parent corporation), and on phone call to Gevalia customer service failed to produce an explanation.  Thank goodness I bought the Krapp from Amazon, because one e-mail to Amazon produced a refund.  I would NEVER buy this Swill Hazelnut again, and in fact, I would not have bought the Tassimo machine (which is actually a pretty good one) had I known how bad the customer disservice is.

review/summary: Not enough punch!
review/text: This coffee comes in a shallow disc, similar to the Starbucks espresso discs. It smells good while it is dripping but if you watch the coffee as it comes out, about 1/3 of it looks pretty much like water. And what you get is a cup of coffee that still smells good but is very weak on flavor. I don't want to waste it but I need to read the manual again and see if I can stop the process before all that's coming through is water. Then I'd use 2 discs and hopefully get a real cup of hazelnut flavored coffee.

review/text: I like the Gevalia better than the Starbucks Caffe Verona my husband first bought me. The Starbucks is way too strong and bitter, in my opinion. However, I'm a "foo-foo" coffee lover, the more fancy the flavor the better. I like the Swiss Hazelnut as a basic coffee; although it's even a bit on the strong side, but not bad. I add the latte creamer or cappacino creamer to it...using a BIG cup.

review/text: I am a faithful Tassimo fan, and Swiss Hazelnut has become my favorite coffee. The aroma alone is worth it.<br /><br />I am equally ecstatic about Amazon's very intelligent packaging, which I hope will set a trend for traditional retailers as well. Now that I am getting older and crankier, I get very angry when I return home from WalMart or Target, only to find that both my mental and physical health are jeopardized when I try, for example, to open a blister pac of batteries.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon, for doing what is environmentally right, for making shopping easy, and for avoiding the very real insult to honest consumers embodied in anti-theft packaging that requires our time, effort, and physical well being.

review/text: I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for "emergency" use for me.

review/summary: Love this K-Cup flavor!
review/text: I've been percolating coffee for 30+ years. To me, there is nothing like a percolator for a really good, HOT cup of coffee. However, even though I only drank two cups per day, if I missed my morning java, I would get one of those 'caffeine headaches;' not very pleasant. So, about 10 years ago, I started mixing equal parts of regular and decaffeinated coffee, thus solving my problem; I could still get a little caffeine boost without the withdrawal. Then we got a Keurig at work, and while I really liked the convenience, I didn't want to go back to 100% caffeineated coffee. I tried two different decaf K-Cup flavors and they were terrible. Then I heard about Half-Caff. It's delicious; a perfect blend of caffeine & decaf, and dare I say, just as good as my percolated coffee, which I never imagined. Actually, I have to say its better because of the convenience. In short, because of Half-Caff, I bought a Keurig for my house, and Half-Caff is the only flavor K-Cup I use (I don't like flavored coffee) Highly recommended! Well, gotta go have my coffee now...

It has much more flavor, still not as good as regular coffee but now I can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about falling asleep when I go to bed. Great!
