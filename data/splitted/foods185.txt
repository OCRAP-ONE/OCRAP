review/summary: SF Pistachio Pudding Mix
review/text: I make a great Watergate Salad (from the Jell-O website)with this product, and it is all sugar-free.  I leave out the marshmallows, and I use pineapple packed in its own juice and sugar-free Cool Whip.  My diabetic friends rave over this dessert and the non-diabetic friends love it also!  The pudding mixes easily with the liquids and is never pasty.  This is really a great product.

review/text: I've tried both versions of Pistachio Jell-O (with and without sugar). I understand eating the sugar-free version for health reasons, but it's sadly lacking, and not just because of the lack of sweetness.<br /><br />The regular version:<br />-Is thicker (more like a custard)<br />-Has a stronger pistachio flavor<br />-Has more actual pistachio bits (the sugar-free version has maybe 1/4 as many)<br /><br />Either way, pudding is a great comfort food if you're looking for a tasty snack.

review/summary: One Of The Better Flavors
review/text: If you've never used these mixes before, they're easy enough even for a lazy oldtimer who doesn't like to spend time in the kitchen.  I'll sit in front of the TV and spend two minutes whisking it up on the coffee table, right in the measuring cup itself, which makes it easy to pour into a bowl or bowls.  I usually fix two packages at a time, so use my four-cup Pyrex, available on Amazon (geesh, that sounded like a commercial).<br /><br />The result is... well, much more than worth that two minutes.<br /><br />Flavor is a matter of taste; but, for me, this pistachio is one of their better flavors.  You won't find big chunks of nut floating around; but there are enough little granules to remind you that this is pistachio.<br /><br />Unless you don't feel like a nut, I'll recommend this flavor and this easy dessert.

I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company.

review/summary: Only ILLY for this filly ;-P...
review/text: The Illy company was set up in 1933 in Italy by a Hungarian officer who had come to Trieste with the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, and stayed. Today, the company remains with the Illy family, with the founder's grandson at the helm. They have 700 employees and sell their brand in over 100 countries. The company uses only Arabica beans, purchased directly from the farmer, rather then the middleman, and produces only one superiour blend.<br /><br />So much for Google info ;o)... Now, here is my personal Illy "journey":<br /><br />I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect (quality vs quantity). I like my coffee very strong, but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong brands induce (Starbucks would be one). I was introduced to Illy by a co-worker a few years ago, and have not looked back... It provides the strength I crave, with a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Yes, this coffee will grow hair on your chest(figuratively...). The coffee is packed in air free conditions (with nitrogen gas), to help preserve the taste. When you pull of the inner metal seal, you will hear the air hissing its way into the can. The metal cap is a twist off. It is designed to be air tight as well, to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.<br /><br />Regarding the brewing process: for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively (I believe it delivers a stronger/sweeter brew). I find the medium grind/medium roast "blue band" Illy to be perfect for the purpose. The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press. Do not over-agitate the French press after brewing and you will be ok. Alternately, you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction (sadly, I am too lazy for that...).<br /><br />Regarding Amazon price and service: Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country. Where I live, it requires a trip to the local mall... So, I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall, with the cost free, directly to my door, service. The item arrived promptly, with the "open by" date fourteen months away. I am a happy customer!<br /><br />I hope the coffee will work for you as well!

review/text: Just purchased this at Safeway for $15.99 per 8.8 oz. can which of course is $31.98 for the two that Amazon is offering here for more than $35.00(too expensive) however for ready ground coffee it is AMAZING.  It actually smells and tastes as if one had just put it through the grinder seconds before it went into the machine.

review/text: This is hands down one of the best coffees I have ever had. Not bitter, smooth, wonderful full body flavor and not acidic. I was surprised when I opened the can, the grind is very fine, finer than what I would consider using for a drip coffee pot. I just used less grounds to adjust for the fine grind. I think the Amazon price is high. I usually purchase this at my local grocery for $12.99 per can

review/summary: Decent if you lack a grinder
review/text: Now that I have a coffee grinder, I buy whole-bean coffee nowadays, but this Illy pre-ground coffee was adequate back in the day. The instructions on the side of the can -- I can't remember what the instructed proportions are -- will produce unusually weak coffee. For drip coffee, I recommend the standard 2 Tbsp coffee per 6 oz. water. This grind is too fine for a French press, but it's good for paper filters in drip coffee machines. I hear that Illy packs their coffee in nitrogen to help preserve flavor and aroma. I don't know if that's true or not, but the canisters Illy produces have a metal pop-top seal under the lid, so you're probably getting fresher coffee from Illy than you'd get from other brands of ground coffee.

review/summary: Not as good as in store
review/text: Earlier this year, a colleague pointed out that I live right next to an illy.  Hearing that they have good coffee, I went and found my latte to be marvelous, better than anything at Starbucks or Caribou coffee.  Since then, I gone in on numerous occasions and had their full range of drinks, including their drip coffee.  Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.  I dunno if they use fresher beans or what, but I found this coffee from Amazon to be dull, flavorless and definitely not worth the $26 price.  I only used 1/2 of the canister before switching over to Peets.  If you're in the mood for illy's, you should just go to their cafe to get a cup, otherwise brew something else at home.

review/summary: Way overpriced; only average taste
review/text: Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so "out of this world"? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: "Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.<br /><br />'nuff said.

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

review/summary: Good chips with an occasional bad aftertaste
review/text: These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Best flavor, hands down of Popchips is barbeque!!
review/text: I bought a multi-box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy, sweet, flavorful, fun, crispy, lower fat than chips, I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

review/text: We all have our vices, mine has always been chips.  Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!

They are light and as far as junk food goes they are healthy..'er than your regular chip. They do not leave your fingers greasy or any oily / greasy feel or taste in your mouth. That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag. Like I said I just love these chips!

In fact, I HAVE to get them in the small bags or I will eat a whole large bag...it's one of those. Hickory, salty, hint of sweetness.<br /><br />They aren't fried or fake baked to taste fried.

The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

My kids love the chips and, I agree, they are YUMMY!  I'm sad that I can't have them!  :-(

review/summary: Salt & Pepper Popchips - I crave these!
review/text: If you like hot peppery spicey food (and drink), you will like these.  I get a craving for them.  Of course, I like to drink Habanero Margaritas -- yes, there is such a thing! -- so you may prefer to order the Popchips variety case first (you'll get 3 packages of these in the case) to see how your taste buds react.

review/summary: THE BEST CHIPS, EVER!!!
review/text: I first sampled these chips at a volleyball tournament in California.  I'm a big chip lover, and these are by far the best chips I've ever had.  Better than the baked; not greasy at all, sturdy for dips.  I highly recommend these chips to any chip lover!  (I've not purchased them from Amazon, so I don't know how they will fare during shipping.)
