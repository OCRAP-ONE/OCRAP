review/summary: Switching from Texmati
review/text: I ordered this rice, willing to take a chance, and it turned out be the best brown rice Ive ever eaten or made.<br />I have a rice maker that I have been using to make texmati rice and it was always ok, but the Nishiki rice cooks flawlessly.  Just set the rice maker to brown rice add the rice and fill with water to brown rice line and let it do its thing.(no rinsing or soaking etc.)  The rice comes out perfect!!  The texture of the rice is "meaty" it has substance without being cruchy or undercooked.  The taste is somewhat "nutty and rich".  If your on the fence try it I believe youll be happy.

review/summary: Great rice.
review/text: Excellent quality rice. This rice is especially good for those who are iffy on the taste of brown rice as this rice has a much milder flavor profile. The whole family enjoys this rice.  Admittedly, I purchased this rice from an Asian market for less than $20 and do not plan on ordering from Amazon. But if you don't live close to an ethnic market and want a high quality, mild tasting brown rice, this is your brand.

review/summary: Oh, finally some brown rice I can eat daily
review/text: I've been buying small amounts of brown rice at all the health food stores in Denver, my new home. Prices range from expensive to ridiculous; I've had stores order special types in for me to try.<br /><br />I don't know why I took a chance on buying a bag this large, but since I eat only steel-cut oats and brown rice as grains I will be using a lot of it.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I did. This rice has a great smell while it's cooking, I put it in my Zojirushi cooker and it didn't take all that long to have perfect rice.<br /><br />I use this rice in a variety of ways, even putting honey in it and using it as a breakfast cereal. My palate is undoubtedly weird, but I don't care, my diet has saved my life.<br /><br />As I will be eating this rice nearly every day, I'm very pleased with the price and thrilled with the flavor and texture.

review/summary: Great flavor, but not for sushi.
review/text: This rice has a wonderful flavor and texture. However, in the description it said it was great for sushi. Do not be fooled. Short grain rice makes the best sushi as it stays together very well.<br /><br />Though when cooked properly this medium-grain rice is STICKIER than the long grain variety, you may have difficulty trying to make any recipe where it is necessary for the rice to stick together.<br /><br />If you like rice to be somewhere between sticky and separated, then this is perfect for you. If you're looking for a good brown sticky sushi rice, stick with short grain.

review/summary: Its brown rice.....
review/text: Ofcourse we all know brown rice is healthier than white rice, and im eating this now because ive gone on a stricter diet to lose fat and build some muscle...so i bought this rice. I dont know how or what brown rice is supposed to taste like but this rice is pretty much flavorless (reason for 4 stars) the other reviewers say its quite good and flavorful but honestly its really not. But id rather have flavorless rice than nasty tasting rice. I have no problem eating it at all. Its healthy and it does not taste bad. Also as a final note, it does take a bit longer to cook than white rice, i dont why but it does and its not THAT much longer though. I very much recommend this rice. If your looking for some good healthy brown rice, this is a good one. If your looking for some flavorfull brown rice, this isnt it, but it doesnt taste bad though.

review/text: We couldn't find bulk brown rice in stores from this brand (we really liked Nishiki white rice) so of course we checked Amazon and they had it.<br /><br />It's every bit as good as white rice and is more filling.  We usually use it in stir fry and can't really taste the difference between white rice.<br /><br />Eaten plain, you can tell there is a slightly different texture and a very slight "nutty" aftertaste which you can't detect if you add any kind of meat/sauce to the rice. It's still really good.

review/text: This knife/cutting board combo is awesome.  Not only is it beautiful (red alder with maple and walnut accent), it's amazingly functional!<br /><br />Knife stashes in the board when not in use, board leans nicely against counter backsplash.<br /><br />When ready to use, simply pull the knife from the indentation, plop your fresh bread onto the board and slice away.  The knife is sharp, long, and simple to use.  Thick or thin, all slices look like professional cuts.<br /><br />When you're finished, dust the crumbs off the board, place the knife in it's holder, and replace it against the backsplash.  Looks good and works great!

review/text: This board and slicer came up in my search for bread slicing guides, and looked wonderful so I wanted to believe it would be a more solid replacement for our second Norpro slicing guide, which is perfect, but not very durable. It turns out that the stripe in the picture that looks as if it might be a guide, isn't. For those of you who are handy enough to cut straight pieces of bread without help, then this is probably a wonderful set, but in our house we need those guides to go by or the pieces come out all lopsided, so I will need to return this and keep looking. I'm giving it 4 stars as a compromise, although it's probably worth 5 for you talented folks who don't need the guides, and 3 or less for those of us who do.

review/text: I was looking for a snack cracker that was gluten free and thought I'd try these.  When I first saw the cracker I thought they would be bland and tasteless.  However, because they themselves do not have a strong flavor I have been able to enjoy them with cheese, hummus, cream cheese for lunch, and also with fruit-flavored cream cheeses and jams and jellies.  I had some this morning with my omelet.  This is a really versatile cracker! Wonderful for watching calories, too; no trans fat. Try them; you'll love them, too.

I bought these crackers without any hope of enjoying them, but was surprised to see them disappearing quickly, everyone loved them!<br /><br />Usually products that restrict nutritional items - be it fat, sugar, gluten - charge a big price in the taste department  ;-)<br /><br />Not these - in fact, to enjoy a good cheese, it's much better to have a cracker without too much flavor, just great texture and mouth feel.<br /><br />These will be in our pantry as a regular item - plus, each cracker has only 17 calories!  My kind of treat, hands down!

review/text: Amazon was kind enough to take a return on this item, but what is pictured is not what you will receive.  The picture shows Goya Frijoles Negros Volteados (refried bean paste).  This is a common dish in Guatemala where my family is from; however, what I actually received was Frijoles Negros Refritos (refried beans).  If you have ever eaten frijoles volteados, you will recognize that there is a fairly significant difference.<br /><br />After some research, I have learned that Goya no longer makes frijoles volteados -- apparently, they were selling the Ducal brand in America under the Goya name.  You can now buy the Ducal brand in the U.S. (I believe Ducal is owned by Goya and I think they have been selling it under the Ducal brand in the U.S. for a number of years now).  If you purchase Ducal refried black beans, you will be getting frijoles volteados.  Add some queso seco or sour cream and enjoy!

review/summary: Pro Plan is the Favorite
review/text: HERE IS THE STORY OF HOW THE PRODUCT FARED AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My kitties have been eating Fancy Feast for 4 0r 5 years. I get most of their supplies through Subscribe and Save plans through Amazon. However, when I make an outing to Petco, I look around to see what is new in the cat food aisle, browse through the Toy Line, and pick up an odd and end along the way.<br />Once day while visiting my local Petco, I was checking out Fancy Feast to see if they had any new flavors out. Nooooooo! An employee happened along and asked if she could help me. Rather than give her the standard "No thank you," I told her of my delimma. My cats were growing tired of their routine diet. She said the same thing had happend to her, so she had given some of the new ProPlan flavor a try. She found that her kitties loved the fare that came in bites. Neither her cats, nor mine, are fanciers of Pates.<br />So I found several new flavors for my spoiled loved ones and took them home for a try. Salmon and Rice were the first cans I picked out because this flavor is so obviously in bite size form. I also found a Trout entree and one with Beef and Chicken.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODFW48">Pro Plan Trout & Pasta Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Sauce</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F2AYH6">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Beef and Chicken Entr&eacute;e (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br />I took these offerings home to my kids and they were estatic! Salmon and Rice was a Favorite!!!!!!!!!!<br />They licked their platter clean with no complaints.<br />I have four kitties and they have just seen the vet who says they are all healthy and says their diet seems to be fine.<br />I sat the kitties down and had a long conversation with them about how we should rate this entree. Because the can says it is for Indoor Use, we were hoping that on the days that they had Salmon and Rice, that their "potty smells" would not be so offensive. (Well, they did not really seem all that worried about THEIR SMELLS, but I was hoping). However, there is no change along those lines. Then they collectively pointed out that a Pro Plan Product called Seafood Stew (I cannot find it on Amazon) is their absolute favorite and the Trout is their second favorite.<br />So, after much meowing, batting Dah Bird about, and waltzing off for a potty break, they all collectively agreed on 4 Stars. Having spent 30 minutes in negotiating this very enlightened discusion, all four decided on a nap in their favorite Cat Tree. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GRBCHW">80" Cat Furniture Tree Condo House Scratcher Pet Furniture</a><br /><br />So, I was left with the  actual work of writing the review and grading the cat food. I was very temped to give the product 5 stars because my kitties gobble it down and are so healthy, but given the work that they did to make this decision, I will abide by their decision. Four Stars it is! Very good cat food. If your fair haired ones likes his/her meals in bites, and like seafood, then this should be a hit. Perhaps your kitty will give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Thank you from Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom and Mercy

review/text: I bought this rice after trying it once in Hawaii and have left the other ones behind for good. It is a happy medium between brown rice and white rice, has an excellent nutty flavor rather than the stronger one of brown rice or the nothingness of white. The texture is grainy and a bit sticky, it can be used in place of either brown or white rice. I pressure cooked it (4c water/3c rice, two tsp salt and a splash of rice wine) for 18 min. and it comes out perfect every single time.

review/summary: LOVE this obscure rice!
review/text: I describe this rice as a perfect compromise between Brown and White rice.  It retains lots of the nutrients and fiber from the Brown rice, but tastes much more like an excellent White rice, as well as having a short cook time.  It could easily be mistaken for White rice if you see it in a pot.<br /><br />I wish this rice was more common.  The price used to be much cheaper and included free shipping.  If the price ever comes back to around $2/lb. with free shipping, I will buy a few bags more at once.

review/text: This Healthy Request version of Chunky Chicken Noodle is delicious. It tastes the same as the regular version, which isn't true of all of the varities of Healthy Request soup.<br /><br /> Before I start to warm the soup. I add a package of Ramen noodles, without the flavoring packet. The Ramen noodles absorb the chicken flavor of the liquid for a great taste. And makes for an inexpensive, and filling, complete meal that is quick and easy to prepare. With much less salt than the regular version.

review/summary: Converting a healthy choice into an unhealthy feast
review/text: Being a senior citizen and all, I know how to stretch a buck here and there. If I don't, I go hungry, or at the very least have to see if Meals on Wheels has a few TV dinners to spare. When Campbell's chunky soups hit around a buck fifty or so, I start stocking the pantry.<br /><br />This soup is supposed to be healthy. I don't actually pay much attention to that. It tastes pretty good, it's filling, and I can even identify chunks of chicken amidst all the noodles. This makes it a good base for some further enhancements--more salt, some Parmesan cheese, Louisiana hot sauce, baco-bits, you name it. These chunky soups are an excellent opportunity for some culinary experimentation.<br /><br />If you're really determined to be healthy, then the basic soup is certainly as good as anything else out there. But at $1.50 a can or so, we might as well cut loose and party a little. A cheap thrill here and there is certainly better than daytime TV.

review/summary: Best canned cat food for the price!
review/text: I adopted my cat from the local shelter about 7 years ago. We bought him the standard Purina dry cat food from the grocery store and he was fine for a couple years, until he started throwing up a lot. His stomach would hurt so bad he would hide in a closet or a corner and just moan. We took him to the vet and they told us he had a sensitive stomach; they said we either needed to change his food or he would have to get steroid shots every couple months--obviously we opted for new food, which they recommended as science diet sensitive stomach (only available in dry). His symptoms got better but he still threw up a lot and his coat was dull and full of dandruff.<br /><br />So, we did our homework, and found out that science diet is the fancy brand for Purina--full of fillers and unidentifiable ingredients (and costs the same as higher-end, natural foods to boot!). After much research we chose to try Natural Balance canned food due to it being relatively inexpensive and also full of natural ingredients. Right away we noticed a difference in our cat. He hasn't thrown up since, his coat is full, shiny, and beautiful, and he loves the taste of it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Trust me, it's worth the cost to keep your cat healthy and strong! Couldn't be happier with the results.

review/text: My cat's vet strongly recommended a wet food diet because she's pretty chubby. (4 pounds overweight.) He promised that the weight would just fall off. He wasn't kidding. After two weeks she has lost a whole pound.<br /><br />Per my cat's vet, the feeding instructions on the can aren't quite right. He said that a cat should weigh 10 pounds or less, so one can per day should be enough. Half a can in the morning and half at night seems to work pretty well.

review/summary: Healthy Cat Food at a Reasonable Cost
review/text: After the second cat of three cats in my household started having problems with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, I got serious about researching cat foods and decided to try Natural Balance. They make a totally grain-free hard cat food that I decided to supplement with their wet food. My cats love the Natural Balance wet cat food. The taste is obviously good to them and nutritionally it is a much healthier choice than Science Diet or Iams. Because Natural Balance contains more protein than cat foods that are loaded with grains and other fillers that cats do not need, it is slightly higher in calories. Thus, you may need to feed your cats slightly less than you are used to if you make the switch or consider the Reduced Calorie version. I am very pleased with the results of this cat food. Within a very short period of time, there was almost complete resolution of the vomiting/diarrhea/GI issues of my cats and their stool is less foul smelling. While two of my cats have always had lovely coats, one did not and his coat is now wonderfully soft in a way that it has never been. I will never go back to other wet foods.<br />Amazon has the best prices I've seen for Natural Balance (a little over $1 per can for the 6 ounce cans of wet food) and it's convenient to have it delivered to my door rather than trekking to the pet store. One 6 oz. can is dense enough to feed all 3 of my cats for one meal and they seem full for about 8-12 hours. So far I've tried the Indoor Formula and Ocean Fish. My cats did not love the Duck and Green Pea hard food so I've avoided feeding the wet food version of that flavor and can't vouch for it. The cost is a little more than Iams or Science Diet but my cats are worth it and I am probably saving a little because they require less hard food overall.

review/text: I have 3 cats and was feeding them the Pro Plan, which is a pricey food when you consider the poor ingredients.  I am currently feeding a combination of this food, Wellness and Trader Joes. My local pet store sells this for the same price as Wellness though, and Wellness has no grains so I may switch to that as this does contain some. Ingredient list very similar to Traders Joes Turkey and Giblets formula at 69 cents a can. This is the only formula of theirs that does not contain brewers rice. I also supplement with a little Wellness Core/Indoor formula mixed. So far no problems , litter box smells far better.

review/text: Very good product,it helps our (completely) indoor cats to maintain a healthy weight.  They like it and eat it well.  HOWEVER, based on ordering at least 30 cases, you should expect at least one can per case to be so crushed as to be unusable.  Two or three other cans per case will be dented, but usable.  As the outside packages arrive in good shape the damage must be occuring prior to shipment.

review/summary: My Cats will not touch this
review/text: I wish I had success with this food. I just purchased it because I read all the great reviews, I have 6 cats, all were formal ferals and rescued by me, along with ,many others I have found homes for. I have had cats my entire life (and other animals), and am older, so have a strong history with their food likes and dislikes. Not one of my six cats will touch this food. They eagerly wait for "dinner" I open the can, they sniff it and walk away. One even made a burying motion over it which was comical. They do have dry Fromm Cat food available at all times, but love canned as well. After reading how bad the supermarket available brands were for cats, I decided to try some "better ones". They have become quite finicky lately for some reason..but they at least will lick other brands. They want nothing to do with this food at all. I even left it in the bowl overnight, removed the dry, and it was untouched in the morning. I still am trying entice my cats with it by mixing in tuna and other cat foods, no luck. I bought a whole case, so have been giving the untouched food to the raccoons that forage in my woods at night, they have been eating it, so it was not a total waste. I know it is a great company and good food, but my cats will not go near it.

review/summary: Not yuck... YUMMMMM IT IS!
review/text: I came across Dr Oetker's Organic Cake mixes & icing several months ago. I LOVE IT! My boys, daughter in laws, grandchildren, many other family members, friends & also members of my church. I am sure some may "dislike" Dr Oetker's icing, but if you love a old fashioned, creamy, rich and TASTES YUMMY then you WILL like Dr Oetker's Organic icings and cake mixes. The "grainy" referral from the preceding review is SUGAR. I am 47 & my Scotish grandmother used to make old fashioned cream icing that had a lovely sugar crystal crunchiness (very fine and not an over-kill of crystals). Both the Vanilla & Chocolate Organic icings by Dr Oteker has this wonderful old fashioned flare and DELICIOUS. The chocolate reminds me of a fudge icing. If you are looking for a foo-foo fluffy, whipped or the store bought plastic cup of artificial fake gunk in a tub or ground carob health store blandish food types then by all means - "DO NOT" ORDER DR OTEKER. Buf if you appreciate sweetness, richness, old fashioned tasty delights - "DO" ORDER DR OTEKER!!! Do not allow 1 persons negative review desuade you from trying and posting your own "positive" OR "negative" review. Thank you for your time in reading.

review/text: I actually bought this at Wal-Mart, for about $2.50. I wanted to try it because at only 140 cals per serving (for the mix only, as packaged) it comes in at 20 cals less than Pillsbury, plus hello, it's organic. I made it as cupcakes and they sank in, in the middle. Also, the consistency is way more like a corn muffin than vanilla cake. Kind of grainy, and actually the taste is quite reminiscent of cornbread too. Pretty gross!

review/summary: BEST Cornbread I've ever eaten...PERIOD!
review/text: We are eating gluten free by choice.  We don't like cornbread as a rule, because cornbread made without some flour is just yucky.  I bought this mix at the grocery store on a fluke.  We needed it for a meal.  OMG!!!!  IT WAS AMAZING!!!!  I've made it using sweet milk and buttermilk.  No matter what milk we use it is amazing!  Even my picky granddaughter wants it all the time.  Well worth the money.<br /><br />It reaheats well too.  We have kept it in the refrigerator, wrapped for up to 10 days.  After day 9, it started drying out, but still tasted good.  We microwaved it with a wet papertowel covering the piece and it was good.<br /><br />I've made it by standard recipe, as well as jalepeno.  Yummy.  Chop some fresh jalepeno's, a small tomato, and a bit of onion.  Use 1/4 cup LESS of the milk and add a small (the teeny 'individual') can of creamed corn.  yummy!

review/summary: Great Taste!  25.3 grams of carbs per muffin
review/text: I've tried a from-scratch gluten-free cornbread recipe before, and it was too close to cornmeal mush for us to consider it cornbread.  I ordered this cornbread mix from The Gluten-Free Pantry on a whim, and the whole family is delighted with it.  It tastes great and has the consistency of "real" cornbread.<br /><br />I mentioned the carb count because my son was recently diagnosed with Type I Diabetes. Until we get more used to estimating carbs in home-made foods, a mix helps us be more exact about carbs per portion. One box of this Yankee Cornbread Mix makes 12 medium-size muffins of 25.3 grams of carbs, each.<br /><br />We do not have to eat gluten-free, but I've always found that a gluten free muffin always makes me feel less full, less like the muffin has congealed into a ball in my stomach. So we go gluten-free at times.<br /><br />You add sugar, milk, egg and melted butter to the mix. It calls for buttermilk, but I make it with whole milk and it still tastes great. Ingredients in the mix are corn meal, white rice flour, baking powder (corn), and salt. The label states it also contains soy, but I can't find any ingredient with soy (such as soy lecithin) on the box's labeling. It could be that it is manufactured with machines that also process soy products, so, just to be safe, they mention the soy.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it. But it is expensive, considering that you have to add most of the recipe to the mix. You are paying for the convenience of not having to sift your own corn meal and rice flower.

review/summary: The Best Tasting GF Cornbread Mix EVER
review/text: I have been trying quite a few brands over the last few years.  This brand wins hands down.  It tastes great! Even when I make it with soy milk instead of the buttermilk in the recipe, it is yummy.

review/summary: Wonderful jalapeno cornbread!
review/text: My daughter has celiac and we have tried every g-free cornbread mix out there.  Being very southern, I only put a small amount of the sugar in my cornbread, we don't like it too sweet down here!  I added 1/2 cup diced jalapenos, 1/2 cup yellow sweet corn, and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese and it was fabulous!  We eat it with our taco soup and chili all winter long.

review/text: This is my favorite GF cornbread. My husband who does not need to eat GF loves it. I am so glad I buy it by the case. It taste like grandmom's cornbread (not dry) Due to the fact that it takes alot of butter for the recipe. It is a great treat. It is one of the few things I tolerate well and enjoy the taste.

review/summary: very dense finished product
review/text: I have purchased this item 3 times and have had positive results each time.  Though the finished product is very dense and not as sweet as the traditional Jiffy Corn Muffin, if you have gluten intolerance, you will find this to be an adequate replacement.  It does offer lactose free directions (a common condition for those recently diagnosed with celiac)which is my usual prep method.  The only drawback of the lactose free version is the oil tends to separate from the batter as it bakes, but does not effect the overall quality of the finished product.  Leftovers should be refrigerated, and reheated in the microwave for best taste.

review/text: If you need to cook gluten-free then you know how hard it is to find good, simple products that do not taste "gluten-free".  I am not gluten-intolerent but my family is.  I don't like most gluten free products (I just smile and eat) but this one is really good. The mix has good flavor and texture, is simple to make, and makes dad a hero on "chili" night.  Much better than the Bob's Red Mill.  Only knocked one star off because I hate paying the higher price for gluten-free stuff.

review/text: These things are amazing! Blueberry Pomegranate is the only flavor I have tasted, and I love it. It is helpful to read the label though. This company makes two types of the blueberry pomegranate - one with aloe vera extract and one without. I bought one without reading the label (I am allergic to aloe), and you can probably guess what happened. Not good. Anyway, I would give this product 5 stars if they weren't so darned expensive! However, I know that these are expensive drinks, and I have not yet been able to find them in bulk, so I am glad that Amazon sells them.

review/text: This is great gum!  I have never been big on chewing gum but I really like the Trident Splash.  I walk 2 to 4 miles every morning (weather permitting) and I chew gum when I walk (helps me think.  No music stuck in my ears! I want to hear the birds singing.).  I find the Trident Splash is the best for keeping its flavor!  When I found the Trident Splash Peppermint Twist I would buy all of it from the drugstore that carried it.  They do not carry the Trident Splash anymore nor does any other stores that I can find.  I'm just happy I found it on Amazon.com and hope the company who produces it does not discontinue this gum.  Thank you, Maxine

review/text: I have had this cake mix before and when I made it for a work potluck with cream cheese frosting....everyone LOVED it!  I told them it was simply a box cake mix and several joked that I shouldn't have told :)  I have been looking for this cake mix ever since.  When a dozen people drop their jaws and tell you how fabulous of a cook you are, well, you tend to remember that moment.  The previous reviews/reviewers obviously did not understand or look at the description.  The $32 is for 12 boxes and is in line with other hard-to-find foods from this vendor.  Amazon simply acts as a third party to market and make it more available.  Yes, the prices are higher than Wal-mart, but a lot of these foods you can hardly find anywhere anymore.

review/summary: Wonderful Caramel Flavor
review/text: I love this flavor cake mix and it is always such a hit when I take it to Potlucks or have family over. It is very hard to find. I have to stock up when I go up to Iowa or over to Virginia. It is not sold or distributed in my area of Tennessee, and I can't get the grocery stores to stock it because they say it is not stocked in their distribution centers. I wrote Duncan Hines and they said they can't do anything about the situation, it is up to the buyers in the distribution centers. Oh well. I bought 14 boxes the last time I was in Iowa (Thanks Hy-Vee). I grudging shared them with family members who love this cake mix flavor also. I make this cake by following the box directions but then stirring in one can of any brand of Coconut Pecan Frosting (this is my secret ingredient). Stir it in well and then bake according to box, but adding 10 or 15 minutes to baking time. Cool completely then frost with one can (or homemade) of Cream Cheese Frosting. Always a big hit. Yum!

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them.

review/summary: The whole family loves these...Yum!!
review/text: There aren't many things that my whole family agrees on but we all agree that these Cookies & Cream Pop-Tarts are awesome.  My husband always refers to these as the "Oreo" Pop-Tarts.  I personally don't like Oreo's but I do love Cookies and Cream ice cream and I love these.  We all eat these for snacks rather than for breakfast.  It's like having a cookie or something.  To me, they are good toasted or not toasted.  We eat them both ways.  I highly recommend this flavor if chocolate & cream appeal to you.

review/summary: Grandson's Favorite
review/text: I haven't been able to find this variety of Pop Tarts in the stores near us.  So I purchased online from Amazon, even though the quantity was large.  No problem.  My grandson absolutely loves this variety.  He chooses this as his dessert!
