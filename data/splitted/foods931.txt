review/summary: This is a great shampoo
review/text: I have color-treated (all-over blonde highlights) and very fine hair... but a lot of it! I originally tried the volumizing shampoo and condition by Clear but I needed more moisture. This one is great!<br /><br />Even with the first washing my hair was more manageable, styled better, and was so shiney and bright! One of the guys I work with said it looked blonder and asked if I just got it done!<br /><br />I know it has sulfate but my hair looks great anyway!

review/summary: Excellent Bouillon for Vegetable Dishes
review/text: I haven't been a vegetarian for over a decade, but I still make a lot of vegetarian meals.  Better Than Bouillon (BTB) is one of my go-to ingredients for adding flavor to vegetable soup and stock, and also less expected dishes like pasta, or braised veggies and even stir-fry sauces.  Though shelf-stable when you buy it, the BTB needs to be refrigerated once open.  I keep mine in the door of the fridge for easy access, and can fit three or four varieties of BTB in the shelf where eggs are meant to be stored.  Though it takes up space in the fridge, it gives me lots more room in my pantry and freezer, since I'm no longer storing boxes, cans or jars of broth.<br /><br />I also like the flexibility to use the amount I need for a specific recipe.  I wouldn't always open a huge box of broth if I only wanted a splash of it to loosen a stew, for example, but I can easily use a 1/2 tsp of BTB in water and dilute my gravies without diluting their flavor as well.  You'd be surprised how many places you can ramp up flavor with this product.  I often use it in place of salt as well, particularly in saucy dishes where it blends easily.  The sodium content is comparable to other bouillon I've seen, but the flavor seems richer, so less is required overall.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist but I feel like I should comment on the reviews which blast BTB for adding MSG; as far as I can tell from my research, they don't add MSG.  Now, not *adding* MSG is not the same as not *having* any MSG, which is I think what confuses and frustrates some people.  MSG is a naturally occurring compound in some foods, but can also be isolated and added into foods where it doesn't naturally occur.  BTB *does* contain ingredients that have natural MSG in them, therefore it has some natural MSG as well, but is stating the truth when they say they don't use MSG as an additive.<br /><br />For what it's worth, completely avoiding MSG in a typical American diet can be quite a challenge.  I've gotten really horrid migraines for a long time and spent years cutting out all kinds of different foods, including MSG, to try to decrease the frequency of my headaches.  For me, MSG can make pain worse, but doesn't cause it to occur altogether.  My husband, being a thoughtful man, has made soups for me using BTB when I've been knocked out due to a migraine, and with the quantities we use in our cooking, I haven't had any problems.  Of course, your experience may differ.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Better Than Bouillon's Vegetable Base.  It's an excellent way to add flavor to dishes, easy to use and undeniably better for you than most traditional bouillon cubes.

review/summary: For those of you that are hyper about MSG...
review/text: For those of you who are acting so hyper about MSG, consider this.  All cheese, meat products, soy sauce (including the naturally brewed shoyu without added MSG), oysters, clams, mollusks in general, and tomatoes are LOADED with MSG.  This is a naturally occurring substance in many fermented or aged products.  If you can eat cheese, enjoy your tomatoes, and tolerate naturally fermented soy sauce, think again about MSG reactions.  This info is coming from a biochemist and a physician who does a lot of nutritional therapy.  There are a lot of myths that are still being perpetuated, and this is no exception.  Even the tongue contains taste buds that are specific for detecting MSG.  So it's in your genes!<br /><br />As for this soup base, it's fabulous!!<br /><br />If you still have issues about the thought of consuming ANY MSG, then be prepared to stop eating all deli products, any mollusk, anything with soy sauce or other fermented bean product (including black beans, other soy bean products like miso, etc.), any aged milk curd, and anything containing a tomato, including pizza.  If you truly believe in the MSG ban, then put your money where your mouth is!

review/summary: Give it up with the MSG
review/text: First, the actual product: Love this stuff. Tastier than bouillon cubes, easier to deal with, and the price is comparable given the large number of servings. We live in a vegan household and wouldn't ever be caught without it. Having said that, it's usually about half this price at the grocery store, not quite sure why Amazon's costs so much.<br /><br />Second, to the MSG haters: there is going to be no such thing as an MSG-free broth unless you make it yourself. Make sure you leave out all naturally-occuring sources of it as well. Furthermore, a cursory search for medical journal articles doesn't turn up any reputable sources concluding that MSG consumed in the quantities found in this kind of product possess any adverse health effects. If you'd like to share some citations, I'll be listening. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to use this product in every soup/gravy/ice cream topping I eat.

review/summary: Great flavor;  Perfect for a quick soup.
review/text: I love making quick veggie soups on the fly.  At less than $6.00 a bottle this is a great bargain.  Makes 38 quarts.  Considering that 1 qt of veggie broth costs $3.00 in the market.  I use this for chicken soups as well.  I like to creat quick soups by throwing whatever veggies (sometimes meat) I have in the fridge.  My favorite is throwing in mushrooms, napa, and baby bok choy and perhaps some rice noodles.  What is great about this product is you can use just a little to create one or two servings or you can use more to create a large pot of soup.  It will stay fresh about a year in the fridge once opened.  I use it often so this smaller bottle lasts me about 3 months.  Costco sells the larger bottles of beef and chicken but not the veggie.  If you are looking for an all-natural, all-organic broth then just make your own.  This base is perfect when you want soup fast.

review/summary: Delicious for coming off a cleanse, too
review/text: We just came off a 7 day cleanse and in order to ease back into "normal foods", we drank a light broth made of the tasty No- Chicken Chicken broth. Very satisfying and delicious. I have been cooking with it for years and originally bought it at Whole Foods, but now even they don't carry it...just the chicken and beef flavors. We are planning an off-shore cruise and this will definately be in the larder!!!<br />Wish it came in larger containers. (By the way, my last shipment had 2 leaky jars from off-set lids...the seal wasn't even broken, but some of the product leaked out anyway. Better packing would probably help keep the jars and the product safe.)

review/text: Unable to get to a health products store, I got Better than Bullion vegetable base and the beef base. Both are way too salty if you are watching your daily recommended sodium intake it is listed at 21 percent for the beef variety (reduced sodium) and 30 percent for the vegetable base. It makes me wonder if there other products are this way too.<br /><br />It is something to consider and I've found powdered vegetable broths to be much more friendly in terms of low sodium.

review/text: Even I was fooled into buying this organic vegetable paste (made from seasoned, concentrated vegetables with no MSG!).  Autolyzed yeast paste (the third ingredient) IS MSG.  Also soy sauce (the fifth ingredient) contains MSG, also autolyzed yeast extract (the ninth ingredient) is MSG, and the seventh ingredient, natural flavor, can include MSG.  Basically you think you are buying a healthy organic product with no MSG when in fact you are buying MSG (with a few healthy vegetables mixed in). It is criminal to be able to market this product as having no MSG.  When is health going to take precedence over profit?  Shame on us.

review/summary: Superior Touch, Please advise if there is ANY MSG in your product
review/text: I have been using the Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for years.  I was in the process of ordering additional jars, when I read Ms Hill's comment, from December, 2008.  I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be "hidden", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides "monosodium glutamate" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, "NO MSG ADDED" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is "processed into" a product as opposed to being "poured into" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare "NO MSG ADDED"  or "NO ADDED MSG", even though the product contains MSG.<br />Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG.

review/summary: 'Tiptree' Orange Marmalade (medium cut): Slightly Bitter, But Good!
review/text: This is the fourth item from "Tiptree" that I've tried.  (Their "Little Scarlett Strawberry" is out of this world!  The regular "Strawberry" and "Damson" (plum) were also very good.)  Truth be told, I found myself a bit surprised at first taste; being it's somewhat bitter.<br />Aside from random U.S. marmalade's; I have tried one of "Mrs. Bridges"- a Scottish (orange) marmalade, of which, there was no bitterness.<br /><br />The previous reviewer said this one from "Tiptree" is made from "Seville" oranges; which neither the website nor my jar indicates.<br />However, I just read some info on "Seville" oranges, and they are supposed to be bitter (they come from the Mediterranean).  One page stated that no "pectin" is required.  Since this particular one does not contain "pectin" (as some other marmalade's of "Tiptree" do), this could very well be made from Seville's.<br />FYI, The label also states: "45 grams of fruit per 100 grams".<br /><br />With that said, after a few times of eating it now, I'm quite used it's unique flavor, and find it delicious on toast!<br />  For those who aren't keen on a slightly bitter spread, perhaps you should steer clear of at least this particular blend/flavor from "Tiptree".  (P.S. I just read a review on their "Tawny" (orange; thick cut), which said it's also bitter.)<br /><br />In conclusion, I hope to try another of their marmalade's in the near future!

review/text: I have added green tea to my weight loss regiment which also includes RK-500 which blocks or dissolves fat and Liponexol which does the same for carbs<br /><br />I don't exercise and being a single male a eat mostly prepared food (but I take vitamins too) my only exercise is walking my dogs twice a day and I have noticed I walk more briskly now.<br /><br />This is how I prepare the tea; I use two bags in a large mug drink that then later, on my second cup I add 1 more tea bag to the two I already used and drink that.<br /><br />One other item I have to make a plug for is I love my Nuwave tabletop oven it uses less power than a conventional over and it lets the grease and fat drip away from the food you are cooking whick is way more healthy plus you don't have to thaw out the meat prior to cooking.<br /><br />All of this is helping me lose weight. Below is some info on green tea I found on the web. And btw my comment to the reviewer who gave a one star review and complained about the taste; I don't find it repulsive at all<br /><br />What makes tea increase weight loss? According to scientific studies, it is the catechins, caffeine and theanine that makes green tea an effective weight loss tool.<br /><br />In particular, scientists have found that EGCG (the most active and abundant of catechins) and caffeine are especially important. They fight obesity in at least 7 ways.<br /><br />Method #1:<br />Boosts Metabolism<br /><br />There are 3 kinds of fat. They can be found beneath the skin, in the body organs and in the muscles.<br /><br />Brown adipose tissue is a layer of fat beneath the skin that has the ability to generate heat. Scientists found that green tea stimulates the heat burning process (called thermogenesis) much more than caffeine alone would.<br /><br />Green Tea Metabolism - How Many More Calories?<br /><br />Method #2:<br />Burns Fat<br /><br />Fat is an excellent source of energy in humans. Beta-oxidation is a process during which fat is broken down to provide energy. Scientists found that green tea burns fat by stimulating the beta-oxidation process.<br /><br />Green Tea Burn Fat<br /><br />Method #3:<br />Prevents Fat Storage<br /><br />An adipocyte cell is a fat cell or connective tissue that is involved in the synthesis and storage of fat. Scientists found that green tea prevents fat cells from multiplying and enlarging.<br /><br />In an animal study, scientists found that green tea increases weight loss by blocking the actions of enzymes involved in the synthesis and storage of fat.<br /><br />A 2006 study conducted by Donald Danforth Plant Science Center discovered that green tea may help reduce fat storage by moderating your body's production of hormone insulin. The scientists discovered that green tea does this by blocking the production of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).<br /><br />This is important because insulin plays a key part in converting glucose (blood sugar) into fat.<br /><br />Method #4:<br />Reduces Food Craving<br /><br />When you eat sugary food, your blood sugar level spikes up. This triggers a large release of insulin to move the glucose out of blood into cells for storage.<br /><br />Because your body can overreact by producing too much insulin, this can cause a sharp dip in glucose level afterwards. Low sugar levels increase your cravings, hunger, and mood swings, and reduces energy level. End result? You crave more sugary food, causing the vicious cycle to repeat itself.<br /><br />Green tea, by regulating your blood sugar levels, helps to reduce food cravings and hunger pangs.<br /><br />Green Tea and Blood Sugar<br /><br />Method #5:<br />Blocks Dietary Fat Absorption<br /><br />Another green tea weight loss secret...<br /><br />Digestive enzymes act on the foods we eat so that the body can absorb them. According to a 2006 peer review study by Wolfram, green tea reduces carbohydrate and fat absorption by blocking the actions of these enzymes.<br /><br />Method #6:<br />Regulates Glucose Uptake<br /><br />A study conducted by Ashida found that drinking green tea increases the glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and reduces the glucose uptake by fat tissue.<br /><br />End result? You are able to exercise longer, which will help you burn more calories and fat. By exercising more, you develop more muscles, which will help you maintain an active lifestyle.<br /><br />Green Tea Diet and Exercise<br /><br />Method #7:<br />Synergism with Caffeine<br /><br />Ready for the final green tea weight loss magic? Now consider this: When is 1+1=3?<br /><br />Studies conducted by scientists Dulloo and Rumpler found that caffeine and catechins benefit from one another's presence. Together, they burn more calories than each compound is on its own.<br /><br />Green tea, including caffeine, greatly increases and prolongs the heat burning effect. It helps you burn more calories even when you are sleeping!<br /><br />Diet suggestion #1<br /><br />Avoid diet drinks ans sugar substitutes. That right avoid them as much as possible. Though they help prevent you from gaining weight,they also PREVENT YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #2<br /><br />Eat protein and only proteins for breakfast. This sets up your metabolism to burn fat the rest of the day. Avoid "breakfast" drinks as they contain sugar and any carbs too.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #3<br /><br />This will be the most difficult; keep the room temperature as low as you can tolerate. Your body will burn fat to maintain it's metabolism and body temp. I prefer 64 degrees.

review/summary: all right by me--with a minor cautionary note or two
review/text: Kellogg's Corn Pops breakfast cereal in these 1.5 ounce cups boasts a delicious and flavorful taste. It contains no cholesterol, no fat and it is low in calories. The delicious taste and the nutritional value that it does have make this better for you or your kids than skipping breakfast. It is low in carbohydrates, too. It stays crunchy in milk; and I enjoy the strong corn taste. Milk enhances the excellent flavor of the cereal. It is also certified kosher if that's important to you.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some disappointments exist. The cereal is only average in terms of vitamin content, reaching at the very best 30% of your recommended daily intake of niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid. It delivers somewhat less than average value in the vitamin department. Corn Pops in these 1.5 ounce cups cannot be considered a substitute for a morning vitamin if you need one. Therefore I will take off one star to make this a four star review.<br /><br />Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal does contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and this can convert in your body to trans fat. Be careful!<br /><br />One more caveat: this product contains traces of soybeans and it is made with wheat. Ask your doctor before eating this cereal if you are unsure if your body can tolerate these ingredients. In addition, consult your doctor about your diet from time to time.<br /><br />Overall, these 1.5 ounce cups of Kellogg's Corn Pops truly are very useful for people on the go or kids who want an after school snack that's not too bad for them. The cereal does have some basic nutritional value. Nevertheless, Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal cannot be a substitute for a daily vitamin.

review/summary: Tastes like wallpaper paste
review/text: This is absolutely the WORST condensed soup I have ever tasted!  I used it to make another recipe, and as soon as I opened the box, I was disgusted by the smell.  I thought perhaps the "sell by" date had passed, but it had not.  I should have just thrown it away and tried to salvage my recipe some other way, but with GF ingredients, these are expensive "experiements"!  My recipe tasted awful, my whole kitchen smelled like this soup, and I can't get the taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />This product is horrible.  I can't believe it actually made it past their quality assurance dept. and onto the store shelves.<br /><br />If it was possible to give it negative stars, I would!!!!

review/summary: Good News and Bad
review/text: The GOOD news is that this Comstock Apple pie filling has 60% fewer calories than Comstock's regular apple filling and it's really tasty.  1/3 of a cup has only 35 calories so that this would make a good pie for the holidays for people on a diet.  Sweetened with Sucralose (i.e. Splenda) it's made with one of the healthier artificial sweetners.<br /><br />The Bad news -- at least for moms like me -- is that there aren't any vitamins in this pie mixture.  0% Vitamins A and C.  Zero percent% Calcium and iron.<br /><br />Now, glancing over some health sites on the internet I find that what you can expect from a 'freshly' made apple pie is something like 2-to-4% of daily requirements of Vitamin A per slice, and 4-to-6% Vitamin C; and 4-to-10% of daily Iron.  So something is lost in the processing of this product.  Something that I was hoping to fill my family with... good nutrition.<br /><br />This is important for me because I have one of those kids who disparages fruits and veggies, but who will eat pie.  It's for him and his sister that I bake pies.  If there's no vitamins there doesn't seem to be a point in making them.  I could easily buy cookies which don't require preparation.<br /><br />SUMMARY::<br />I won't be buying this mix again.  At least not until the kids go off to college.  At that point I might make it for my husband and myself on the rare occasion, as the lower calorie count and lack of sugar makes this pie filling very attractive for us.

review/text: I grew up in hawaii and really miss the foods & drinks from there. Guava juice has always been a favorite of mine. I ordered this-amazon said to allow several extra days but it came within 3 days-superfast from Hawaii no less.Drinking it made me feel like i was back in Hawaii-really ono delicious! Price was kinda high $27 but i cannot find this brand where i live now. The stores here do carry guava juice and its about $18 a case-it tastes good too so unfortunately i won't be ordering this aloha maid anymore because of the price but if ever there is a sale on it then i will be back!

review/summary: Watch out for the ingredients!!
review/text: Crunchy carrots contain - organic carrot, organic maltodextrin and lecithin.<br />Hearty Sweet Potatoes contain - organic sweet potatoes, organic maltodextrin, organic corn starch, sunflower lecithin.<br />Plump peas and crunchy apples contain - 100% peas and 100% apples.<br /><br />The peas and the apples were the first products I tried from this company.  The baby loved them and I loved the ingredients.  I thought I would try the other products so I ordered the carrots and sweet potatoes.  To my surprise and disappoinment, when they arrived, I saw that they contained ingredients that I was not pleased with.  I wrote Nurturme and asked why they put maltodextrin in their products unnecessarily and they responded, The organic maltodexrin in our products is derived form organic corn.  Maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods.<br />They are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried.  Like starch, most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body." So, while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine, they did not contain ingredients that I wanted to feed my baby.  The biggest issue being that this information was not included in the product description on amazon.

review/summary: Finally! Soy Milk that is capable of steaming and suitable for lattes!
review/text: Great Product! We started experimenting with soy milk due to allergy concerns/sinus congestion with regular organic milk.  We wanted to see if we were less congested with soy milk.  The consensus is that it does seem to help a bit, so we wanted to stay with it.  BUT---> it destroyed our morning lattes, UNTIL we found soy blenders.  It's a staple in our home,now.<br /><br />We use a Superautomatic Espresso machine for daily coffee/lattes (Saeco Talea Touch) and anyone who's ever tried steaming soy milk knows it doesn't steam correctly for lattes.  Traditional soy milk is too runny to whip up and produce a lovely microfoam.  These soy blenders were designed to steam and produce microfoam for your latte!<br /><br />Do know though, that it *seems* like traditional soy milk until you steam it, that's when the magic happens.  I do find that occassionally it produces too thick a microfoam, but I simply remove that from the top of my steaming pitcher and use the lovely silky foam that's underneath the surface of the denser bubbles!<br /><br />Overall, if you're making lattes, there is NO other alternative if you use soy milk!  Trouble is, it goes out of stock on Amazon too quickly, I'd like to see them stock it more reliably.  When it's in, I stock up, and since you can store it on the shelf in the pantry without refrigeration, (another plus!) it's no problem to stockpile some so you don't need to order too frequently!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!

review/text: While I love this product, this is the second time we have received a leaking box of soy milk in the case of 12 boxes.  So 1 of the 12 containers was no good from the beginning.  In addition, the leaking containers caused other containers to get soft on the bottom and pour everywhere.  It was a mess and all that soy milk was ruined.

review/summary: Beware of possible damaged goods
review/text: Well, this is frustrating as I really love this product for making decent quality lattes on my home machine. However, this is the second time in a row where the product has arrived damaged with cartons opened/punctured with leaky milk. It is hard to know what caused the damaged cartons as the original box is packed in a larger box with paper around it. I am thinking that because I am an Amazon Preferred customer, the orders are shipped via 2-day air. Maybe the air pressure in flight is causing packaging to fail. Fortunately, Amazon has been very good about dealing with the situation, but as I said it is frustrating not having good soy to make decent foam.

review/summary: Tastiest capaccino you can make
review/text: Saw that my favorite coffee house (Pete's) uses this for thier soy caps & latte's. Couldn't find it in any stores so ordered it from Amazon with monthly shipment. Works amazingly well and cost effective. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />What is good about this brand of soy milk is that it is not too sweet but sweet enough - incredibly tastey. The Barister version is supposed to be a little lighter than normal soy milk to froth better. I guess I didn't really notice the difference there - regular soy milk froths fine for me.

review/text: Thank goodness for this product. I've had to remove dairy from my diet due to a sensitivity in my breastfed baby. As hard as it was to give up cheese, I think it would've been harder to give up my daily latte. Enter Soy Blenders! This stuff tastes great, froths up wonderfully, and has made this break so much more bearable. I've tried a variety of other soy products during this break, and I haven't found anything that comes close to Soy Blenders. I also love the vanilla for when I want my latte a little sweeter. Good stuff!

It froths perfectly and has no bitter taste or cardboard smell like many other alternatives. I think it is the closest you can get to the real thing. Since it must be bouhgt by the case, I also use it for cooking and cereal and have never been disappointed.

review/text: I've just recently developed a sensitivity to dairy and have to opt for soy milk for my daily latte in the morning.  I tried a Vanilla Soy Latte at the Whole Foods Barista and it was great.  I looked around and couldn't find it for sale anywhere so I just order it by the case from Amazon.  I honestly cannot tell the difference with this product!  I've tried others but none compare.  I have been using the plain and just add my favorite hazelnut flavoring to it.  I know the vanilla is good because I had it at Whole Foods.

review/text: Salsify is the taproot of a weed (kindof like a carrot or dandelion) called Goatsbeard.  They're okay to eat plain.  But I use them as an easy, lightly flavorful addition to just about any crock pot recipe, or mashed potatoes - I like saute'ed leeks and turnips in them too.  People describe them as having a faint oyster flavor - I wouldn't call it that except for having heard them described that way.  Given this, I want to try them in a Thanksgiving stuffing.<br /><br />Note:  the Roland can is well-made - lined, as I think you'd need for this product.

review/summary: Roland brand canned Salsify
review/text: This product is often called "Oyster Plant" and does indeed have a pleasant, cooked mild oyster flavor.  Roland has packaged the salsify quite nicely in a mild liquid that does not detract or overpower the product.  I've prepared the salsify both scalloped and in a garlic butter sauce and was very pleased with the end results.  This vegetable was very popular in KY and TN in the early 1900's and was grown in country gardens.  My 94 year old mother remembered it well but had not eaten any since she was a child.  Amazon was the only place I could find it until I recently visited an "international grocery store" in a large city.  This was the first time I'd ever heard of it or tasted it.  I bought 12 cans from Amazon and 5 from the grocery store (all they had in stock...).<br /><br />Very pricey through Amazon, but if you're looking for an exotic gourmet side...this is certainly one that will fill the bill.  Use mild ingredients so as to not overpower the delicate flavor of the salsify.<br /><br />One can will serve 2 people nicely as a side, perhaps 3 if a mild cheese and bread crumbs are added.

It's chocolate with nuts - fine, but it just didn't met my expectations. I bought some hersheys chocolates at the same time that was much cheaper and had much more content and honestly I enjoyed the hersheys much more. That is only emphasized by the fact that the hersheys are all gone and I haven't even completed half this box. Good chocolate, but nothing that special.

The chocolate has a white coating and has a old tasting Flavor. I will not purchase this product again. I called the company and the voice said I was next in line, However,five minutes went by and no one activated the line, I hung up and give this a 1.

review/summary: Just like a dream
review/text: Picture a warm summer day and you're lying in a comfortable, handwoven hammock tied between two towering coconut trees as the welcoming sun beats down on your glistening face.  Sunglasses drawn, you sip your cool, pineapple-laced mai tai enjoying every gulp as it refreshes your dry, parched mouth.  A cool breeze brushes past as if nature's hand itself wanted to rock you gently as you would a baby in its cradle.  The soft crashes of ocean waves against the white sandy beach beckons you for a short dip in the cool, clear waters of Hanauma Bay.  Ahhhh, paradise....<br /><br />Eyes closed, you feel a presence come up next to you as they cast a shadow across your body.  You open your eyes to find a beautiful island girl dressed in her native garb of Hawaiian grass skirt, coconut shell top and aromatic lei around her neck and forehead.  She greets you with her pearly white smile that shines in contrast against her perfectly tanned, soft skin.  Surely, no mortal deserve such perfection.  She reaches over for a chocolate covered macadamia nut and motions toward you to place one of these little pieces of heaven in your salivating mouth.  Just when the tip of your tongue senses the sweetness of milk chocolate ---<br /><br />SLAP!!!!<br /><br />Inexplicably, your horrible boss appears before you with his arms belligerently crossed against his chest yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to know where his TPS reports are as he is already 5 minutes late with his appointment with the "Bobs" in the meeting room.  He storms out of your cubicle while contentiously muttering the words, "We'll talk about this later, mmmmkay?"<br /><br />Suddenly, the reality surrounds you like a cheap wet suit as a co-worker passes by insisting you have a bad case of the "Mun-days."  Dejected, you sit back down in your office-appointed chair and reach out for a macadamia nut chocolate and realize this candy is the closest you'll ever get to Hawaii.<br /><br />Sigh...

review/text: Love this mix. I would pick this one over Williams Sonoma Belgian Waffle and Stonewall Kitchen Pancake and Waffle mix. Waffles come out very light (remember to use sparkling water), and are a great 'base' for various fruit additions: orange zest and chopped strawberries, chopped mango and nuts, etc. I use very basic full-size Belgian waffle maker and one recipe makes 2 waffles. I just wish more stores carried it.

review/text: I love Belgian waffles.  However, I have searched for and tried every Belgian waffle mix in the grocery stores in St. Louis.  I even ordered waffle and pancake cook books to whip my own.  Nothing I tried gave me the taste and outside crispiness of what I wanted.  Then I found Maple Grove Farms Belgian Waffle Mix at Schnuck's market (a midwest local grocery chain; we don't have any national grocery chains in St. Louis).  Since I tried everything else, I bought it and tried it.  It was best of any I tried, and I tried quite a few.  Now Schnuck's market doesn't carry it anymore.  Great product, and this is a good price, especially for six boxes.  Use a good Belgian waffle maker for best results, and enjoy.

review/text: For years, Sunday breakfast in our house has been waffles or pancakes.  We have had these particular waffles every week since I discovered the Maple Grove Farms Belgian Waffle Mix two months ago.  The malt flavor is a tasty alternative to other mixes and scratch recipes.  The waffles are crispy outside and soft in the middle.  I'm sure we'll return to pancakes for a bit when the blueberries are ripe, but for now, we're happily stuck on these waffles.

review/text: I love this all organic Hot Cocoa.  I first heard of it in reading Prevention Mag. when they recommended it for dark chocolate lovers.  They were right.  My pantry is never without it and when I want something chocolaty I have a cup of this. The trick is to be certain that you don't use more water than it calls for on the label.  I don't have 6oz. mugs but do have a lot of 8 oz. ones so I put in three tbsp. of the cocoa per 8 oz. of water - that's still only 110 calories. There is already organic milk powder in this product so no milk is needed.  Of all the hot cocoa products I have used this is far and away my favorite.

review/text: This has a distinctive taste, so I am not saying that it is not chocolate tasting or has no taste, but it IS extremely thin. Quite watery for something you are just supposed to add water to. My family does not like it and I only drink it when made with 1/2 water, 1/2 milk. The taste is not the same as other hot chocolates, this is not to say bad but certainly different. It is simply not to our liking and due to that and the thin, watery consistency we won't be buying again. Amazon's part in purchase and shipping was fine per usual.

review/text: I really love this Hot Chocolate. First found it in Whole Foods and bought it as it was organic, fair trade AND low sugar! So many organic hot chocolates are very high in the sugar department which bothers me. This one is not. I think only 11gs of sugar?! When compared to 25gs and up, it's rather good. With the low sugar content it does remind of a more european type hot chocolate which is more creamy than sugary. So maybe bare that in mind?<br />All in all, lovely stuff!

review/summary: The BEST peppermint tea I have ever had....
review/text: I was raised on tea, by a tea-loving mother and English grandmother, however, I do not consider myself an expert. I know you can go further down the tea-fanatic trail than I have gone. Despite my attempts, my own children refused tea, and I was resigned to the fact that passing on love of tea ended with me.<br /><br />I picked up the Traditional Medicinals Organic Peppermint at the now-gone Henry's chain looking to add variety - as a kid my mother plucked mint plants from the field to dry and turn into tea (I was also raised on chamomile tea procured in the same manner), and have never found a peppermint tea with the same flavor... until now. The tea tastes fresh, it is not too sweet or too strong, nor too weak as some brands I have tried resemble spearmint instead of peppermint. It is perfect on it's own, or with a bit of honey and cream to appease a strong sweet tooth. Best of all, I cannot keep my kids from drinking it, and they have begun branching out, and sampling other teas and even chai as well. It IS expensive, however, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the best money-saving option, as it is eligible for Super Saving Shipping and (for now) tax free to my state. I recommend trying one box to see if it is to your liking - I have found the tea at Sprouts, Trader Joe's and Wild Oats, so similar stores should have it as well.

review/text: I have tried various natural medicines for my long lasting stomach gas problem. Every time after each meals, I have serious burps, farting, and feeling of heavy filled stomach and then soon I start to get headaches. The only way to solve my problem was to do treadmill  for 20 min  and take an Advil. I tried gax-x type of medicines but no long term relief.<br />Since I started drinking peppermint tea, it has helped me to releases any trapped gas from stomach and intestines like jet blast. I love it, its natural and no side effects at-least I know.<br />But always remember, gas, farting, belching is due to indigestion so although peppermint tea will fix your gas problem but you need to fix the underlying problem of indigestion. simple way to solving is to drink lemon juice & yogurt etc right before the meals.

I drink it every morning before breakfast and sometimes during the day.  But I find it starts my day out in a very calming relaxing way.  I was really excited to find it at Amazon and at such a great price.  I have literally ran around from store to store just to find this Organic Peppermint Traditional Medicinals brand.  So often they are sold out of it and for good reason.  Others must love it as much as I do!!  Try it you'll love it :)

review/summary: Great afternoon pickup without caffeine
review/text: Pure peppermint herbal tea - all you need to perk up that afternoon sluggishness.  I love mint tea - but kept searching for a peppermint tea without other flavors to mask the pure energy.  This one is the best I have found, intense flavor with no additives.

review/summary: tastes good
review/text: Seems to get rid of stomach acid coming up my throat. forgot what that's called. May just be the placebo effect.<br /><br />I put a tea bag in a 20 oz container with reverse osmosis water before I go to bed. I then drink it in the morning with my breakfast.

review/summary: Soothing
review/text: My favorite tea is Organic Ginger.  However, recently I had a tummy that needed something more soothing.  This Organic Peppermint tea has a wonderful aroma and flavor and helped soothe my body and mind.  I recommend this tea for when you are stressed or when your tummy needs soothing.

review/summary: Tea Drinker
review/text: I brought this tea because mint tea is great for cramps.  Well the aroma and flavor is what hooked me.  I drink it, if I just want a cup of tea.  It's not often you get a tea that's medicinal and has great taste.  I've shared this product with a couple co-worker and they even enjoy it (they're not real tea drinkers)

review/summary: Very flavorful
review/text: The organic peppermint tea has an intense flavor. This tea has a number of uses for me. I use it in an Iced Spice tea blend that I make; as a single cup of hot tea at night to calm my coughs; as a digestive aid when I eaten food that is a little spicy and to flavor a simple syrup for plain iced tea.

review/summary: Organic Peppermint Tea
review/text: Traditional Medicinals makes some really nice tea, and their organic peppermint is one of the best. It is strong; none of that weak fare you get at your local grocery store. You can really taste the peppermint oil on your tongue, almost as if it were brewed from fresh peppermint. It is not sweet; add some honey or raw sugar if you like it that way. Excellent for your digestive track and memory, peppermint tea is a wonderful study aid and will help you stay focused without getting the jitters of caffeine.<br /><br />A first class tea, and easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys herbals.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I grew up on this juice in England. The lemon flavor was the original. Look for the orange and black currant......mmmmmm It is great. In the USA you don't tend to find what we call 'cordials' so much. It is a economical way of getting a great tasting juice. It is so concentrated, it goes a long way. I have a soda stream (again something I grew up with in the UK) and I make a lot of club soda with it. I then add a small amount of Barley water and it is so refreshing.<br />I love it !!!

review/summary: Really liked it until I read the ingredients: saccharin!
review/text: Since the 2nd listed ingredient in this beverage is sugar (behind water), why bother to put saccharin in it as well?  It's the last ingredient listed, so presumably a small amount, but why add it at all?  My child is allergic to sulfa drugs, and people who have allergies to sulpha drugs should stay away from saccharin.

review/summary: This is a great product
review/text: I was introduced to Robinson's Lemon Barley Water by a friend that grew up in the U.K. I cannot attest to any latent "health" benefits of the product, but I agree with the other reviewers that this is absolutely delicious and refreshing when spritzed up with seltzer water in keeping with the directions on the label.

review/summary: Wonderful Barley Water
review/text: Lemon Barley water is delicious with club soda or seltzer water.  It gives it just that right amount of fizz!  I grew up with Lemon Barley water and am thrilled I can get it stateside.  I have ordered it from here before with great results.  Three bottles last quite awhile.
