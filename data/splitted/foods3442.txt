review/summary: Great bone, keeps them busy for (ever)
review/text: My shih tzu loves this bone, along with the other flavors.  She wasn't very good at getting the filling out, so I kept pushing it out from the other end. It's too long to be lickable for a little doggie.  It's larger than I thought, but she continues to carry it around and chews on it every day.  The filling is the least of it, she uses it without the filling.  I would suggest it for little dogs (Chewy is 12 pounds) or a bigger dog would really like it, too.

review/summary: Herbal Alternative to Caffeinated Beverages, A Different Rooibos
review/text: *****<br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br />*****

review/summary: King of the green
review/text: I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go-mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.<br /><br />This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia-based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine-free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right.

review/summary: A five star review---no bones about it !!!
review/text: Starkist Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water makes for one of the healthiest foods on your grocer's shelf. At the Amazon price it is economical, too. More importantly, however, this tuna provides you with protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 is just about the only fatty acid that is actually good for your heart. Your heart loves omega-3; trust me!<br /><br />Starkist packs the tuna in water to keep it moist and fresh for months at a time while it is in the can before you open it. You may want to drain the water from the can before you remove the tuna. This tuna, as Amazon correctly notes, comes from only the choicest cuts of the fish and it tastes delicious. While you certainly can eat it right out of the can; it mixes particularly well with products like mayonnaise and reduced fat mayonnaise.<br /><br />One caveat, however: the water/vegetable broth contains soy, salt, and pyrophosphate. If you are allergic to any of these ingredients or if you are on a salt free diet consult your doctor before eating this tuna. Starkist may make this tuna with reduced salt; and there are other brands of tuna that definitely contain less salt.<br /><br />Overall, Starkist solid white albacore tuna in water offers an amazingly healthy meal. It is especially healthy for you because it is lower in fat and cholesterol than meat or even poultry. It tastes great directly from the can; and it makes an excellent ingredient for tuna fish sandwiches with mayo or any recipe that requires tuna. I highly recommend this tuna for people who want to eat healthy foods; and this tuna fish will never disappoint mothers who want to feed their children well.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!

review/summary: try feeding it to the cat
review/text: While this was once a good tuna at one time, they've gone down hill, recently. I normally eat tuna from the can, with just a squeeze of lemon. I've had three recent cans that not only is in no way solid, but it's a dark color, slimy and off tasting. The only way I can describe it is what cat food must taste like. I have to say, "sorry Charlie", but dolphin would be an improvement over this.

review/text: What I loved about this set was that it was a pull-open container which made it a million times easier to have in my dorm last year.  You didn't have to reach for a can opener.  Same taste (clearly) as normal Starkist tuna and was really a whole fillet, not chunky passed off as fillet.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are in smaller sizes than you typical grocery store can but not that much smaller.  So you may want to order double.

review/summary: Instant Lunch On The Run
review/text: Like many other people, I've found it rather expensive to "eat out" for lunch while at work every day.  Of course, when I say, "eat out," I mean going to a fast food joint for a quick hamburger or some other not-so-great choice of a meal.  Averaging anywhere from four to seven dollars per meal, that can get pricey very quick.<br /><br />With Starkist's Solid White Albacore Tuna, I've found not only a decently priced meal, but a healthy one as well.  Albacore tuna is packed with Omega-3 fatty acids (the good kind of fat) that helps promote good heart health.  The can is even marked as approved by the American Heart Association as a heart healthy food.<br /><br />For folks who enjoy working out, tuna also provides plenty of protein to get you through a tough routine.<br /><br />I enjoy eating Starkist Albacore Tuna mixed with a little light mayonnaise, sweet relish, and just a hint of mustard to perk up the taste.  If I have time, I'll often boil an egg, chop it up, and mix it in as well.  I usually eat the tuna with crackers or as a sandwich.<br /><br />For health-conscience individuals on a budget who prefer their lunch to be portable, I highly recommend Starkist Solid White Albacore Tuna.<br /><br />I also enjoy Starkist's Chunk White Albacore Tuna.

review/summary: Go with Chicken-of-the-Sea
review/text: When I was a kid my mother swore by Chicken-of-the-Sea's tuna products.  When I got out on my own I decided to give Starkist a try because it was generally a little bit cheaper.  Terrible mistake.  I purchased 3 cans of the solid white in water and each can had unwanted surprises.  In two of the cans I found multiple pieces of bones, just straight little pieces that really hurt if they jabbed your mouth.  In the third can I had what appeared to be an entire round fish scale.  It was disgusting!  Pay the few extra cents for the better tuna...the fish may be the same but the cleaning and inspection processes with the more expensive brands are worth it.

review/summary: Nice fish, handy size
review/text: The albacore tuna in these cans is fairly consistent (only occassionally see some that is darker than I would like) and the size is very convenient.  I recall reading the allowable darker meat is regulated based on calling it "solid white albacore" but of course it would be nice if Starkist kept even stricter requirements.  Each can is smaller than a standard chunk light can, and makes a nice single-serving size for a large sandwich or added to a lettuce salad.

review/text: I had to return this eight pack after opening several cans. This was no "solid white albacore".  it was loosely packed minced fish with bones. It smelled fishy.  Starkist even has a help line after hours with a nurse in case anyone chokes. I called. They seem unconcerned with the bone issue.  I have a 2 year old. I can't understand why someone would want to open a mystery can of this stuff twice.<br /><br />I would recommend that people stay away from this product. Target makes a great albacore.  Go there.

review/summary: Solid?
review/text: The can of Starkist "Solid White Albacore" I opened looked more like "Chunk Light" tuna, with random bits of fish and other dark fish parts that one doesn't normally associate with "solid white albacore."  In all my other experiences of eating solid white albacore from other brands, the can usually contains a "solid" piece of fish from one part of the fish, not chunks and bits from who knows where.  Don't get me wrong, I eat chunk light tuna as well and it's fine for sandwiches and everything, but that's not what I paid for.  At least with the can I opened, it seems like they either made a mistake or were cutting corners.  Very disappointed.

review/text: My mom used Alessi Salt while visiting my sister and loved it.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find it in any stores, but luckily, we discovered it here on Amazon.  Don't you just love Amazon???  We use Alessi Salt for both cooking and for sprinkling straight onto food.  The salt has what they call a nice "finish" and a soft, subtle flavor that goes well with everything.  Try putting a little bit on a plate, with a little regular salt and do blindfold tastings with family and friends.  Alessi Salt comes in a box of 6 at a great price, which makes sharing fun.

review/summary: This product has changed!
review/text: My family and I have been enthusiastic consumers of this granola for years. We even switched grocery stores when our old one stopped carrying it. I'd say we went through about 2 bags a week, pretty regularly. Recently I have not been able to find my familiar package at the store--like the one pictured on Amazon. Instead the grocery store carried only the new "clusters." Disappointed by the change in structure and recipe, I went to Amazon to see if I could get the old one back. I was pleased to see it pictured--the old one, not the clusters. So I ordered SIX packages of the stuff. Instead of getting my old favorite granola, I got the darn clusters. We are hanging on to the granola we got from Amazon (it's not so bad that I need to send it back) but unless the old one returns, count us as "used to be customers." The clusters, which is what you'll get now, have far fewer nuts in favor of what seems to be less expensive fillers. Not fans of the new and "improved" clusters.

review/text: Enstrem's Toffee is absolutely the best candy I have ever eaten.  When I was a kid living in Grand Junction, Colorado (the home also of Enstrem's) my parents used to get a box of this every year at Christmas.  Needless to say the box would not last very long.  This is thick, rich, and buttery toffee at its finest.  Whole almonds inside this delicious toffee make for the excellent crunch and the crushed almonds and milk chocolate on the top is beyond yummy!  After you eat this awesomeness, there is the crushed almonds, bits of the toffee and chocolate, at the bottom of the box.  You literally have to shake the box of these delicious crumbs in your mouth!  Enstrems has become world famous not only for their toffee but for their chocolate, hard candy, and so much other delicious candy.  They have shops in Colorado from Grand Junciton to Colorado Springs.  It is now easy to order Enstrem's off the internet and their website is outstanding!  I order at least a pound of this delicious toffee every Christmas and have to be careful not to order it every month of the year!  But, I just torture myself and wait to Christmas to order this.  I can't recommend this delicious candy enough!  5 stars and more!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DELICIOUSNESS!

It is a little strong and tart, but I tend to mix it in with about a liter of water to dilute the sour taste a little and still have a great flavor.<br /><br />The box also calls it "skin essentials" and since I have been drinking it my skin has looked a little better. I drank plenty of water before so it wasn't that, and I still eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. I believe this has a the perfect blend of pomegranate and lemon to make the all around best anti-oxidant combination which would make skin look nicer as well. It has 10% daily value of vitamins A, C and E-which is not a ton but it is a little boost.<br /><br />Like most Crystal Light flavors it contains natural and artificial ingredients-so mostly artificial ingredients. Here is the ingredient list I found on the back of the package:Citric Acid, Modified Cornstarch, Aspartame (Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine), Potassium Citrate, Calcium Phosphate, Contains Less than 2% of Natural Flavor, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Vitamin E Acetate, Beta Carotene, Marigold Flower Extract (Source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin), Acesulfame Potassium, Sodium and Potassium Bicarbonate, Calcium Carbonate, Soy Lecithin, Red 40, Blue 1, Tocopherol (Preserves Freshness).<br /><br />source: Package of Crystal Ligh

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I drink Crystal Light like it was ...water!  This is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry/orange/grape, etc.  It is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be.  I do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors!

Thank goodness for this wonderful drink,which also keeps me hydrated...just mix with water and you are good to go.

review/summary: Hate This! Overly Sweet with a Bitter Artificial After-Taste! Nothing Like their Other Lemonades!
review/text: Despite still not being convinced of the safety of any artificial sweeteners and finding the price somewhat inexplicably high, I've been a years-long devotee of the various Crystal Light Lemonades due to the low cal factor and the fact that I don't like carbonated beverages.<br /><br />I love the Pink Lemonade flavor, though it seemed to disappear for a while and still is scarce. I also like the regular and Raspberry Lemonades, though the Raspberry seems to have changed formula for the worse over the past year or so. I do doctor these two flavors by either mixing them in equal parts and/or adding a splash of tangerine juice or some berry juice to the plain lemonade or a fresh-squeezed lemon (bottled lemon juice in a pinch) to either to perk them up and made them less fake tasting.<br /><br />So, looking for some additional variety, and going by the unanimous high praise in the reviews, I thought I'd give the Pomegranate flavor a try. Wow--bad decision! First off, I don't know where the Lemonade part comes in, as I don't taste a bit of it. I even tried my trick of mixing it 1 to 1 with the plain Lemonade mix, but to no avail. The phony "pomegranate" flavors, along with enough pigment to dye a blanket scarlet, and a distinct bitter artificial sweetener after-taste refuse to be concealed.<br /><br />I even thought I'd salvage my financial output by using these over time by adding just a but to my other Crystal Light concoctions, but this stuff, even in the tiniest measure, overpowers the everything. And, since each unit comes in a 5000 year thick plastic container, I can't even just toss them, but must add them to my giant pile of them filling up my garage, as I'm sure I can eventually find a use for them. (They're great for small items--if you're a crafter or a carpenter you'd probably be happy to use them to store beads, nails, screws, etc., but even you will end up with a huge stockpile unless you don't mind clogging the landfills.)<br /><br />I also don't care for the new packets Crystal Light is using inside the plastic tubs, but I've already complained about that in one or two other reviews or comments...

review/text: There's a lot of beef jerky choices out there.  This stuff had a dry, brittle, hard to chew consistency and poor flavor.  Not for me.<br /><br />On the positive side (sort of) I got a package that was 1 short of the four packs that were supposed to be in the box and had a post-it note indicating that one was missing - but it got sent anyway?  Odd.  When I let Amazon know, they refunded my entire purchase price.  Bad product, good customer service.  So I didn't feel bad at all when I tried several bites from two of the packs, then tossed the whole batch in the garbage.  Oh boy, Oberto.

review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: This is marketed as "thin style", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.

review/text: I would say I get less salt from sucking on a handful of sunflower seeds. This was horrible. Despite what the package says this is not the original jerky. I would eat a bag a day back in 2005 and 2006, so I was so excited to see this but it did not taste at all like the jerky from way back then.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just ate the thin peppered beef jerky and was surprised by the difference between the flavor of the peppered and the original flavor. Two thumbs up for the peppered jerky, in fact they don't even tast like they were made from the same company. I will make sure to always only buy peppered.

review/text: If you like beef jerky that is dry, over salted and super tough then Oberta Peppered Thin Style is sure to please. Despite being very tough in the first place the poor meat quality contained large amounts of gristly material that simply could not be chewed. The peppered flavoring was not bad and the only notable highlight in an otherwise terrible product. So two stars on the review. Otherwise this is worst quality jerky I have ever tried.

I don't usually do reviews but I felt I had to give my opinion on this one. I will NOT be buying this one again... Sorry Oh Boy! Oberto...

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: I love beef jerky, and it's perhaps the one thing standing between me and full-on vegetarianism but this product was too salty, didn't have enough pepper, and the thin strips were not as tasty and chewing a thicker slice of jerky. So, all in all, it was adequate, but Jack Links' peppered beef jerky is a much better choice.

review/summary: Lucky dog
review/text: Since I have been buying Firstmate dog food for my dog, I've noticed a remarkable change in his coat, his health, and, the reader should know, in his well-formed stool.  Another benefit of Firstmate is that the flavors are interchangeable, making eating kibble much more interesting for the dog. Try any flavor to begin -- I liked the idea of of my dog eating blueberries and chicken, so that's what I started him on -- and I think you'll agree with my review.

review/text: No peanuts.. so I dont have to worry about allergic reactions. When I first opened it, I made the mistake of string it. I saw the oil on the top and just assumed it was like peanut butter. That made it very runny. So, just pour that stuff on the top out when you get it. I made a sandwich with this, sugar-free wheat bread (which doesnt taste very good) and strawberry fig preserves... Absolute heaven!!! I could eat this stuff right off the spoon. Very low in carbs too.

review/summary: Great baby food when you don't have the time to make your own
review/text: After trying several organic jar baby foods in the grocery store & deciding that I would not feed them to my dog let alone my baby,  my husband and I decided to make our own organic baby food. Feeling a little overwhelmed I decided to try yummy spoonfuls.  It is an AMAZING baby food.  The only ingredients it contains are the organic fruit/veggie/grain and maybe some water.  The best part is, it actually tastes like the orignal item and looks like it. (for some reason bananas in the store are a pink/cream color - yuck) My husband and I now have made several items on our own, but I still purchase from Yummy Spoonfuls because of the convenience.  The only con is that the food is a little expensive and you have to have some freezer space, but I would even pay extra for potatoes, peas and blueberries just because of the labor intensive process that goes in to making them.  The customer service is great and I feel good knowing that I am feeding my baby healthy food with only natural ingredients.

review/text: Though we have just recently moved to stage 3 (chunky) we are still using some stage 2 (mushy yummy) as base for pastas at home, I can't even begin to express our family's gratitude for this brand.. In my opinion, NOTHING is better than home-made baby food blended with mommy's breastmilk. After personally tasting how yalkie baby foods in the markets are (especially the ones with meat flavor)  it is always with extra pride and less guilt that i buy and feed my baby Yummy Spoonfuls.. I wish every baby food manufacturer would really start making fresh food for kids. I love the fact that I can feed my precious baby freshly made food that taste fantastic without having taken the time to make it at home, we just started stage 3 and no surprise here, rice medley is fantastic, next in the freezer  to try is the adzuki beans, can't wait.. hubby eat the lentils so that review is going to come later..Love love love your product..Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Grateful mommy

review/summary: Yummy Spoonfuls vs. Jack's Harvest....My baby and I vote for Yummy Spoonfuls!!!
review/text: I have become a big fan of Yummy Spoonfuls over the past several months.  Now that my daughter is getting older, I am now ordering "mushy" in addition to "creamy".  This food is really great.  I always taste everything before giving to my daughter and I have never had a negative experience with Yummy Spoonful's flavors.  I feel good that I am offering healthy choices to my baby and yes, it cost much more than jarred food, but it is soooo much better.  I think it is totally worth it.<br /><br />Last month, I placed my first order for the "mushy" variety pack and also placed an order with Jack's Harvest "little lumpy" sampler pack at the same time.  Both orders arrived promptly...they actually arrived the same day.  I purchased with Jacks hoping to provide a little more variety for my baby since she seemed to be getting a little bored with her foods and since Jacks had 5 stars on Amazon I thought they would be a good choice.  Now that both my baby and I have had time to compare the two brands, we by far prefer Yummy Spoonfuls.  My baby has not rejected any of the Yummy Spoonfuls flavors, but I can only get her to happily eat 1 of the 3 flavors in Jack's Harvest Sampler pack. I was able to compare Yummy Spoonfuls butternut squash and apples to Jack's Harvest butternut squash and apples since both variety packs included that flavor.  Jack's was so tart that I had to add in so much cereal to tame the taste before I could get her to even take a couple of bites and that was all I was able to get out of her...a couple of bites.  I have tried again a few times since then and she now completely refuses Jack's Butternut Squash and Apples.  I have tasted as well and I would have to agree with my baby...the taste is not very enjoyable.  A week or so later, my baby tried Yummy Spoonfuls Butternut Squash and Apples and to my surprise (after how she reacted to Jack's)...she loved it.  Not sure what could be so different, but it sure is.  Yummy Spoonfuls taste is so much better.<br /><br />The heart shaped foods that Jacks sends are cute, but I find that I have to find another container to store it in since she does not eat the whole heart in one serving so it is a little inconvenient for me.  Yummy Spoonfuls comes in small plastic containers and I find them very convenient.  When my orders arrive, I put them in the freezer then the day before I am ready for them, I simply take out what I want, put it in the fridge and let it defrost.  Then once my baby has finished, I wash the container and reuse for snacks on the go.<br /><br />Also, to those who want more variety like me, Yummy Spoonfuls has great customer service and they allow you to customize the variety packs to what you want/need.  I simply send them an email with what flavors I want (you have to choose at least 3 of the same flavor) and they will change my order accordingly.<br /><br />Bottomline,  I really think Yummy Spoonfuls is doing a great job, the food tastes great and the containers have worked out well.

review/text: Health department regs in my state do not allow unsealed containers of food be brought in to daycare. This created a problem since I do not want to feed jarred food to my baby and they won't let me bring in homemade food.  Yummy Spoonfuls is the only company that I could find that makes individually packaged, frozen organic baby food. I feel better about sending it to daycare since it's frozen rather than jarred, and daycare happily accepts it. My baby has enjoyed every flavor available. I am so happy this product exists...I just wish it was a bit cheaper.

review/text: I wrote a few other reviews regarding this company. There is only maybe 2-2.5 oz of food in each cup. The food was fine but after I contacted the company about my discovery I got the run around. I ordered two different times thinking it was a fluke but it was not. Go with Jack's Havest brand. They do not lie about how much food you are getting and they do not package in wasteful containers.

review/text: I'm very happy with this product & will order it again.  I was skeptical about ordering frozen baby food off of the internet but this arrived completely frozen and was fresh with natural color. I had every intention on making my own baby food again like I did for my son but I just don't have the time & felt guilty for making it for him & not for my daughter. I was looking for baby food that was organic, fresh and tasted like homemade. While researching options I found that Yummy spoonfuls won the award from Cookie Magazine for best baby food so that is why I gave it a try. My daughter loves the taste of it, which shocked me because she is a picky eater. I struggle to get her to finish jar baby food. I think it is even better than what I could make at home, the portions are the perfect size and it is a lot easier.

review/text: There's the tradeoff.<br /><br />Yes, it's delicious, and the baby loves it. At over $3 per cup, it's also incredibly expensive, and I haven't seen any options to buy in bulk. As noted, it comes delivered in a huge styrofoam cooler, which ends up in your trash, the landfill and/or the ocean for every 12 cup variety pack you buy.<br /><br />So, the question is what's more important to you - the fact that it's delicious, or the fact that it's expensive.

review/summary: Too expensive and too much packaging
review/text: If you're not able to make your own and freeze it, this is certainly the next best thing.  It is very expensive for not a lot of food, especially considering if you were making your own it would cost you one tenth of what they are charging.<br />This comes in a styrofoam container.  So if you were ordering this on a regular basis you would be the proud owner of many styrofoam cooler containers... I'm not sure what to do with the one.  I know it comes frozen but it seems like there must be something out there other than styrofoam, honestly shouldn't the stuff be banned already?  My older two kids and I had a great time with the dry ice however.<br /><br />The baby does like the food so far.  Frozen instead of jars is an interesting idea, although I think I will freeze my own and continue to use my processor to process what we are eating for her and keep jars for emergencies.

review/summary: Tried frozen baby food and it was fresh
review/text: I received my order of food yesterday, I am so happy with the quality of the foods.  It was so good I think I will join my little one and eat Yummy Spoonfuls myself.  I have tried many other brands of organic baby food and have alwys been dissatisfied with the quality of the food, mainly with taste and/or the texture.  I will say this taste nothing like baby food, it is very rich in flavor and very fresh.  The Carrot, Sweet Potato and Broccoli was creamy and delicious, it was so "orangy" it looked like I had just pureed it myself best of all my baby enjoyed it.  This morning I tried the Blueberry Banana and Brown Rice and to my surprise he wanted more. I can't wait to try the other flavors later tonight.<br /><br />For the price I am completely happy with the product I received.  I lve in an area where organic produce is not readily available.  It is important for me to feed my little one organic, good quality foods all the time and being able to order this product online and receive it in 2 days works out perfect for me.  I also love that it is individually packaged, makes it easy to travel with.  I took some this morning to his nana to feed him while I am at work today.  No more worrying where to find food for him when out on the road, it beats trying to fix myself.  As a working mom it is great to find products like this one which makes my life much easier without sacrificing nutrition, taste or time.  Thanks Yummy Spoonfuls!

It is great on ribs, steak and fish. It is a fantastic rub that is great on ribs, steaks, and fish. The salt is brinier than table salt and gives an earthy flavor that really enhances the food. Try the spicier version as well!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Having lived in the UK for 3 years, I figured the British must know what to do with a salt and vinegar chip... Boy do they ever! I dislike the US versions; too strong.<br /><br />This chip/crisp is absolutely the most delicious salt and vinegar product I've tasted.

review/text: Im all for spicy but this was killer... And salty. Not a fan. Just get the plain stuff and cook a cup at a time.
