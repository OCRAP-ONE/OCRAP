review/summary: Very cheap and flat taste...
review/text: I was hoping for a nice creamy cappuccino for the evenings or during the day where a strong brew wasn't needed.  Well, *some* coffee flavor would have been good.  This tastes like coffeemate plus sugar plus old coffee grounds.  Its flat, sweet, thin, and ends with something of a slightly bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of aspartame...  with nothing in between.  There's not even a filter inside the k-cup...  just mostly cheap creamer...

However, since I found these cappuccino k-cups, it makes it much easier to fit in our budget. And they love the flavor! The French Vanilla ones are great too!

review/text: Everyone's tastes are different and I didn't expect to like this after reading some of the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised and glad I tried it. I prefer this French Vanilla over a couple of the other brands.  It's the only one I don't have to add sugar or creamer to and it's not too heavy on the vanilla for my taste.  I'm ordering enough to keep stocked up since it's my evening treat and a great price!

review/text: The Grove Square cappuccino is like a "comfort food" to me.  It is much like oneI get from a local ice cream parlor, the drink is comforting and relaxing, good for releasing stress at a time when that is extremely high in my life.  A good way to start a busy day for extra pep, yet a good "slow down" in the late afternoon or early evening when I need to let go of "life" and rest.

review/summary: Awesome Beverage
review/text: I bought the Keurig for my husband who really did not want it.  I don't drink coffee but love, love gadgets.  So order to enjoy my new GADGET I had to find something to make.  I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.

review/text: I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.

I will not buy this again at any price.<br />The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?

The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better.

review/text: This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.

If you think this review is an exaggeration and you have money to waste, try it out, and then proceed to throw $10 in the trash can. Keurig should seriously consider removing all of Grove square's products.

review/summary: YUCK! :(
review/text: Very excited to order these....but what a disgusting rip-off. I echo the sentiments of those who compared this to the stuff you get at truck stops- overly sweet and a bit oily....plus it is simply powdered mix in your k-cup....if you want this taste (probably a bit better) for like 25% of the cost buy some instant mix at your grocery store and run your Keuring with no k cup and stir.

review/summary: In a league of it's own!
review/text: If you're looking to buy some French Vanilla coffee, look no further! Having tried several k-cup flavors, I have to say this French Vanilla is in a league of it's own. It is amazing, so rich and creamy. I have made it both on the medium and small settings on my Keurig and both are very good, the small so creamy and thick, almost like a dessert. AND it is the least expensive of all the cups I've tried, being only 50c per cup, with the next lowest being 67c. I can't wait to try the Grove Square caramel flavor.

review/text: It wasn't until my It got "backed up" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the It or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my It frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.

I know I won't ever buy any of their "cappuccino" again, but I will give their hot chocolate and apple cider a try in hopes that they are drinkable.

review/text: Why do some reviewers seem to expect Italian coffee house products in each and every product made for K-Cups?  This is a Very Nice Cappuccino / French Vanilla flavored drink.  It is well above what you find in some gas stations - and not as good as in some others.  Just because you get it in a gas station does not make it bad - go to Italy and find out.  This makes a very acceptable cup using the middle or lowest setting.  Remember - less is stronger.<br /><br />60 cal (40 fat)  --  4.5g fat sat  --  9 carb  --  5g sugar  --  0g fiber

review/summary: Refreshing for the Afternoon Blahs
review/text: Yes, this is an instant coffee.  It dissolves as the hot water runs through the K-Cup.  But it is so refreshing and fast when you need a pick-me-up cup of coffee.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and I also like the hazelnut and caramel flavors.  You can't beat this price, especially with "Subscribe and Save".  I have found Grove Square at HEB in Texas, but it is more expensive than the price here.  I'm not very picky about it being a perfectly brewed coffee with deep, rich taste.  I just want something that is hot and tasty.  Try it out and if you don't like it, share it with a friend or family member who will be glad to have some free, good coffee.  A box of 18 K-Cups makes a great hostess gift.  By the way, the order is for 3 boxes of 18, a total of 54 cups of coffee.  I wasn't too clear on that when I ordered the first time.  Why pay $3 for a cup at Starbucks when this is just as good, convenient at home, and tastes great?

review/text: I purchased these at walmart but they were so bad I wanted to come review them so you guys online can be warned.  I brewed myself a cup and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it, i had to throw it out.  First off, I want to say that I'm not a cappuccino snob, I enjoy a great cappuccino at a coffee shop but I also regularly drink the powdered flavored kind that you just mix with water.  I didn't have the highest of standards for this drink to begun with but it was bad, t doesn't have very much flavor the flavor that it does have is not good, it's watery (I brewed it on the small cup setting) and it has a bad aftertaste that I just couldn't get over.  These are also pretty expensive for what you get and you are much better off in my opinion to just go to get a mix with water types.

It's as good as those French Vanilla cappuccinos you might get from a gas station in the middle of the night when driving down I-5, but you can get it in your own kitchen.<br /><br />Does it have much coffee in there? It's hard to say. The box claims that there is some instant coffee inside, but it certainly doesn't taste like it. It simply tastes like sweet delicious vanilla.

review/text: I had been waiting for a while for a Cappuccino on the Keurig and I happened to find this one at the store. It's like drinking an angel wrapped in a unicorn. In other words, my new favorite Keurig drink! If you're not a coffee snob and you like French Vanilla and Cappuccino, try this product!

review/summary: BETTER THAN "5 HOUR ENERGY" AND GREAT FOR A HANGOVER
review/text: Yessiree- this is the same sweet coffee-esque sugar buzz that you'll find at most convenience stores and gas stations. Is it a chemical abomination? You bet! Does it taste great with a day-old buttered roll in a wax-paper sleeve? Absolutely! Here is the real thing that fogs your windows and leaves a vanilla aroma in its aftermath. It is sickeningly sweet and guaranteed to snap you out of a hangover when followed with a day-old roll or bagel with cream cheese. Nothing short of an American classic and friend of the open road.<br /><br />It's not just about the sugar. They actually put 30mg of caffeine into this concoction of--well, you really don't need to know.<br /><br />It's cheaper than the $1.75 at the gas station (around $.45 a paper cup).<br /><br />It's not actually coffee-- but it hits the spot when you're down and out and need something more for breakfast than a Baby Ruth Bar.<br /><br />Go ahead- you know that you want this, uh...whatever it is. Mmmmm! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!

review/summary: Great Cappuccino
review/text: I really was wary about ordering this since I's picky about cappuccino but it's great. I like my cuppuccino a bit sweeter so I add 2 Sweet and Low packets per cup.  I'm hooked now on this Grove Square brand. It's great!  Very smooth tasting and good finish.

review/summary: Really deserves each star!
review/text: My favorite thing about this K-cup Cappuccino is that it does NOT taste artificial!!!!  I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?

review/summary: Great taste, a smooth and sweet coffee
review/text: I finally found a coffee that I can say I love!  I may never go to Starbuck's again!  This coffe is just strong enough, not too bitter.  Also has a smooth and sweet taste from the french vanilla.  And, the best part is each cup is only 80 calories!  I will definitely order this brand again.  I'm usually a hot chocolate or mocha coffee drinker, but this will be my coffee of choice and I will always have on hand to brew a fresh cup.

Taste fantastic, is just the right strength to get you going when you need to but not so strong where it gives you the shakes..

review/summary: My new favorite for a cocoa-type drink
review/text: While Mocha Nut Fudge coffee is still my favorite, and hazelnut the coffee I most often drink,  This is the best tasting cocoa-type think I have yet had.  I find myself drinking the hazelnut, then making this in the same cup with some of the hazelnut still in there, as well as just drinking it by itself.<br />After trying several cocoas and cappuccinos, I was skipping the kcups and just using the machine to make hot water and using the far cheaper instant cocoa packets.  But after a freind had me try the caramel cappuccino, I ordered boxes of my own, and I am still happy with the taste after a month of it.

review/summary: Real coffee???
review/text: I bought a box of Grove Square "medium roast" for $10.00. I thought, what a great price for K-Cup coffee.<br />Ya right! When I opened the box I thought that the cups were very light. Of course their light, they are filled with instant coffee!<br />For the amount of "instant" coffee that I got for $10 I could have bought 2 jars at the same price and got 100 times the same type of coffee.<br />I expect REAL coffee when I pay around 50c a cup.

review/summary: Non Sequitur - Instant coffee from K-Cup Brewer
review/text: I had a cup of this at a friend's home, and he asked me if I liked it. I told him frankly that it wasn't great; it tasted too much like instant coffee. He said that it WAS instant! Conclusion: It is anathema to use a K-Cup brewer to make INSTANT anything. And at 50 cents (minimum) per cup, it's got to be the height of misplaced convenience. There are wonderful flavored coffee K-Cup varieties out there -- try them.

review/summary: Grove Square Cappuchino
review/text: I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company, Sturm Foods, Inc.,  I learned they do not refund customers based on "personal taste". I would suggest staying with a brand you know and love and avoid this "bargain" item.

review/summary: Disgusting.
review/text: Whoever designed and/or created this product has never had a real cappuccino. Even the ones from McDonald's rank as gourmet compared to this vile substance. Unless you are a fan of flavored laxatives,which is what this reminded me of, save your cash and just either buy an over priced cappuccino from a trendy cookie-cutter coffee vendor, McDonald's or a gas station because any of them have better tasting product than this. I literally took a sip and spewed it out in the sink. It was foul. Seriously, don't buy it.
