review/summary: Extremely tasty but very hard to find.
review/text: We picked up 3 bottles of this about a month ago at a Winco grocery store in Northern California for $2.00 per bottle.  It is a delicious edition of Heinz Ketchup.  It is rich and tangy, with a not too sweet flavor.  I would recommend this on any hamburger, we had it with sweet potato fries and it was so good.  We even used less of this than we usually do with regular ketchup.  We have actively been looking for this ketchup at all stores we go to and we haven't been able to find it again.  I did read in a magazine that Wal-Mart will be carrying it for a limited time for the same price point that we bought it at.  I also heard a Heinz executive mention it as an upcoming new product, so hopefully it will become more available before it goes away forever.

review/summary: Delicious and Portable Snack
review/text: I am a frequent traveler and always looking for handy snacks that will fit in small spaces in my laptop bag or purse. I love these cocoa-roasted almonds! They are delicious, with just a hint of cocoa and sweetness, and they are always fresh. Almonds are a great snack, they help keep my hunger under control during those long meetings and training sessions. The only complaint I have is the little bit of cocoa dust that makes the snack a bit messy, although this is a minor annoyance.

review/text: This is a little bit of portion control heaven.  These cocoa roast almonds are really a delicious treat in many ways with crunch and a solid deep chocolate and almond taste with just the right amount of sweetness.  The 100-calorie packs take the guesswork out of portioning, and especially if you're watching portions and calories, being able to take a bag and eat the whole thing without guilt can be very satisfying. This is a yummy little snack.

review/text: Who would have guessed that this combination would work, taste so good and satisfying?<br /><br />The concept is so simple. We have been eating all kinds of chocolate impregnated with almonds. Why not the other way around.<br /><br />The size of the packed is not only good for calorie counters but also from a snack stand points its self. Being in individual packages, helps keep and ration it through the workweek.<br /><br />I did try sucking on them and that just does not work as it is the combination that fives the sweetness and fullness to the snack.

My coworkers tried them and love them too, now we all bring them in. 3 of us in the office are on weight watchers, and the 100 calorie packs are 2 points each, which makes them great for a snack since they have all the good fats we need and keep us on track (otherwise the 3 of us on weight watchers would end up in line at the vending machine looking for something with chocolaty goodness). Highly recommended.

All you do is push the spikes in the dirt around your plants and it fertilizes and releases insecticide that the plant draws up into it's tissues.

No spraying or mixing and you don't have to worry about applying on a windy day, or trying to get it on the under side of leaves.  I LOVE it.

I threw one of these fertilizer/bug killer sticks into the soil, and within a week or so i am yet to see one. Pretty amazing actually, as I didn't think it would actually work. If the bugs look like gnats, and fly around this product will kill em!<br /><br />You also get 10 of them in the package, which will last quite some time

review/summary: be warned- you need multiple spikes per plant
review/text: I have a rather large container garden outside on my lanai (anywhere from 75-100 pots and planters depending on what I've got growing). Pests *can* be a problem, especially mealybugs. I usually treat with either tons of power misting from the hose (takes care of almost all pests- do it several days in a row and it usually eliminates the problem altogether) or Safer spray products, because I try to be mindful of environmental factors. Plus we live right on a bay and we've got three cats who roam the lanai and a bunch of tiny lizards and frogs that live *in* and among the plants.<br /><br />However, every so often the pests get out of control (mealybugs.... ARGH) and the eco-friendly options don't do anything, and instead of tossing ten plants, I have to get something stronger. I like these Bayer spikes because I can control the application. I like that they are buried in the soil and treat from the inside out. I also can control how much water I give the plant after the spike has been buried, so that there's no runoff. It's a VERY controlled pest control solution.<br /><br />However, unless you are growing plants in pots the size of teacups, you will need multiple spikes per plant. I can usually treat about 2-3 plants per pack, which isn't really a great bargain. However, if you have an infestation on a prized plant, this might be a good option instead of dousing the plant with liquid chemicals or pouring in gradules on the surface of the soil, which will likely be run off when you water.<br /><br />So be aware you won't get much use from one pack, and there are much safer options, but if you are looking for a controlled way to kill pests from the INSIDE and not be applying toxic chemicals to the surface of the plant and soil and area surrounding, this is a great option.

Long and short of it is these don't really work.  I would recommend [...]details as a solution over these.  I had soil gnats like a m** f** and if anyone has had the same, they know its not fun, pleasant, or anything similar.  After applying the one linked and watering well, there were one or two stray gnats within two days, and none within a week.

review/summary: Fertilizer works but wont control white flies!
review/text: I bought several of these fertilizer/pesticide stakes and was mildly disappointed in the product. Our garden has been over run by white flies lately and after reading these could kill them I bought 3 packages and followed the directions in placing the stakes in my pots. The product comes with a bunch of stakes and an applicator to place the stakes in your soil. Simple enough so I added 4 stakes to each pot. After a few days the plants looked greener from the fertilizer but the white flies were still out of hand.<br /><br />After a week the flies were still there in great numbers so I applied another 2 stakes to each pot. Fast forward 3 weeks and the flies were still out of control.  As a fertilizer they work well but in my experience the have no effect on white flies which is unfortunate because it says right on the labelling that it kills them...<br /><br />For the price I think you are better off looking at other options.

review/text: I had some insects in the soil that were eventually killed, but it took replacing the spikes a few times to get rid of all of them. If you catch the insects sooner than I did, they might work in a single application. Keep in mind that the process is slow, unlike a spray, since the insecticide has to spread through the soil and the plant to work.<br />If your household has children, you might want to be careful with keeping these out of reach, as the spikes resemble large tablets, and they can be dispensed easily by pressing them through the foil backing.

review/text: I knew this was going to be strong going into it. I mean its named Black Tiger. It delivers. I had to purchase another weaker set of K-cups to drink after my initial blast. Its strong, but not that nasty burnt flavor that you can sometimes get.

review/summary: Perfect Combination of Smooth and Dark
review/text: I'm really glad I gave this flavor a try. Like other Coffee People blends, Black Tiger is spicy and a full of flavor. It is a bit darker than the Donut House blend - which I guess you'd expect - but it is also, ironically, a lot smoother as you drink it. I've really begun to enjoy Coffee People's products because they're really tasty without being overwhelming like, say, Starbucks.

review/text: Black Tiger is by far the best coffee I have ever tasted(for Keurig machines). We have a keurig machine at work and Black Tiger is the only flavor I will drink now that we ordered it by chance when an older flavor was no longer being made. Black Tiger actually tastes like coffee should. I had, up until I tasted this, thought that the keurig was unable of brewing a decent cup of coffee but thanks to Black Tiger now I have something to look forward to when I want a cup of coffee at work.

This company is owned by green mountain, hopefully they keep this brand going strong!  My wife prefers the less strong, but equally smooth, donut shop which serves as my backup when i am out.

More often than not I receive crushed, open K cups and coffee ground are all in the bottom of the box. The last time I received it, I got my crushed K cups and the crushed original box folded up all inside another box. When you notify Amazon that 1/5th of your product was ruined they don't offer to make it right, either. It's almost better to order directly from Keurig. Amazon isn't that much cheap and Keurig offers automatic shipments, also.

review/summary: Coffee good but not great--- k-cup quality awful
review/text: Opinions on coffee, like those on most food or drink are subjective. On coffee quality only, I would give this product 4 stars... like I said, "good, but not great".<br /><br />On the other hand, the quality of the K-Cups is a very objective item. I purchased my first (and last) box of the "Coffee People" cups after Amazon discontinued the "Subscribe and Save" on the Timothy's Parisian Nights K-Cups, in April of 2011.<br /><br />I provided Amazon with direct feedback that this product is substandard, and also noticed that many of the poor reviews of this product were from customers complaining of leaky or otherwise badly constructed k-cups. Some of these reviews were from over 1 year ago. (Shame on me for not catching this  prior to choosing this product.)....<br /><br />My advice, don't buy this brand... the bad cups will end up costing you more than what it would cost to buy KCups at your local grocer.

review/text: I have sampled most of the K- Cups.  During that process my husband and myself almost went back to a French Press.  Obviously using a single serve machine is the easiest way to brew and enjoy coffee.  After reading the reviews, we tried Black Tiger and knew we had found the right flavor for us.  It has a bold robust flavor without the bitterness.  It is comparable to Starbucks "Pike".  Everyone that uses a single serve brewer knows that it is the most expensive way to enjoy coffee.  Combine the ease with the perfect smoothness of Bold Tiger and you cannot go wrong.

I felt like the acid finish was too much, and the coffee was over roasted tasting.  Jet fuel is very similar with less acid finish, wake up call is again similiar and I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.<br /><br />We are relative novices when it comes to K-Cups, Prior to receiving the Keurigg we used a percolator and it still makes the best coffee in my opinion.  As a refernce point, we enjoyed Starbucks Komodo Dragon, and Cafe Verona.  We also enjoyed Dunkin Donuts coffee on the less expensive end.

review/summary: Exquisitely Rich & Black!
review/text: I am so glad I paid more attention to the positive reviews for this than to the negative ones.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started brewing it because it is SO black, but it turned out incredible.  It is so rich, it feels creamy on the palate.  No bitterness at all, only fullness.  I do have to say that when I first started trying several different coffees, I wasn't giving each brew it's rightful place.  By this, I mean I was making the mistake of adding the same cream and sugar for each kind and you can not do that!  If you drink it black, which I don't, then this wouldn't matter but if you add cream and sugar the amount you add for each kind of coffee will be different.  Every coffee has a certain amount or lack of sweetness on it's own and if you add the same sugar to it, you will ruin that brew.  I start each cup with just about 1/2 tsp. and then work up to another pinch if I need it according the the taste of that coffee.  This one needed very little sugar and a little more cream than for some kinds.  It is different with each cup.  Once I figured this out, they are all unique in their own right.  I imagine as time goes on there will be one I don't like and can't "adjust to suit my taste", but I haven't found it yet!  Loving my Keurig and the deal on these K-cups!

When i drink a cup of coffee, i want it to have a punch..after years of trying all brands, i finally found a grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat cup of coffee...BLACK TIGER!!! It is strong, but not bitter. Its taking years...but i finally found it..You must try BLACK TIGER.

review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: Finally I've found a K-cup coffee that delivers. Even brewing the maximum-sized cup produces the nice dark flavor of some of the best French roasts. Until now, my favorite has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>, which produces a "dark" cup of coffee, but not quite as bold as the Black Tiger. If you like a genuinely bold cup of joe, I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XLH4Y">Coffee People Jet Fuel</a>.

review/summary: One of my favorites!
review/text: I agree with some other comments about the Tiger in that it is not as strong as you might think, like a Midgnight Magic from Timothy's or Green Mountain. Having tried many of the dark & bold blends, however, I think it is one of the nicest all-around flavors. It's got a nice, deep, complex flavor without the bitterness you find in many of the espresso blends.<br /><br />Black Tiger is always one that I order because I can drink it regularly without the harshness. It's always in the shopping cart!

review/text: Something was defintely different this time around. Extremely bitter tasting k-cups.  I have had about 10 thus far and are giving up on the batch.  Too bad as it was pretty ok previously.  I suspect a victim of another brilliant cost cutting move by corporate bean counters.  Bye Bye Black Tiger.  Hello again Green Mountain Dark Magic.

review/text: I like strong bold flavor coffee. I started out drinking Green Mountain Dark Magic, and would rate Black Tiger between that and Santa's Buzz. Santa's Buzz is my favorite very bold flavor, and a definite caffeine rush. Black Tiger is very close but not as extreme as Santa's Buzz. I would order Black Tiger again, but for now as long as I can still get Santa's Buzz that is what I will be drinking.

review/text: After living in Portland OR, I found the Coffee People coffee not only superior but the people were awesome - now that they have been pretty much bought out by Starbucks - my local Coffee People store is sorely missed... but now I can use my Keurig and brew up some Black Tiger in a flash - strong- not bitter... not for the weak! I love it.

review/text: Really good bold taste without the after taste or being too strong for the stomach.  My only complaint is that a few of the K-Cups were open and made a huge mess and gave me few less cups of coffee.  But that's a pacakaging issue.  I definitely recommend you buy this coffee if you like a robust taste.

review/text: I love the convenience of the K-cup, but feel guilty about the environmental consequences of my choice. This packaging option lessens that guilt a tiny bit. Why have boxes within boxes if you are using the product in your home? Coffee People really do know how to do coffee and I am always impressed with their selections. A big thumbs up for a smarter packaging choice!

review/text: If you like rich, full-bodied, coffee, Black Tiger is for you.  I've tried most all of the dark and medium roast K-Cups that are available, and this is my consistent favorite.  Guests are always very impressed, and more to point, guests that have their own Keurig machine have commented how good this coffee is and write down the name so they can order some for themselves.  If you like full-bodied coffee, I highly recommend you give Black Tiger a try.

review/text: First I must say that I absolutely love my Keurig coffee machine.  I like my coffee fresh and when using regular type coffee machines only enjoyed the very first cup, then the coffee tasted old. Now every cup tastes wonderfully fresh, I would never use any other coffee machine.  I like my coffee strong and find Black Tiger to be pleasantly strong without being bitter at all.  I always buy my coffee from Amazon as it is the best deal, - much cheaper than other sites.

I like the packaging all in one box - less waste.

review/text: First off, I love all the Coffee People coffee..at least all the ones they make in K-Cups, but I like a stronger, bolder coffee.  While Jet Fuel and Wake-Up Call are my favorites of the bolder coffees I have chosen to stay with the Black Tiger as my main stay KCup of choice, I cant really say what in the flavor make it my favorite, just that it is.  And  I LOVE the frustration free packaging and the auto ordering.

review/text: I purchased the Black Tiger based on the reviews...one especially said it tasted like the Starbucks espresso. Boy, that couldn't have been more untrue. The coffee is sour and leaves a putrid bitter aftertaste. I can handle bold and extra bold but this is just gross. My favorite K-cup is coffee People Kona.....I really wish I wouldn't have bought 50 of these. Gross.

review/summary: VERY BITTER, WEAK COFFEE FLAVOR
review/text: I am a die-hard Keurig fan, and not too picky about my coffee. I prefer a stronger cup and don't use sugar. This blend was extremely bitter and lacked substance. I've tried 20+ blends for my Keuring and this is the only blend that I would'nt drink. I agree with another rater that compares this to the Jet Feul, but the Jet Fuel has a bit more taste and was tolerable for me. Nothing compares to the Newmann's Own Extra Bold Organic. It is cheaper at BJ's ($33 for 80 cups) versus the BJ's website.<br /><br />I also enjoy the Donut Shop Blend and the Green Mountain Nantucket or Breakfast Blend. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Great cofee! Sucky shipping!
review/text: This is my favorite k-cup coffee- no complaints there. Amazon shipped them loose in a box- no padding to keep them from jostling in transit. One foil seal was punctured, several were loosened at the edges. Every cup was covered with coffee grounds residue. In the past, they came with some filler in the box to keep them from moving around during shipping. These were just thrown in- cheap and lazy shipping- errrhhh.
