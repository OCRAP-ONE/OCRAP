review/summary: Nonni's Biscotti - Cioccolati
review/text: These are high quality biscotti that you come to expect from a brand like Nonni's.  There are no disappointments to be found with this product.  The tastes is fresh and the bittersweet chocolate is to die for.  I even love the anise seeds.  This pairs well with P&G tips tea or any of your favorite Keurig coffees.  None of my biscotti have been broken and I am on my second box.

review/summary: Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!
review/text: I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in). There is just enough of it to give you a taste without making you feel you are eating a chocolate bar!<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: A good coffeebreak snack
review/text: This product is a superior light biscotti, crunchy without being hard, and with a light coating of chocolate.  The texture is good, and the flavor is good.  Each piece is 110 calories.  It makes a good snack for a mid-afternoon break, or can be added into a brown bag lunch.  The chocolate coating is heat sensitive, and I would recommend against shipping it in hot weather.

review/text: First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: This is a great dog treat if you don't want your dog to have too many calories.  Hey, they get weight problems too!  We have a Silky Terrier who had gained some weight due to his owners being to generous with the high calorie treats.  My daughter reminded me of Charlee Bears, so I called our pet store and they said they did not have any.  After that, I searched Amazon, like I always do and there they were : )<br /><br />Oh, I mentioned low-calorie, but didn't say how many.  Charlee Bears only have 3 calories in each tiny treat.  One thing all should know is a hint a vet gave me years ago:  he said a dog doesn't know he's getting a tiny treat or a big one, all he knows is he is getting a treat.  He said no one should give those huge treats to their pets, not even to large dogs because most dog food contains all a dog really needs and lastly, like most humans, many dogs do not get the daily exercise they should.

review/text: I have a 9 month old weimaraner who loves these treats. I have been mixing them with the Zuke's Chicken mini Naturals dog treats, and bacon strip broken into pieces for puppy class to help him stay interested. But the other two smell so strong that they make these a little smelly for class.  I take these along on walks for him and to dog parks because they don't smell strong and I can sometimes sneak them to him without other dogs knowing. They also don't make my coats smell as bad. They are also only 3 calories a piece so they are not super unhealthy. So great to know what your feeding your dog. The ingredients are wheat flour, liver (poultry liver preserved naturally with vitamin E), salt (1 tablespoon per 100-pound), garlic powder.

review/summary: Little surprised at oyster cracker like liver snacks
review/text: Little disappointed at first when received and my sheltie sort of went nose up on them  and I thought they where soup crackers. But he started liking them and there certainly are enough of them in bag. Think they would be good for dog training where you just need something little for repetitive positive reinforcment. I'm not sure of the taste but he is liking them more and more.

review/summary: Great training treat!
review/text: My dogs love these little treats.  They have been perfect for training my energetic Yellow Lab and he loves them.  I think the price is fair for a whole pound of easy to use training treats.  I've had no issues with stomach upset or any other issues as I have with the egg version of this product.  This one causes no gas and the dogs enjoy them.  Good deal. Go for it.

review/summary: Great training treats!
review/text: My dogs love these!  I bought them because they were relatively cheap, and not full of chemicals, and figured the dogs wouldn't be crazy about them, but I was wrong.  My Akita in particular loves these, which is funny, given how small they are and how big he is!  I didn't expect such a small, unassuming looking treat to be a high value reward, but the dogs do love them, and I like them too since they are not messy and are low calorie--so you can use a lot!

review/summary: Great for training & watching weight!
review/text: We have a mini dachshund and since we want to keep his weight under control and do obedience training this treat was perfect. At only 3 calories each we don't have to worry as much about adjusting his meal later or counting treats which allows us to have longer training sessions with our pup. The price is better than in stores and with prime shipping this is a great buy.

review/summary: Nice!
review/text: We definitely have picky dogs and it's hard to find something that has longevity or that they like. We're still training our puppies, so these are a great low calorie snack that they seem to really like the flavor of.<br />The only downside for me is the size of each one, they're about dime size. If you have a lab mix with a big mouth you better have a good size handful or she is going to have a handful of your hand in her mouth.<br />Packaging was great, ordered on Prime. They arrived next day which was a relief. It's hard to find anything worth the money with a good value to it. For the price and the amount of snacks you get this is quite the bargain.<br />Definitely a staple for the snack jar!

review/summary: Loved by the entire pack
review/text: I have three boston terriers and one french bulldog, and they love these treats. The small size and low calories make them perfect for rewards. All of my dogs had a slight weight problem, but after switching their rewards to Charlee Bears (a better value as well) they have all lost the extra weight and are very fit. I feed them a high quality dog food and make sure they have the play/exercise time that they need, but the treats I was feeding before switching to Charlee Bears were too high in calories and too large. Their vet is happy, I'm happy, and most of all my dogs are happy. They love their Charlee Bears!

review/summary: Dog crack.
review/text: Dogs love treats.  All I can say is the look in their eyes has changed from one of excitement and food gratification to addiction.  I have a Pug and a Brussels Griffon who would give this ten stars if they could.  These are kibble size treats - training size - so don't think you are getting biscuits here (like Milk Bones).  The nice thing is two or three of these with a small dog seems to do the trick.  I work from home three out of five days of the week, and now have to keep a few of these by the computer so I can save trips upstairs to the kitchen.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: I am a pet sitter and give Charlee Bear treats to all the pets I sit for.  I have never had a pet turn away from Charlee Bears.  Because they are low in calorie I don't have to worry about adding extra weight to the pets while their parents are away.  They are great reward treats because of their small size and are easy to carry in my pocket while we are playing or walking. Hide and seek is a great game to play with these treats.  I also use them as rewards when I am grooming or clipping nails.  It is amazing to see how a dog will allow me to trim their nails without a fuss just because they know they will get a Charlee Bear treat.

review/text: Since our dog was a puppy we have been training him with these little treats. They are convenient to carry in your pocket for impromptu training sessions or rewarding opportunities.

review/text: This is a great training treat since it is meat flavored but doesn't make a mess in your pockets like the meat and jerky dog treats do, and it is not crumbly or oily like some of the dog cookies.

(My dog is also an exceedingly picky eater.)However, I can get a whole pound or more of Charlee Bears for what a 6 oz bag costs me of the Fromms Family treats.

review/summary: Dogs Love Them and They're Cheap as Dirt
review/text: We got our first jar of these treats from the breeder who raised our dog.  She said exactly what I used as the title of the review--"Dogs love them and they are cheap as dirt."<br /><br />When I looked a the label I was happy with the ingredients, and I saw that they are only 3 calories per treat!  The small size means that you can use them for training, and you can give the dog a lot of them without filling up--and you won't have given the dog a lot of calories, either.<br /><br />This is a good thing to keep in mind if you need to plump up your order to $25 to get free shipping.  If your order is at $20, you can save more than the price of the treats by ordering them!  And your dog will love you for it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: The size of the treats is perfect for smaller dogs.  It is also the right size for the manufacturing process because it is easier to bake and less likely to break in the package. For larger breeds, just give them a few a time and should not be any problem. All dogs love liver treat. I tried to bake liver cookies myself but it is a lot of trouble. Not only it take a lot of time to mix and bake, the smell of the it is not very pleasing to human. I saw a lot of frowned faces in the house when I was baking it. This is great, not too expensive and goes a good mileage.

These treats are great - the price was considerably less then most training treats, they are small and easy for her to eat quickly, they have a great smell to dogs, they are low calorie.  Our trainer recommended dry treats because soft treats get stuck in their teeth and can encourage decay.  These are about the size of a dime - perfect size for any dog.  Keep in mind when training you don't need huge treats - a treat is a treat to your dog.  I will definitely be buying more of these.  I would recommend them to anyone using treats for training.

review/text: These are a hit with my pups, and for the price and 3 calories a piece, they can't be beat!  They're great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied.  I also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toes.<br /><br />First ingredient is wheat flour, so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these won't work for you.  My dogs aren't allergic, nor do these treats give tummy problems, so I'm happy!  Ingredient list is short, that's another plus, it's not a long list of artificial this and that.<br /><br />I give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese/egg flavor to mix things up a bit.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Turns out my younger sheltie has epilepsy, and possible seizure triggers are wheat, corn, and gluten.  Can't give him these these Charlee Bear treats anymore. =(

I think the product description for Charlee Bear treats should be amended to reflect that they contain garlic.  We won't make the mistake of buying these treats again.

review/summary: High Calorie Treat
review/text: These are about the size of a small rounded lima bean. They have a shocking 3 calories each, twice as many as a lima bean which has about 1 1/2 calories. No, I am not suggesting that you feed your dog lima beans - just making a comparison based on size. I have a Dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats. However, because each of these tiny treats has 3 calories I can't give him very many or he would gain too much weight. If you have a teeny tiny dog that would be satisfied with just one of these teeny tiny treats then go for them. If you have a big dog as I do then you can find a much better treat without all the comparable calories.

review/summary: am I seeing the right price?
review/text: I have purchased this in the store and loved it.  These boxes were introduced to the local stores at 99 cents each.  Now they are running about $2 per box in the store (each box contains 5 packets/ net weight 7.55 oz.). If this is a 6-pack, I can't see why I would spend much more than $12 to order on-line.  I'd even throw in a little extra to get the "unusual" flavor that I like but WOW -- WHAT A HUGE MARK-UP ON AMAZON!

review/text: I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind.

I have purchased from numerous companies claiming to taste like the buttered movie theater popcorn that you used to be able to get and this is the ONLY one that has come even close.  Also, their butter topping (which you can order from their homesite) DOES taste like the movie butter topping that was used in theaters years ago.  I will always order Wabash Valley Farms!!!

And it is very good popcorn but if you use the full seasoning/butter-like-substance packet it is really not popcorn you want to eat on a very regular basis because your sodium and cholesterol levels will go through the roof! If you don't care about the health impact, I wholeheartedly endorse it.

review/summary: Be sure and get the whirly popper
review/text: My 14 year old is a popcorn fanatic. Popcorn for dinner is a treat for her and drives her dad crazy. We are a family of five and we all really enjoy this popcorn. This will be our third case in about 15 months. We love it. It can get a little too oily for us old folks but the teenagers love it and when my friends come over they love it too. So my husband and I usually split a bag with the teenage girls and we have just enough. The bag does make plenty however, if you don't make the popcorn in about three months or if you store it in a warm place and the kernels get stale, the popcorn does not pop very well, so store carefully and pay close attention to the expiration dates on the serving bag. ENJOY!!!

This is the way we used to do it on the stove. I bought these as a birthday present for a real popcorn lover and of course had to share some. It popped almost all the kernels and was not dry like you get out of a microwave. Very light and easy to eat. I could't put it down. If you like the greasy stuff you get at the movies these days you will need to add butter but this is great popcorn as is.
