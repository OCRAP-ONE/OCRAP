review/summary: Breakfast of Champions
review/text: I eat a can of this soup everyday for breakfast.  I add a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes, minced garlic and couple of tablespoons of chopped onions.  This is the best canned soup I've ever tasted. I'll drive from store to store to purchase it.  It must be very popular since my usual grocery store is sold out of it a lot.<br /><br />It's still a tad too salty but it's much better than most soups. I've tried other brands but not compares to Select Harvest.  Yummy!!

review/text: I have so far ordered them 3-4 times and always have liked them. You get them on amazon at the same price you pay for them at any indian grocery store, which is unlike any other Indian dessert that you find on amazon.  Price is one of the reasons, we keep buying them from amazon, followed by convenient 2-days shopping from amazon.

review/summary: Authentic Tasting & Delicious
review/text: The first time I ever tasted Gulab Jamun was at my parent's friends' home where we had been invited for dinner.  They were from India and everything we ate that evening was homemade including this lovely dessert.  Spicy World Gulab Jamun remind me of the fantastic homemade ones I had previously tasted.  Syrupy, sweet with a nice hint of cardamom.  Would have given 5 stars except that the packaging was a little rusty on the outside.  I did check the expiration date and made sure it was properly sealed.  I'm planning on purchasing these again, hopefully the cans will be in perfect condition next time.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Better tasting than canned!!
review/text: I am from the Caribbean, so I know how coconut milk for cooking should taste.  For many years I have used either a fresh coconut (which to me is a lot of work, with the breaking open the coconut, removing piulp from the hard shell and grating or blending) or canned Asian products (some with strange aftertaste - you have to use entire can unless you freeze remainder).  When I went back home for a visit this year, I saw this powder in the store, bought a pack because I was skeptical, and was amazed.  I use it for cooking and you can make it as creamy as you wish based on your recipe.  I brought some back with me and thought I would have to get it sent in the mail from back home.  I checked Amazon and I am very happy to find this right here. I am not vegan and I know where "MILK based sodium caseinate" comes from.<br /><br />If you are looking for a no-hassle authentic tasting coconut milk - this should be your choice!!

review/text: I bought this product to make some vegan milk soap. However, after reading the ingredients "...sodium caseinate (From Milk)..." and that is how it is worded. I thought, does not mean animal milk? So I did a google, and sure enough caseinate is produced from mammals, usually derived from cows for food purposes. Do not waste your money if you are looking for vegan here, it is not. If you care not about vegan, I still do not recommend this product because it comes from Sri Lanka, which means it supports the concentration camps of the Tamil civilians. I know this because my husband is Tamilian. Thank God we do not live in Sri Lanka. Google no to Sri Lanka if you need more evidence.

review/summary: Misleading label
review/text: This is in reference to the Unsweetened tea. The label on front proclaims in giant print that it is brewed with all natural ingredients.<br /><br />Only on the back in fine print under ingredients do you learn that it has "CARAMEL COLOR ADDED [ed. emphasis] for uniformity of color". I would contend they did it to make it look darker and stronger than their competitors.<br /><br />I grew up in the south and my mom made iced tea twice per day and she never felt compelled to add any caramel color and we never complained it wasn't dark enough. She let the tea provide its own color, just as nature made it.<br /><br />Tradewinds should stop trying to dupe their customers with misleading labels. The tea was only so-so anyway. I certainly won't buy it again...and besides the price I paid was about half of Amazon's price and since I bought locally, there was no shipping either. This one is a loser.

review/text: I would never pay the fortune being asked to have it shipped!  The shipping cost alone is DOUBLE the cost of the tea itself!  How does a gallon jug of tea translate into a shipping weight of 10 pounds?  It's madness!  What's even more crazy is that I happen to live very close to where this tea is produced and bottled (Cincinnati, OH) and for some reason, it's even difficult to find around here!  The TradeWinds company must have a really poor marketing and distribution staff because, despite all the products the company supposedly makes, I can only find their jugs of Sweet Tea very occasionally.  This area should be SATURATED with their products, and yet I never see their stuff anywhere around here.  If you are not in an area where you can find this tea brand at a local store (and good luck!) I suggest you just make your own at home.  I mean, come on!  It's TEA!

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

review/text: For those who like a bit more flavor than the soft breakfast blends -- this is the best of the bunch.  I have worked through most brand "bolds" and come back to this one every time.  Black Tiger is similar but does not have some of the added flavor notes found here.

review/summary: Temptations could do SO much better!
review/text: Well first off, you know how Frito-Lay totally understands what gets people hooked on snacking?<br />Temptations has figured that out for cats.<br /><br />There are probably very few cats who would turn down almost any flavor of Temptations, our cats<br />included. We used to buy them all the time, but also had one very itchy cat. They (we have two)<br />would fight each other for a treat dropped on the floor, and we used to use them to train them<br />for tricks - they'd do almost anything for these! The dairy flavor is their favorite.<br /><br />Note that you hardly ever see the ingredient list for these, so I found it and will post it here for those<br />who want to know. We have not tried this particular flavor of Temptations, but it is a given that the cats<br />would love them. Will we be trying them?  NO!<br /><br />These are supposedly to help with the coat and skin, yet they have put one of the main cat allergens<br />as one of the main ingredients! What is the deal, Temptations?!?<br />Ground corn (TOTALLY NOT NEEDED OR NATURAL IN A CAT'S DIET), rice, corn gluten meal and<br />wheat flour. What - you couldn't pack in rye too? No more room for grains?<br />Come on - make a really healthy treat for cats. You have the basics mastered.<br />Now make something decent that we won't mind feeding our cats.<br />These are too loaded with allergens to possibly be helpful to anyone's cat!!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, ground corn, animal fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), rice, dried meat by-products, wheat flour, natural flavors, corn gluten meal, soybean oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) potassium chloride, fish oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), sunflower oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), choline chloride, salt, taurine, DL-methionine, calcium carbonate, vitamins (dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), vitamin A acetate, niacin supplement, vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin supplement, thiamine mononitrate, D-calcium pantothenate, vitamin D3 supplement, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), folic acid, minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, manganese sulfate, potassium iodide), natural salmon flavor.<br />Guaranteed Analysis:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.) 28.0%, Crude Fat (min.) 19.0%, Crude Fiber (max.) 4.5%, Moisture (max.) 12.0%, Linoleic acid (min.) 2.2%, Omega 3 fatty acids* (min.) 0.15%.

review/text: Some  look for greener pastures; others look for the pot at the end of the rainbow.  I've spent  much time looking for the perfect sea salt caramel.<br /><br />  Now, this caramel has a great deal  going for it.  The package is lovely, and would make a great gift.  Also, the individual squares of caramels look very attractive in a dish -  love the pattern on the papers.<br /><br />  However, for our taste while the caramels were delicious there was  only a hint of sea salt - we're looking for a definite taste of sea salt.<br /><br />  We'd gladly recommend these caramels unless you're  looking for an obvious sea salt flavor.

review/text: I purchased these as a treat for myself, I love the Hachez chocolate. I was a little disappointed with the selection of the chocolates, there was not a lot of variety in such a large box, there were too many with the same fillings. I was expecting the usual chocolate varieties as in the Hachez rose box but these were more of the little chocolate cups with fillings and pralines. Overall still great tasting chocolate, but if the description stated more of what the fillings were I may have not purchaed this box.

review/summary: zomg no way they have this on amazon O.o
review/text: When our family lived in Japan, we were introduced to this insanely awesome sauce. My mom has craved it like a nutbag ever since we left, and we only get it about once a year. But it's on Amazon (the bottle looks different but the brand is the same at least)! This is great. I'm gonna buy a bottle for a late mother's day gift ;)<br /><br />Anyways, the sauce is sweet but a little sour/spicy and normally you're supposed to make it with okonomiyaki but you could be just a bum and put it on anything you want, and it tastes good anyhow (my sister personally likes to put it on the chicken). It's so good sometimes we take a little from the bottle by itself xD<br /><br />It's a very good sauce though, I recommend it :)

review/text: I have been getting two cases per month of CherryPharm (now Cheribundi) for the past five years.  I love how healthy it is, how great it tastes and the juice really does have a positive impact for recovery.<br /><br />When the new flavours came out I decided to try them.  The Cheribundi Cacao sounded great!  What's not to like about cherry and chocolate?!?  However, two things have made me decide to no longer get this flavour:<br />1.  The Cheribundi Cacao flavour has sugar in it!  For me, the whole point of getting these juices is to have healthy beverages to drink.<br />2.  When you pour the Cheribundi Cacao juice out these little white things that look all the world like fingernail clippings come out and float on top.  I have no idea what it is; I presume it is something natural.  However, it looks disgusting and I can't bring myself to drink it - first having to scoop them out.<br /><br />Given the above two reasons I will continue to enjoy the original and ginger Cheribundi flavours but I will no longer get the Cheribundi Cacao.

The Originals were delicious and soft as they should be, however the Apple ones were hard as a rock, they must not have been ordered very often, and have been exposed to air for too long, this could be easily remidied by sealing then in some kind of air tight bag as the stock is recieved. Regardless at this point I do not see myself ordering Apple cremes from this company again.

review/text: I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than "regular" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas.

review/text: I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)

review/text: i know there are finer beans out there at a greater cost, but at anywhere near this price you would be hard pressed to beat this coffee.  even though at this time there is only one other review, i tried out coffee bean direct based on the strength of reviews here on amazon on several of their other varieties - if you do a search, you will see that amazon carries many other beans by this company.<br /><br />before ordering, i also googled the company, i suggest you do the same to see all the different varieties they have to offer at coffee bean direct dot com (it's still cheaper to order through amazon due to no shipping cost).  i chose this particular bean because the roast is medium - we've been using a darker roast in the past because my wife typically likes her coffee beans heavily roasted.  however, we recently got a new coffee maker as an anniversary gift from my parents (the capresso coffee team gs - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EVOVPI">Capresso 464.05 CoffeeTeam GS 10-Cup Digital Coffeemaker with Conical Burr Grinder</a> - a very nice grinder/brewer combo with which we are quite pleased) that is more versatile than our cheap burr grinder and french press combo of the past.  anyway, that's a long story, the point of which is that i wanted a coffee that i could grind on the fine setting on our new coffee maker, and this one seemed like it would produce a nice brew on the finest grind - and now that we've lived with this coffee for a few days, i'm happy to report that you grind this up nice and fine and squeeze all the subtle flavors out of that way if you so choose.<br /><br />this coffee is as the way coffee bean direct describes it on their website description and accompanying roast/acidity/body chart - it is a nice bodied coffee with medium acidity and a lot of flavor (my wife and i both think it has fruit notes in it, especially as it nears room temperature).  i'm quite pleased with it, and i plan to try another of their beans as soon as we go through these five pounds we have now.

review/summary: this is it ! this is the bean!
review/text: Lets start with my qualifications (ha!) I drink about 4 to 5 cups of black coffee a day and have tried different roasts and beans over the years to nail what -I-  consider the best for me in price and flavor. I tried some expensive coffee beans that ended up in an open container in the fridge just to take away the odors instead of throwing it away, I tried *tarbucks my favorites Verona, Colombian and Sumatra and their anniversary blend. Then here comes -Coffee Beans Direct-, my "find" for quality, price and variety, and started telling my people about them . . . I tried coffee bean direct's coffee for about a year now, I used to get the six bean espresso blend for a while then I bought four 1 lb bags of different coffee beans to try to find something different for a change or to "discover" something better for my palate, and to use them in my saeco odea automatic espresso machine, in lattes and americanos. I tried (in order of my liking) city roast Papua New Guinea, dark sumatra, dark brazilian santos and still have a french roast bag that i haven't tried yet, and I would place the six bean espresso blend between the dark sumatra and the brazilian santos (maybe even tied with the sumatra), now again this is in regards to the ability to make great americanos and lattes, I drink americanos during the week and lattes on weekends. Like I said I drink my coffee black with no additives and filtered water, don't like to spoil the subtle aromas and flavors (of course unless is a latte). . . made an americano with the papua new guinea for my girlfriend which also likes good coffee, on her way to work and she called me just to ask me what kind of coffee I used because it was excellent. I also had noted that it is excellent for my americano but I noticed that i need an extra shot of espresso for my lattes to make the flavor strong enough for me; in comparison to the dark sumatra and the six bean blend. Anyhow I think this is an excellent coffee bean, I have not tried it with drip coffee but the espressos are just excellent, again, for my palate (and my girlfriends apparently) not too bitter not to acid great aroma; which is a big part of the experience, (it doesn't cause me heartburn:-). I hope it helps someone to make a decision.

review/text: We received this coffee yesterday and after 2 pots of it we are very satisfied.  It's nice and mellow and doesn't have any bitterness to it at all.  It's a big bag and will likely take us around a month to consume but after trying to find a reasonable storage option, I've decided to just fold the bag it comes in over and duct tape it closed.  I'll see how that works out.  We use the Cuisinart burr grinder on medium and brew it in a Cuisinart Brew Master 1200.  These products are all relatively new and along with this fine coffee have been an added pleasure to our mornings.

review/summary: I like it, but don't love it
review/text: My favorite coffee is Columbian, because its strong flavor stands up to milk and sugar or honey, but price is a factor (I drink a lot of it), so I bought this instead. The flavor is pleasant and mild, not as strong as I like it, but good nonetheless. I ordered this City Roast to compensate for the milder flavor, but it isn't very dark. One reviewer said the beans were dark and oily, but the ones I got are just a little darker than non-dark-roast beans, with just a smidgen more sheen on them. They don't stick together in clumps at all like a French roast. And the flavor is just a little bit "darker" than regular beans (such as Dunkin' Donuts original). I found no downsides to the flavor (no bitterness, "dustiness," or "chemical" aspects), but I just wish it was stronger. If you prefer a medium-mild flavor with just a hint of darkness, this is a good choice. (But the review that said the beans were oily suggests that the roasting might be a little inconsistent.) I liked it better than their Dark Brazilian, which also wasn't very dark, and which wasn't as pleasant overall.

review/summary: First Cup is 5 star
review/text: These beans arrived having been very freshly roasted and with excellent aroma.  I brew in a French press and that first cup was excellent indeed- being a 5-star in flavor and at perhaps 4 on the aroma.  It did posses a rather surprising bitterness in the aftertaste but nothing that took anything significant away from the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I have essentially finished the 5-pound bag now, and the enjoyment of that first cup continues at the same level as the first brew.  Unfortunately, my own style is to drink the coffee over the morning hours, and I normally do so by warming individual refills in the microwave.  After that  first excellent one, subsequent rewarmed  cups of this product, while a problem with many beans, drop off in quality faster than any other beans I have tried (of course, some start bad and stay bad). For that reason only- and admittedly my own habit that may not match yours- I drop this product to about 3 stars- it is a very steep drop in quality after that first cup.<br /><br />I have no idea how this might show itself using other brewing and serving methods.  I suspect that in any environment that does not require rewarming or perhaps held at temperature for longer periods, this is most definitely a 5-star candidate.  Its oiliness might possibly be a bit of a nuisance for some machines.<br /><br />Since I have found a few others that do hold their flavor extremely well after brewing and submit to rewarming quite well, I won't be using this one again.  If you are a re-warmer, I would try something else. However, I think that if you can avoid the heat cycling you should definitely consider giving in giving this one a try.

review/summary: PASSED PRICE COMPARISON CHECK TO JARS~  NATURALLY SO SWEET~ WE LOVE IT!
review/text: The problem we have with this applesauce is that we can't keep it.  It is gone in days and no children here...at least no little children here!! I do have to share it with my dogs as they love it too.  It is so good we usually eat more than one at a time. One is not enough for an adult, most times, I think.<br /><br /> I have done the price comparison to comparable jars of applesauce and the cheapest ones I can find in a jar is  0.07 per ounce and this one is 0.09 per ounce (at this time) so, you are not overpaying greatly for the individual servings. Price is not bad. You get 36 individual servings.<br /><br />This is a finer grind applesauce.  I really prefer it not so fine but love the flavor of this one. It has a great cinnamon taste without over doing it. The apples vary in sweetness I have noticed as they do in nature. The last order we received, the apples were super, naturally sweet, which I love.<br /><br />I have ordered this several times and never had a problem with the packaging.  All have arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />Truly a great product!

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights.

review/summary: Taste and Make of Milo
review/text: The product is China made.  Taste is not quite the same as those I had shipped before, from Australia, New Zealand, UK, Malaysia and Singapore.  Color is a shade or two off the original Nestle Milo.<br /><br />It is not widely available or rather not available in the District or the vicinity supermarket where I stay. I like the rich chocolate flavour especially in wintry seasons and I drink it with a slice of Brea California bread and strawberry jam purchased from Potomac Cosco.  Instead of adding evaporated milk, I stir in condensed milk typical style (no sugar)to get a rich flavourful taste drinking it while hot.

I remember when I was 7 years old I wanted to taste it without the liquid, so I went and ate a scoop of the powdered mix. It was even better than with water or milk because the taste wasn't watered down. I still drink this today, and I recommend it to everyone because it is filled with vitamins and it tastes great!

I was glad to see it on subscribe and save. The only drawback I might mention is that the flax seed tends to fall to the bottom so I try to get a little from the bottom each time or you end up with about a 1/8 cup of mostly flax when you get to the bottom. The flax tastes fine as it is mixed in but not so good by itself. Hey hey... Highly Recommended...Brian

review/summary: Gift To Rice Cake Eaters Everywhere!
review/text: For those of you unfamiliar with Paskesz rice cakes, the compressed nature of their rice cakes is a gift to rice cake eaters! There is minimal mess and very little crumbling when you eat these mini rice cakes. It's so much more satisfying to eat a finger sandwich made with these as opposed to trying to get your mouth around the standard sized height of a rice cake. Because of food allergies, our children can only eat plain rice cakes and no baked goods. There was another brand that made delicious crunchy mini rice cakes who then changed their recipe to include corn. It was a tremendous blow to our kids who loved eating the mini rice cakes as a snack on the go. We were elated to find these Paskesz minis.<br /><br />They can be dipped into hummus, drizzled with honey or maple syrup, used as the bread for a mini sandwich or eaten plain. We can't recommend them enough and dread seeing that they are out of stock with amazon, as we can't purchase them anywhere else.

review/text: I gave this product only four stars because I wish it was a better value.  I admit when you purchase it as an add-on, it lowers the price, but would give five stars if it could be purchased in a larger bulk amount.  Otherwise, the flavor and nutrition are excellent.

review/summary: Awesome, but pricey
review/text: I have been eyeballing this stuff online for a while. Peanut butter that is not only low-cal and low-fat, but also organic - a dream come true! But, really, I couldn't justify spending $15 for a little jar. I was happily surprised to see this at a local grocery store chain called Reasor's. It was $7.29 for the little jar and I bought it.  If I see it on sale, I will buy all the jars.<br /><br />It tastes good like a very natural-tasting Jif. I like it stiffer so I use less water than the directions call for. Also, because of the lower fat content, it washes very easily. No more gross peanut butter knives in the sink!

review/summary: Tastes great with low calories
review/text: The taste is great and only 45 calories. You can make it as thick or thin as you may want it to be.<br />I would recommend buying somewhere else; price here is probably 60% to 100% more expensive than in a supermarket

review/summary: Organic, tasty, and customizable
review/text: This product is great. Its got a few different ingredients than PB2 which are going to appeal to a big chunk of people in the health food community.<br /><br />PB2 is made with peanuts, sugar, and salt. This is made with organic peanuts, organic coconut sugar (which is supposed to have a lower glycemic index and for the record does not taste like coconut in the slightest), and sea-salt. I'm not certain how much the glycemic index of the sugar matters when it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving (PB2 has 1 gram), but then again I'm not diabetic and I thought it might be a useful thing to point out.<br /><br />Overall unless you are a strong subscriber to the "Organic over Conventional" debate I'm not sure this product is more nutritious than PB2. It has an extra gram of sugar and a gram less of protein and fiber per serving. Of course this is a huge improvement over normal organic peanut butter let alone peanut butter from any of the major brands. So if the two products are more or less the same nutrition wise purchasing would come down to flavor and price.<br /><br />This product is a bit more expensive than PB2. Thats probably due to the organic factor and scale. Organic ingredients cost more to produce and more to buy, but also PB2 has a jump start on branding and is in more stores (or at least it seems to be) so its distribution network may run more efficiently, it may be able to produce larger batches at lower costs, and overall its going to be a bit cheaper. So don't write this product off now and forever because of the price. If you try it and like it support it and the price may come down.<br /><br />Finally flavor and texture. This product tastes like peanut butter there's no getting around that. Its rich and almost creamy when you mix it up. It can add a peanut butter flavor to protein shakes, yogurt, muffins, cookies, etc. In short its fully customizable and how you use it is up to you and your preferences. I've read that a lot of people have to "learn to like" PB2. I didn't have that experience, but if you did or are having trouble learning to like it give this one a try. I'm not sure what it is exactly maybe the coconut sugar (which again doesn't taste like coconut), but it does taste a little different than PB2. I don't have much of a preference either way and friends that have tried both seem more or less split in their opinions (when they have one).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />It tastes great<br />It can be used in many ways and mixed to any consistency<br />It uses organic ingredients and coconut sugar (unlike PB2)<br />But its nutritional stats aren't quite as good (1 more gram sugar, 1 less gram fiber and protein)<br />Its a bit more expensive than PB2<br /><br />I love it, but you'll have to decide how you weight organic ingredients vs nutrition stats vs price, in any case if you want to replace your normal PB but don't like PB2 its worth a try

review/summary: PB&J a whole new way!
review/text: I had been using PB2, but saw this at the store and scooped up a jar.  Came home, toasted up some Coconut Paleo Bread, mixed a tbsp. of this PB powder with 1 tbsp of no-sugar apple butter, and made myself a PB&J that was phenomenal!  Also, it kept me sated and happy for hours!  This is a nice low-carb, gluten-free, low-calorie alternative to a traditional favorite.  It is also great spread on apples and other fruits.  If I could have one wish, it would be for the company to make a salt and sugar free option, as my all time favorite PB is the kind you get straight from the grinder at the health food store!

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: Much healthier (less fat, sugars etc) than any other powdered peanut butter i've used. This jar is quite small, but I only use it in my daily protein shakes to add flavor. Perfect for putting in blender bottles, when you don't want to use a blender. Will buy again.

review/summary: Wonderful in yogurt!
review/text: I have not yet tried to mix this with water and spread it like regular PB, but it's terrific in plain Greek yogurt, with some Truvia or Splenda added.  It seems to make the yogurt more filling and rib-sticking too; I'm not sure if that's because it has protein in it, but anyway, it's a nice bonus.  Even though the Just Great says it has sugar in it, it doesn't really taste too sweet by itself.  I will definitely buy again.  Have not compared it against PB2 because PB2 is harder to find in my area.

review/summary: No, not 3 leaf balsamic. Do not buy.
review/text: This bottle just arrived today.  I unwrapped the top, took a taste, and I can tell you that this is sad, sorry stuff.  It is as thin as water, acetic in not a good way, and completely lacking in the flavor complexities one wants in a good bottle of balsamic.  This is watery dark-colored vinegar.  This is NOT 3 leaf balsamic which I hoped I could use as a drizzle or use for a reduction.  Is there a board I can appeal to? 'cause this stuff is improperly marketed, as I can get the same vinegar for 1/10 the price at a grocery store.<br />Let my folly be a lesson to all of you:  spend the money on a good balsamic and do not economize.  DO NOT buy this sad stuff.

review/summary: For a decaf coffee, this is good
review/text: I got this coffee at a discount shelf, as doctors just put me on a no caffein diet, last year. I like the taste which is much better than most decaffs I've tried. The fact that it is Organic and Antioxidant is a bonus. It is the only thing I drink in the morning now. I even take it on vacation with me. greg

review/text: This is the closest we have been able to find to true stone ground hand-mixed cornbread.  It tastes like real southern cornbread is supposed to taste.  We buy it by the case.
