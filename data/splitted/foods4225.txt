review/summary: The best tea anywhere!
review/text: I purchased Ahmad tea for the first time on a recent trip to England, and our whole family enjoys it immensely.  Ahmad is about the best tea we've ever tasted.  This green tea is excellent and turned some family members from "no thanks" to "where's my tea?" every night!  Even the boxes are a work of art.<br /><br />If you like tea, don't be put off by the seemingly "large" size of the package.  We're already halfway through our second case and showing no signs of slowing down.<br /><br />An excellent tea at a great price.

review/summary: Forgotten taste of real green tea from Sri Lanka
review/text: If you are like me, and was missing the taste of real tea in America, then this tea is for you! This tea is packed in Sri Lanka, which is apparent from the wonderfully strong taste and aroma that these tea-bags produce! When you drink this tea, you taste green tea, not water.<br /><br />The tea-bags are wrapped in some kind of plastic foil, so they are hermetically sealed to preserve freshness.<br /><br />The boxes have instructions in English and most other European languages, including Russian. Tea-bags have brewing instructions in English.

review/text: A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste, subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.

review/summary: Bottle Caps aren't just for Bottles!!
review/text: Bottle Caps really take me back. Back to a kid in the 70's. Back to when candy bars were bigger, and only cost 9c at the local candy shop. When we had 4 different stores where we could go and gaze at all the variety of candy to spend our meager allowance on. If you are looking for nostalgia, try bottle caps. They really take you back to when there WERE bottle caps on the actual bottles!

review/summary: A Blast from the Past
review/text: When I saw these available I was delighted, having not seen them in what seems like forever; memories of the General Store (or Kate's Market as it was actually named) came flooding back to me.  These were a favorite of mine growing up and I had all but forgotten about them until I stumbled on them recently.  To my delight they taste just as I remember them and I was very happy to get them here.  I can now keep a healthy supply on hand which goes over well when my oldest friends come visiting.  I would offer this caveat though, the bottle caps here are not the same ones found in the movie theater box of bottle caps.  The boxed ones are smaller and have a different flavor than the rolls of bottle caps.  The rolled caps are the ones I enjoy the best.

review/summary: Quite simply my favorite candy
review/text: I grew up in the mid-70's and 80's eating Bottle Caps, Sweet Tarts, and "Un-Cola" (which was basically the same as Bottle Caps, except they had no Root beer or Cola flavors).  Bottle Caps were always my favorite candy, along with Zots and Pop Rocks.  Prior to finding them online, I would occasionally find a store that carried them while traveling and I would buy everything they had.  Now that I can simply purchase them online, I can get my "fix" anytime I want, which is great.  While the wrapper has changed a bit over the years, the candy is exactly the same and they're still just as delicious as they ever were back in the day.  I've introduced them to my kids and they love them as well, though I'm trying to impart a little moderation so that they don't spoil their dinner...

review/text: One of my favorite types of candy and when ordering in bulk it saves me almost around $20. If you are like me and buy a little candy each time you go to the store then it makes a lot more sense to go ahead and order these two cases.<br /><br />What's better then a candy store right up the street? Having a candy store in your closet.<br /><br />Not much else to say except if you like bottle caps and buy them even on a semi regular basis then this is a great deal.

review/text: Nesquik dissolves into cold milk completely. And it tastes great. The old "Nestle Quik" that I grew up with was slightly gritty (but a nice chocolaty kind of gritty). This Nesquik makes a tasty, smooth, creamy glass of chocolate milk. It also tastes great sprinkled on ice cream. It has no corn syrup like Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. It also has less sugar than Hershey's. In addition, it is fortified with calcium and vitamin C, among other things. If you grew up with Quik, you'll probably love Nesquik.

review/summary: Never really liked this...
review/text: I myself was never fond of the taste of this chocolate powder and I've been drinking it since I was a child 25+ years.  To me, when Quik was available was like "ehh" and sometimes not even.  When I lived in Puerto Rico, the best chocolate powder was Kresto.  Hands down, nobody can make chocolate powder like that.<br /><br />The next best would be Ovaltine, which resembles Kresto almost exactly.  Now the Nesquik people want to make efforts for new customers by making it 25% less sugar; and I say, does it matter to most kids?  It tastes horrible still!  For some reason it tastes somewhat like they added a pinch of coconut flavoring to it.  Absolutely horrible.

Amazon doesn't show the nutritional information for this bar, so for those who are concerned, I will point out that the ingredients include both corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oil.<br /><br />For those who like these chocolate bars but are looking for a change of pace, I'd also like to recommend the delicious <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVLU9A">Health Valley Tart, Chocolate, Multigrain, 6-Count 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Almost too good
review/text: These may be the best diet snack bars I have ever tasted.  I feel like I could serve them to company: Remove the wrappers, cut them in half so they look like bar cookies, and serve on a pretty platter.  They are salty and chocolaty.  The only down side is that it is hard to eat just one.  Unlike the meal replacement bars, which are quite chewy so they take longer to eat, these are light and, well, just leave you wanting more.  I am not sure that is a good thing when you are trying to restrict calories.  But I gave them five stars anyway.  They taste very good, they have at least a little fiber in them and a few vitamins.<br /><br />I have been trying to lose weight for a long time.  The Special K line of low calorie drinks, bars and crackers have become a way to simplify eating for me.  Each night before I go to bed I put out on a tray what I plan to eat the next day up until dinner-which is a real cooked, healthy meal full of vegetables with some protein and carbs on the side, fruit for dessert.  My tray currently includes 600 calories made up of Special K meal replacement drinks, bars and protein water, supplemented with green tea and coffee.  It is working for me.  I have lost eight pounds in 2 months.  This is a sustainable plan.<br /><br />In the long run I am concerned about all the artificial ingredients in these processed foods.  But I have read the literature, and it seems that lowering weight has so many health benefits that it is worth it for the short term.  Keeping it off will be the test.

I knew when I purchased these that they are meant as a treat or snack, NOT as a meal replacement.  They are part of Special K's weight loss line, and are often mistaken for meal replacement bars<br /><br />These are VERY, VERY good.  I sometimes crave something salty and sweet.  These take care of the cravings and have 90 calories and 2 grams of fat!<br /><br />The bottom is coated with delicious milk chocolate.  The top has crunch, yet is soft.  The combination of the crispiness, the chocolate, the pretzels is incredible.  For an actual meal replacement bar, I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOH6G">Atkins Advantage Bars, Chocolate Chip Granola, 5/1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2 )</a>.  For a snack, or a treat, you cannot do any better than the Special K Chocolately Pretzel Bar.

review/text: These chips are somewhat expensive, but there really is no substitute for green mint chips, and they are darn near impossible to find in grocery stores.  They make all of your minty baked goods so much tastier, and you don't have to worry about coloring white chocolate with food coloring if you are making holiday treats (Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  I find myself using half a bag to make something and munching on the rest of the bag throughout the next week or so.  They are also great as an ice cream topping!<br /><br />It is kind of a bummer that you have to buy six bags at once, but they are so good, you won't have any trouble finding ways to use them!  They are a must-have for any mint-chocolaphile.

review/summary: RAW "natural" almonds - no roasting, added fat, or salt!
review/text: These almonds are "packaged by Spicy World, sold by Simply Beautiful, fulfilled by Amazon, shipped by Deeva Fullfillment Services, Inc" - so its hard to know WHO takes the credit for the quality. They dont state the origin, but these almonds are definately smaller and less tasty than the "California almonds" I purchased previously - but I KNEW they were probably foreign because they are packed by Spicy World, and because the price was less than 6 dollars a pound, including postage. So there u go. I got what I paid for - cheap almonds of uncertain origin.

review/summary: Best deal in town + FREE SPAM!
review/text: (update after ~4 months: they will spam your inbox if you buy without an unsubscribe link since it comes via amazon as if it is a seller communication)<br /><br />I ordered hesitantly, and boy I am glad I overcame my hesitation!!! I was hesitant because there are a couple of reviews that questioned the quality and taste. Absolute baloney!<br /><br />These are as good as any almonds I have encountered, if not better. They are just the right level of crispness, and there is not even a hint of anything wrong. In fact, they are a bit more "fragrant" which is the only way I can describe that slight aroma when you chew upon an almond. That and probably because they seem to be grown in a different climate they taste slightly different in a good way.<br /><br />I have an Amazon Prime membership, and either because of that or may be they ship to everybody that way, I got the product by FedEx on the second day!<br /><br />In short, a perfect product at an amazing price. Don't hesitate to order!<br /><br />Disclosure: I am NOT affiliated with the seller or grower or distributor in any way. I never heard of them until I ordered this item.

review/text: These almonds came in a large plastic bag with a twist tie at the top. They were not sealed in any way, which isn't necessarily bad just seemed a little odd to me. Some reviewers complained about the taste, i didn't have an issue with that. They cost about the same as the Emerald brand from Walmart and I don't have to wait for delivery. I was expecting them to either have a better taste than what I could get from a big box store or be cheaper. If you have a Costco or BJ's membership you can get them for even cheaper than this so the product itself is fine, no complaints, there are just cheaper and easier options available out there. Nothing special here.

review/summary: Great tasting, wholesome food
review/text: Almonds are extremely nutritious, and particularly so in a raw, natural state as in the case of this product. They are loaded with protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals (especially magnesium, potassium and selenium), and they have a very healthy, monounsaturated fat.<br /><br />Since purchasing this many nuts in bulk means I can't eat them very fast, I keep part of them in the refrigerator and the rest in the freezer to maintain freshness since there are no chemical preservatives or salt on these nuts.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat them is combined with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAQ6A8">Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY">dried cherries</a>. It's a delicious and quite nutritious snack.<br /><br />These almonds also taste very good combined with pretzels.

review/text: Have ordered unsalted almonds by the pound one time previously, and these were not flavorful like the others. The ones ordered previusly were sweeter, had more nutty flavor, and were slightly more chewy (not as dry).  I would think that these are tasteless/flavorless because they have been sitting on a shelf for a long time (like tea leaves loose their flavor over time), but not sure because I don't have any fresh ones with which to compare them.

review/text: These berries aren't dried, nor are they advertised as being so. Rather, they have a candy-like texture and flavor. They are somewhat sticky and gummy, and have a very very intense, sweet blueberry flavor. They do not contain high fructose corn syrup, only corn syrup - don't be mislead by other reviewers. Also, they contain no sucralose (Splenda), only sucrose - otherwise known as sugar. They are wonderful for cooking and baking in muffins and pancakes, and serve as a more healthy snack than conventional candy when you're looking for a sweet-tooth fix. These rate very high in our household; they're delicious and embody everything BLUEBERRY.

review/summary: Too fake-sweet with poor ingredients
review/text: I was disappointed with the taste of these, having had dried blueberries before. They were too sweet, and a sickly unnatural sweet unlike the blueberries I had previously.<br /><br />When I looked at the ingredients, it was clear why.<br /><br />Wild blueberries (good)<br />Corn syrup  (there's the cause! ugh)<br />Sugar (maybe okay if corn syrup was gone, but you don't need much sugar with dried fruit)<br />Natural flavor (uhhh... natural? added?)<br />Citric acid<br />Sunflower oil<br />Potassium sorbate<br /><br />I am not too big on the ingredients but could forgive them if the flavor was right, but as is, horrible.  I am donating the rest to a food bank and hoping someone who likes refined-hypersweet tastes gets some enjoyment out of them.  I am going to a different supplier for my dried fruit needs. I had enjoyed the cherries in the past, but after this I'm afraid to try anything else from this company.

review/summary: Unhealthy Ingredients
review/text: Because of the unhealthy ingredients in this product I would have rated this a ZERO, but that wasn't an option.<br /><br />I bought this product thinking it would be of the same caliber as Mariani cherries, which contains "dried cherries and sugar."  I'm not a fan of white sugar, nor do I buy or use it in my home, but at least it's the only other ingredient.<br /><br />After I received my delivery I read the ingredients for this product- "Mariani Wild Blueberries, 3-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)", which I neglected to do so before my purchase, but I have done with almost every food item have purchased over the past 25+ years, and I found the following quite disturbing!<br /><br />In addition to the blueberries there are the following ingredients:  1)"Sugar" (who knows what kind. I can only assume it's refinded white sugar, but it's not as bad as the following 3), 2) "High Fructose Corn Syrup" (Nasty stuff this is!), 3) "Corn Syrup" (More nasty stuff and also useless), and 4) "Sucrose" (also known as "Splenda" with the Blueberries, and linked to health problems more than the previous 3 ingredients).<br /><br />ALL 4 of these are unhealthy and should be baned from all foods!<br /><br />I was looking for something natural and healthy. There's 'nothing' natural and healthy about white "Sugar", "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and especially "Sucrose" (better know as "Splenda")<br /><br />There is quite a bit of information available that proves these 4 ingredients are unhealthy.  Search each one, or search "artificial sweeteners", and you will be surprised at the negative effects these have on the health and well being of both humans and animals, despite what the manufacturers claim.<br /><br />Had I read the Amazon product description of the ingredients I would NEVER have bought this product!<br /><br />I will NEVER by this product again, nor will I ever buy "Mariani Berries 'N Cherries, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12) again!  They contain the same 4 NASTY ingredients as the "Wild Blueberries" product does!  And they taste awful!  NOTHING like real unadulterated dried fruit.<br /><br />Mariani:  You should have left nature alone, not tampered with the taste of fresh fruit, and only added some sunflower oil or Vitamin E.<br /><br />P.S.  I wonder if "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and "Sucrose" are Kosher?

review/summary: Pretty good as a stopgap meal
review/text: Chili aficionados will almost certainly turn up their noses at this chili, but it's still a pretty good meal. At the $1.50 per can that I spent, it's also a very economical meal. I bought it more or less in desperation as my monthly expenses left me on pretty thin ice for a week or do.<br /><br />In the past, I had pretty much dismissed Hormel in favor of Campbell's line of chili. My memory of Hormel's offering was that they were a bit on he greasy side and tasted cheap. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It seemed to compare very favorably with what Campbell was offering, was not greasy, and tasted fairly good for canned chili. It had real, identifiable pieces of meat and was also mildly spiced--giving me a chance to add a hot sauce of my own preference. And it is substantially lower in price than what I recall for he Campbell's chilis.<br /><br />As I suggested at the beginning, if you want a gourmet meal, this is not it. If you want an inexpensive stopgap that will help you stretch your budget, then this works very well.

review/text: I have an allergy to onions so I can't eat most canned chili. There is onion powder in this but not actual onions. I find the turkey variety to be very flavorful and appealing. It's not overly greasy like the beef variety tends to be. It is high in sodium if that is a concern for you. It's great for a quick high protein meal. On days that I know I'm going to roller derby practice or the gym, I'll have a can a couple hours before I go and don't get that weak/shaking feeling while I'm working out. Word of warning however; the cans are shipped individually. 3 of the 6 cans were dented upon arrival. Since I don't care about the aesthetics of a can, it's no problem as far as I'm concerned but others might find that disconcerting.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Hormel's classic beef chili but let's face it, without a good fire to melt the 3/4" of fat/flavor, it's a pretty lousy meal straight from the can!  It's one of the best there is for canned chili but it has its small flaws.  This turkey variety doesn't have the fat.  It's just as good straight from the can as it is in a bowl.  Stick a few cans of this in your pantry for emergencies and you'll always have a pretty decent, healthy meal when the power goes out.  For you hardcore survivalists and hikers/campers, strip the label off and just drop the bare unopened can into your pot as you boil your water.  Serves well over rice and well drained pasta, too!  For a pleasing change, try it over spaghetti or penne!

review/summary: Wissotzky Mahogany 9 Flavors Tea Chest
review/text: Others have reviewed the teas themselves, and since this is a gift, I won't be trying them - so this review is based only on the gift presentation.  If I also get good reviews for the tea itself from the recipients, I'll post an update.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed; I think the term "tea chest" made me picture something more luxurious than this product turned out to be.  It's not bad-looking, but I think this is a case of getting exactly what I paid for - this tea chest and its contents look and feel like a $25 gift.  It's a shame, because I think that this could be exactly what I was expecting if more attention had been paid to finishing.  As it is, though, I think I will probably be looking elsewhere if I ever decide to buy another tea chest.  I'm giving it three stars - I don't feel ripped off, but I don't feel like I've gotten away with anything, either.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />The chest dimensions are 11 3/4" L X 9 3/8" W X 2 3/8' H.  The chest comes shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, with a nutrition label stuck to the underside of the chest itself.  I didn't try peeling off the label because I was afraid of pulling up some of the finish or making the wood splinter.  It's a very lightweight, soft wood - the sides are about 1/4" thick and the top is around 1/16" thick.  The chest is a red mahogany color on the outside only.  The hardware (hinges and a hasp-type closure) are silver-toned and also of a lightweight material.<br /><br />The box itself, I don't find very attractive.  I like the color of the stain, and the construction seems sturdy enough (hardware is attached with screws, joins are straight and secure, although I can't tell if there's anything besides glue involved), but the finishing isn't very craftsmanlike:<br /><br />- The surface has dark-colored particles stuck to it, which makes me think they stained this without wiping it down after sanding.<br />- There's some slight drips of stain visible on the sides of the box.<br />- The finish is not very lustrous.<br />- There are splinters around the indentations for the box's hinges - although on the plus side, they did at least make indentations for the hinges.<br />- The hasp is slightly misaligned, so when you flip the hinged part on the lid down, it doesn't slide easily over the catch on the bottom half and you have to force it a little to get it closed.<br />- I have all sorts of issues with the lid: it has light scratching on it that looks like it got a few swipes of a medium-grade sandpaper and that's it; it's for some reason really dusty-looking and I can't seem to get it clean by just wiping it; and it's stenciled with the Wissotzky Tea logo in a slightly metallic gray paint.<br />- That logo - I don't know why, but the logo design, and the design of the tea bag wrappers, does not give the impression of luxury or indulgence.<br /><br />Ironically, the sides and bottom of the box are a little nicer-looking than the lid; they're slightly more lustrous, not as covered with sanding grit, and you can see some wood grain.<br /><br />There's an insert to divide the box into nine slots for tea bags; it's a very lightweight wood, glued together but not attached to the box interior.  The sanding on the insert also seems incomplete (or not done at all).  The interior of the box is unlined, unstained wood.<br /><br />A big plus is that when you open the box, it smells *delicious*.<br /><br />To be honest, if I knew what the box would be like before I had ordered this, I would have kept looking.  Now that I've got it, though, I'll go ahead and give it to its intended recipients - the helpful and friendly staff of an office I frequent, whom I wanted to remember for the holidays even though my budget's limited.  But if I had gotten this for someone as a more personal gesture, or if it had been for someone I was trying to impress (i.e. boss, client, mother-in-law-to-be, etc), I'd probably be putting this aside and looking elsewhere for an alternative.<br /><br />1/30/2011 - The girls at the office all love the tea!  But I still wouldn't necessarily recommend this chest as a gift - you can buy Wissotzky tea for around $3 a box right here on Amazon.  I'd probably buy the tea and then see what I could do about finding a nice-looking presentation box separately.

review/summary: ridiculously tasty
review/text: One night I desperately needed a chocolate sundae.  I had no syrup, no ice cream, too lazy to go out and acquire the ingredients.  No sundae that night.  I saw this on Amazon the same night, and purchased a case on impulse. I probably shouldn't be allowed to buy food products at night when I'm having a craving. Why I would need six bottles is beyond me, but I purchased it anyway.  It is great syrup.  Intense chocolate flavor, rich, not chemical tasting like some other syrups I have had. It's a good thing I rarely have ice cream, or I would be gaining a lot of weight.  I appreciate that it has no corn syrup.<br /><br />So, I gave away four of the bottles to friends who love it!  Now I just have to go through two bottles on my own.  I've had more difficult tasks in my life, I'm sure I will rise to the occasion!  Maybe I will start making hot chocolae now that it is cold outside.

review/summary: So Long Overpriced Coffee Drinks!
review/text: I love those Starbucks and McDonalds iced mochas, but they are so expensive!  I decided to give this a try and the rich, delicious mochas you can make at home with this syrup are, in my opinion, better than the ones you can buy out.<br /><br />Get some strong coffee, milk, whipped cream, and a couple of tablespoons of this syrup and you'll be good to go!  Delicious hot or iced.  You'll save a ton of money over buying those fancy drinks at Starbucks or wherever.<br /><br />Someone commented in another review that it sticks to the sides of the bottle.  It does - it's very thick.  When the bottle is nearly empty, I just pour a little hot coffee or milk in the bottle and shake it up good, and you can then claim those last few remnants of fabulousness.  I'm way too tight with a buck to waste any!

review/text: I liked the DD iced latte with mocha favor.  I saw them making it just by adding chocolate syrup to iced latte.  Although it is not the "real" cafe mocha, it was good enough for me.  So I tried to do it myself at work.  I tried both Hershey and Torani.  Torani has a stronger chocolate favor.  It still was not like the one by DD so I think I am still missing something.  Perhaps it is the coffee itself that has to match.  But the one made by Torani Mocha Sauce was good enough.

We highly recommend this syrup for your cafe mochas. I'm so glad I didn't notice it was a pack of 6. The first would have been gone way to fast!

They were okay, but not what I was looking for, or they were too complicated and still didn't give me that nice rich chocolate flavor with a nice chocolate color. Finally Torani saved the day and now I can take a standard 1 quart recipe and use 2/3 cup of the Torani Mocha Sauce and without all of the hassel I have the best homemade chocolate Ice Cream I have ever made.

I got this because it is made with sugar syrup, not corn syrup, but to be honest I really can't tell the difference when comparing the two. I would like to find something that has a more intense dark chocolate flavor, and perhaps is not as sweet as this. Maybe I should try making my own.

review/text: With the purchase of a new single-serve coffee brewer, I was looking to enhance the java experience by finding a proper chocolate addition.  My research led to me to sauces rather than syrups and I opted to try a product by Torani, an already trusted name in coffee products.  Sadly, I haven't found Torani's Original Mocha Sauce to be all that bold or flavorful.  In fact, though I'll continue to use the bottles I've purchased, I won't be buying this same product again.

review/text: I paid a premium for this syrup, and don't feel it's appreciably better than even Hershey's syrup for mocha drinks at home.  Don't get me wrong, most of what I consume would be considered "gourmet", but I was simply disappointed by this product.  I don't get a richness of flavor depth (similar to Hershey), I don't get a natural cocoa flavor...I simply get a raw sweetness from this "sauce".<br /><br />To summarize:  it's fine, very drinkable, and does the intended purpose.  I personally don't feel it's a gourmet product at all, however.  I see from reviews I am nearly alone in that sentiment!

review/summary: Overpoweringly sweet
review/text: I have to admit that I'm disappointed with this after reading the other reviews.  I purchased a six pack and began using it to make my replication of the Starbucks peppermint mocha (non-fat, no whip) that I take to work most days of the week.  I use a Bialetti stovetop pot and the Starbucks espresso roast, plus the Starbucks peppermint syrup.<br /><br />My old recipe, a perfect match, was 2 tablespoons of Starbucks natural mocha powder mixed with 2 tablespoons of Starbucks peppermint syrup, 2 tablespoons of hot water, and 1 tablespoon of Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Add 2/3 cup of espresso and 16 ounces of steamed, nonfat milk to make a "venti" sized (20 ounce).<br /><br />I thought that this sauce would simplify things by replacing both the Hershey's syrup and the mocha powder and hot water, but using 3 tablespoons of it left a somewhat chocolate-flavored, but overly sweet result with an almost metallic aftertaste.  I'll force my way through the rest so as not to waste it, but will use smaller servings and mix it with the Hershey's syrup.<br /><br />I will in the future purchase the Starbucks mocha powder and return to my original recipe.

review/summary: Torani Mocha Syrup
review/text: This product was not as I expected.  There was no decernable coffee flavor.  I probably was too vague in my search.  I have been  drinking Nescafe Iced Java Mocha for quite a while.  It is now longer available.  I went wearching for a replacement.  This was very thick and not to be used cold.  It only made chocolate milk.  I have Hershey's for that.  All in all, it was a waste of my money because, even though I could have returned it, it would have cost more that I would have gotten back.

review/summary: Bad packaging
review/text: The chili itself is delicious but unfortunately one of the cans had split open and had to be thrown away; which makes for a very expensive chili.  The "accident" didn't happen during shipping because the Amazon package was intact. It seems it happened during the manufacturer's packing.

review/summary: Great taste and good texture-some dents-so what
review/text: I've had chunky canned products where the chunks were formed ground beef.  Not the case with this product.  The beef has real texture and is a little dry (the product is 1/3 fat calories).  The chili sauce is tasty, without ground meat, and it also has a few small chunks of tomato.<br /><br />2/19/12 update - 3 months later<br />Still love the product, but with more experience, less than half of the chunks on average seem to be naturally occurring chunks.  However, the composite meat chunks have the best mouth feel of any I've tasted in any product.<br /><br />Others have commented on damaged cans.  I have received wrapped six-packs where the can dents could not have been caused in the six-pack configuration shipped, and EVERY can had a dent with no can-to-can alignment.  NONE of my cans were UNSAFE to eat in my opinion.  If it saves me some money to buy dented cans, then that's fine with me -- but it would be honorable to be told that's what you're buying.  Perhaps I missed some print?

review/summary: ABOVE-AVERAGE CANNED CHILI
review/text: HORMEL CHILI no beans is always in our pantry. This version is a bit sweeter, and maybe a bit hotter, than the regular style. But it is not FIVE ALARM hot by any means. My overall impression is positive, and if you just want a quick chili, maybe with canned HORMEL tamales, it sure is OK. I also like the HORMEL regular style product. I appreciate Amazon having this available because we cannot find it in our town.

review/summary: not the best, certainly not the worst
review/text: this is as close an item as i can find to the can in front of me....3.75 oz, soy oil, product of Poland; not Scotland.<br /><br />Lightly smoked and salted.  Good<br />Oil, too much...not so good<br />Fish, not bad; though some look like they got caught in a wringer.<br />Bones?  they're part of sardines...i just eat them.<br /><br />Overall...a decent 3...it wouldn't take much to bring these up to a 4<br />says 8-18 fish per can because sizes are quite variable...i didn't<br />count them, but at 3.75 oz i'm not expecting a bucketfull...
