review/summary: Great Coffee Substitute
review/text: Coffee was killing my stomach so I went in search of a healthy organic alternative to my morning ritual and discovered this little treasure.  The jasmine is strong and the green tea is superb.  And, with less caffeine in my life, I am a much nicer person (chuckle).

review/text: Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!

review/text: This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try.

To those who do not regularly use loose tea, the tea bag (Teebeutel, sachet) definitely does not taste as crisp and refreshing as the comparable tea when brewed as loose tea.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

I love this tea, but their suggestion of one teaspoon is a bit conservative for black tea you usually do one tablespoon per cup not a teaspoon, its up to preference but i love this tea and the fact that it reminds me of camping is a plus! it makes me feel good, and it tastes great too!

review/text: I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning.

review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste
review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.
review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

review/text: Seems like high quality authentic manuka honey.  It was a little runnier than another brand I purchased, but tastes very good.  I used it when I had a bronchial infection but didn't do anything.  I'm sure it is good for your stomach as well, but taking it at night increased my heartburn.  Where it really worked for me was on cuts and skin infection.  I used it several times and it works wonders when applied topically.  I am keeping it and not eating it so that I can use it for future cuts or infections, its too expensive to consume on a regular basis, but I'm sure it would provide various health benefits.  I'll stick to good quality unpasturized honey or royal jelly for daily consumption.  It is worth purchasing and keeping around the house.

review/summary: manuka honey the wonder food
review/text: I first heard of Manuka honey from a post on face book. A friend said that it saved her leg. I have been having issues with my eyelids getting infected, red and swollen. I was sent to an optomologist and he prescribed some pretty expensive eye drop. After 2 months, and $320, I found out about manuka honey. I did a lot of research on line about my issue and about manuka honey and decided to give it a try. To my surprise my eyelids started to clear up and are no longer red and swollen. All I did was rub some around my eyelids everyday and they started to get better. I would recommend Manuka honey to anyone who has an infection of the eyelids to try this out. From the research I did it is also good for other types of infections and good for your digestive system too. Bottom line, although I thought the price was a little high it was well worth it, remember I spent $320 dollars in 2 months for regular medicine.

review/text: Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before<br />they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite.  I was<br />able to find the recipe for the corn cakes in a cookbook I purchased, but I could never find the recipe for<br />the Cancun.  I made several attempts to prepare our favorite dish, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't<br />come close.  I finally just gave up, and then, a few weeks ago, I found the recipe on the internet.<br />I was so excited, and made my grocery list for the ingredients that were needed.  Well, I found everything<br />I needed, but you guessed it, the lobster base.<br /><br />I went back on-line and did a search on lobster base. After checking out all the companies that popped-up,<br />I decided on Amazon.com.  I found the amount and cost range I was looking for.  I placed my order and within<br />a few days I received it.<br /><br />I surprised my husband one night for dinner with our long-awaited favorite dish and when we took our first<br />bites, we looked at each other and smiled.  That was it, the taste I thought was lost forever, had been found.<br /><br />Thank you for giving me my missing ingredient......Better than Bouillon Lobster Base!!  Now I'm searching for<br />more recipes that I can use it in.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />P. Bush

review/summary: Wonderful for seafood recipes
review/text: I'm really rather surprised to see the mixed reviews on here, although I wonder if some of the less favorable reviews have more to do with the recipes in which the base was used. Keep in mind, this is basically a replacement for bouillon cubes, but with a lobster flavor instead of beef or chicken. It packs an intense flavor and, yes, does have a lot of sodium (but not as much as a dried bouillon cube). For most recipes, this means easing up on any additional salt.<br /><br />That said, I've used this not only for lobster bisque but also for a broth for seafood risotto and a paella and it makes for a wonderful dish that can't be beat except by your own lobster stock (and this is a lot cheaper). If you'd like a particularly good recipe for which you can use this stuff, check out the Seafood Risotto recipe at the Rustic Kitchen website. That's a restaurant in Boston that hosts a cooking show with a local celebrity chef -- the recipe is delicious. Bon appetit!

review/summary: One of the Best cooking secrets I have found
review/text: I have been using this flavor (Lobster base) for several years and continue to get raving compliments of the dishes I prepare using it. Specifically:  in the simplest context, just include an ample amount in the water when you are boiling fresh shrimp (it works best when shrimp is shelled and deveined first to allow the most surface area to absorb the flavors)<br />  Slightly more complex: I use it to flavor my Salmon Croquette recipe. It is a fairly standard recipe -- although I use only fresh salmon filets (precooked)never canned salmon.  Include this product in your mixture for fabulous flavor! (one note -- this product is already pretty salty, so wait until you have added this stock , then taste your mixture before adding any more salt)<br /><br /> Bon Apetit<br />William Edwards

review/text: Of the Better Than Bouillon lineup, I've used chicken, mushroom, beef, vegetable, ham and lobster; they are all very good (much better than any other bouillon I've tried), but lobster stands out as both unusual and good: complex, balanced, not fishy.<br /><br />Here's what I've been using it for recently: I separate a big bunch of<br />CHARD into leaves and stems, slice the<br />CHARD STEMS fairly small and saut&eacute; them for a few minutes in<br />WALNUT OIL; add a teaspoon of<br />LOBSTER BOUILLON, some<br />CASHEW PIECES and some<br />RAISINS; while this cooks, slice up the<br />CHARD LEAVES; add the leaves, cover, and cook for a few more minutes (mix it a couple of times to get the flavored oil distributed evenly).<br /><br />The number of raisins has a big effect on sweetness; I've tried it at various points between almost none and enough that there's a raisin or two in every mouthful, and I'd say that somewhere in the middle is optimal (a lot of raisins is good too, but shadows the lobster).<br /><br />I echo the comments of other reviewers: if you use BTB, omit the rest of the salt from the recipe until you're sure it needs it.  They make a "reduced sodium" version of some flavors, but it's only 25% less; I couldn't tell that it was less salty.

review/summary: Wow - can't wait to try the recipe on the label
review/text: Well, I have to admit that I love the Bases for cooking.<br />They do have forms of MSG in them, so those who are allergic need to be aware.<br />They can say no ADDED MSG, because they add it in a different form than pure MSG<br />(which you can actually buy - it is a salty powder). If a product has "hydrolyzed __ protein",<br />then it has a form of MSG, which is created in the hydrolyzing process.<br /><br />Anyway -<br />There is a recipe on the label that I look forward to trying, and plan on making<br />seafood enchiladas with this as well.<br /><br />Since Amazon sellers almost never list ingredients for their food products, here is<br />what the jar says on the lobster base:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Cooked Lobster, Salt, Maltodextrin (a sugar), Hydrolyzed Soy Protein (form of MSG),<br />dried onion & garlic, potato flour, corn oil, natural flavors (?), xanthan gum,<br />disodium inosinate and guanylate, soy lecithin, oleoresin of paprika.<br />(As they'd say on HeeHaw,Yum Yum!)<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />serving size 1 teaspoon.<br />Calories - 10<br />Sodium - 680mg<br />Total fat - 0<br />Carbs - 2g<br />Protein - 1g<br /><br />If you eat out much, you probably are already eating these bases. They are highly concentrated,<br />so you don't need to use much. You "reconstitute" the base in boiling or very hot liquid and add<br />it to your recipe. Very easy to use.<br />The product should be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />I'll update my review once I've made something with it.

review/summary: If you miss Chi Chi's, this is worth the money.
review/text: The Chi-Chi's restaurant chain used to sell a dish called "Enchiladas Cancun".  Recently I decided to see if I could find the recipe because I missed my favorite dish.  All the internet searches for the recipe were more or less identical & said to use this ingredient.  I was hesitant because this product isn't cheap so I made the dish for the first time with a substitution & without this ingredient.  The enchiladas were okay, not great, so I thought that maybe my memory of the dish was probably better than the fact.  I tried to talk myself out of this product because of the cost.  One day in a fit of impulse buying, I finally decided to buy it.  I'm so glad I did!  I made the sauce last night & made the enchiladas today & it was like being back at Chi-Chi's.  If only I had the Spanish rice & corn cake to go with it!  I'm also going to take the basic sauce recipe to make an incredible pasta sauce with this base.  It was definitely worth every penny & the cost of the base is still cheaper than ordering a meal at a restaurant.

review/text: I use several of the different flavored Better Than Bouillion bases for different recipes.  The Lobster Base is wonderful.  I use it mostly to flavor my fish soups, and works for Creole style soups as well as Asian inspired soups.  If you back off the regular salt in the recipe and use some of the base instead, it can be used to intensify seafood sauces and stews.  I use a small amount of beef base to "salt" my ground turkey to make it taste like ground beef when making turkey burgers or spaghetti and meat sauce.  You can get so creative with these bases!!!!

review/summary: Lobster base was the missing ingredient in my new favorite recipe
review/text: I have been lookng for a good recipe for Seafood Burrito's and found the ingredient I was missing which is this Better than Boullion Lobster Base. Well, this was the flavor enhancement that was needed. Here is my procedure (sorry not a complete recipe, this is more of a guideline). I start with thawed shelled shrimp, cut them in half (I like to use the large shrimp). Add lump crabmeat (you can use shredded imitation crab or lobster though it's not quite as good, it works just fine). Warm the seafood in saucepan with a little garlic butter (do not overheat). Place warmed seafood in a flour tortilla that has been warmed and roll into a burrito form. Ladle hot seafood sauce and a little shredded cheddar (or any other cheese of choice or none at all) on top. May be topped with diced green onions or cilantro or diced fresh tomatoes if desired. Side with refried beans with shredded cheddar and mexican rice. Seafood Sauce: Start with a roux of equal parts melted butter and flour. Cook roux til slightly tan in color. Add whole milk or half milk and cream. Heat until thickened. Add lobster base to taste (I use about a scant teaspoon for 2 cups of sauce but just taste it as you go - you can add more but can't take it out). Add a little shredded parmesean to the sauce if desired but not essential. Sorry no pecise measurements since I don't measure anything but if you are any cook at all, you will know ho much sauce to make for as many burritos as you are making.

review/text: I was delighted to find the lobster base at Amazon, use all the other bases made by this company, but had no idea the lobster base would be this good. I love to cook, flavor your rice with that, use it in a bouillebaisse or a cioppino, you will be thrilled with the results. It has a great aroma, not overpowering, just right.  You cannot possible miss using this product. I love to find new ways to incorporate it, even the already heavenly paella tastes richer. Rosemarie Conover

review/summary: The secret weapon in the World's Best Barbecue Shrimp.
review/text: Mine!<br /><br />OK, so now you know my secret so I might as well tell you that anchovy paste is also<br />critical. Send me some royalties awright!<br /><br />I have to laugh at the negative reviews for this wondermous stuff, you're not supposed<br />to eat it with a spoon, its a concentrate you nimrods! Sheesh.<br /><br />I also use this in gumbos, and recently tried it in some homemade vegetable soup and guess<br />what.... it was GREAT!!! Very versatile, I can imagine any number of uses.<br /><br />Better Than Bouillon has a great product line, and this is the Flagship. No kitchen should<br />be without a jar of this, and it lasts a long long time in the fridge. Seriously, whats to<br />complain about?

review/summary: Radically improved my cooking and eating experience!
review/text: I only use a little of this but it's the best store-bought bouillon I've ever used.  If you don't have time to make your own stock, this is the next best thing.  It dissolves in hot water and this is what makes it so good.  I now make rice using this added to the cooking liquid.  It adds a great flavor so you don't need cream or cheese to give depth.  Even sliced potatoes or veggies in a pan with a little bouillon made using this will taste great.  Rarely have I come across a food product to rave about but this has really made my life easier.  The organic chicken version is fantastic in chicken stew - throw in some barley or wild rice and basta!  I only wish the organic versions were easier to buy in stores and that I'd discovered the brand sooner!

review/summary: Lobster Base
review/text: I have a recipe for seafood newburg which I created over 30 years ago.  The key ingredient is a shrimp or lobster base.  For the past 5 years I have had difficulty finding it in the area where I live.  In fact, I had almost given up when a friend suggested Amazon.  I was able to get the lobster base by the end of the week and enjoyed seafood newburg for dinner on Sunday!  I've also used it for seafood lasagna.  The flavor speaks for itself. A little pricey but worth the money!

review/summary: Why does Amazon charges three times the retail value for this product?
review/text: I understand it's hard to find, but it costs roughly $3.50 in the grocery store.  And for those who don't have local access, with just a little bit of searching, it can be had for $4-5 a jar.  Don't get me wrong... I love Amazon; I'm a Prime member; and use them at least once a week. The product is awesome and doesn't deserve to be downgraded because of Amazon's highway robbery, but a rip-off is a rip-off.

review/text: I just received this today from Amazon.  My question - when using the recipe online (food.com #148921)it calls for 2 tbsp lobster base.  Is there enough liquid in this recipe to dilute the lobster base, or do I actually make lobster stock first and then use 2 TBSP of STOCK?  Any help would be so appreciated!  I want to make this recipe soon, and it looks like it will be expensive, so I don't want to screw it up!<br /><br />Thanks.

review/summary: Yummy in risotto
review/text: I use this to make risotto with asparagus and pine nuts... its flavorful enough that I don't need to add either butter or cheese to the recipe, which certainly cuts down on the fat content.  I agree its a little salty, but just plan the rest of your meal to be low-sodium and the problem is solved!  I would, however, definitely buy a better than bullion lobster with, say, half the sodium if they began making it (hint, hint).<br /><br />UPDATE: Although I am still very fond of this product, I was disappointed when I recently ordered some through Amazon.  Although the jar itself was still sealed, there was a coating of dried lobster base on the outside of the container (I'm guessing another jar in the original shipment broke).  The seller is simply damaging their own reputation by shipping product this way.

review/summary: WOW!! soo much salt
review/text: I purchased this product with anticipation of a great seafood base for soup and stews. It was late and after 2 weeks of waiting I contacted seller. Janet the rep asked if my address was correct and to check it first. I have used the same address for 3 years and it was not the problem but Fed Ex was! I let her know they simply had not delivered my package and that wasnt the first time. I wish the vendors let you know at time of purchase who delivers for them. I would not use Fed Ex, they used to have such terrific service but now there are News reports on how bad the service is lol! Anyway she stated that she would send out another one 2 day air, about a week later the original finally showed and no confirmation asked he simply handed it to me and dashed off. The directions say dissolve 1 teaspoon lobster base in 8oz of boiling water. For each quart of stock needed use 1 1/2 tablespoon. They claim they use 1/3 less sodium, now mind you it contains 680mg per serving size!! Thats an unbelievable amount of salt. It had my head swimming from dizziness. The ingredients dont list tomato but when you get past all the salt you taste tomato and not lobster in my opinion. I would probably have to use much more base to get any seafood flavor but am very concerned about that much salt in my familys food. I would not purchase this again considering all the trouble I went through and I could have bought it locally for half the price but the seafood bases are a little harder to find in my neighborhood. One more thought and I am done. Food vendors should automatically be required to list all nutrition facts. This was an all around wasted holiday effort for me and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.

review/summary: Better than bullion but worse than the Custom Culinary's
review/text: We hadn't been able to find our favorite lobster base at Surfas, LA.  They've been out of stock since the first of the year.  So, following the reviews here, I bought a jar of Better than Boullion lobster bast, $6.19 at Bristol Farms.  Tasted it:  It's not good, no way can it be compared with Custom Culinary's. With only a hint of lobster, dark red color, and tasting strongly of tomato paste, it won't do here.  Surprisingly, Better than Boullion has an excellent chicken base and their ham base if good too.  Had I looked farther down the page, I would have noticed that Amazon also carries the Custom Culinary "Gold Label" lobster base, which is the brand we had been using.  Yes, it's more than 3 times as expensive, but a bigger jar, much less need be used at one time, and the flavor is a world of improvement...really tastes like lobster and enhances everything from fish chowder to thermador.

review/summary: No Lobster Flavor
review/text: I bought this to try and shortcut a lobster stew recipe.  It was horrible.  It is so salty all you can taste is salt - like the tinny salt taste in canned soup.  I read the reviews about the sodium content, but figured I would compensate with the other ingredients in the recipe.  I put no other salt in the stew, and still all I could taste was salt - but more importantly, no lobster flavor whatsoever.  It was worth a shot, I guess, but I will throw the rest out.

review/summary: Too salty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I ordered this specifically for a recipe for Chi Chi's seafood enchiladas/Cancun on Recipe Zaar. The recipe consistently got five stars rating. It called for a tablespoon of lobster base (for a half recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, adding no salt and using no salt butter.  The dish was so salty that we threw it out.  Later, while trying to figure out what went wrong I found that this particular lobster base has 800 mg of sodium per tsp.  So, I had used 2400 mg of sodium in a recipe for 4-6 enchiladas.  We like salt--too much sometimes--but this was beyond the pale!!  Now, I've got 2 jars of this base and doubt I'll ever use it.  What a disappointment! Just be careful!

review/text: Love, love, love the malty taste of this vinegar on my chips, cabbage slaw and fried chicken. My husband also adores it on his fish and chips. Best part about this is there is *no* corn (and for corn allergy sufferers like me, this is important). The Heinz brand is made from corn malt and thus it is not a true barley malt flavor.

review/text: I have been using Heinz Malt Vinegar for what seems like forever. I was curious what an actual British Malt Vinegar tasted like, and how much different it was from our own domestic brands. Well, I'm glad that I was curious enough to order a couple of bottles of Sarson's. Compared to Heinz, Sarson's has a richer, brighter taste that barks out loud and clear when put on fried potatoes, salads, Etc. I'll definitely buy it again. Keep your eyes on the cost of shipping. If I had known, I would have purchased a larger quantity.

We had friends over and my wife put out two bowls with Heinz in one and Sarsons in the other. The other 3 of us blind tasted the chips dipped into each and it was unanimous. All 3 of us preferred the Heinz. It has more bite to it. The Sarsons is quite mild. Plus, the Heinz is a lot cheaper since my wife can just pick it up at the local market.<br /><br />Just 3 opinions. You may prefer it. Who knows.

review/text: This might not be the ideal gift for the casual LotR fan, but for collectors and die-hard fans, this is a must-add to the collection.  Yes, there are LotR Pez dispensers out there already, but the exclusive Eye of Sauron piece is only available in this gift set, and it does looks really unique and special.  Whether you are the type to leave it in the box, or if you want to take it out and use it, it's a great set overall for fans of all ages (provided you like Pez, of course).<br /><br />There were only 150,000 of these made, so it is not going to be available for a long time.  Also, if you can find it still at WalMart, where it was exclusively sold, you might still be able to pick it up for the original asking price of around $16.  If not, then your best bet is sellers on Amazon and the like.

I just came back from NM where I went to a Wallmart and purchased Payday kingsize bars for only $1.00 each retail.  This is for the kingsize 3.4 oz candbar.  I guess Wallmart really has the buying power and can out do the candy distributors.  So now I must go to a local Wallmart and stock up again.  Who knew?  By the way they are good even if they are made by Hershey now.  I remember the originals by Hollywood brands of Centralia, IL when I was a kid in the 60's and I think they tasted better.

I was not pleased with the quality of the ham.

In any case I honestly believe that considering price and quality this is by far the best deal I have seen in the US and only 2 clicks away.

review/summary: Rich Even When Made With Water
review/text: I first stumbled onto Land O'Lakes Cocoa Variety Packs at my local branch of a national warehouse store. As some other reviewers have noted, in retail stores this product is treated as a seasonal item, so by the time the winter holidays have passed, you may not be able to just run out and purchase it. It's a pity that it sells for so much more online because it is a really delicious hot cocoa.<br /><br />All the included varieties are made with real powdered milk, which makes such a difference in your final cup. There aren't many instant cocoas that can compete with homemade, but this is one that might. The varieties included in your pack do seem somewhat inconsistent, since different sellers claim the same "7 Variety Pack" but have different pictures and item descriptions.  (This one even claims "6 different flavors" in its description while still picturing seven.)  The sampler I had contained Supreme, Arctic White, White Chocolate with Peppermint, Caramel, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and Vanilla. The other flavors that appear (either in product descriptions or photos) are Tiramisu, Graham, Cinnamon and Mint. Generally speaking, all of the mixes are quite good. I found the Dark to be a bit too dark for my tastes, and the Arctic White a bit too sweet; I solved the problem by mixing the two powders together, half a packet of each per cup, and loved the result.<br /><br />Another nice thing about these Land O'Lakes Cocoa Packs is that the individual pouches are all tin, not just paper, so they stay fresh a long time. In my house, they didn't last a terribly long time regardless, but the last cups were just as creamy and warming as the first ones. I highly recommend trying out the Variety Packs. They're perfect for large gatherings (just add hot water!) and there really aren't any bad flavors.

review/text: Land O'Lakes Cocoa makes the perfect cup of hot chocolate. I am a huge fan of this brand of cocoa. My personal favorite is the raspberry variety. The raspberry taste is very bold and the chocolate milk/powder very creamy. I would highly recommend this hot chocolate to anyone.

review/summary: Super Easy, Versatile, and Tasty
review/text: I love a product that's ready in five minutes but is still healthy and not filled with chemicals or preservatives. The "original plain" flavor is versatile because you can add any veggie, spice, flavored oil you want and it make it go with whatever you have on hand.

review/text: My wife and I have been enjoying Near East Couccous for quite a while, and were surprised/happy to find it on Amazon for LESS than our local grocery store (Jewel). The original flavor is the best because you can flavor it any way you like. We especially like it with fresh basil and oregano with chicken breast. A healthy, complete meal that is very easy.
