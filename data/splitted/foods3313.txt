review/summary: Very good and cheap
review/text: I only drink this type of green tea (genmai-cha) but oftentimes, these are not available in your regular grocery stores, unless you go to the Asian market.<br />Amazon makes it easy for me to get this in bulk, and never run out.<br />This tea is very similar to the green tea they serve at Japanese restaurants. It is not too bitter and not too weak either.

review/summary: Yamamotoyama Genami-cha Green Tea
review/text: I love this tea and used to drink it all the time when I lived in San Francisco. I moved to Central Florida and have not been able to find a place that sells it. I ordered the product online and received it just fine. I'm a little disappointed because I don't think the tea is as strong as it used to be or as flavorful--maybe it's the water here. Ha! But I still enjoy the tea and probably drink 3 or 4 cups a day!

review/summary: great tasting tea
review/text: I chose to buy this tea because I first had it at a sushi bar and fell in love with it.  It's got a bit of a nutty flavor because of the brown rice, which I think makes it delicious if you're into that flavor.  It kind of reminds me of cereal...I just can't put my finger on which one though...maybe Kix or something like that?

review/summary: Great item, not so great packaging
review/text: I'm a big fan of the wholesome goodness of Honey Maid graham crackers.  We use them for peanut butter sandwiches and smores, and sometimes just for a nice snack with apples.  The kids love them, and so do I.<br />When I ordered the subscribe and save option was available.  I see that sometimes this disappears, I imagine due to stocking.  It was a great deal when I ordered, at least a dollar a box less expensive than my local store. I thought I was getting a fantastic deal, until the boxes arrived.  Instead of long sheets of grahams, what I got was more of a powder - the crackers had been completely obliterated in shipping.  Not just a cracker or two, but well more than half of each box. Bummer.<br />I might try this again, but unless you're looking to make a lot of pie crust, you might consider spending the extra dollar and getting an intact box.

review/text: High in fiber and zero cholesterol and made with real honey. So many ways to enjoy, from straight out of the box plain to the classic crust for cheesecake.<br />There are three stay fresh packages inside each 14.4 ounce box. Although, its packaging didn't protect the crackers from a little breakage. Still, even buying from a grocery store is a gamble. You'll never know if your box was dropped by a passing shopper once, twice or 10 times, before you got it.<br />The Warehouse deal with free Amazon Prime shipping is the greatest. &lt;- Don't overlook.

review/summary: Helped Boxer with Digestion Problems
review/text: We rescued a female boxer who came with severe digestion problems.  No matter what she ate - loose stools.  Not diarrhea, but loose stools.  We tried plain boiled chicken, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, you name it - all of the all natural, not rich to her system foods.  Removing grains.  Nothing worked.  Took her to the vet periodically as a couple of months went by without improvement.  Put her on a medicated food that was SUPER EXPENSIVE.  It seemed to work.  So I did some research and read more dog food labels than I knew what to do with and compared the HIGH COST vet food label to Diamond Naturals Senior.  She is approximately 3 years old and not a senior by any means, but the combination of ingredients and the percentages are a perfect fit for her large breed size and her digestion.  Her stool is beautiful and I never thought I'd get so excited to see firm stool.  Needless to say, we won't be changing her diet - ever.  My younger boxer male is on the Diamond Naturals Lamb & Rice and doing very well.  Highly recommend the brand for both the quality and the value - can't beat it!

review/summary: The best affordable nutrition for your old friend.
review/text: I'm a breeder of Champion Bird Dogs. Our Dogs have been winning on national stages in the field and in the ring for over a decade.  We have tried almost every form of canine nutrition available. We have done more research than I care to admit, and I have concluded that the Diamond Naturals Brand of Dog (and Cat) Food is the best value in the market today.  This company does not sponsor us, or anyone else. They don't have a breeder program or advertise like all the other brands do, they just make great food and keep the cost as low as they can.<br />I feed almost the entire line of Products offered by this Brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKDT6">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Puppy, Large Breed Lamb and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCQ6DY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Chicken and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFIWXU">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Senior Dogs 8+, Chicken and Rice Formula, 35 Pound Bag</a>.  This food will keep your Dog fit and trim, healthy and keep their coat looking as it should. I highly recommend it.<br />If you're reading this, then you obviously care about your Dog.  Buy this food, follow the recommended feeding instructions and enjoy your best friend for a long long time. God Bless

review/summary: Weak, poor quality
review/text: This is a very, very mild ginger tea.  I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.<br />I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas.  Here are just some of the problems I found:<br />1. Cannot open sachet without scissors.  Many are missing tear marks.<br />2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags.  So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.<br />3. The tag is glued to the sachet on several (maybe 20%) of the bags.<br />4. The tea bag rips apart when opening the sachet or when squeezing out your tea.

The bow and tag was missing, and the glue clump was still left that held it in place. The tape that closed the box was dirty- I had to take it off, and luckily, it peeled off easily. I was able to open the box and observe the contents. The crepes were wrapped in a separate interior container. The containers were cheap, brown flimsy plastic holders and several of the crepes were broken. I am ashamed to give this as a gift, but have no choice. I can't understand the high price on these! I think it is the outer box as it seems to have a magnetic closure.

review/summary: delicious toasted
review/text: delicious toasted! Pre-heat oven to 350-365 degrees farenheit. Spread on dry, UNGREASED cookie sheet, toast for about 8 minutes (or until edges and noticably browned like toasting coconut) stir and repeat. Times will vary. I do batches that will last about a week long, I put this in almost everything. It has a delicious nutty flavor after toasting with no afteraste.<br /><br />I love it in cereal, yogurt, soup, ice cream, pasta, stirfry, crab cakes...like I said, I put this in almost everything. Not beverages though (except shakes and smoothies, yum!).

review/summary: Economical higher-quality FLUTD food
review/text: I live with three cats, one of which has to be on a relatively pricey canned prescription diet for a urinary tract condition.  The problem is, this very same cat (Fred) loves to gobble down anything he can find, especially leftovers from the other two.  I've started feeding this to my other two cats that don't have the condition, as a preventative measure, and also to feel safe feeding them all at the same time and not having to worry if Fred picks up their scraps.  I adopted him as an adult, and I think the people that had him as a kitten starved him or fed him a lot of "people food," as I've caught him eating the weirdest stuff -- from pizza to sugar cookies to jalapenos.  This also might explain why his system is a little messed up.<br /><br />Frisky's also has a "Special Diet", which is cheaper and therefor probably not as good for kitties.  I ordered that, too, just as a back-up if my other two wouldn't eat Proplan.  I would say they all preferred ProPlan over Frisky's Special Diet (except Fred, who would gleefully scarf down hot garbage if he could get his paws on it).  Cats like what they like, and my cats have slightly more expensive taste -- again, except for Fred, who has quite an indiscriminate attitude towards food.<br /><br />I spoke with the vet about possibly switching Fred from his prescription diet to ProPlan and they reassured me that this was a very good food for cats with urinary tract problems, too.  Fred is the least picky cat I know when it comes to food, so I would only switch if cost because an issue.  I love my cats and they have a great life with me, but there are very occasionally some months where I have to eat off-brand ramen so I can pay the bills....so sometimes my cats have to slum it with me.  They are pretty good sports about it.  :)  I am planning to keep feeding this to my other two cats, with extras on hand for Fred if necessary.<br /><br />The delivery option is GREAT to save on trips to the store, and you can "subscribe" and save a buck or so.  If you do the math right (I didn't the first time, whoops), you can ensure the new palate arrives just as your little friends are polishing off the last couple cans.  If you have prime, it even ships for free.  Extremely convenient, cost effective, and perfect for the cat owner who would rather spend time at home with their cats than out running errands for them.  I would highly recommend this product, especially with the subscription if you're kind of lazy and a home-body like me :)<br /><br />Only negative thing I have to say:  I just wish they came in bigger cans.  I do recycle, but I feel that one large can would make less waste than two smaller cans.  On the other hand, my fridge isn't full of half-full cans after the cats eat their breakfast....

review/text: We had such urinary problems with our cat until we switched to ProPlan Urinary Tract formula.  The canned worked better for her than the dry as the vet said her urine was too concentrated.  We give her a small amount mixed with water about 4 times daily.  She loves it! (so does the dog).

review/summary: Amazing FLUTD cat food
review/text: We have a 16 month old cat who suddenly got FLUTD.  For about a month, she looked very uncomfortable and desperate to urinate, and was making a rancid mess of our house.  She would spend the entire day going back and forth to the litter box, straining and straining, and then leave one drop of urine in the most unpleasant possible places - on our couch, our bed, etc.  It was awful.  Almost every day led to high-stress discussions about whether she might have a life-threatening blockage.  Visits to the vet and internal medicine specialist cost us $3,500, and led to a complicated, expensive drug regimen.  The $3,500 of vet analysis basically concluded with "We don't know why it happened, and it's really not fixable; you just have to manage it."  They recommended a special diet food sold solely through vets.  It was ridiculously expensive.  We looked out at a 15 or 18 year time horizon, and thought, man, that is just insane.  I mean, if you have a 15 year old cat and you're facing a year or two of special diet food, then OK.  But a whole cat lifetime of prescription food? Only after other approaches have been tried.<br /><br />So we picked up a case of this food, along with Purina's dry food for FLUTD cats.  And that very day, her flutd STOPPED.  Period.  She has not had a single, solitary incident of straining or sign of discomfort since.  It's been about two months.<br /><br />And, both she and our other cat (who has no flutd issues) LOVE this food.  They stand at the bowls and meow for it, in a way that we have not seen them do for any other food.  Sadly, this food is only offered in one flavor (chicken), so our plan was to feed it to them for as long as they would tolerate it, and then integrate in some other non-FLUTD foods, to give them the variety that cats usually demand.  Well, they have eaten this one flavor every day for two months, and they continue to lick the bowls dry and empty every single day....and STILL stand there meowing for more of it, the next morning.  Insane...<br /><br />So far, so good, and this seems like a fantastic product.

review/summary: I wont't buy any other brand now
review/text: 9 years ago my cat had an overnight stay at the vet due to struvite crystals in his urine.  I don't speak cat but from what I could tell, he was miserable and the vet said that he would have died if I hadn't checked him that morning because he wouldn't have made it through the day.  The vet prescribed a combination of wet and dry prescription food.  My cat refused to eat the wet food which is odd because he will chow down any type of wet food he can get to.  I returned the food because it was expensive and it would sit for days and he wouldn't touch it.  From the vet's office, I went to a pet store and found this brand.  I let him take a whiff of the one can I bought as a test and he was climbing up my legs to get to it before I could get it into a bowl.  The vet told me that he felt that it didn't work as well for the issue as the prescription version and he would have problems because of that in the future.  Well, like I said, it was nine years ago and with this food - nothing.  My mother has a brother out of the same litter and he also has the same problem and she uses the Friskies version of this food because her cat wouldn't eat the prescription brand either.  He has had other episodes since his original one. I like to think that my cat has done so well because this food is better for him.  It used to come in a larger sized can but I haven't seen it in years so perhaps they no longer make it.  The subscribe and save is a great option too along with free shipping with Amazon Prime.

review/text: My cat recently got diagnosed with FLUTD. The vet told us that he would need to be put on a specialized diet for the disorder. We switched the foods at once and have not had a FLUTD flare-up since. He also loves the stuff! The only thing I wish were different was that Purina had more options besides chicken - the cat (as do most) loves him some tuna.

review/summary: Cat Loves Better Then Vet Prescription Food
review/text: Very early this year (2010) my vet diagnosed my cat with a urinary tract infection and gave her Royal Canin Urinary SO canned food.  She liked it somewhat and seemed to get better.<br /><br />When the vet said that she would have to come back for another office visit I decided to try the Purina urinary tract equivalent.<br /><br />My cat just loves it!  When hungry, she finishes off a 3 ounce can in about 15 minutes.  I still give her the vet food as well but she never finishes off that food as a fast.  She also eats the Purina dry food, that I leave out, but not nearly as fast.<br /><br />Unfortunately she is sick again(weight loss - but not Hypothyroid).  Blood work has not determined what is wrong with her.  He wants another $500 for xRays and other stuff.  She nearly 17 years old, so I'm not sure what I'll do.

review/summary: The berry taste is out of this world
review/text: I have gradually become a berry flavored tea fan over the years. I've done all the store bought ones and they are pretty good. I had never seen this variety before and had been pleased with Stash's high quality product already (they make an amazing Peppermint). The purity and taste of the berry varieties in this sampler box is totally wow. I brew these in a sealed tea container overnight with a cinnamon stick dropped into it. If you want to experience the most delicious taste ever, use only highly purified water (I buy spring water) for your creation. Today's tap water will ruin the experience. Don't do it. One last thing: there is a wonderful book available called "20,000 Secrets Of Tea" -- it's a little paperback. A nice little history of tea in general, and then a detailed breakdown of all tea varieties. The healing properties in teas is nothing short of miraculous. High blood pressure, stomach distress, fatigue, headache, urinary distress,...the remedies are in there. Most likely, your doctor is poisoning you with prescriptions that you don't even need (well hey, that's their job!). LOL. This is an awesome deal here by Amazon folks: SIX boxes of these, with 18 bags in each. I've plowed through one whole box already. I'll be back.

I was somewhat disappointed that the berries, cranberry and pomegrante are flavors. There are not pieces of the fruits, as some other teas have. The teas are caffeine free which is a real plus for iced tea, since I like to drink that at all times of the day.<br /><br />I did think the ice tea was good and tasty, but it's flavors did not come through as well as I expected. Perhaps I should try what the one reviewer suggested and keep it brewing overnight. I had mine seep at least 10 minutes. Overall, it is a good addition especially for iced tea, and it is much less expensive than other places. I have not tried the tea hot, yet.

A little sad that it is so difficult to find in stores in our area, and shipping from most sites is almost as much as the coffee itself.<br /><br />The taste is rich and extremely smooth.  No bitterness.  No acidity afterward.  This coffee is phenomenal!  If we don't manage to find it nearby, you can be sure that we'll order some sooner, rather than later.

review/text: If you are looking for a great tasting, not bitter coffee, this is IT.  It is a million times better than any of the big chain coffes including starbucks.  LOVE this coffee, you will not be dissapointed.  Can be hard to find as I assume it is a regional item but well worth the money!

review/summary: Smooth, rich, and satisfying coffee
review/text: My friend received this coffee as a gift from someone else and passed it along to me because she only had a Keurig machine.  She made a mistake!  This is the best coffee I have had in a long time.  It completely blows Starbucks away.  There is NO bitterness or bad aftertaste...it's creamy, rich, incredibly smooth, and melts in your mouth like good chocolate.  Try it and you won't regret it!  It's definitely worth buying a coffee maker just to try this coffee.  In fact, I may have to take pity on my friend and hook her up with a coffee maker and some of this coffee, so she can finally try it and enjoy it.

review/summary: Wonderful Twist on the Classic Form
review/text: These ungodly chocolatey snack pods spawned from the marriage of a Snickers Bar and the devil himself aren't quite Snickers, but they're damn close to heaven. The nougat and peanuts aren't gone but they take a backseat while chocolate and caramel make sweet love in your mouth. Bought these as a gift and ended up eating most of them myself. Her loss is my gain.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Awesome<br />- Prime Shipping = WIN<br />- Chocolate<br /><br />CONS<br />- Probably not available year-round - wait, that's probably a good thing.

review/summary: 425F seems too high a recommended baking temp
review/text: The muffins themselves are quite tasty and easy to prepare, but they probably would have come out much tastier had the edges NOT come out just under burned. :(  Box directions recommend to bake these at 425F for 15-20 min. That seemed pretty extreme to me, especially for Lemon Poppyseed muffins which seem delicate. I baked at 425 but pulled them out after just 12 minutes. Didn't make a difference - they were already nearly black around the edges and on the bottoms by then. Had to eat around the burnt parts. No doubt the whole batch would have been ruined if I'd left them in the recommended 15, and certainly 20 min. Glad I wasn't serving these up to company.

review/text: "Real Theater Popcorn" is the easiest way to get the best theater style popcorn at home (especially if you use a whirleypop popper)<br /><br />But you should be aware that most resellers are selling this stuff for more than you would pay if you just buy direct from the source (and yes it is available online popcornpopper dot com)<br /><br />$1.10 to $1.60 per pouch depending on the volume you buy is closer to what you should be paying, not $2 and up.

review/summary: Great tasting and easy-to-make popcorn, but no size choice.
review/text: I have a six-quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn - perfect, right? Not so much - I find that they make too much - by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper - if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though - the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.<br /><br />Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs - I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too.

review/summary: Awesome!! Order this popcorn!
review/text: Last year I bought a popcorn machine for my son's carnival birthday party and needed some popcorn kits to go along with it.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with Great Northern popcorn because it had a lot more review. WRONG CHOICE!  It was terrible! It's had a chemical-like smell and was EXTREMELY salty -- and I am a person that salts everything and it was way too salty for me to even eat. It was just all around nasty popcorn.<br /><br />This year I decided I'm going to break out the popcorn machine and use it again, but I needed to get different popcorn.  I wanted to allow myself enough time this year that if I didn't like the popcorn I ordered, I would have time to order replacements before the party.  Last week I ordered the Real Theater popcorn kits and OMG! I LOVE it!  It tastes really good like movie theater popcorn or the popcorn you get at the popcorn carts at the zoo or amusement parks.  My house smelled really good like popcorn you just had to have.  I even stepped outside for a little bit and walked back in to see how the smell would hit you if you were just walking in the house.  It was fabulous!

review/summary: Tastes like the movies!
review/text: I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn. Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy. Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet. Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too). You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping. While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl. Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is about $2.40 per pack (or $1.66 per pouch in the 15 pack), which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

When I got the Whirley, the Wabash Valley Farms was the first popcorn I tried for it.  I was immediately amazed. This pops larger than any one I've ever tried.  Much larger.  And the flavor cannot be beat.  It is truly an exceptional popcorn and I will never again use a different one.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this "Real Theater" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is "bad" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of "real" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be "artificial" and "thick".  "Thick", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent "real theaters" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.
