review/summary: Good, but pricey.
review/text: Pros: My dogs love them. They last a long time. They don't really stink after the first 30 seconds.<br /><br />Cons: They're a little pricey.  And I don't like to think about what they're made out of.  They lose the star on price, though.  Pound for pound, they cost more than dry-aged USDA Prime Rib.  I don't buy USDA Dry-Aged Prime Rib for myself, so I'm not sure how I got talked into paying that kind of money for a dog treat.  I blame my wife.  She says I'm stingy with the dogs.  I say I'm pragmatic and our dogs would be happy eating out of the litterbox if we would let them.<br /><br />My dogs will recite Shakespearean sonnets for these treats.  One of them has learned how to mow the lawn for me, and the other has started grading my students' homework in exchange for a half-length of one of these apparently delectable sections of dried out taurine...parts.  (Seriously, don't look up what they're made out of if you're squeamish.)<br /><br />These things are expensive compared to regular rawhide, but they do provide a longer chewtime-per-inch for my mutts and, so I've been told by professionals, don't have the same potential to cause gastrointestinal damage.  Furthermore, I cannot emphasize enough how much my dogs prefer these things to regular rawhide chews.  They just have to see me move my hand toward the bag and all of a sudden my two Tasmanian devils are stone-still statues of obedience eagerly awaiting, nay, eagerly DESIRING any word of command I might give.  Therefore, despite the price, I don't feel I've gotten the shaft on this deal.  At least not metaphorically.  Euphemistically, though, I suppose I got a whole bag of them.<br /><br />Oops, sorry.  Now you know what they're made out of.<br /><br />When you first open the bag, they'll smell bad.  After 30 seconds, there is no scent whatsoever unless you wave one of them right under your nose.  If you're the kind of person who regularly waves dried out steer phallus under your nose and you need them to be totally odor-free, get a different product.<br /><br />You'll need some heavy-duty garden shears or a really sharp cleaver if you're going to cut the foot-longs down to smaller sizes.  This process makes me wince in some sort of primal, Y-chromosome encoded empathic reaction, even though I realize the animal from which the product was taken no longer has need of it.  My wife says I'm a wuss.  I say I'm compassionate.<br /><br />If you have neither a prohibitively strong gender-based moral qualm regarding the raw materials used to make a bully stick nor a hyper-developed sense of smell, and you can afford to pay Dry-aged USDA Prime Rib prices to throw pieces of dessicated steer pizzle to an animal that will wolf down filet mignon with the same delight it takes in bolting cat poop when you're not watching, then go ahead and buy these.  At least your dogs will give you their undivided attention for the 15 seconds between your opening the bag and distributing the treat.

review/text: Our dog LOVES to chew, and these sticks are the best! Each stick is strong, yet softens up as it is chewed. Each stick lasts long enough to satisfy his "chewing fit." For quality, value, and safety, we haven't found anything to compare with the bully sticks. Next to Costco (when they have them in stock), Rawhide Depot has the most reasonable price we have found anywhere for the 12" bully sticks. And, their customer service is excellent!

review/summary: Finally found some reasonably priced bullies!
review/text: Recently, my local feed and grain store upped the price of their bully sticks so I've been searching for a cheaper online supplier. Everyone else seems to have similar prices, wanting 3.50-4.00 dollars per bully stick not to mention shipping so I was thrilled to find these on here. My dog loves them just the same as any others I've bought for her. There was an even mix of some skinny sticks and some thick ones and it works out to be much cheaper to buy them this way rather than by the price of a single stick.

review/summary: "Large" Bull Sticks Sickened my Dog
review/text: These bull sticks carry the same name brand as the Costco standard, Cadet Bully Stick, but are not as uniform in shape or nearly as large.  Instead of smelling like dead animal, these bull sticks smell like dirty underwear.  The smell didn't bother my dog... at least at first.  My dog threw up each time after chewing/consuming the bull sticks.  Her dumb owner (me) wasn't sure what was making her sick at first, so we had three opportunities through the week to chew and clean up.  The rest of the bag went to the dumpster.<br /><br />If your dog has a sensitive stomach or anyone in the family has a sensitive nose, avoid these rawhide chews.

review/text: A friend gave me a sample of this product and I liked it, so I purchased two bags.  What a disappointment! The sticks are unevenly sized (some very thin, some very thick, some tall, some short) and smell awful, even through the sealed plastic bag!  When my dogs chew them, we can't stand to be in the same room, because the whole room stinks.  I don't know why the sticks from the bag I sampled were evenly sized and smelled fine and this order was so different.  I will look elsewhere for bully sticks from now on as I need to be able to depend on the quality of the product.  My friend also ordered a bag with the same poor results and won't be buying from this company again either.

review/text: These bully sticks are super cheap (for bully stick standards) and they last pretty long. I typically buy these instead of the 6" variety and cut them in half for my Cairn Terriers as they last a lot longer. They're pretty tough to cut, but a good hacksaw does a good job in short order. Once cut in half, the additional thickness means they still last about twice as long as the 6" ones.<br /><br />Still wish they were cheaper though!

review/summary: Dog Crack
review/text: My sister and brother-in-law rescued a beautiful black labrabull. They had no intentions of adopting a pit bull - quite the opposite, that was the one breed they wanted nothing to do with. But there at the Northshore Animal League their dog Rosie chose them, and they went for it. She's a mellow, friendly, loving, playful, athletic family member. As my sis has two boys - 9 & 10 - they've got the energy to burn exercising their lovable muttigree.<br /><br />One teeny-weeny issue - she chews. She's only 4 months old so teething may be part of it, but based on her lineage, the chewing part will last a lifetime. I read up on bull pizzles. Supposed to last a long time, and give a digestible, safe alternative to typical rawhide bones. I ordered a pack of these. From the reaction from the dog I'll be ordering again and again. Rosie gnawed her very first one is about 15 minutes, wagging her tail the entire time.<br /><br />Yeah, they do smell a bit - but you have to put your nose right inside the bag, or get in the dog's face while chewing (not advisable - my sister said that really stinks.) She solved the problem with Ziplock freezer bags.

review/summary: Gross for us, great for dogs!
review/text: Yes, bully sticks smell horrible... And if you think about what they are made from you just may gag (or eat yourself up with guilt if you are an animal activist).  However, my dogs go absolutely crazy for these! NOTHING can distract them from their chewing with one of these in their possession!  They are supposed to be much better/safer for dogs than regular rawhides and I have noticed that my dogs don't seem to choke after eating them the way they sometimes did with rawhides.  We have 1 small and 1 medium sized dog, both very aggressive chewers and these keep them occupied for over an hour (depending on the size of the stick).  I think the larger sticks are a better deal and if you have a small saw you can saw them in half for the smaller pups.  Yes they are pricey, but if you have ever bought these at any pet store you will quickly realize that this is a great deal!  One large bully stick at Petsmart or Petco will cost you about $8 and you usually get about 10 per package with these...well worth the cost.  So if you can get past the smell and the source of these nasty lil things, your pups will thank you!

These are great for when my family and I want to eat dinner with peace and quiet. She will not leave the bully stick alone until it is all done. She chews one up in about 30-45 minutes. I'm pretty sure she is going through a teething phase right now so these are perfect for that as well. She hasn't had any intestinal problems (i.e. diarrhea, vomiting) from these either, which is nice.<br /><br />The only complaints I have is the price and I've noticed a small odor.

review/summary: My dog loves these and after one Stick, her teeth look better already !
review/text: My dog loves these Pizzle Sticks.  I wish I would have found them or had them recommened to me sooner.  My Pittie can and will chew any type of chew practically within seconds.  I needed to find something that would last longer because I wanted something that would help keep the tartar off her teeth.  She is going to be 6 years old this year, and the tartar is starting.  Even though I brush her teeth, and give her a couple different types of Dentel Chews, this was not helping.  Then a friend of mine whose dog will also be six years old this year, and is the same breed, has the most sparkling, white teeth.  I needed to know what she gives him to help keep his teeth so nice.  She told me about the Pizzle Sticks.  I read up on them, and although I found what they are made of a strange item for a dog to chew on, I gave it a try.  And yes, she had her first one today and she chewed on it, for about 35 minutes.  I was delighted that I found something that she can actually chew on for more than a couple of minutes.  She finished her Pizzle Stick and was so happy.  I looked at her teeth later, and I was amazed that the tartar is almost gone.  Really it is.  So these will be the Dental Chew of choice from now on.  Pizzle Sticks are expensive, but so are all the other Dental chews that I have found available.  And, the Pizzle Sticks from Amazon is one of the best buys of them than anywhere else I have checked.  I highly recommend these Pizzle Sticks.

review/summary: Great Outlet for Chewers
review/text: This is a great outlet for dogs or puppies who like to chew, and chew safely.  While a puppy, one bully stick would keep her entertained for about 2 days, and she never ever went to chew chair or table legs.  Priceless.  Now that she's older (9 months) they don't last longer than 1/2 hour, but it's still a great diversion when she needs something to do on a rainy day.  I limit her to 1 per day as they're not cheap.  If buying bully sticks elsewhere, read the ingredients list.  You want something that's 100% bull pizzle (which these are).  Anything cheaper tends to have something like potato flour in it which has made my dog sick.  My dog loves these.

review/summary: Bull Sticks, dog chews, not as smelly as Costco's same brand
review/text: Although slightly more expensive per pound than the same brand from Costco (approximately a 1.2 pound pack vs. 1 pound for same price), these have very little odor, while same brand at Costco are very "aromatic".  Our golden retriever likes both about equally.  The chews seem to clean her teeth.<br /><br />I cut the sticks in half on my band saw, so a 6" piece is about right for a good days chewing.

review/summary: It's tough to find good long last bully sticks
review/text: I was buying sticks from my local high-end pet store.  $6 a whack for a 12" stick.  EXPENSIVE!  But, those sticks last FOREVER.  Like everyone else, I wanted to buy in bulk for cheaper.  This seemed like the best reviewed product on Amazon.  The sticks are OK, but are really like 1-time use sticks.  My small dog can kill one in an hour.  It's probably an equal trade off since the price is so much better, but it's a little frustrating to see similar looking sticks disappear so quick.  Anyway, I'll probably buy the product again because it's so cheap, and it has taught me to be more sparing with the dogs and use the sticks more like treats.  Probably a good thing for them.  It's just a weird change going from leaving a stick on the floor for about a week of chewing activity.

review/summary: Smaller Than They Used to Be
review/text: My five dogs, Mastiff, 2 Labradoodles, 2 Blue Heeler puppies, all under 2 years of age, love Bully Sticks. I started purchasing them at Costco. When they stopped carrying them, for a several months, I purchased these from Amazon. Recently they have been thinner than the first ones I purchased. We go through several pounds a month. Costco has recently stared carrying them again. This batch at Costco, are mostly thick, some even Mastiff sized. In fact the 10 packages I purchased a month ago didn't have many, Doodle sized, only huge. So I cut them in half for the Doodles and Blue heelers, now 5.5 mos old. But never mind, they switch them all out amongst themselves so I've stopped cutting them in half. I use a big tree branch hopper.<br /><br />I was going to order a few packages of the smaller diameter for the "smaller" dogs, here, but the last few packages we purchased at Costco had a few smaller diameter.<br /><br />My 1.5 year old Mastiff finishes one of these smaller ones in a few minutes, if he doesn't get distracted. I then have to give him another and then another. I would rather give them all one large one. When the smaller dogs tire of chewing they will leave the stick, and sooner or later, another finds it for an extra treat. Thank goodness they get along well enough that there is no fighting when only one has a stick; otherwise I would be handing them out throughout the evening and next morning. They get the Bully Sticks when we are home to supervise.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase from Costco as long as they carry them and only purchase these when I have to. I've ordered the "premium" sticks but they cost quite a bit more.

When we ask him if wants a bullie, he jumps up, runs to the cupboard where we keep them and hops up and down excitedly. One of these last about an hour for him. He usually doesn't leave anything for a second go-round.<br /><br />As for the vendor, Rawhide Depot is outstanding. My order usually arrives in two days tops. Even if I could find these local - which I can't - I'd still use Rawhide Depot because of its customer service.

review/summary: Skinny Bully Sticks
review/text: I was very disappointed with these bully sticks. They were incredibly skinny. I have been ordering these bully sticks from Rawhide Depot for quite some time and have never been disappointed before. There is usually one in the package that could be better but on the whole they have aways been an acceptable size.  These are priced very well.  I cannot afford to buy them anywhere else. My doggies may have to do without. I may take a chance again in the future but if I receive the same incredibly skinny ones I will never buy them again. The shipping was fast and there were no other glitches. I love that Rawhide Depot offers free shipping on this item if the minium purchase is met and it isn't very high - I think about $30 just off the top of my head. I always shop Rawhide Depot for dog treats and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Would have rated 5 stars a couple of months ago, but...
review/text: When I got my keeshond puppy about a year ago, I had trouble finding something that he would like to chew (that he was supposed to chew) until I discovered the wonderful world of "Bully Sticks".  My vet advised against nylabone (which didn't interest him at all anyway) and rawhide for puppies, so I let my pup browse the pet store shelves and his nose lead him to the Bully Sticks (any nose from afar could smell these out.)  I handed one to him and it was love at first bite.  They are quite expensive at the pet store, so I was thrilled to see them here on Amazon for such a bargain (compared to pet store prices.)  With all the hype about pets getting sick from products made in China, I was also happy to see that these Cadet Bull Sticks are made in Brazil... (though I know USA would be best.)<br /><br />On average, I've been buying 2 packages of these "Large 1 lb. Bull Sticks" a month for about a year.  At first, my puppy would take at least a whole day to consume one, and it was my sanity saver.  Any time I needed my pup to just chill out for a while, I'd give him one of these long Bully Sticks and he wouldn't want to do anything else until it was finished.  Yes, they do smell.  When you first open the package and if your dog is chewing it by your feet, you will definitely be surrounded by the fresh "pizzle" aroma.  Remember what these things are made of, though.  (It's what makes a bull, a bull. ;)  You also may not want your furry best friend to give you kisses while he's chewing it, but the smell does go away quickly and having my dog content and occupied is worth more to me than a brief "pizzle smell."  Because of their shape, they have not posed a choking hazard to my dog nor do they upset his tummy like many other things do.<br /><br />Now, if I had thought about writing a review on these Large Bull Sticks months ago, I would have given this product 5 stars.  I'm rating it 4 stars now because the last couple of recent batches I've gotten, have been very inconsistent in size...  most of them pieces around 6 - 8" long instead of 12" long, however, they do package them to equal out to be 1 lb. worth of bull sticks, albeit some are short and very thin, some are very short and thick, some are long and thick.  (Resisting inappropriate joke...;)  My other disappointment with these latest batches is that the price has gone up about $5 from earlier in the year, but it's still a nice value compared to the pet stores.  Like someone else has mentioned, they also don't seem to grab the attention of my now 14 month old, 45 lb. keeshond like they used to.  The last 2 batches, he'll leave it lying around awhile, but will finish it in about an hour when he does feel like chewing it.  I wonder if/what they changed at the manufacturer?  Though it's still a must-have for me in my arsenal of items to keep the dog busy.

review/summary: BULLY STICKS VS RAW HIDE
review/text: I dont think a lot of pet owners realize that the reason raw hides are cheaper is because your pets can choke on them.  They can rip chunks of the stuff off while chewing and it will expand after they swallow and choke.  There have also been many cases of raw hides being contaminated with Salmonella especially those imported from China.  I have a friend whose little Maltese got Salmonella from a little raw hide stick off those cute Christmas gift bags.  She got lucky and got better but it took a couple of months and was on lots of anti-bionics.<br /><br />Most shelters & Rescue Groups will not accept raw hides as donations. So although Bully sticks and tripe are pricier, they have better nutrition as well as safety for your pet.  As a precaution, make sure they are not imported from China.

review/text: I've gotten these from my local pet store, and am very picky about getting the tallest, fattest one I can locate. Recently the price for one jumped from $2.99 to $4.99, which is ridiculous for a chew stick that lasts no longer than 24 hours, on a good day. I learned of this "economy package" and though there's many, many negative reviews, I thought I'd give them a whirl. Well, I am now in the market for new bull dicks altogether. Exactly half of them were 6" tall and the 12" tall ones were completely anemic. I myself, if this was my business, would be embarrassed to sell this product. There's clearly no quality control. I cannot speak to odor, as I've not opened the package yet, so I cannot comment on that. Maybe that would knock off the last star possible.

review/summary: Variety of bullies
review/text: You would think that a bull pizzle is created the same, right?  Right?! I have been procuring bull pizzle for my puppy for the past 6mos.  I have bought odor free [read: less odor than full stink] bullies, regular odor bullies [read: first and last 5min is barf-inducing], and then these Cadet bullies [read: ability to make a human pass out while sealed in the bag]. Apparently, not all bullies are created alike and these bullies are not for my lil miss pittie mix.  She'll chew on them for a few minutes and leave them.  With other bullies, she would chew forever.  Maybe it was just this batch.<br /><br />In the bag that I got, there were about 9-11 bullies of different lengths and thicknesses.  There were about 5-6 6" fairly thick bullies; 2 or 3 thin (like a reed) bullies; and some others.  I am sure each bag has a different variety, but they were definitely not all large.  Unless large has multiple meanings, such as small, short, thin. They somewhat do the job for now, but I will go back to other vendors.

These bully sticks will keep him occupied for 5-10 minutes, which doesn't sound like much, but it is for our dog.<br /><br />Like most other bully sticks, the smell is a bit, um, pungent.  It helps if you open the bag in the garage and let them air out for a few days.  Also, your dog's breath will reek, but he'll reek happily.

review/text: My chihuahua has loved bully sticks ever since I brought him home.  They keep him busy for long periods of time and I guess overtime has prevented him from chewing on "no no"  items in my home since I've never had those issues with him.  My chihuahua runs through these so quickly so continuing to purchase locally no longer made financial sense. I feel the large bull sticks are a great value as previously I was paying $7-$10 per bull stick - purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XSXZM">Large Bull Sticks, 1 Lb</a> comes to around $2 per bull stick so I will definitely be a repeat buyer. The smell is intense but I'm used to it.  These 12inch sticks last about 3 days with my little one.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the packaging, it comes in a thick plastic that is tightly sealed but I prefer something that snaps shut because of the smell.

review/text: My 3 dogs absolutely love bully sticks. Head to your local pet supply store and you will be horrified to find out that these can cost as much as $12 a piece! This 1lb package is a great deal especially if you get the free shipping. In my last package I received eleven, 12" bully sticks that were all quite thick.<br /><br />As some other reviewers have mentioned they do smell. It's a gross smell but guess what dogs love gross stuff! It's not the type of odor that permeates your house, lingers or makes you gag (at least not me). It usually takes my slowest chewer 20-30 minutes to finish one and my most voracious chewer about 15 so that's not as long as some might hope but really for my adult german shepherd dogs and one cattle dog this seems to sate their need to chew and they really love them. When they were pups they lasted even longer.A very nice treat!<br /><br />Edit: Some reviewers have said these bully sticks are yet another product "made in China" but that is not the case. I check every package I get and they all say "Made in Brazil".

review/summary: My dog enjoys them, but not very long lasting
review/text: I have a medium-sized 60 lb dog who is not an aggressive chewer. He can go through one of these in under 10 minutes, however. He seems to enjoy them quite a bit, so I keep buying them. I've bought several packages so far and I've noticed that in every package, there is a stick or two that smells absolutely AWFUL. The smell for most of the sticks is usually pretty unoffensive but occasionally you get one that stinks to the high heavens. The stinky ones don't seem to give him digestive issues so I guess they're fine, but it is a little weird....<br /><br />Can someone please comment and tell me why bully sticks are so expensive? Is there a reason or is it because pet companies know owners will pay through the nose for their dogs' enjoyment? Bully sticks are just cow penises after all!

review/summary: Very Smelly Bully - The dog likes them but I don't
review/text: My dogs have had many different types of bully sticks over the years.  Some have a funky smell.  These are the worst smelling bully sticks I have ever smelled.  With other bully sticks, the funny smell goes away after the bag has been open for a few minutes.  These bully sticks really stink.  They have a very strong smell that you can actually smell from many feet away. And it does not go away even after the stick is gone. Not only in the bag but hours later and the smell goes wherever they go.  My puppy now has stinky breath.  My family room where he has been chewing reeks of funky bully.  But dogs being dogs really love bad smelling things.  I am not returning them but I will never buy these again.  We will be sending them to the kennel next time my dog has an overnight stay and letting them keep the leftovers.  We have had better luck with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012UK8IQ">12" Free Range Bully Sticks Thick Select Odor Free 25 pieces Sealed with UPC</a>  Even though they are not Prime eligible.

review/summary: Bully Sticks
review/text: I was turned onto these bully sticks by a dog forum I belong to. I have a 12 month old female Labrador that LOVES to chew! She will chew walls, carpet, toys, shoes, wood, ANYTHING! I went to the pet store to find these bully sticks and was shocked at how expensive they are. I bought one and I gave it to my dog and she was completely in love with it! They do have an odor but it is not bad and so worth it to have my very hyper dog occupied with something she loves.<br /><br />Bully Sticks are perfect for long car rides or when you're trying to get a task done at home and you need to keep your dog entertained or just for whatever reason, dogs LOVE them! In fact my dog is chewing on a bully stick as I write this and she doesn't care about anything else except her bull stick! Yes they are an expensive dog treat but they last a long tme and are worth it. Buy these and you will not regret it!

review/summary: Dog Treat
review/text: This is about the sixth time that I have ordered these large bull sticks and I have always been extremely pleased with the value and quality of the product. My dog obviously loves to gnaw on them. I have a small dog so I cut them in half to make it easier for her to handle and the product lasts twice as long. The only reason I didn't award five stars is because the last package I received had sub-standard pieces compared to all of my previous orders. I anticipate that I will continue to order this product.

review/text: As another reviewer mentioned, it is expensive. But my dog loves it; these are a fail-safe method of keeping him busy for few hours atleast. With a very active Siberian Husky in cold Minnesota winters, thats always a plus!<br />And also, couple of hours of chewing on one makes his teeth seem cleaner and whiter.

review/text: When we were on vacation, a pet store owner offered these bully sticks to my young dog with a sensitive stomach. The store owner was absolutely correct!! Our dog absolutely loves them & has no problem digesting them (like he does with raw hide). Teddy hides his sticks, in & out of doors, &later 'searches' for them. They do smell but one can get them odorless.

review/summary: Golden loves them
review/text: My Golden Retriever loves these things. I let him chew them down to about 5-6" and then I take them away because he likes to swallow them. One time when he swallowed one it came out as one long rubber-like bully stick. I buy these because they are cheap and he seems to enjoy them. The inability to completely digest if swallowed does bother. Please make sure to take them away when they get short if your dog tends to swallow things!

I think 15 servings or so would be more accurate. The tea is good but due to the misleading number of servings it becomes a very expensive purchase.

review/text: This is exceptionally good tea for the price, and it's nice to have a selection.  The first time I bought it, it came with Bi Luo Chun (or China Green as it says in the description), and it was one of my favorites.  However the last time, when I ran out and reordered, it was replaced with Genmaicha, which isn't very good in my opinion.  I'd much rather have the Bi Luo Chun and I hope they switch back, but this still deserves 5 stars.

review/text: I ordered this and the organic white tea sampler and am very pleased with both. I like pretty much every kind of tea, but green is generally my favourite and white my least favourite. Surprisingly, I like the white even better than the green. That is not taking anything away from the green tea sampler - it is very good. I think the Organic Green Paradise is my favourite, but they're all very good. I'll probably try the Flavoured Organic Green Tea Sampler next time I need green tea & plan to try all of Heavenly's teas as they look to be the best organic loose leaf teas on Amazon.

review/text: I was disapointed in the lack of italian flavor, very bland. Not enough italian seasoning.<br /><br />Years ago I purchased a Breaded Veal Cutlet Pattie from Sam's Club but they have since discontinued it.<br /><br />I'm hoping someone can send me in the right diection to find this item. As I remember the patties came in a plastic wrapper much like a loaf of bread/bagles and contianed about 12 pieces. I believe the wrapper had the colors of the Italian flag, red, white and green, and/or maybe even had a small Italian flag on the wrapper. I just can't remember the name of them.<br /><br />The Omaha ones, even though the patties looked very much like the ones I am trying to find just did'nt do it for me.<br /><br />Can anyone help me find the ones described above???

review/summary: Very good product, packaging a bit off
review/text: I decided to give this and a couple other products a try.  I am glad I did, the breading on these patties is lightly but nicely spiced, not too thick at all.  The quality of veal is good as well, I've had better I suppose but I've had much, much worse as well.  I thawed a couple of them out overnight in my fridge, then pan fried them in olive oil, albeit for a bit longer then they suggested on the box on each side and they came out fine, not greasy at all.  I may try another reviewer's suggestion of baking them after browning for a few minutes next time with grated cheese on top, I do have most of them left.<br /><br />I'm deducting one star due to the somewhat poor packaging.  They didn't come thawed out at all, Omaha steaks ships in a good sized styrofoam cooler with dry ice on the bottom so that isn't an issue.  But the 8 patties didn't fit well in the box, it was taped shut but even with that, the top of the lid was bulging out.  If it wasn't for the fact that the patties themselves are also in a zip-loc bag, they would have spilled out into the shipping cooler/box.  Maybe I'm being harsh since although they didn't fit in their box, they were also in a ziploc bag and they were still frozen and ignoring this shipped well, but for me it was a bit annoying.<br /><br />I also managed to avoid their shipping costs via placing an order above $75.00, I also ordered a few other items at the same time, just enough to get above their minimum for free shipping.  When I fix those I'll post reviews as well.

It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Wish I could give 0 stars.
review/text: You know, I feel so guilty that I had been feeding this crap to my dog for 3+ years and I admit the only reason I did was because I didn't know any better and it was affordable. Why did I not put 2 and 2 together when he stared getting very dry, flaky skin, itchy paws, hot spots, red crusty sores and on top of all that - ear infections? When I started learning about the ingredients in dog food it really opened up my eyes. This food is a sham. They want you to believe it's chock full of beef and vegetables but it's not - it is full of corn (which is a an allergen), flours, fillers, artificial ingredients, fats and sugar with a little bit of beef and veg thrown in at the end. No wonder my dog was having so many problems with his health! I have since switched to higher quality foods with chicken, lamb or fish meal as it's first ingredient. I highly recommend these brands if you want your dog to thrive on healthy whole foods full of nutrients and flavor: California Natural, Innova, Canidae (the old formula), Merrick and Wellness Core. See http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/ to research all brands of dog food.

review/summary: Healthy as a box of chocolates for your dog.
review/text: You would think such a large brand should be trusted; that they made money by making a healthy product for dogs. Well, let me not even say what effects this dog food had on my dog--let me just show the beginning of the ingredients list from the [...] website as of the date of this review (Check there yourself if you don't trust me):<br /><br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol<br /><br />Corn and corn gluten and rice flour are not exactly wonderful, but--SUGAR and SORBITOL! Sorbitol, that nasty stuff in gum that gives people gas and loose stools! Can you wonder why your dog stinks up the house if it's eating this crap? And sugar! Need I even say why that is bad, or what health problems that can lead to? My vet sure got on a soapbox over the dangers of sugar, and rightly so. And even the "healthy weight" stuff has sugar and sorbitol in it!<br /><br />Don't buy Beneful for your dog. Pay careful attention to the entire ingredients list of the dog food you DO buy, as a lot of brands sure don't think you care about whether your dog lives many years or has expensive vet bills as long as it scarfs down their corner-cutting product. And if you must buy Beneful, at least send the company a few angry letters telling them to take the sugar and fake sweeteners out so you no longer have to feel you're killing your dog. I mean, come on, they could use apple juice if they wanted a sweetener. This is incredibly unhealthy and reprehensible, if you ask me. I sure won't buy this dog food ever again, and I would think twice before trusting Purina.

review/summary: not going to kill your dog but definitely not healthy
review/text: I fed Beneful to my last dog for 13 years and he lived to be almost 14 years old so it obviously isn't going to kill your dog.  But my current dog has really bad skin allergies and the vet said to try switching food first. That was the first time I looked at the ingredients in Beneful and was shocked! Corn is the first ingredient? That's ridiculous. If you can't afford a better food with less junk in it, this food will suffice. But definitely if your dog is prone to allergies like mine don't feed them this food. It isn't healthy at all. Personally, I'm finding it costs just about the same to make my own dog food with natural ingredients and real meat.

review/summary: Avoid at all costs!
review/text: I too have guilt about having fed this to my dogs for so long.  My dogs had been gassy (almost perpetually, it seemed), and I wrote it off to just something dogs did.  Then, one of my dogs (I have 2 beagles) became sick (unrelated to the food) and we had to switch foods, and wound up just going and switching for both.  It didn't dawn on me until a few weeks later that my dogs were no longer gassy (and we all breathe much easier!).  I doubt very seriously that this is coincidence since they both had the problem and now they don't.<br /><br />My advice is to avoid this stuff like the plague!

review/summary: Great, albeit slight, tasting tea.
review/text: I have been looking for a good loose genmaicha since I last visited Japan in 2008.  I had to finally give up and look for bags.  This product is great!  The nylon bags and fresh tasting tea do the trick!  You can even do the faux pas two steeps before trashing with a little flavor still coming out!  Even with water normally too hot for green teas, the result is a smooth, low tannin flavor.  There are a few downfalls, however...<br /><br />Although each tin has a generous amount of tea bags, there is NO air tight seal.  You rely on whatever reduction in air exchange through the tight fitting aluminum lid.  Once you open this 60-bag pack, therefore, try to drink it quickly.  If you drink a lot of tea, this may not be a problem.  Oxygen in the air catalyzes rapid degradation!<br /><br />That being said, the tea, so far, is still wonderful after a couple month of usage (down to 1 tin!).<br /><br />Another issue, I like my tea to have a little stronger flavor than these bags allow.  It may be a product of the amount of tea in the bags, but even steeping in boiling water for over 10 minutes does not extract a ton of flavor.  If you're looking for a VERY light tea, this will not be a problem for you.<br /><br />I've adjusted my drink schedule and switched to my strongly caffeinated, stoutly flavored coffee for workday mornings and this delightfully light tea for weekends.<br /><br />In summary, this tea is quite fresh and tasty with almost no bitter tannin flavor, though comes with no airtight seals and brews a little weak for me.  A great buy if you consume a lot of tea, or have two friends who would benefit from your generosity.

review/summary: Very good tea - would buy again
review/text: This tea is one of the better commercially available Genmaicha teas I have found.  (The Yamamotoyama Genmaicha is also very good, maybe slightly better than this one.)  The flavor of the toasted rice complements the green tea very well.  The quality of these teas is quite high -- they would be surpassed by the green teas from specialty importers like Amazing-green-tea dot com, or Japanese specialty importers, but those teas are quite a bit more expensive, too.<br /><br />Overall they are worth the price and I plan to order both this tea and the Yamamotoyama Genmaicha again.

review/summary: I'd fight a thousand Sumo wrestlers for this tea...okay, maybe not, but its damn good.
review/text: This tea is a party in your mouth! I've really enjoyed it! The combination is amazing, makes me think of what an Asian tea should taste like. The tea bags are kinda cool;  you can see the "popped rice." I've shared it w friends, and their now fans as well. :)
