review/summary: An Alternative To Fresca!

review/summary: lemon lime twist zevia
review/text: lemon lime twist and all zevia sodas are great and a  healthier option to regular and diet sodas.  They don't have all the sugar of  regular soda and the harmful chemicals of the diet sodas.  A Dr I work with stated she normally eats healthy but she stated she has a soda addiction and she is worried it's going to  harm her bones.  I had a zevia mountain dew with me that night and asked if she likes mountain dew, she stated that's her favorite so I gave it to her, she looked at the ingredients and was thrilled with what was and wasn't in it.  She stated she thinks she could definitely get used to this, and not hurt her bones.  Amazon shipped it quickly, great product.

review/summary: DISGUSTING!
review/text: OK, let me start out by saying I'm extremely biased when it comes to sodas. I grew up with all the delicious teeth-rotting HFCS sodas such as Coke, Dr. Pepper, 7Up, Mountain Dew, and Fanta. And I'm allergic to Aspartame, so artificial sweeteners and I don't usually get along. But I have tried some Stevia-based products before and they weren't too bad, so I thought maybe this would be OK.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. This stuff is now on my list of "Worst Sodas I've Ever Tasted", right up there with Russian malt soda and that disgusting No-Cal junk. I had expected a little better than this, but should've known better. If anyone ever comes out with a better Stevia-based soda, let me know. I'm willing to give anything a try at least once.

review/summary: From a recovering Diet Mountain Dew addict
review/text: Last year, I was drinking probably two 24 packs of Diet Mountain Dew a week. I thought this was rather unhealthy (and expensive), so I decided to gradually taper off. I had decided to steer clear of all types of pop, but while at Sunflower Market, I noticed Zevia. I liked that it was sweetened with stevia, rather than something a little more artificial. I allow myself a maximum of one Mountain Zevia a day, if that. It has helped me rid myself of a pretty bad DMD addiction.

review/summary: Delicious and refreshing, however expensive
review/text: I love this soda. Absolutely delicious. I used to be addicted to diet sodas, but after reading that sucralose (i.e. splenda) acts as a pesticide in your body (killing crucial intestinal flora) and that aspartame is made up of a main ingredient in paint thinner (methanol), I knew a change was necessary. Zevia was the exact crutch I needed to make it through. Incredibly, when I try other sodas now, it makes me sick and burns my throat. I would have given this product 5 stars, but the price recently went up, and it is not cost effective for most people to switch from cheaper sodas.

review/summary: Pretty Good, But Better Mixed With Juice
review/text: I bought this soda because I was looking for an alternative for soda with high fructose corn syrup and also because my husband recently found out that he's diabetic and can't have the real stuff anymore.  I wasn't that impressed with it at first taste, but I would say that the taste is comparable to a store brand of regular lemon lime soda.  This soda is really good when you mix it with juice.  I add a little bit of cranberry juice and the result is kind of like a wine cooler without the alcohol.  I will definitely buy this soda again.

review/text: I really wanted to like this! I love Stevia in it's natural form. I do not use the Stevia based products, just straight up Stevia. I have also not tried any of the other Zevia products. This was a first, but I couldn't get through the first can and my husband didn't get beyond a sip.<br /><br />It has a very strong aftertaste. Bitter almost.. I tried masking it by adding other things to it but it just didn't work. I would loved to have found a pre-made Stevia sweetened beverage, I love stevia... but not this. Sorry.<br /><br />I will stick with making my own using Stevia, crystallized citrus juice and water. Tastes good to my taste buds and no bitter aftertaste.

review/text: I found Lemon Lime Zevia undrinkable.  I love Mt. Dew, Sprite & Squirt but this certainly isn't like any of them.  It has way too much of a strong artificial citrus flavor -- it should probably be diluted to 1/10 of its current strength.<br /><br />I like the Zevia Cola and Root Beer flavors but this is definitely not in the same league.  Same goes for the Mountain Zevia.  I'll be throwing the remainder of the 6-pack in the trash.

But, if your looking to drink healthier, its worth the adjustment.  I gave up soda 10 years ago, and i wont drink artificial sweetener soda.

review/text: I used to drink diet sodas constantly until I got sick and wasn't able to handle the artificial sweeteners.  I am absolutely thrilled that I can enjoy a zero calorie soda that's actually good for me.  I've been drinking beverages sweetened with stevia for several years now so I found the taste of the Zevia to be very enjoyable.  There was absolutely no after taste with the Zevia flavors I've tried and they are just as refreshing to drink as traditional sodas without any of the bad stuff! I cannot wait to try more of the flavors but the ones I've tried are very similar to their traditional soda flavors.

review/summary: Chemical-free Diet Soda + Free Shipping Make for a Winner
review/text: I recently found out about Zevia through a friend but have had trouble finding it outside of health food stores, which aren't that easy to come by in my neck of the woods. I wouldn't have guessed to look for soda on Amazon, but the Zevia website pointed out it was for sale here, and when I found out about the free shipping, I ordered it on the spot.<br /><br />At just over a dollar a can, it's a tad pricey compared to other diet sodas, but that's to be expected for a specialty drink. The price here at Amazon is comparable to the prices I saw at the health stores, especially if you sign up for the subscription delivery which discounts things 15% at the time of this review. Also since you're not paying for shipping, I think it ends up being a good deal, especially considering the limited availability of the drink across the country.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I've tried several of the flavors and like the lemon lime the best. If you're a Mt. Dew or 7-up fan, this is a similar style of drink. I do recommend that you try a can somewhere before ordering a 24-pack. If you at one time switched from regular soda to diet soda, you may remember that period of "getting used to it." I don't think it's as much of a stretch to switch from aspartame-sweetened diet soda to this, but I didn't love it at first taste.<br /><br />In regards to other flavors, I thought the orange and Dr. Zevia were okay. I wasn't a fan of the ginger ale at all, but that may just be because it uses real ginger (and tastes like it), unlike the watered down fake stuff I'm used to. I haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend Zevia to anyone who's trying to avoid high calorie beverages as well as artificial sweeteners.

review/text: OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness. Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my "go to" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/summary: Great Base Sauce (and Low in Sugar!)
review/text: I'm going to sound very old when I say this, but Classico Pasta Sauce has been my jarred pasta sauce of choice for 20 years.  It's not really that I'm old, just that I stick with what I like once I've found it, and though I've tried other sauces, I always always always come back to Classico.<br /><br />First of all, Classico's sauces are all very low in sugar.  Remember how Atkins and South Beach had everyone reading labels and forgoing ketchup and vinaigrette because of "hidden" sugars?  I'm not sure if Classico was ever Atkins-approved, but it is one of the national brands with the lowest sugar content.  In other words, if you like sweet tomato sauce, you might not like this one, but if you're trying to eat low on the glycemic index, look no further.  I really love the savory quality of Classico's sauces, which let the acidity of the tomato and bright punch of the basil, fruity olive oil and other pungent herbs shine.<br /><br />Of all Classico's pasta sauces, this is the ideal one for "semi-homemade" type dishes, where other ingredients share the spotlight.  For a straight pasta dish, I like adding sauteed garlic (don't let it burn!), crushed red pepper, and chopped kalamata olives, heating them through in the sauce, then adding the almost-cooked pasta and letting it finish cooking in the sauce.  If I'm feeling fancy, I'll saute my garlic in the oil from some pancetta I've rendered at the start, then sprinkle the finished, plated dish with the crispy pancetta bits.  Because Classico's sauces are a little on the thin side, they're perfect for finishing pasta; basically just undercook your pasta by a minute or two, then strain it and add it to the saucepan you've used to warm the Classico, letting the pasta absorb some of the sauce (instead of just the cooking water) to finish softening to al dente.<br /><br />I've given Tomato Basil "only" a four star review because, as much as I enjoy it, I agree with another reviewer who noted that their Four Cheese pasta sauce is really divine.  Tomato and Basil is a great basic, starter sauce, but Four Cheese is spoon-from-the-jar good.  (Don't judge me!)  I'm also very partial to their Florentine flavor, and the newer Carmelized Onion one as well, though I can't say I've tried a bad flavor yet.  Highly, deliciously, completely recommended.

review/summary: Good, but Classico makes an even better sauce than this!
review/text: As a vegetarian, I find it a challenge to find jarred sauces that have great flavor on their own because I won't be relying on ground beef or chicken at home to add more flavor.  I need them to taste like real vegetables because that's what I want them to be made of!  I've used this Classico tomato and basil sauce for years, and have always been fairly satisfied with it.<br /><br />But, I just discovered Classico makes an even better sauce that is organic!  It's the Classico Organic Tomato, Herbs, and Spices sauce, and it is amazing.  Minimal sugar, so it's not too sweet.  I sampled it at a chain warehouse store and immediately bought the 3-pack of jars.  I recommend trying it if it's sold near you!

review/summary: Great for a jarred sauce
review/text: I really prefer homemade sauces and usually it doesn't take much time to make a simple sauce from scratch if I use canned tomatoes to start with. It's not always an option though. My husband lived in Italy for a few years and can be very picky about tomato sauces as well so finding good convenient ones is a little trickier.<br />The first thing I look for in a jarred sauce is that it's not too sweet. A lot of jarred sauces suffer from too much sugar so you can't taste all the flavors of the sauce itself, much less what you put it on. So I look for ingredients similar to what I'd use. This sauce is made from tomato puree, diced tomatoes, onions, salt, basil, garlic, olive oil and other seasonings in trace amounts. Pretty close to what I put into mine except I'm also nuts for oregano. There are nice sized chunks of tomatoes in the sauce and it's liquid enough. The flavor is good, the garlic and onions aren't overpowering and it doesn't have that off taste that some sauces can have. It does taste pretty fresh.<br />It's great for quick meals. Poured over chicken breasts and topped with cheese, or baking fresh ravioli in it are two of the meals my family makes when I can't cook. We always keep a couple jars on hand for that reason. It also makes a decent pizza sauce when my daughter wants quick pizzas.

review/text: I grew up in the area this wine is from. You drink it young, when there's still bubbles in the bottle. 2010 is left over stock that was shipped to the USA in a cynical nod that Americans don't know any better. Unfortunately, the exporters are right much of the time.<br /><br />Basically you can't buy a fresh Santa Margherita in the USA. As with their cheeses, oils and many other food products, the USA is a dumping ground for Europe's out-of-date food inventory.

review/summary: Best cat food for multiple fat cats
review/text: We have 3 cats. They start at 10 pounds. After some crazy vet bills and a good scare, the oldest was put on prescription weight loss food. Which means they all were. A year later, they had all gained weight. Apparently it's delicious and they over ate.<br />We needed to change that. So we had given them the total canin wet food and they liked it, so with our vet's permission, we moved them on to it. They like it, but they are not over eating or gaining weight. That its exactly what I needed. And now I can have it delivered in 2 days! If only I could subscribe and it was Cheaper!

review/summary: Best food for my cats so far.
review/text: I have two cats, one was a tad over the recommended weight, the other one a lot.  The heavier one was also very lazy, never playing much and mostly sitting around watching the world go by.  After many, many attempts of different foods (including super expensive stuff from the vet) and feeding times, I ran across this food.  Within two weeks, the large cat started to chase things and play around, and after about two months, she had lost enough weight that we could tell just by looking at her.  Both cats really like it, and I have to say that since we started using it, I can't remember what hairballs even are, a nice side effect.  This stuff is not cheap, but if your cats are a little bit on the chubby or lazy side, you should definitely give this a try for a month or so.

review/summary: Great food-- my cat actually lost weight!
review/text: This food is something we have been looking for a long time. Our 12 year old tabby has been overweight since her adoption into the family 10 years ago.  No matter what amount of dieting she did she never could lose weight.<br /><br />In her first month eating this food she lost 8 ounces. People may laugh at measuring weight loss in ounces but when you only weigh 12 pounds that is a high amount of your body mass.<br /><br />Some advice-- this food is rich.  Use a blend to introduce the food slowly-- gradually working up to the recommended amount with none of the old food mixed in. The people at the pet store highly recommended this brand and I think it is a great product!<br /><br />We are almost a year in-- we tried to go back to the "cheaper" food but noticed that the cat was way hungrier-- the Royal Canin keeps her full like the other popular brands cant!  So yes, it is more expensive but is it worth it not to have your cat wake you up at 5 a.m. for breakfast!?

review/summary: no hairballs here
review/text: I have a short hair tiger cat, and rotate this royal canin cat food with earthborn holistics grain free dry food. I switched to earthborn when she had hairballs using the science diet, for the staff at a pet food store said that would help. But I also needed a lower calorie count as the vet said she was slightly overweight, thus the half and half. I used the RC 27 indoor cat formula first, but my cat begged for food constantly on that one, so I just used it until her weight was close to perfect, then went to the combination of earthborn/rc 40, as long as she is more active and outside quite a bit and can burn off the higher calorie earthborn. I do brush my cat every couple of days.

review/summary: Fabulous pasta -- and HEALTHY too (!).
review/text: This isn't just healthy pasta (although it is that). It's delicious!!! My husband, who totally hates whole-wheat pasta (he'll eat whole-wheat bread, if pushed against the wall, but absolutely holds out against whole-wheat pasta) adores this. He prefers it to any other pasta. Now, if it's out of stock at the store, he grumbles and won't buy his old favorite brands as a substitute. I love that it tastes so good that we can serve a healthy pasta dinner for unsuspecting company without anyone asking what on earth we did to the food. We're thrilled to see that it will soon be available on Amazon so we can stock up!<br /><br />This thin spaghetti is actually my favorite -- works for both spaghetti and angel hair dishes, and has a light taste and texture that fools non-health-foodies into thinking they're having unusually good ordinary pasta.

review/text: I buy this pasta by the case now since it is so convenient at Amazon.  Better than waiting for sales at my local supermarket.  I buy the brown rice pasta as well, but I'm going to stick to the Barilla Plus which is more economical. You are getting whole grain but you are also getting additional fiber, protein and the big bonus of Omega 3 fats which is a real plus.  Of all the various whole grain & multigrain pastas I've tried, Barilla Plus tastes the best.  My kids & hubby have no complaints and that's what really counts.

review/summary: Great product, Incredible value!!!
review/text: I was doing some research to find the healthiest pasta because my family eats a lot, as well as the best price. I got in on a deal that made this about $1.50 per box. This almost never goes on sale at my local waldbaums and when it does its $2.50 per box!<br /><br />Not only did I research various websites for healthiest whole wheat pasta, I compared Barilla to Ronzoni, and the decision is a landslide. Barilla takes the cake!!<br /><br />A healthy tip, instead of melting butter on the pasta but about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil on the pasta, after it is cooked and drained, for the same great taste without the cholesterol and fat contents of butter.<br /><br />This product is fantastic, I cannot say that enough.<br /><br />The only con is delivery, it arrives fast yes, but the handling of the box caused the 4 boxes (one on each corner) to rip a little on the top, due to the handler not being gentle. But that wasnt such a big deal for me, as I did not lose any product and simply used those boxes first.

These husks are both larger and cleaner than other brands that I have tried.  They really made what can be a labor intensive cooking project a bit easier.  These large husks fill nicely and take less time to use since you don't have to clean a lot of silk out of the husks.  I'll buy these again and again.

review/summary: Best Taste Overall (but still strange)
review/text: This has a unique, three-part seasonings process. One is shrimp and little dehydrated red pepper (not spicy mind you, but red bell I am pretty sure), then a powdered one that smells like cumin but tastes heavily of garlic and then a liquid one, which I am pretty sure is just plain old sesame oil, great for asian flavor.<br /><br />Now - this comes out tasting like just about the worst item from the worst seafood restaurant or Italian restaurant in town...which, for Ramen, is remarkable.<br /><br />The thing is, it tastes quite - Italian. It has oregano I am pretty sure, or some other green herb in there that lends it a very Italian-oil-pasta-and-herb flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I will buy this again (WM is cheaper than here even, I almost want to say "by far"...around 75 or 88c per if I recall correctly), but will almost definitely cut back on the dry seasonings packet. It's slightly overpowering in flavor and (are you surprised) saltiness.<br /><br />Excellent effort and uniquely tasty, just needs spice adjustments (downward!)

review/text: I tried this for the first time and I really like it! I love poppy seeds and almost anything with poppy seeds! I was looking for something with real ingredients that did not have preservatives and artificial ingredients and was pleasantly surprised. This is such a rich and thick, creamy texture. There was a sticker on the bottle that said "Tastes great on fresh peaches." Now, I did try it on fresh peaches but it definitely had to be an acquired taste, meaning I was not too cray about it. BUT .... as for a dressing on salad ... DELICIOUS! I just find it to be a little too rich for me (Hence the 4 stars). I want something that is a little lighter in the thickness and texture otherwise the flavor was delicious. It has a sweet, yet slightly sour flavor to it ... Although it was poppy seeds, I found the poppy seed flavor I was looking for was not quite strong enough for me (who knows what poppy seed flavor is) but I wanted a stronger poppy like flavor and less of the thickness from the dressing and sweet flavor. I was looking for more savory. I would definitely say try it because it is has great ingredients and is very yummy but, I personally just needed more flavor without the rich thickness of the dressing and sweetness.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored "cake". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have. One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.

review/text: My vet recommended Dentahex Chews for our two poodles. That was three years ago and we have never looked back.  I order the petite size. One piece can be broke in half and is enough for each to enjoy. They seem to be content as they chew on their daily treat and both have nice white teeth.

review/summary: Perfect for Queen Mum's cocktail
review/text: I happen to enjoy London Dry gin. Usually I drink a dry martini but I'll sometimes drink a salty dog or, as Douglas Adams once wrote, a Jinnon Tonnik. (42 to those in the know). A Salty dog uses grapefruit juice as a mixer, and it really brings out the juniper flavor of gin without competing with it.<br /><br />I bought these bitters because I had read an online recipe for "The Queen Mum's" cocktail of gin and duBonnet. Several ratios were mentioned but in the ratio I liked best, the recipe recommended a few dashes of these bitters.<br /><br />I have to agree with the advise. These bitters bring out the juniper flavor without competing. I haven't tried them with a dry martini and probably never will, but for the Queen Mum's cocktail they were just the thing! I guess they might work with a Salty dog, too, but as there's already grapefruit mixer in that one, I'm not in a hurry to find out.<br /><br />These are like a concentrated grapefruit flavor without the tanginess. More flavor, not more citric acid, and a little bit of something else I can't quite place. Not for every liquor, but for gin, I'd heartily recommend these!

review/summary: Worst $12 I Ever Spent
review/text: "The bold citrus taste of glycerin combines with the artificial flavors to create a uniquely disgusting cocktail ingredient."<br /><br />Excuse my sarcasm, but this is one of the most disappointing bar purchases I've ever made. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the ingredients until after I purchased the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture. Silly enough, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Fruit Roll Ups: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors.<br /><br />These bitters taste awful. There's a slight grapefruit flavor behind the awful, overpowering lime (as in limestone, not key lime) flavor. If you want grapefruit flavor in your drinks, this isn't the bitters for you. You should really just buy a bag of grapefruits and spritz a small amount of juice into your drink. I've used this in a couple of drinks, and each turned out poorly. I thought it might give my Negroni a nice additional grapefruit boost, but all it did was poison the drink. It tasted chemically and sour. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!

review/summary: A delicious 'tonic-like' tea
review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

review/text: One member in my family was in need of a gluten free BBQ sauce and we could not find one in any of our local grocery stores and then we found the Bone Suckin' sauce. Now we have re-orderd I don't even know how many times and I feed it to the whole family (I know it's spendy but really, it's worth it). The flavor is just delicious, tangy with little bits of onion. It's literally as though I took the time to make a totally homemade BBQ sauce! We were extremely pleased to find that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup, which again, in your typical grocery store every bottle on the shelf contains. I just tried this thicker version for the first time and it's fantastic, just like the thinner. Both are perfect for cooking and dipping. If you want something primarily for dipping, I'd recomend this thicker version :)

review/summary: Rudy Greens Beefy Rice ROCKS!!
review/text: When we introduced Beefy Rice to our three "kids," Sturgis-the-Wonder-Peke, Bobette (aka Alien-Love-Child), and Ellie Mae Dobby Diana (our little rescue mix), the response was overwhelmingly over-the-top HAPPY!!  They've always been pretty much tolerant of their dry food, no one seemed to be doing the happy dance prior to meal-time.  Well, except for EMDD, who spent her first year being horribly neglected.  She does the happy dance for just about anything now that her life has turned around.  Anyway, the first time I put just a small spoonful of RGDC's Beefy Rice over their dry food, our trio made it perfectly clear that this was absolutely the BEST food they've ever had, even better than the Pork & Pasta that they loved!  Noses buried in their bowls, tails wagging while they ate, and not a drop or morsel left behind!!  Now, I am notified early every morning by Sturgis that it's time to get up and make breakfast.  And in the afternoon, he does the same thing.  EMDD makes us dizzy with her spinning "I'm-so-happy" dance.  And Bobette simply hops around (which, for her very low-key self is almost as strenuous as kick-boxing).  Meals vanish in record time!  Bravo to RGDC for bringing "delicious" back to dog bowls!!

review/text: Ok, we get it, not everyone loves SPAM. Yeah, it's meat...in a can.<br /><br />But you can do many things with this delicious treat. Like others have mentioned, SPAM Musubi is great "sushi" treat popular in Hawaii. Rice, Nori (Seaweed) and some slightly cooked, thinly slice Spam makes a great Lunch or Dinner. Problem is, when you use a whole can of SPAM, you usually can get 8, maybe 9 slices out of it. So if you don't plan on making Lunch/Dinner for 3 or so people, you end up with extra SPAM you either have to eat right away (within a few days) or it goes to waste.<br /><br />But these are terrific! You can take one out, fry it up, and your done! Can't believe I didn't think of getting these earlier. Personally, I love sliced up Spam on rice with a little Furikake on it.

This single-size portion of original flavor spam is large enough to make 2 "Hawaiian breakfasts" of fried spam, sliced warmed/fried pineapple and a croissant.  And it is a good thickness to make spam musubi, a sushi roll made with spam, rice and seaweed that is often offered in Hawaii as a grab-and-go meal.  Hmm, I see a spam sandwich for lunch today after all this spam talk.

I hate having an open whole can in the fridge -- for one, it's unpleasant for me, and two, it just means that to try to finish it he'll eat more as soon as possible, which is hardly good for him (or he'll eat the whole can right from the start --ditto!).<br /><br />But these single serving packs are a godsend.<br /><br />Yes, one is exactly the right size for a sandwich.  So what if I hate it that he takes 2 to work?  That's better than a whole can's worth, right?  And it IS great emergency food (for him, I mean -- I can't imagine how hungry I'd have to be to eat this, even if the power were out, but then again he can't stand my emergency pouches of white meat tuna in water, so we're even!).<br /><br />I don't care that the packaging is wasteful, I don't care that it costs more -- this product is terrific, solving different problems for both of us!  We're happy to have a case in the house, now almost empty, and we'll be ordering more.  For the SPAM lover in your life, this is a good solution for both of you!

review/text: Backpackers on the trail will find Spam singles are most convenient to pack and carry, and are also delicious to eat!  Buying Spam in quantity just makes sense!<br />Pete also uses it in the morning at home - and egg and Spam sandwich hits the spot!

review/summary: Spam Singles Great
review/text: These Are great.  .. We like that that we don't have to open a whole can for one sandwich.  They also fry up real well, for a fried spam and cheese sandwich.. I know not healthy but sure is good :).<br /><br />Expiration Dates are far out ..The ones we received a month or more ago expires oct 2014, so you don't have to worry about having to eat all 24 in a few months.  Nice staple to keep in the pantry for a quick sandwich.

review/text: Todays SPAM is not the SPAM of years ago.  The taste more mellowed out and very flavorful.  Check the nutrition info.<br /><br />If you use Amazon Prime and subscribe 'n save, the price is cheaper per oz than by the can at the grocery store.<br /><br />Use it for a quick sandwich, or add to a pasta salad.<br />Just the right size to fry up and make a spam n veggie frittata.<br />Take it on hikes or backpacking, or keep some in you 72hr pack instead of so many granola bars and jerky.<br /><br />Can millions of Pacific Islanders be wrong?

review/summary: Meat Candy!
review/text: This is the most convenient way yet to enjoy SPAM!<br />Simply slide one in your pocket on your way out of the house and enjoy anytime.<br />All you have to do is tear off the top and you can eat it like a candy bar.<br />Great for a snack in public!<br />Simply squeeze gently at the bottom and the delicious meat slides out the top for your immediate enjoyment.<br />It's also conveniently sized to fit an english muffin, toast or bagel. Make your own breakfast sandwiches and get rich faster!

review/text: SPAM Single Classic is a good buy.  The single part is definitely better when you're on the go.  I just wish amazon.com had the SPAM Single Lite.  These are a little too fatty and salty.
