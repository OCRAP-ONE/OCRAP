review/text: I could eat this with everything!  It is really good with eggs, or anything else you usually eat salsa with.  I read one review that said it was the best jarred salsa, but this is better than most of the salsa we get when we go out.  The only one that comes close is the chipotle one at Izzos.  They sell it at Albertsons, and Whole Foods, but it's neat to be able to buy it off Amazon and get it delivered to your door!!!

review/summary: Fantastic salsa
review/text: I first saw this salsa in a grocery store in Southern California. The regular price was a bit high, but it was on sale so I picked up a jar. I took it to a friend's where we sat around eating chips and salsa and drinking beer while playing cards. The salsa did not last long. Everyone agreed it was the best jarred salsa they'd ever had. I bought many more jars at the store, on sale and at regular price, and eventually started buying cases direct from the manufacturer.<br /><br />When I moved to Florida I was disappointed that I couldn't find the Arriba! Chipotle salsa in any local stores. Shipping costs made buying direct cost prohibitive. I went a long time without my favorite salsa. I was thrilled when I found it available through Amazon at a reasonable price and eligible for the free super saver shipping.<br /><br />I'm surprised about some of the comments concerning the taste of this salsa. The reviewer who found it truly wretched either got a jar that had gone bad or has a very different sense of taste than most of the rest of us. (There are several very popular food items I absolutely can't stand, so I can relate if it's the latter.) The comment from another reviewer about the salsa having a "unique" smell and taste at room temperature is interesting. This is one of the only salsas I've ever had that I actually prefer at room temperature.<br /><br />This salsa has a flavor that's far more complex than most jarred salsas. The fire roasting of the ingredients combined with the wonderful smokiness of the chipotles brings dimensions that few other salsas can match. I still have a couple recipes for home made salsa that I think are better, but this is the best commercially jarred salsa I've ever had.<br /><br />Update -- I have to slightly amend my review. Amazon used to sell this salsa direct at a very attractive price. Unfortunately, it's now available only through a marketplace vendor at a totally ridiculous price. You can order it at the manufacturer's web site for about half what this vendor wants.  It's still fantastic salsa, but at the marketplace price I'd suggest moving along to something else.

review/summary: best jarred salsa, period.
review/text: I have eaten gallons of crappy salsa, from Taco Bell to supposed "gourmet" salsas (Newman's Own comes to mind). Arriba salsa (in partcular this Chipotle salsa) is by and far the best jarred salsa on the market. I have even presented it to my Mexican friends (I lived in Mexico for 4 years, so yes I know 'real' Mexicans) and even they were impressed. One of the reviewers complained about this salsa tasting bad - chill the salsa first. at room temperature it 'does' have a "unique" smell and taste, but chill it and WOW. I can find it in my local grocery store for almost $6 per jar (yikes), so this 3 for under $12 price is fantastic to me. Can't lose with this salsa, really.<br /><br />I have also tried the fire roasted (not chipotle) salsa, and it says "Hot" and it is just that, almost too much so for me. I have not tried their black beam stuff, or advocado dips, etc., but if they are like the regular salsas then they should be good to go, too.

review/text: I couldn't find this salsa at my local supermarkets so I was really happy that Amazon sold it!  Most commercial salsas taste overwhelmingly of tomato so eating them is like eating ketchup.  This salsa is rich & flavorful.  I use it on practically everything - eggs, baked potatoes, burgers, etc.  Also, don't be fooled by "Medium" - it packs a kick and I am no stranger to spicy food!

review/summary: CROWD FAVORITE!  Yum. Recipe for mex rice below...
review/text: I'm typically a salsa snob who prefers my own recipes for roasted salsas over ANY bottled product, but this is a GREAT substitute! I have even gotten great reviews from my dinner guests, time after time. We also love the Roasted Red (medium hot is preferred, though my young daughters love the "mild" which is excellent for kids). If you like restaurant-quality "mexican rice", here's an easy recipe: using your regular rice recipe, simply reduce the called-for-amount of water/broth by 1/4 cup and add 1 cup of this salsa for each cup of rice you're cooking. I use a slightly different procedure, frying the rice in a bit of oil and then adding the salsa to sear for a minute first before adding the water/chicken broth, but just adding it with the water is MUCH easier. Can't speak highly enough about this brand.

review/text: Unquestionably the worst salsa I have ever tried.  Bad doesn't even begin to explain this salsa.  I can stomach bad salsa, though I may not enjoy it.  This salsa literally triggers a gag reflex as I try to eat it.  I tried one or two bites on three separate occasions and have decided to throw out the rest.<br /><br />Maybe the shipping wasn't kind to my salsa, I can't say.  I suspect that one or more of the ingredients is rancid in the salsa I received.  Either way, I will not be buying this brand again.

I was not disappointed in the cereal at all.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of sugary cereal so this cereal hit the right spot with it's subtle sweet taste with a hint of cinnamon. The cereal squares are crunchy out of the box but I let the cereal soak for a few minutes in it's milk to soften them up before eating since I'm not fond of super crunchy cereal. After soften the cereal, the texture of the cereal reminded me of Chex Rice cereal but denser and heartier.<br /><br />My teen likes this cereal enough to eat again but thinks it's not very sweet and felt some squares tasted sweeter than others.  I didn't have the same experience and that may be because I let my cereal soak for a few minutes.<br /><br />I'm planning on substituting this cereal for the Chex cereal I use in a snack that consists of mixing the cereal with melted chocolate and peanut butter.<br /><br />A 14.5 ounce box of Cinnamon Quaker Oatmeal Squares contains 7 - 1 cup servings.<br />Total fat: 2.5g (Saturated 0.5g, Polyunsaturated 1g, Monounsaturated 1g)<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Potassium 200mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 44g (Dietary fiber 5g, Soluble Fiber 2g, Sugars 9g, Other Carbs 30g)<br />Protein: 6g

review/summary: Tasty Contraband Sugar Cereal
review/text: I like this cereal for its taste and sturdy crunch, but as with all cereals, it's imperative to read the side of the box to know what you're eating. Oatmeal, yes. But what makes it taste so good is nine grams of sugar. That's the same amount of sugar per serving as:<br /><br />1. Honey Nut Cheerios<br />2. Rice Krispie Treats cereal<br /><br />...and only two more grams than these classic sugar bombs:<br /><br />1. Frosted Flakes<br />2. Lucky Charms<br /><br />Keep in mind, too, that a "serving" is a measly cup. Make it a cup and a half and you're up to 13.5 grams of sugar. Yikes.<br /><br />For this reason, Quaker Oatmeal Squares is outlawed in our home. It's also incredibly expensive, when you compare it to a canister of real oats: 15 cents for a bowl of Quaker Oats, vs. $1.00 for a bowl of QOS, which lists sugar as five of its top seven ingredients (see list below). Not recommended.<br /><br />Whole Oat Flour<br />Whole Wheat Flour<br />Brown Sugar<br />Sugar<br />Maltodextrin<br />Malted Barley Extract<br />Molasses

review/summary: Unsatisfying. Cinnamon is supposed to be an accent, not the predominant taste
review/text: The box says "crunchy oat cereal with just a hint of CINNAMON", but I would classify it has having a moderate cinnamon taste, which is a reasonable level for this type of product. I would have been disappointed if there was less. The problem is that here cinnamon is the predominant taste -- the underlying squares are quite bland.  In most recipes, cinnamon functions as an accent, and for good reason. Without a base flavor, the impact of the cinnamon is fleeting and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Although the box claims that the cinnamon is "baked into" the squares, a very noticeable amount winds up in the milk and on the side of the bowl (as specks), which is more what I would expect from it being a coating.<br /><br />The squares are definitely crunchy and stand up well to sitting in milk.<br /><br />3-stars = "It's OK" : I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I wouldn't refuse it if someone else served it to me.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares are smaller in size than one would expect, especially in comparison with some other cereals. The dietary information is encouraging as there is fairly low sodium, 190 mg per 1 cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber along with 6 grams of protein.<br /><br />One of the things I first noticed about the cereal was its ability to remain crisp long after some other cereals had given way to sogginess. This is a real plus for my money. The box was 14.5 ounces as advertised and comes in one of those pouches that must be cut with a pair of scissors to open. All told it is a nice alternative to the spoon size shredded wheat and the raisin bran cereal that more frequently winds up on the breakfast menu. Try it, there's a good chance you'll like it.

review/text: Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it. There are too many cereals I like to bother with one I might or might not like, right?<br /><br />My concerns were two-fold. First, would they be sweet enough. I don't need sugar-coated cereal, but I don't want to eat cardboard, either. And second, tight-woven cereals like this tend to suck-up all the milk, so they'll start off too dry, but end up too soggy. Could this cereal overcome those concerns?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The flavor was sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. The squares started-off crunchy, but not too rough, and they did not suck-up the milk like a sponge, so they weren't too soggy at the end, either.<br /><br />I still have other cereals that I like better, but I'll likely occasionally buy this one, too.

review/text: These little Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares are indeed delicious as a snack right out of the box or as a breakfast cereal with milk. In fact, there was almost none left to test with milk since they were eaten out of hand once the box was opened.<br /><br />They are pleasantly sweet without being too sweet and the cinnamon taste is almost understated so I found myself adding some. (I like cinnamon)<br /><br />The squares are a little smaller in size than I anticipated and as has been stated they hold up well and remain crunchy even after milk has been added.

review/summary: Tasty and crunchy
review/text: This is a nice tasty little cereal.  It's good with milk but also makes a tasty snack by itself.  I had some of these in a baggie at an internal work meeting late in the afternoon.  When I crunched down on one, everybody laughed!  They have a light taste, and only slightly sweet.<br /><br />At 210 calories per 8 oz cup without milk, the box lists a nice selection of vitamins, including A, C, E, Folic Acid, calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, Niacin, B6, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc. 200 mg potassium, 0 mg cholesterol, 190 mg sodium, and 44g carbs of which 9g is sugar.  Cins grains and wheat.

review/summary: sweet and cinnamony but too heavy.
review/text: Oatmeal squares (also made with a lot of wheat flour and sugar) are tasty and hold their rather substantial crunch. They also have a nice cinnamon oatmeal flavor with a strong sweet note. So that sounds great, right? Well, they hold their crunch so well that my jaw was tired after chewing through a bowl of them. After a while I felt like I was eating Legos. These hearty pieces are a bit too dense for my taste, so this cereal will not be on my list of favorites.

review/summary: Not bad but is it necessary?
review/text: This cereal tastes good with or without milk, holds up well (keeps its crunch) with milk. The cinnamon flavor is not overpowering and it isn't too sweet. This cereal is pretty much like shredded wheat but made with oats. What the differences are nutritionally between shredded what and this cereal is, perhaps would make a difference as to which you would prefer.<br /><br />It is good, but is it really anything new? 4 starts for taste and crunch.

review/summary: Cruncy, tasty, hearty and healthful
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal makes for a very tasty and satisfying breakfast. Taste is overall very good as is the ability to remain crunchy while drenched in milk. In other words, it doesn't turn soggy that easily which is a very good thing. By the same token, it's not as hard as some granolas so it's easy to eat and digest. I tried this with soy milk -- but I assume the taste experience would be similar with regular milk. I would not hesitate to buy this in the future.<br /><br />There are 210 calories, 46 grams of whole grains and 5 grams of fiber per serving (without the milk/soy milk). So it appears to be a relatively healthy breakfast as well.<br /><br />I also tried the "Hint of Brown Sugar" version at the same time and I prefer this Cinnamon flavor more. I noticed that the "Brown Sugar" version actually is rated a little higher on Amazon, but to me it tasted a little too much like maple syrup which I don't like in cold cereal. So that's why I like this Cinnamon flavor better, which I find just perfect in terms of the amount added.

review/summary: Tasty and crunchy, and not too sweet
review/text: Most breakfast cereals these days are cloyingly sweet.  It is not really just breakfast cereals that suffer from this, for example, try to find unsweetened ice tea in the beverage aisle, it can be difficult.<br /><br />I even find that most artificially sweetened foods, for example, oatmeal, tend to be so overly sweetened; when all I really want is something that just simply has less sugar.<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised to find that these tasty toasty little squares are only lightly sweetened. How refreshing to find something that isn't sickeningly over-sweetened, and that tastes good to boot. The whole family enjoy them, even my youngest who loves to eat sweet treats, he doesn't really miss it.  In fact, it's time to get some more because we have run out.

review/summary: A Great Way for Start Your Day
review/text: This cereal is absolutely delicious. The cereal is very crispy. It is flavored very quite light so that we do not have to eat it with milk. Additionally, this cereal is made of real grain which is very healthy for our health. Even though it is not very sweet, it still gives us enough energy to work and study. This product is very suitable for breakfast, and it will be a great way to start our day.

review/summary: Lots of crunch with a hint of flavor
review/text: When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with "a hint" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that "each square has cinnamon baked into it". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a "better" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a "serving" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast. That is, unless of course, there's donuts or pancakes. But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature. My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation. They are nice and cruncy with just enough cinnamon and sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds. Also, it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes. Definitely recommended.

review/summary: a little plain
review/text: They weren't joking when they said "just a hint of cinnamon;" I could barely discern any cinnamon at all.  This cereal wasn't bad, but it didn't have much flavor of any kind.  For such a plain cereal, Oatmeal Squares seemed a little high in calories especially considering the serving size is on the small side.  For comparison, I looked at another fairly plain cereal, Kix.  Kix has 110 calories with a serving size of 1 1/4 cups;  Oatmeal Squares has 210 calories with a serving size of 1 cup.  On the plus side, Oatmeal Squares held up really well in a bowl full of milk.

review/text: I thought this was a good-tasting, filling cereal.  I am not a fan of very sweet-tasting cereals, so I liked the fact that it was just a touch of cinnamon. I also thought the cereal was pretty filling and generally kept me full until lunch.  The only thing I would change is to make the pieces smaller, as I'm used to Cheerio-sized pieces and these were much larger.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a plain, very slightly sweet breakfast that will keep them going throughout the morning.

So how can it rightfully be called a "Crunchy Oat Cereal".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker, which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.  This is really "Oatmeal and Wheat Squares"<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is.

review/text: I like to eat cereal as a snack, straight out of the box and Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great for that. When I ate them in a bowl with milk, I didn't like them as much. They don't seem to get any softer with milk, unless maybe you let them soak for a while. I like cereal that doesn't get soggy but I want it to soak up at least a little bit of the milk. I also thought that they were sweet enough when I ate them straight out of the box but with milk, I thought they needed to be sweeter so I added sugar.

review/summary: One of the Sturdy Ones
review/text: Seems to me there was a different version of this cereal around some years ago that rather resembled Life. Be that as it may, this cereal in no way resembles Life and requires a bit of a commitment. It's very hearty, holds up superbly in milk, and is only kind of sweet. In short, a bowlful can't be scarfed down like frosted flakes or fruit rings; it demands your attention for the duration. This is good, because one should pay attention to what one eats. It would be nice if there was a little more flavor to devote one's attention to though. There is some, both of oats and cinnamon, but they're rather overwhelmed by the sheer bulk of the pieces. All in all, I'd give them average marks on their own and recommend them as a mixer with other cereals that have a lighter and perhaps sweeter character.

This is a good breakfast cereal that might even make a good snack.

review/summary: Not Too Sweet, Pleny of Whole Grains
review/text: This is a terrific breakfast cereal.  It's made from oats and wheat, and has just a little bit of cinnamon and brown sugar added to make it tasty.  There are a whopping 46g of whole grains per serving, along with 90% of the daily recommended value of iron and quite a few other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I was initially concerned that the texture would be hard and coarse like shredded wheat, but that is not the case.  Instead, I thought the consistency was closer to a chex cereal than shredded wheat, despite the fact that the pieces are not hollow.<br /><br />I dislike overly sugary cereal, and I love the taste of oatmeal.  Combine that with the huge amount of whole grains in this product, and I'm definitely happy.  I would certainly eat this again.

review/summary: Pretty Average
review/text: For the sugar content I expected this cereal to be much sweeter / spicier than it is. While it isn't super bland it's not super flavorful either. Holds pretty well in milk. The taste is just ok. It's like having mini wheats with a smoother crunch. I tried it on the kids and got mixed results. The one who likes Mini Wheats mixed it with another cereal for a flavor boost while the other just ignored it. This falls somewhere between plain Mini Wheats and Life in the sweetness/ thickness scale but doesn't replace either. You could do much worse than Quaker Oatmeal Squares. If you watch your intake of sugar cereal you can also do better, both in grams per serving and in taste. I'd eat it again if it was on sale but I wouldn't seek it out.

review/text: Their description of the flavor as "a hint of cinnamon" is a touch overstated. It's kind of the ghost of a wisp of homeopathic cinnamon-water having been wafted over the cereal at some point, perhaps.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're not worried about the cinnamon, this is pretty good stuff. Love the texture, and man, is it filling; a regular-sized (for me) bowl of cereal actually proved hard to finish because this stuff is BULKY. That's never happened to me before. And as long as you don't mind the taste of oats (without, or with only a ghost of, cinnamon), hop to. ***

review/summary: Not your Mother's cereal.
review/text: I loved Mother's Cinnamon Oat Crunch.  It was my all-time favorite cereal.  Even though I don't like honey (the cereal was sweetened with honey) and feel neutral about cinnamon, the stuff was special and made me look forward to breakfast each morning.<br />My grocery store was recently out of Cinnamon Oat Crunch, so I went looking for it online. . .and discovered a notice on the Quaker site that the cereal had been discontinued.  What a bummer!  Then I saw new Quaker Oatmeal Squares and how similar they looked to Cinnamon Oat Crunch in the photo.  They even have the tilted heart logo that recently appeared on Mother's boxes.  Here's Quaker's replacement, I thought.<br />Not as good.  Oatmeal Squares are sweetened with sugar instead of honey.  Somehow, the sugar tastes separate from the cereal, like I took a bland piece of unsweetened cereal and put it in my mouth with a sugar cube.  Cinnamon Oat Crunch was all-natural; I see no such claim on the Oatmeal Squares box.<br />You can make your own call about which cereal is better for you; I'm going to post a user image of the nutrition facts side by side.  Some areas have improved; others have gotten worse.  Oatmeal Squares are all right for taste--I don't mind them--but they just aren't quite as delightful as Cinnamon Oat Crunch.

review/text: This cereal reminded me of nothing so much as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, except with less crunch and less flavor and less sweetness.  Physically, it's the form factor of Bite-Size Mini-Wheats, except at about 75% of the biscuit size.  The recommended serving size of 1 cup, with skim milk, gave me a 250-calorie breakfast, more than my usual 200, but the extra calories are pretty evenly distributed between protein, carbs, and fat.  Overall, I found it bland and largely uninteresting.  I'd eat it happily enough if it were put in front of me, but I won't be bothering to buy more of my own volition; I like other things better for my daily starter.

It holds together in the 'miniwheat' shape pretty well: you can crumble it for a nice dessert topping, but it also works with a nice sort of granola like trail mix.<br /><br />It's not too sweet (something that cereal often is when you eat it loose) and has a really nice crunch and just the right amount of cinnamony flavor.<br /><br />I would definitely buy again

review/text: This cereal is very similar to Shredded Wheat in size and the way it really fills you up after eating.  I found this cereal to be really bland with no flavor to it at all.  Yes, it says cinnamon on the box and it smells cinnamon-y when you open the box but once it hits the bowl it is like all flavoring washes off with the milk.  I think I was expecting a sweeter product and this was not at all sweet.  On the plus side, if you like a crunchy cereal these squares stayed solid and crunchy the entire time.  I found this to be really filling and didn't even finish the bowl I had poured for myself.  This cereal was too bland and heavy for me to want to eat it on a regular, daily basis.

review/summary: Needs More Cinnamon Flavor
review/text: These little biscuits are a great snack by themselves, or you can eat them as a traditional cereal with milk added. They do not get soggy in milk, but be careful of getting too many on your spoon, they are rather large. They have more of a graham-cracker texture than the similar-looking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037MVZMA">Post Shredded Wheat ' Bran, Spoon Size, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a> (which has a straw-like texture in my opinion).<br /><br />However - and this was a BIG however for my tasters - the cinnamon flavor fades away in milk. They end up tasting like graham crackers with just a hint of cinnamon. I would like something with a lot more cinnamon taste.

review/summary: Very Good/Crunchy/Cinnamon/Not Too Sweet
review/text: The plain Quaker Oatmeal Squares is one of my favorite boxed cereals so I was happy to try this cinnamon version.  This version has good cinnamon flavor; not fake & not too strong.<br /><br />I usually eat plain shredded wheat cereal (no sugar added) with a small amount of a sweetened cereal like this one, on top for added flavor.  This Quaker Oatmeal Squares is not too sweet even on its own although 9 grams of sugar is more than I like to see in my morning cereal.  It has 5 grams of fiber per serving.<br /><br />It stays crunchy in milk & tastes even better if you add fresh fruit.

review/summary: Review for Quaker oatmeal squares, cinnamon flavor
review/text: This cereal reminds me of frosted mini wheats. When eaten without milk, it is not too sweet but is still sweet enough to avoid being bland. It's crunchy, and I can definitely taste the cinnamon. Unfortunately, once milk is added, the not being too sweet part became a disadvantage. I usually complain about foods being too sweet, but this time the sugar got diluted by the milk and the cereal became a bit bland. I would only buy this if you're planning on eating it without milk added or if you want to add extra flavoring to your cereal.

review/summary: Very tasty, not too sweet, just a hint of cinnamon
review/text: I've loved the brown sugar flavor of this cereal for years, but hadn't tried the cinnamon version until recently.  It's quite similar to the brown sugar version, except for the hint of cinnamon, and I'll warn you that it is just a hint; if you're looking for a very strong cinnamon flavor, this is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy. But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals. It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for "healthy" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats. And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any but not so much that I feel like I'm eating candy.  The main problem I have with it is that my kids love it so much we go through a box in no time (unlike other "healthy" cereals, which the kids wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole).

review/summary: Just a hint of cinnamon
review/text: I had been wanting to try this cereal because I usually have hot cereal for breakfast and thought this might be a nice alternative.<br /><br />The taste is good, it has a hint of cinnamon and is crunchy. I do use a lot of milk but the cereal remained crunchy (on the bottom where the milk was).<br /><br />It tastes sweet and when you look at the ingredients/serving size you realize that it contains about 2 teaspoons of sugar. Not too bad but if you are trying to go for a low caloric cereal, this is not the one.<br /><br />I liked it and would recommend others to try it.

review/summary: Definitely a new cereal
review/text: Its similar to Mini-Wheats but not quite as stiff since it is more oat flour than wheat. It definitely has a cinnamon flavor but not over powering. It is nice and crunchy if you don't let it get soggy in milk. I think that this would be a great item to add to a Chex-Mix style of snack along with nuts and dried fruit.<br /><br />I also tried using the Oatmeal Squares to flavor some non-sweetened cereal and found that really helped stretch the food dollar. One thing I really like is that it does not have the over powering sweetness of say Kellogg's cereals. That was a pleasant surprise.

review/text: The latest Quaker Oatmeal Squares flavor claims "just a hint of Cinnamon" and just the hind was perfect because this is one enjoyable bowl of cereal.  With only seven servings, the box will not last long ) I was able to finish it off with five bowls) so if you eat a lot of cereal you may want to buy multiple boxes or purchase a larger box to make it through an entire week.  Also if you are one of the people who thinks the crumbs at the bottom of the box are the best part of cereal, you will be happy to learn about half of my last bowl were crumbs.

review/summary: Nothing to get excited about
review/text: My wife is the member of our household who eats cereal of this sort. She eats shredded wheat and other cereals I personally don't care for, so I considered her my primary resource for an opinion on the consuming side of this cereal. Her viewpoint was that it wasn't bad, but it was a bit too sweet.<br /><br />Looking at the nutrition label, I can see why. While it does have whole grain oats, ingredients three through five are sugars. That is why a cup of this cereal comes in at 210 calories per cup, which far higher than I like to see in a cup of healthy cereal. This cereal is definitely off the list if you are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />If you are currently maintaining a healthy weight and have the room in your daily calorie budget, then this cereal wouldn't be a mistake if you like it. However, Kellog's Cinnamon Oat Fiber Plus cereal ALSO has whole grain oats, and almost double the fiber content of these Quaker Oatmeal squares. It has less sugar. The only downside in comparing the two is that this cereal has more protein. However, it is more common to have trouble getting enough fiber in your diet than it is to get enough protein.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product for most people.

It is also made with whole oat and whole wheat flower but your children won't realize you're serving them healthy stuff :)

review/text: This is a dense and hearty cereal packing enough in it for those who prefer a hearty breakfast cereal over lighter fare.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the texture of this cereal, however. It is nothing like shredded wheat, which is what I imagined looking at the cereal. It's a somewhat indescribable combination of biscuit and dried oatmeal that's neither really crunchy nor soggy. It isn't too bad for a few days, but it isn't what I would buy regularly. I would recommend trying a box before splurging and getting a 4 pack.

review/summary: Not as Tasty as I Hoped
review/text: The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me.  Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest, but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind.  Maybe it was the milk, but I have tried these on their own too and find that they're kind of short on flavor.  I still like these Quaker Oatmeal Squares and they're still great for just about any time of day.  Still crispy inside even if the outside's a little soggy and still good for you too, just not my favorite.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: This review is based on a sample box provided from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I eat a lot of cereal.  From the pictures, I was worried that this would have the texture of shredded wheat.  I don't like shredded wheat.  This cereal, despite looking quite a bit like shredded wheat, does not have a similar texture.<br /><br />I love cinnamon, and this has a good sweet cinnamon taste, but not too overpowering.  There is a fair bit of sugar, plus other unnamed carbs, so be warned if you're on a low carb diet.  There are twice as many calories as a bowl of Cheerios, but that's pretty comparable to most other cereals.  If you're looking for something relatively high fiber without the high fiber taste, and you like cinnamon, give this one a shot.<br /><br />It also comes in brown sugar flavor.

review/summary: Pretty Good and Healthy
review/text: As an oatmeal lover, I enjoyed this product. The oatmeal squares look a lot like Frosted Mini Wheats but they taste a lot better! I think it would taste better if there were more cinnamon on the squares because when you add milk, you really can't taste much. The milk tends to get inside the holes of the squares and you get a mouthful of milk. Therefore, I prefer to eat these as a healthy finger snack because they taste better that way to me. When you eat them dry, you can definitely taste the cinnamon. Overall, it's good tasting and healthy, but for the price you pay, there should be more in the box...lots of air space and not as much cereal.

Imagine Life with a bigger crunch, and less propensity to go soggy after a few minutes in the milk. The cinnamon flavoring is not overwhelming at all; it's just subtle enough to add sweetness.

review/summary: Subtle cinnamon flavor for a filling breakfast
review/text: This cereal is an excellent way to start off the day.  With a subtle cinnamon flavor, I did not feel this cereal to be too sweet or overpowering.  It has a nice crunch and did not get soggy in milk, although honestly it did not stay too long in the bowl.<br /><br />It is a nutritious cereal as well as tasty.  It is high in fiber (5g dietary fiber, 2g soluble fiber), iron (90% of daily values) and folic acid (100% of daily value).  It is low in fat (2.5g total fat, 0.5g saturated fat, 0g trans fat, and 1g of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat each), sugar (9g) and sodium (190mg).  It also has protein (6g) and potassium (200mg).  It is made with whole grain oat flour and whole wheat flour too, so it is not empty calories without nutritional value, which is important to me.<br /><br />It is a quality cereal with a good taste and good nutrition to start the day.  Health conscious and flavor conscious cereal connoisseurs will both be pleased with Quaker Oatmeal Squares.

review/summary: Very enjoyable
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon fulfills all my cereal needs: crunchy, just sweet enough without being overwhelming, with a nutty quality and a flavor factor that made this cereal good enough to serve as dinner the night I got it. (Well, the fridge was not bursting with suggestions and I didn't feel like stopping anywhere, but cereal for supper has been done before.) It is faithful to what you would expect from Quaker, a robust, satisfying oatmeal cereal with the addition of cinnamon, and cinnamon takes almost everything up a notch. It doesn't get immediately soggy with the addition of milk, and is also pretty darn good as a snack food to answer cravings between breakfast and lunch at work. One of the better cereals on the market today.

review/summary: Kids love it.
review/text: I was going to wait to review this product until after I've had a bowl of it, but given the response of my young family, I see no need.<br /><br />The night I had the box of Quaker's Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares in the house, my daughter (who's five) asked for it as a snack before bed. Then after she tried it, she asked for it as a snack in her lunch box.<br /><br />When my son (who's seven) saw what she was eating, he wanted some too, liked them, and asked for some in his lunchbox as well.<br /><br />Hard to argue with that reception.<br /><br />Here's a cereal that not only tastes good (think a heartier and less sweet version of Cinnamon Life), kids like it, and--with 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein--it is good for them too. I recommend it for you and your family.<br /><br />** One word of caution, this cereal does have barley in it. We have one family member who is allergic to that particular grain. (Causes mild hives.) You might too, so be aware of food allergy symptoms!  **

review/text: I've always like Quaker Oat Squares, and these Cinnamon Quaker Oat Squares are no exception.  The texture of the oat squares themselves resemble Life cereal a bit but with much more substance; they are crunchy and filling, and hold up to milk quite well (they don't get soggy in the bowl as quickly as many other cereals do).  They also make a handy snack without the milk (as I'm eating them right now).<br /><br />The Cinnamon variety adds a touch of cinnamon flavor - not overwhelming at all, but blends in well with the oats.<br /><br />Coupled with the relatively low sugar added (9 grams per serving) and 5 grams of fiber, this seems like one of the healthier mass market cereals available.  That plus its good taste make this an easy product to recommend.

review/summary: Great straight from the box, and healthy to boot!
review/text: I am always looking for a quick and easy but nutritious breakfast or snack for my family, so I welcomed the opportunity to try out these Cinnamon Quaker Oatmeal Squares. I've tried them now with milk for breakfast as well as just straight from the box, as has my family. The verdict? These oatmeal squares make a terrific snack for those times when you're hungry and need a little something to tide you over until dinner.  The squares have a satisfying heft and crunch to them, and it makes you feel like you're eating something substantial, even though the actual calorie count is highly reasonable.  The slight sweetening and added cinnamon make them taste gratifyingly close to an oatmeal cookie, only crispy.<br /><br />I had my husband (eats anything), daughter (sweet tooth), and son (notoriously finicky) sample the cereal as well.  Hubby liked it, but then again, he likes anything.  Daughter said she liked it, but "it would be better if it had frosting."  The biggest surprise was my picky son, who usually eats nothing but mac'n'cheese and PBJ sandwiches. He gave the oatmeal squares a big thumbs up, and I even spied him later in the pantry grabbing a handful.<br /><br />So I think I will stock this cereal regularly. I like that it provides a way of getting the health benefits of oatmeal into my kids, who shun the mushy hot stuff.  I like even more that it gives me something healthy but satisfying to point to as a snack when they come to me and say that they're hungry. It beats potato chips or crackers by a long shot.

review/text: I generally stuck with this cereal for a similar taste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0TRGW">Barbara's Bakery Shredded Oats Original, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Barbara's tends to stay crunchier and has a better "mouth feel" or texture to it. Otherwise it's a very good comparison for these Oatmeal Squares.<br />The oatmeal squares are cinnamon flavored, which was a very nice hint of flavor and was not overbearing at all. It was not sugary sweet (which I hate)or artificial tasting at all.<br /><br />It's pretty good in terms of nutritional value: 210 calories, 2.5 g fat, 5 g fiber, and 6 g protein. It's also high in iron and folic acid. I appreciate a cereal that is a true "good source" for something, rather than just saying "it has fiber!" and contains only 1 gram. This cereal is not that way, thankfully. It does have 9 grams of sugar, but compared to other cereals that seems acceptable to me.<br /><br />The one drawback in comparison to Barbara's is the crunchiness. The oatmeal squares just don't stay crunchy in milk.

review/summary: Too much sugar for my taste, contains wheat
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this cereal, as I am getting pretty tired of Cheerios.  Nothing against Cheerios, of course, but variety is the spice of life.<br /><br />Speaking of spices, I thought oatmeal with a dash of cinnamon sounded darn good.  Well, dang, was I disappointed..  It's more like sugar with a dash of cinnamon.<br /><br />I kid you not.  It is not readily apparent from reading the blurb on the box that this is a highly sweetened cereal.  I was anticipating something more subtle in its sweetness: "Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon is packed with a hearty crunch that wakes you up and has just the right amount of sweetness to help fuel you up to conquer the morning."<br /><br />I do not generally eat sweetened cereals.  (I just don't care for them.)  However, the first bite had me grabbing the box to look for the list of ingredients.  The box reads "whole oat flour, whole wheat flour (what?) brown sugar, sugar, maltodextrin, malted barley extract, cinnamon, molasses, salt," and then all those additives with polysyllabic names.  You can see that sugar is the third and fourth ingredient.  Maltodextrin is a starch that your body breaks down into glucose (sugar).<br /><br />This cereal contains 9 grams of sugar in one cup - just over two teaspoons.  (According to various sources on the Web, two teaspoons of white sugar weigh 8.4 grams, brown sugar weighs a bit more.)  If you like a sweet cereal, you might like it, but that's way too much for my taste. (See product images.)<br /><br />On the positive side, I bet this cereal would be really good mixed in with a batch of trail mix.<br /><br />Additional caution:  People with wheat allergies, beware.

However, I did like it without.<br /><br />I ate the suggested serving of 1 cup and used 3/4 of a cup of milk. More milk would have had the cereal swimming.

review/text: Considering this is suppose to be a healthier cereal I guess the amount of sweetness is sufficient. Personally, I would like it to be a little more sweet. Once I began eating the cereal, I forgot it was suppose to have a cinnamon flavor to it. So, if you are expecting a good, strong cinnamon flavor from this cereal you are going to be disappointed. Other than those two disclaimers, the cereal was quite satisfying. It didn't get too soggy from the milk. I did get a hearty feel from it. I would say it is one of the better cereals out there if you are looking for a healthier cereal.

review/summary: Cinnamon Delight
review/text: With its subtle use of sugar and cinnamon, Quaker's Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares seems to be crafted to adult tastes, though I'm sure kids would love it too. It's a hearty cereal, equally good with milk or straight from the box. A small handful will stave off your appetite for an hour or two.<br /><br />The squares look like Miniature Shredded Wheat but I find the texture and flavor much more satisfying..  The cereal is fairly good for you despite its nine grams of sugar per serving.  That's a modest amount, but still may be questionable for some people, yet the good news is that there is no high fructose corn syrup, just real sugar, white and brown.<br /><br />The cereal stays crunchy in milk for a reasonable amount of time, too.<br /><br />Normally, I'm a Cheerios and milk, no sugar, kind of person, but sometimes I get a craving for cinnamon cereal.  From now on, I'm going with Quaker's offering; I like the nice, heavy crunch, the perfectly pitched flavors and the simple, natural ingredients.

review/text: * Same as Oatmeal Squares, with just a hint of cinnamon<br />* Less sugar per serving than Cocoa Puffs (!) ... though it has 6 times as much protein, and double the fiber, but also double the carbs (23 vs 44 grams). (What can I say - I had a box of Cocoa Puffs on the counter when this arrived)<br />* Good finger food for little kids, or for snacking during the day<br />* Slightly abrasive on the roof of your mouth, though not as much as Mini Wheats without milk or Cap'n Crunch<br /><br />It's one of our family staples... healthy enough for mom and tasty enough for the kids. Four stars instead of five out of pure bias - I like it well enough and it gets the job done, but it isn't THAT special.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon cereal is one tasty treat!  As a person who can eat cereal for any meal or a snack, I am always looking for something new to try, so I had to taste Quaker's cereal when given the opportunity through the Vine program.<br /><br />Quaker's cinnamon flavored squares are an equal balance of whole grains and sweetness.  The cinnamon flavor is just the right amount and is not at all overwhelming.  I first tried the cereal by the handful.  While eating it dry, I noticed the pleasant texture that similar cereals lack.  In milk, the cereal did not become soggy too quickly.  And it tasted great both ways and was filling.<br /><br />The one downside was that I expected this cereal that have better nutritional value.  While it is healthier than some of the other cereals that might fall in its category (more fiber and protein, less sugar), I found the calorie amount per serving to be slightly high.  The amount of whole grains included in a serving makes up for this somewhat.<br /><br />Overall, Quaker has a great addition to the cereal market.  It will appeal to adults and children alike.  However, while I would recommend this to consumers looking for a sweet, satisfying, grown up cereal, I would tell those looking to lose weight to try another breakfast cereal.

review/summary: One of my favorite cereals now available from Amazon
review/text: While you normally think of hot oatmeal mixes when you think of Quaker, I think of their awesome Oatmeal Squares cereal.  A long time favorite, the super dense smaller squares of cinnamon based heaven are surprisingly good for you too. 46 grams of whole wheat per serving, providing a whopping 20% of your Daily Value for Dietary Fiber.  And unlike many other cereals, the ingredient list is a pleasant surprise.  Whole grain oat flour and then whole wheat flour are the first two ingredients.  And no high fructose corn syrup either, just good ole brown sugar and regular sugar.  Cinnamon and molasses round out the flavor ingredients.  And sugar only makes up 9 grams per serving- the same as the more expensive and worst tasting Kashi Cinnamon Harvest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW">Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest, 16.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> I bought as a comparison.<br /><br />In fact the Quaker pretty much destroyed the Kashi on the taste test.  It also held up better in milk longer, and the smaller denser squares compared favorably to the bigger looser Kashi squares which crumbled more more easily in the box.  Fiber was a tie, with the Quaker having an extra gram of soluble fiber.  Fat wise the Quaker does have 2.5 grams to 1 gram for the Kashi- but we are still talking 4 and 2% respectively of the Daily Value- so they are both good choices.<br /><br />Downsides- the box is smaller than most at 14.5oz versus 17.5oz for the Kashi.  And its expensive- at nearly $5 a box on Amazon.  But with free delivery and no sales tax its probably close to a wash versus your supermarket. And you will probably eat more than one "serving" per meal, so you can blow through a box quicker than you would think.<br /><br />So one of my favorite cereals with Amazon convenience, now I just would like to see the Amazon price come down a bit more to reflect the quantity we are buying.  But for the cereal itself, I can give an unqualified 5 star rave- its great tasting and good for you to boot.

review/text: I love this cereal! I was looking forward to trying it since I like the other varieties of Oatmeal Squares. The Cinnamon has the same great texture and crunch. I thought maybe the cinnamon flavor might be too strong and overpowering, but it's not. It's just right! It is great in a bowl with milk or by the handful right out of the box for a quick snack. Quaker has another winner! I will be buying this again.

review/summary: Needs More Cinnamon!
review/text: So, if you are a cinnamon junky like myself, you will eat this cereal and find yourself thinking, "Hey! Where did all the cinnamon go?!" The cereal looks like shredded wheat, but it is more a solid piece than individual layers. The cinnamon flavor is rather faint and muted, but it is still pretty tasty. My husband thought the cinnamon was the perfect amount, so it might just be my insatiable need for tons of cinnamon that left me wanting with this cereal. The little squares aren't hollow, so they are really quite filling. I have been eating them by handful as a snack, but I imagine they would be good in milk like standard cereal as well.<br /><br />Pretty good cereal, but want more cinnamon!

review/summary: Mmmmm crunchy cinnamon goodness!
review/text: I received these cinnamon flavored Quaker Oatmeal Squares from the On The Vine program. I just want to be clear that on the box underneath the wording Oatmeal Squares it states "with just a hint of Cinnamon". Dry or with milk this cereal is very tasty.  Cereal w/o milk is 210 calories, 2.5g of fat, .5g sat fat, 9g of sugar, 5g of dietary fiber, and 6g of protein.  It contains 46grams of whole grains, 90% iron and 100% folic acid per serving. As a dry cereal, it is a cinnamon, slightly sweetened crunchy delight. It stays pretty crunchy in milk, depending on how long it takes you to eat your cereal. It has just the right amount of sweetness, for my taste anyway. I don't really care for the sickening sweet cereals. I'm not sure why on the box it states "hint of cinnamon", I would say it's more than a hint, it is definitely cinnamon flavored. I, for one, love cinnamon so I loved it. If you are one who drinks the milk from the cereal when you are done, the milk was cinnamon flavored but no granules of sugar left in the bottom of the bowl like you sometimes get with more sugary cereals. I would definitely purchase this cereal on a regular basis and recommend this product.

review/summary: New favorite at our house!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with cinnamon have an excellent taste, crunch, staying power in milk. Perfect out of hand for a snack instead of potato chips or cookies. They are just sweet enough to need no added sugar. Positively addictive as a snack. Similar in background flavor to Life Cereal, but better crunchiness and stays together in milk ten times longer than Life.  Will absolutely buy more!

review/summary: Sticking with Quaker's Puffed Rice/Wheats
review/text: I eat Shredded Wheat, Grape Nuts & Quaker's Puffed Wheat and/or Puffed Rice.<br />My wife saw this on amazon I wanted us to give it a try. She didn't like how hard it was.<br />As I eat Grape Nuts, hard was not a factor for me. The sugar content was really not something I want, but it is only 9 grams/serving. The taste; however, wasn't there for me.<br />My wife liked the taste; but again, the hardness was too much for her.<br /><br />So I'am sticking with the good old Puffed Rice & Wheat when it comes to Quakers.

review/summary: Crunchy Oats
review/text: Fans of hearty oat cereals should enjoy Quaker Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares. If you've had the regular Oatmeal Squares, then just imagine them with sweet, rich cinnamon added. I prefer their flavor and texture to the similarly shaped mini-wheat cereals.  This is heartier than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ER1JE0">Life Cereal</a> but not quite as heavy as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AY9UKM">Cracklin' Oat Bran</a>. The ribbed oat pillows stay crunchy in milk for a good long time. I enjoy them as a milk-less snack too.<br /><br />This enriched cereal is fairly healthy and not overly sweet. A half cup serving is good for about 20% of your daily fiber requirements and 90% of the iron. They also contain 96% of your minimum daily whole grain recommendation. It is one of the few *healthier* cereals that my kids enjoy as well, and I even like having a bowl in place of dessert. Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares are not an inexpensive cereal, but I would say their price/nutrition ratio is one of the better ones. I've seen highly processed, overly sweet kids' cereals that cost more. This Oatmeal Square cereal compares well with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW">Kashi Cinnamon Harvest</a>, another similar cereal that I like.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: I usually dont like buffalo wing flavored things because they never taste like buffalo wing sauce, like some other reviews have said. These are SO good. They have that tangy buffalo style taste not just spice and i could eat a whole bag! They would be amazing with any kind of dip. I am actually thinking of crushing these up into a breadcrumb texture and frying some chicken coated in them! Totally go for it and get these!

review/text: I LOVE these pretzel crisps.  Lots of flavor, low in fat.  Baked, not fried.  I get these for around $3.50 per 7.2 oz bag at my local grocery store, so I'm a little confused by the astronomical prices shown by the current people selling them on Amazon.  They are well worth it if you find them for less than $4 per bag.  YUM!

review/summary: Way too salty and too much MSG.  Horrible aftertaste
review/text: I tried these pretzelcrisps after thinking what a great idea.  Unfortunately there is so much salt on these things, it even made my lips burn when eating them.  Once I looked at the ingredients, not only was I shocked to see the amount of sodium in these (10 pieces have 23% of your RDA for sodium), but MSG is the third largest ingredient in this product.  WOW, what a shock.  These snacks left such a horrible after-taste in my mouth.  Unfortunately for taste these things get two thumbs down.  Stick with normal pretzels in this case.

review/text: I hate to be THAT person, but these are gross. Buffalo wings are one of my most favorite foods ever but these do not taste like buffalo wings. They taste really sour, then really spicy and hot, and WAY WAY WAY too salty, and I love my salt! I can't pick up a good flavor with these. I'm really sad because they sounded amazing. I recommend the "Everything" Pretzel Crisps.

review/summary: Almost as good as the real thing
review/text: I first tried these after my sister gave me a bag of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT5NFO">Snack Factory Original Pretzel Crisps</a>.  My family really liked them as a quick snack they could grab a handful of.  I also found them dipping them in sour cream, peanut butter, cream cheese and also adding sliced cheese.  When I saw they had flavored ones, I had to buy them and so far the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YTC9MO">Snack Factory Buffalo Wing Pretzel Crisps</a> are our favorites. They don't work well dipped in peanut butter, but are good with all the others including ranch dressing or just by themselves.  Although the size of the bags seem small, because they are so light and crispy, you do receive quite a bit in them. On average I've paid anywhere from $2.50 to $3.50 a bag and I'm okay with that. Definitely give them a try if you like Buffalo Wings!
