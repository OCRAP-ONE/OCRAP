review/summary: Love these, though they were made at different times.
review/text: These are my favorite sour candies - the green ones are just absolutely delicious. Don't eat too many though, or it'll wreck your mouth up something fierce. I'm still working through this a couple months later. The only issue is that some of these were clearly older than others, you could tell by the way the packaging stuck to them and the taste in general. I wouldn't say it's a majority, but kind of what I expected at any rate.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Warheads have been one of my favorite candies ever since I was a kid. Unfortunately, they are nearly impossible to find in my area, so I took to the internet. I was a bit worried after reading through the reviews of people who received 90% yellow candies, but luckily, that was not the case for me. In fact, I received less yellows than any other color. The remaining colors all seemed to be very evenly numbered, almost as if they were counted out. The price seems very reasonable considering it generally cost me $2+ for a small bag if I did end up finding them somewhere.

review/summary: Disappointed With Proportions
review/text: I just received my order of these Warheads candy.  They are great quality, and not deformed/melted like a previous order I had made for 120 bagged together.  The main reason I didn't give this 5 stars is simply because of the uneven proportion, and my favorite ones (green) being the least in the container.  I have read a few reviews which mentioned an over-abundance of Yellows in the container.  Although my results weren't nearly as extreme, the numbers still were frustrating when looking for an even mix.  The numbers worked out like this:  94 Red, 80 Yellow, 45 Blue, and only 28 Green.  What's the deal?!?  Now, I don't mind the few extra yellows, as I do like them 2nd best.  Red is my least favorite of the bunch, however with that said, I still like them, and they will be consumed.  If you do the math, there was an extra 7 tossed in the mix, but I'd gladly given them up for a more reasonable proportion.  So do be aware that the big negative is that it's just not consistent on if you will get a good mix or not.  There's only one other thing I'll point out that caught my attention.  Typically when you buy any type of candy in a tub like this, there is a safety plastic ring around the lid.  That was NOT the case when I received mine.  I'm sure it's no big deal, and the count (like I mentioned above) was in my favor.  It just seemed a bit strange to me.  Regardless, if the risk of drastically uneven colors, and that little plastic ring don't bug you, enjoy!  I know I will, however it would have been SO much better with more greens (to me)...

review/text: Though I absolutely love warheads I was very disappointed to open it and see nothing but yellows almost 90 percent of the bin is yellow though they are the sourest there where only 2 greens!!!! Also that it isn't a closed container as in when you take the cap off there isn't anything for you to open to keep them sealed no factory seal or anything so they are modified in some way to give you more yellows I would assume. Though I am satisfied and will enjoy eating all of them for such a good price so thanks :]

review/summary: Good, But Not Enough Flavor Variety
review/text: I really LOVE Warheads. If you're ordering to get a deliciously sour treat and don't care about a specific taste, then this is a good buy. However, the distribution of the flavors is not up to par. There's plenty of apple, lemon and watermelon in the bucket, but there's very few black cherry (maybe 20 in the whole thing?) and ALMOST NO blue raspberry (I have literally only seen 5 in there). That's just completely embarrassing. When I buy an assortment, I expect close to even distribution. Why are there so few blues in there? They're the tastiest ones. I'm rather disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that, great buy. Candy's fresh and everything.

review/text: I was looking forward to receiving my tub of Warheads until I opened the box. In the photo in this listing, you see multiple colors represented evenly in the resealable tub. By my estimation, the tub I received has about 80% YELLOW LEMON FLAVORED Warheads in it. YELLOW! The worst of the candy flavors. The last Starburst anyone eats. LEMON.<br /><br />Looks like I'll be eating around 48 Warheads and then donating 192 EXTREME LEMON YELLOW WRAPPERED Warheads to an orphanage or something. Don't be fooled by false advertising, you're getting LEMON candy.<br /><br />YELLOW LEMON.

To me they are my favorite cookies! I can see having these with ice cream, whipped cream or just all on their own. They are the best!

review/summary: Oh, yeah... perfect light roast
review/text: In our household, we like to taste the bean, not the roast.  When Starbucks came out with the "blonde" roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br /><br />The other one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  While it's supposed to have "delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts" we missed that. It had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy tasting, bland and flat, not a definitive flavor.<br /><br />On the other hand, we really liked this one.  The Willow has a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  It had a good full flavor, and a clean finish.<br /><br />Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a "breakfast blend" type coffee, the Willow blend will probably be your pick.  We're definitely not coffee afficianados, but we know what we like and Willow is how we roll.

Like another reviewer said, this is not the typical flavor offered from the dark selection like french roast, sumatra, etc. It's a different sensation, one I'll have to get used to because I have two bags. It still has that strong burnt-like roast taste but with different undertones. Taste is subjective. You may like it. For me, it's not an instant hit!

review/summary: Under the willow tree
review/text: Starbucks is now trying medium roasts (as is its predecessor/rival, Peet's) Willow isn't named for Tara's girlfriend in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046XG48O">Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series</a> or for the '80s fantasy cult film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXDD">Willow (Special Edition)</a> with Val Kilmer. The Willow roast doesn't have a burnt taste, so it's better than other Starbucks blends. It's hearty, there are hints of cocoa, and blends well with any milk, dairy or otherwise. Apparently there's a Starbucks boycott going on spearheaded by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895264641">The Abolition of Marriage: How We Destroy Lasting Love</a> the National Organization for Marriage. Maybe they didn't try this delicious roast. Anybody would boycott burnt-tasting coffee, and that's easy to do. The Willow blend is hearty and delicious!

I have a large dog, so any chew treat is usually gone within minutes, but it took him a while to finish. The only downside is that it contains corn and wheat flour...

review/summary: How do I like these golden flaxseeds?
review/text: I am entirely pleased with this product.  Up till now, I have only gotten the dark flax seeds, purchased at my local health food store. The golden are so much nicer and grind up faster and more easily than the dark, plus they bake up into beautiful bread. I'm not a fan of buying already-milled flaxmeal, I just don't think it's as fresh or as good as grinding it myself, as needed.<br /><br />Being able to get a discount and free shipping for getting regular shipments makes it entirely affordable to buy online.  I appreciate the service from Amazon and the availability of this fine product.

review/text: I'm new to the flax world, so I can't say this is better or worse than any other kind of flax, but it's exactly what I was looking for.  I grind my own, as suggested by pretty much every article I've read about flax, and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I'm on a low carb diet and add this to my morning shake that I make (3T ground flax, 1 scoop no-carb protein powder, 1/2c egg beaters, 1/4c to 1/2c cream or coconut milk, 4-5 ice cubes). YUM.  This flax has a very mild nutty flavor but doen't taste like much when added to anything else.  It reminds me of a less-overpowering and fresher tasting wheat germ.

review/text: I recommend taking ground flax daily. Buying this particular variety from Amazon will prevent you from supermarket ripoffs. Don't bother getting the organic one since the difference in product doesn't justify the price difference (check out Bob's website). I think the only difference is the organic gets grown without extra nitrogen.

review/summary: Spoiled upon arrival...not good
review/text: The seeds looked and smelled perfectly fine at first when they were whole seeds, but as soon as i ground them, i realized they were spoiled. They instantly had a sour smell to them once ground, almost like spoiled milk. I have eaten brown flax seeds many times before and never smelled anything like that on them. Maybe these golden seeds smell bad, but i read that they should taste and smell even better.<br /><br />What bothers me most is not only that i have to throw them all out, but also that they take at least a year to spoil when whole which means amazon likely had them sitting around for that long in a warehouse and still sold them to me anyway.

Plus in the past I had to order 22 pounds to get a price savings. Now I can just buy a few bags and still save money.

review/text: Golden flax seeds taste better than the brown variety. I grind them and add them to oatmeal, shakes, cereal, etc. They are a good source of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory compounds including ALA which may get converted to EPA and DHA (Omega-3s). This is especially good for vegetarians and vegans who don't eat fish but want to get more of these healthy fatty acids in their diet from a whole food source, vs. supplements. They have a light but unique taste that might be described as nutty, grassy or vegetal taste. The texture is noticeable and somewhat gelatinous when  ground and mixed with liquid. They also work well as a vegan egg substitute and thickener. People sometimes add these whole to baked goods, but you don't really digest them or benefit from them unless you grind them. I think grinding them fresh is probably more likely to give you the best benefit vs pre-ground or oils, but don't know for sure. This is a lot of flax seed, so keep the unopened packages in the fridge and they'll keep for a long time.

review/summary: Warning--Avoid
review/text: The flax seeds I received are contaminated with grit,  dirt and rocks,  and other filth, possibly rat droppings or leavings of other vermin and extraneous seeds from unknown weeds.<br /><br />  Having read a previous review which described rocks in the Bob's Red Mill flax seeds,  I called up Bob's Red Mill and talked with a representative who said that this had been a problem but was now corrected.  I ordered with confidence that I would get  something that would be usable.  Didn't happen.  I called Bob's Red Mill and left a message requesting to speak with someone about the problem;  I was thinking that I might have gotten seeds from an earlier lot packaged before the problem had been addressed.  This was last week;  nothing so far from them.<br /><br />  I think Amazon should not sell Bob's Red Mill unless there is evidence that they are willing to provide safe and clean products.  You could easily scratch or split a tooth by chewing on rocks.  Even with tedious sorting out of Bob's Red Mill seeds,  there were still particles of grit and rock which were overlooked.  I'm throwing out what I received from Bob,s Red Mill.<br /><br />  In the meanwhile I've ordered and received golden flax seeds from Arrowhead Mills.  Absolutely delicious and clean and ready to use.  Superb ground up with a coffee mill.  These are available with a discount for subscribed delivery (subscribe & save) also from Amazon and can be found if you look around on the Amazon site.  I am also subscribed for automatic provision of the Arrowhead dark flax seeds which are also excellent,  with a somewhat different taste and texture and nutritional profile.

review/text: I have been using these flax seeds from Bob's Red Mill for about 6 months. They are absolutely fantastic! I use them in everything - in baking as an egg replacement, mainly, but also for smoothies and cereals occasionally. I keep them in my cupboard, and grind them in a coffee grinder as I need them.<br /><br />They come fresh and packaged beautifully. They do have a lot of natural oil - Omega 3s anyone? - so when I grind them I sometimes have to use my finger to make sure they all come out of the coffee grinder.<br /><br />Try them, especially in baking, and I know you will love them! Thanks amazon and Bob's Red Mill for a great product at a great price!

review/text: I bought the set as a Christmas present for my mother. When I opened the shipping box, the box inside was for just the bamboo box and containers. The item was as described, and they do a good job of making the wood box and salts very nice-- the top of the box is engraved, and the wooden spoons are a good touch. However, the outside packaging is really tacky; it looks like a cheap kitchen container set, which they obviously buy and fill themselves. Swapping those out for a plain brown box or their own box would make this much more appealing to give/receive as a gift. I'm not looking forward to awkwardly explaining on Christmas morning that it's not just a container set.<br /><br />I haven't tried the salts themselves, as they are a gift, but they smell pretty good.

I switched to the Quaker steel cut in the not-so-cute cardboard box, but was looking for an even cheaper option.  This was it.<br /><br />The oatmeal looks and tastes to me exactly like McCann's.  The bag is not as easy to deal with, so I poured some of it into a McCann's tin that I had saved.  The bag recommends the oats be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, so I froze the extra and will keep refilling the tin.  Steel cut oats take a long time to cook, so I make a cup of it at a time (4 servings).  I eat one serving right away and the other three go in the fridge. A quick minute or so in the microwave gives me a fast, healthy breakfast.<br /><br />I bought four of these big bags and so spent a little time looking for alternate recipes. I use this in hearty breads as a substitute for cracked wheat.  Alton Brown has a good fancied up version of the morning bowl of oatmeal at [...].  McCann's web site at [...] has lots of interesting recipes, but if you try any of them note that many call for their quick cooking Irish oatmeal, which is not the same as this and if you try to sub you will wind up with a very crunchy product.  My favorite recipe is still the basic from the package of one cup of oats to four cups of water.  Bring to a boil, turn down the heat to simmer (or it will always boil over no matter how many times I was going to watch it this time) and cook for 20-30 minutes.  Easy and delicious.

review/summary: best breakfast oats
review/text: Easy to make ahead of time in a rice cooker or crock pot but even on the stove you are a half hour away from an oaty warm bowl of something really good for you. I prefer my oats a little sweet so I skip adding the salt they recommend and use a little maple syrup and just about any kind of fresh or dried fruit. If you make a bigger batch they taste just about as good reheated over the next couple of days by just adding a little milk or water and reheating. I haven't found a better brand.

review/summary: As good as it gets
review/text: I love steel-cut oats and have them for breakfast just about every day.  They're expensive if you purchase them in a health food store or that "whole paycheck store."  I ordered 6 packages at once, which helps with the shipping, so the end result is the cost is much less per ounce than I can buy them anywhere else.  The texture is great and I won't be running out soon!

review/summary: Not too sweet and convenient
review/text: Finding a good barbecue sauce that isn't too sweet and doesn't have any corn syrup can be difficult. Usually I make my own, but sometimes we just want to be able to grill food fast. This works. It doesn't have any corn syrup. It has a very clean taste that can be adjusted slightly if you prefer more garlic or more tart by adding one or two ingredients.<br />Annie's quality is consistent, and this basic sauce matches the quality of everything I've had from them so far.<br />Nice and convenient with a flavor my family appreciates and no corn syrup or odd ingredients. Adding it at the end to grilled chicken and giving it a little while to crisp up on the skin, it's shiny and nicely brownish red.

review/summary: Contains SPLENDA - yuck
review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: First, I LOVE the sodastream machines. They work great for sparkly water anytime you need it.<br />The syrups taste good--just like store bought sodas. But, the price for the syrup is insane! Each bottle makes the equilalent of 6 2L bottles of soda. Every supermarket I go to has 2L bottles of soda for $1 regularly--so the store bought equilent is only $6.

If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/summary: SodaStream Jet
review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.
