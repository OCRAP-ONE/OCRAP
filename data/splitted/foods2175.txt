review/summary: great taste, NOT low carb
review/text: dreamfields pastas taste great, even better than regular pasta, cheap price, easily available , but I don't like the confusing statement of digestable carbs 5, that is not net carbs, I ate them during my Atkins diet and I stopped losing weight and was bloated like after regular carbs.. so I looked at the box and found that they are not low in carbs, almost like the regular pasta, they could be low GI pasta but not low carb, I should have known from the price... so if you are not on low carb diet you can have them.

review/summary: Excellent, truly tasty pasta
review/text: We first discovered Dreamfields Pasta 3 years ago when we were pursuing a low carb diet. Also, I am diabetic, so even though I've lost the weight I wanted on the Atkins diet, and don't follow it faithfully any longer, I still watch my carbs AND my blood sugar.<br />I notice a reviewer disagreeing about the carb count. The thing is, as they say on the package, the EFFECTIVE carb count is much lower than most pastas. And that is, indeed, the tested experience of my family, and many other people who watch their carbs for whatever reason. If I check my blood sugar after eating Dreamfields Pasta, the impact  is way less than with other pastas, whatever the official carb count is. This may not be true for everyone. Your mileage may vary. But for me and many other diabetics, Dreamfields is a dream come true.<br /><br />The fantastic thing about Dreamfields is the taste. We really like it, and would prefer it to most other "regular" dry pastas whatever the carb count.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is with the prices: for some reason most grocery stores no longer carry the elbows and linguini. And when the shipping/handling is more than the (already) high price, buying it is almost impossible in the current economy.

review/text: I've eaten whole wheat Pastas-yuk. This one though is as good as any other at the store. I have friends from Italy that say this is as good as what they eat at home. It's just good. At first I didn't believe it was low carb, so I researched a little and found "[...]". This guy is a diabetic who tested the pasta for blood sugar rise. As a staunch low carb dieter, I don't eat pasta much, but when I do, this is the one for me!

review/text: I am forever fighting weight and am on a low glycemic index eating program.  This means that I am always watching how many and what kind of carbohydrates I am consuming.  All of the Dreamfields pasta products are lower in the bad carbs than others and are the only pastas that someone on a low glycemic index program will touch.  Amazingly, they taste great.  Your dinner guests will never know that you are serving a healthier product.  It is the only pasta brand we keep in our house now.

review/summary: Be careful
review/text: This pasta is fine if you do not care about a glucose spike 3 and 4 hrs after eating. It contains inulin which is in the clear version of Metamucil. Only slows down absorption for an hour or two for me. Caution if eating left overs the rise is quicker. If you eat this with tomato sauce realize all tomato sauce has carbs you need to take this into account. People have said it is the acid in the tomato sauce that causes the rise, some sauces contain a lot of carbs and added sugar. These same people must have forgotten the stomach produces one of the strongest acids in nature to aid digestion so my guess is look at the carb count in the sauce for that rise. I can not believe by adding inulin which is found naturally in onions and bananas could prevent starch breakdown completely. It does seem to protect the starch to glucose breakdown but only for a couple of hours than by the third to fourth hour comes the spike. It is only tested for glucose rise for one and two hours after. Do a 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr blood meter test for your self. Many who really need to be careful with insulin spikes should check the 3rd and 4th hour to make sure it is safe. If you are on a low carb diet and you fall out of ketosis a couple hrs after eating anything get a blood glucose meter this way you can see a cause and affect from anything carb questionable you may eat. If it works for you that is great but be cautious. I am not a diabetic but follow a low carb lifestyle I get no rise at all the first hour than slow rise by the second. Than it comes for me between the 3-4 hour as if I ate a normal portion of regular past. I have never tested past the 4th hour.

review/summary: Not low carb
review/text: When I first tried this product I was very excited.  The prospect of a great tasting pasta at a low price was a very attractive thought to me.  When I first received the product, upon reading the product label I became very suspicious.  They claim that a large part of the carbs in their pasta is not absorbed because it is somehow bound to a protein.  I was wondering to myself what kind of protein would render a carbohydrate indigestible and also not break down secondary to stomach acids and pancreatic enzymes.<br /><br />When I started digging for testing supporting their claim I came across the following article.  [...].  As you can see, testing by the ADA shows that the glycemic response of dreamfields pasta is exactly the same as that of regular pasta.<br /><br />If you are trying to follow a low carb diet because you have diabetes or because you are trying to control your weight, this is not the product for you.  A much better product would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051NHO0K">FiberGourmet Bulk Elbow Macaroni box, 10-Pounds</a>.  With this product, a good portion of the carbs are truly indigestible fiber and this is reflected in the product label.

review/summary: At least for this type 1 diabetic, almost like regular pasta
review/text: I used to buy this all the time, and I would have bought it from Amazon if no local retailer had stocked it -- but they did.  Taste and texture are just faintly different from ordinary durum-wheat pasta -- not really enough to matter, and when it's prepared al dente the difference is trivial.  It's a great product in that way.<br /><br />For me, the problem is that my body seems to react to it almost, if not exactly, the way it does to regular pasta.  The process that "protects" or "blocks" or does whatever to the starch might perhaps slow the breakdown of starch to glucose, but at least in my case the effect is too minor to make a difference.  True, I generally cooked and ate three to four ounces (before-cooking weight) of Dreamfields, and perhaps that is simply too much starch for an insulin-dependent diabetic like me to handle -- but Dreamfields seemed to have little or no advantage to me over an equal amount of ordinary hard-wheat pasta.<br /><br />I'm now on a low-carbohydrate diet, and although I'm not losing much weight I have better control of my diabetes with less insulin by far.  I wish so much that Dreamfields worked for me the way I hoped it did -- I grew to love pasta in the Eighties when the American Diabetes Association was promoting it heavily for diabetics -- but wishing gets me nowhere.

review/text: I am so thankful for this pasta. I have added spaghetti back into our menu. My kids are happy too and have never made a comment that the pasta tasted different.<br />I was a bit apprehensive at first, as I have tried some other low carb items and some were a huge disappointment. But not this pasta. It tastes good with butter, or in a sauce or however you normally would use pasta. My husband is very picky, an even harder sale than I am, and he loves it too.<br /><br />I could not eat regular pasta in the afternoon as it made me so sluggish, I just wanted to lie down and take a nap. But with this pasta, I can have it anytime.<br /><br />We are on a low carb diet and this pasta has not caused any problems with weight gain. Try it, you wont be sorry. I agree with another poster, now we don;t have to wait for a special time to have pasta. :)

My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us.

In fact every single scientific study that has been done has shown the same thing, even the box itself admits to having the same amount of carbohydrates as "normal" pasta in the Gov't mandated nutrition information box. The ad copy then goes on to try and say that by some magical "patent pending" process it "protects" most of the carbohydrates that there is exactly zero science or proof to back up anywhere. In short, this product is a complete and utter lie, not only is it disingenuous for people who are trying to lose weight, it is actively dangerous for diabetics who must keep accurate track of their carbohydrate intake to avoid death.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!

review/summary: TERRIFIC TASTE AND HEALTH BENEFITS TOO -- SMALL SIZE ASSURES FRESHNESS WHEN YOU USE IT!,
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: THE CORNERSTONE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET<br /><br />This Goya "EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" is one of the smartest buys one can make. This is "Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be "All Natural & Cold Pressed". Bear in mind that "All Natural" is not "Certified Organic".<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS: CARDIO-PROTECTIVE<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the "Mediterranean" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of "mono-saturated fats" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

review/text: First off, the price on these is kind of weird. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZUFHW">Thai Kitchen Mushroom Medley</a> is 6 for ~$11 ($.74/oz, just over what I pay at the store) and this is more than double that price ($1.62/oz). If I were reviewing the product itself, I'd give it four stars. Charging double what it's worth lowers my rating a good bit.<br /><br />The Thai Kitchen Noodle Bowls I've had (Mushroom Medley and Roasted Garlic) are both very good for instant soups. I prefer the Mushroom Medley, though. To me, the broths taste very similar (though Garlic is slightly stronger) but the Mushroom contains dried shiitake mushrooms. The mushrooms add more texture to the soup and make it taste less like just broth and noodles.<br /><br />This is still pretty good, though, and if you can find them at a more reasonable price ($1-2) and/or don't like mushrooms, go for it!

review/summary: Small pieces for small dogs
review/text: I purchased the Smokehouse slivers for our two large labs hoping there would be enough size to hold their attention for a while. The dogs like the product, but they could down the piece while standing. This is probably a good product for small dogs, but large labs like our need more substance. The general problem is Pigs Ears have increased in price so much that I can't justify the approximately $1 per ear price I see. Our dogs three several treats a day, I can't afford to keep them in "ears."

review/summary: Smokehouse PiggySlivers
review/text: I won't buy any chewable treats that are not made in the USA, and my dogs love to chew pig ears.  These Smokehouse treats make me happy, and they make my dogs happy.  Rawhide chews and pig ears made in USA can be quite expensive in the local pet stores.  The slivers are just the right size for a treat, and the price is great for the quantity. I generally get the 40 count bag, but it seems to go so quickly with 2 dogs.  I recently ordered the 100 count package, which should last us much longer.

review/summary: 2 out of 7 pets agree!
review/text: If you've read any of my reviews you should know I have 7 little doggies with a big appetite for treats! I love spoiling them too. I've seen them tackle pigs ears and have heard they are not good for your dog so when I saw 100% natural and in these more bite-size shapes I jumped on them! Out of 7 only 2 of my dogs devoured them and they are two rescue dogs who are used to nothing and are thankful for crumbs. My at home born and raised other 5 are much pickier. I'm sure these are great but based on my dogs experience I give it a medium not a low score because I believe in giving your pets 100% natural treats and that is where this product did not fall short.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: I ordered the pig slivers yesterday and used prime 2 day delivery. They were on my door the next morning! Very happy with the quick delivery. My 6 month old puppies (a puggle and corgi) loved these piggy slivers! It took each of them about 10 minutes to finish one (they're 11 lbs and 19 lbs). If you have a larger dog they'll probably finish it in a few minutes. I like the smaller portion for my smaller dogs; the full sized pig ears would probably be too much for their tiny stomachs. This product is not something that will keep your dog entertained for hours, like a compressed rawhide bone, but it's a great snack and really nice for the teething dog. Also, they're natural and made in the USA which is a definite plus.

We like these 'slivers' that seem to be an ideal size for a quick snack and to keep the dogs busy. They are good quality and they seem to really enjoy the flavor and textures.<br />Would definitely reccommend.

review/summary: RANCID!
review/text: I bought these based on good reviews for quality and price. However, the two bags I received both have a strong rancid smell. I've bought fresh pigs ears from the local pet store and paid 3-4 times as much, but frankly, I wouldn't pay 1/4 the price for a rancid product ever again.  Rancid oils are terrible for humans and terrible for pets. My dog, who usually LOVES pigs ears, picks these up, puts them back down, sniffs them, sneezes a few times, and walks away. Not sure if it was a bad batch or if they are all like this. I bought a big bag from costco that smelled similar, and I returned them. I probably should return these, but it's a bit of a hassle with online purchases. Anyway, very disappointed. Beware. Only good thing would have been the nice, appropriate size for a small dog (Havanese).

review/summary: HAIR!! not removed from pig ears and permanent GREEN MARKER
review/text: Very disappointed.  Based on all of the reviews, I was ecstatic thinking that my little Shiba Inu was going to love these.  First off, he doesn't really have a taste for them, so I have just been giving them away to friends who also have dogs.  Secondly, and most importantly, I have found that some of the pig ears have markings on them, like green marker permanently marked on the slivers.  Others have HAIR stuck to them, like old man EAR HAIR... it is the grossest thing I have ever seen in my life and now cannot get the image that has been permanently burned into my mind or the memory of the feeling of the hairs off of my hands.  I cannot believe that these hairs were not removed or that this part of the pig ear was not discarded.  I cannot believe that this was packaged and sold to dog owners.  This is as disgusting as feeding your domesticated pet the non-meat part of animals such as the nails, eyes, beaks, etc.  Be careful in choosing the product that you decide to buy and feed your beloved pet!!

However if you're buying this as a root beer you may be confused at first as this seems to be a bit of a blend between a cream soda and a root beer.  That being said I actually like it much better than Frostie's standard rootbeer or even any other rootbeer on the market, its that good!  If you can't afford ordering it online check if there's a Rocket Fizz store in your area (some bevmo's even have it).  Anyway it's an awesome drink and one of the best sodas available.<br /><br />p.s. Make sure you drink it straight from the bottle even if your usually the kinda of person that prefers having ice in your drink, trust me you'll thank me latter.<br /><br />John 3:16

review/summary: Clever Way to Hide MSG
review/text: dried autolyzed yeast extract = MSG<br /><br />If you want to find out if there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in a product, you must ask the manufacturer for information about "free glutamic acid."  Don't ask about "MSG."  Manufacturers find it convenient, when speaking to consumers, to tell them that there is no "MSG" in their product, meaning that there is no ingredient called "monosodium glutamate."  Even if a manufacturer tells you there is no MSG in a product, there may be autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed pea protein, carrageenan, sodium caseinate, enzymes, and a whole slew of other ingredients that contain or create processed free glutamic acid (MSG) during manufacture.<br /><br />If you are told that all of the MSG in a product is "naturally occurring," thank the manufacturer for that meaningless information, but explain that all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) is referred to as "natural" by the FDA -- so "natural" tells you nothing.  In fact, as the word "natural" is defined by the FDA, the food ingredient "monosodium glutamate" is "natural."<br /><br />It is the amount of processed free glutamic acid in the product that will determine whether or not you might suffer an MSG reaction. (Everyone has a different tolerance for MSG.) If the manufacturer claims not to know whether or not there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in his or her product, ask that the product be analyzed for free amino acids, including free glutamic acid. There are tests for measuring free glutamic acid. The AOAC Official Methods of Analysis (1984) gives one method. There are others. The cost of testing should be no more than $150.<br /><br />We have been advised by the FDA that if any such misbranded products are brought to their attention, they will act to correct the situation. To report misbranded products to the FDA, please call the FDA at 888-723-3366 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., eastern time - and keep a record of your call.

review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

review/summary: Possibly not the best solution
review/text: One of my dogs had a bladder stone and needed surgery. After her surgery, the vet said to prevent the stones, she needed to be on Royal Canin Urinary SO for life. However, a year on the food and her small 12 lbs body (healthy weight) jumped to 19 lbs, which is obviously not healthy for her small breed frame. Her activity level did not decrease and there were no other lifestyle changes besides the food. Even though it prevented more stones, that much weight gain is really risky and dangerous, it could have lead to other health problems. Unhappy with my vet's suggestion to simply walk her more (she already gets 3 walks a day!)  I did my own research and spoke with a pet nutritionist (expensive but worth it). Well little did I realize that this food contains tons of fillers and inferior by-products! Main ingredients include pork by-products and corn grits! The nutritionist recommended that I switch her to a home cooked diet with supplements (multi-vitamin) and urinary health vitamins (cranberry, hydrangea, etc.) to prevent bladder stones and continue to have her urine checked at the vet on a regular basis. Two years later, she's lost the weight and has had no more stones! She also has more energy! Most of the time I cook for her and other times I give her Merrick canned dog food with her urinary vitamins.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it certainly worked for my dog and I'm glad I didn't just accept this food as her fate and deal with the other health consequences that come along with being overweight. I would recommend that anyone with a dog who has issues with bladder stones to do their research and seek a second opinion about ways to deal with these health problems. Best of luck to you and your dog!

review/summary: My dog has no issues with this food
review/text: My schnauzer developed bladder stones that required surgery. She was put on this food, along with the dry version, to control that condition. Seems to be working and she eats it without hesitation...... No bladder stones since the diet started.

review/summary: Seems to work; not many options
review/text: This food seems to prevent bladder stones, but it's by no means loved by my dog.  She'll eat when she's very hungry and not before.  That said, she utterly turns up her nose at the only other commercially available canned bladder-health food I've been able to find, as well as any dry food at all.  I think it comes down to what your dog likes to eat - if possible, get a sample from your vet before you commit to pounds of the stuff.  That said, I have found that a little water and a bit of crumbled dehydrated chicken sprinkled over the well-mashed food do help matters.

review/text: The product is great. My dog loves it. This is the second time I've ordered this product and this time the shipping was more expensive. It also came from a different shipper this time that required a signature for delivery, I wasn't able to be home for signature though, so my poor dog had to suffer with grocery store canned dog food for a couple days. Anyhow, my dog loves this product and hopefully it will keep the stones away!

Please help, she does have the calcium problem that is why our vet put her on your food.<br />Also, could y0u send me a "sample" so I will not have to buy such a large bag?

review/text: These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion).  They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort.  Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body.

review/summary: Tasty & Natural, but high in Fat, try the ones w/ Spirulina
review/text: These bars are definitely tasty and natural, but they are higher in fat than most other snack bars (16g Fat, 3g of which is Sat. Fat).  They're also not as sweet (tasting more like trailmix than candy).  I prefer the "Spirulina & Cashew" bars: they taste very similar to this (with the only added ingredient being the Spirulina) and have 1g less Saturated Fat.  All are very filling.  I wouldn't have one every day, but they definitely can take the place of an evening meal (like when I'm on my way from work to evening classes).

I'm taking a box of these on my upcoming road trip for quick snacks or even meals to avoid eating out.

review/text: I like these bars. The ingredients are good and it feels nourishing to me. I like that they are not that sweet (I'm looking for an endurance boost, not a sugar spike). They are somewhat oily tasting but only from nuts and seeds. By being oily they fill you up nicely, much more than many other bars that wear off quickly. I like them and would recommend them if this sounds like something that you're after.

review/summary: Tastes good, but why so oily?
review/text: Update from July 2012:<br /><br />I just got my latest Subscribe & Save shipment of this product and it is different!  Previously I was receiving "Organic Live Food Bars, Cashew and Agave Nectar, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)" and now it has been changed to "Organic Live Food Bars, Golden Cashew, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)".  The biggest difference is the size - the bars are now 1.8 ounces each instead of 2.2 ounces, FOR THE SAME PRICE.  I didn't receive any notification that this was a new/different product and as I've been getting it regularly for so long I wouldn't have thought to check the product page here on Amazon.  Nice bait and switch, there.  Kind of ridiculous that I'd need to be vigilant about such a thing.<br /><br />The product tastes more or less the same (though for some reason the description "golden cashew" weirds me out, the name no longer mentions agave nectar though it's still in the ingredient list - maybe there's less of it?) - it's actually oilier, as hard as that is to believe, and is now about the size of a granola bar.  Disappointing.<br /><br />Review from December 2009:<br /><br />I like to have healthy, filling snacks on hand for those times when I rush around to get the kids out the door, sit down to work and an hour later realize I never ate any breakfast.  The Raw Revolution bar is a great source of energy - I can eat one and not be too weighed down, but have enough energy to work out before eating lunch without bottoming out.<br /><br />Some reviewers don't like the taste, I find it mild and not unappealing.  I love dates and this tastes quite a bit like them, with some crunchy nutty bits now and again.  It's slightly thick in consistency (as energy bars are wont to be) but with a glass of water easily palatable.<br /><br />The one huge drawback and why I can't rate this five stars is that it's just so oily - the inside of the package is slick with it and I can't even hold it in my fingers without getting grease all over them.  I don't understand why there needs to be this much oil, this bar would be perfect with less than half the amount it contains.<br /><br />I checked the nutritional information and one bar is 280 calories, 140 calories of that is from fat - a whopping 16 grams!  Why so much?  Is it the cashews?  I don't see any added oil in the ingredients so that's the only thing I can think of.  Perhaps they should consider adding more almonds and cut back on the cashews to make the bar less greasy.

The only one that I didn't like was the Spirulina, but my wife likes them.  The Agave and Cashew, like a prior poster wrote, smells like dirty feet.  If you can get beyond the smell and taste the thing, it tastes GREAT!!  The chocolate bars taste is cocoa chocolate, not candy bar chocolate.  I bought them at $12.50 per box.  At that cost, I would probably buy more.  But now that the cost is higher, I may not purchase any more.  All in all a great product!!

review/summary: Cashew and agave flavor - gross
review/text: The concept of these bars seemed pretty cool - 95% organic, live food, etc.  The fat in them is "good fat" so that's really not anything to worry about.<br /><br />The with the flavor I tried (Cashew and Agave Nectar) tasted HORRIBLE though.  To get an idea, imagine an old smelly shoe, rotted meat, and seaweed all mixed together and coated in grease.  That's what these tasted like.<br /><br />Amazon sometimes posts reviews of "similar items", so you might see this on a review for another flavor, whhich this doesn't apply to.  This revieww is only for the cashew/agave nectar.

review/summary: Good Nutrition and Taste
review/text: Most "nutritious/health" bars are none other than glorified candy. You will not find the Cashew & Agave Nectar tasting like a candy bar.  They are so good that I had two.  I intended to bring one home for my partner and wound up eating it and got her another one. I eat mostly raw foods, that is foods not cooked above 110 degrees.  I eat mostly greens, with enough raw nuts and seeds, sprouts, tahini (sesame) butter to add enough nutrition.  Raw veggies too.<br /><br />I think the average persons' senses are jaded with over sweet foods.  The Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bar is very tasty and a plus, not having soy products in it which I can't eat.<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised by a new less sweeter taste than in these glorified candy bars which are classified as "energy bars"

(Certified Organic, I was only able to taste the flax and amaranth. It didn't have almond flavor or cashew flavor.<br /><br />Raw is supposed to be better, and most of the raw things I've tried have tasted fantastic. This wasn't the case with this bar.

review/text: The picture displayed is not what was sent. The picture shows the old formula runts, what was shipped is the new formula runts. Two totally diffent flavors.<br />Not bad tasting but I wanted and like the old flavor better.

review/summary: Poor
review/text: The runts that I received did NOT match the picture.  The picture is the classic style, but I was sent the new style.  Either change the picture or send what is depicted.  This was almost a case of false advertising.

review/text: I was disappointed when I opened this order to see it was a handful of candy in a ziploc bag. Gross. Is that even legal?

review/summary: Quick delivery & product is excellent
review/text: I saw the other two reviews complaining about your sending the latest version of Runts and not the old ones.  Boo-hoo!!  The Willy Wonka factory is now, I believe on it's third batch of flavors.  I am quite sure they no longer make either of the two (or more) earlier versions and IF you want good, fresh candy - then you will always receive the latest kind of Runts available.  I suggest you write the seller BEFORE you purchase and see which ones he has to sell. Funny thing - I would have probably preferred the older ones also but since our local Sam's Club quit selling them, I just feel lucky to get any.  Karen, OK

review/summary: gourmet energy treats
review/text: These are fabulous. I love the balance of the nuts with the berries and cherries, which give them just a slight bit of chewiness with the overall crisp texture. These are a great pick-me-up when you're out all day, and this smaller package is really convenient. This is a totally satisfying healthy snack; you can't do better.

review/summary: Not the old peach tea
review/text: My favorite tea is Bentley's Black Peach Tea. The company no longer makes that product.  Instead, they sell a ginger peach tea.  The ginger is very strong, making the tea somewhat spicey.  It is an ok flavor, but not nearly as good as the old black peach they used to sell.  I will not be ordering any more of this tea.
