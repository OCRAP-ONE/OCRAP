review/summary: McDougall's Pea Soup
review/text: I didn't know I liked pea soup. I thought I hated it, but after reading all the positive reviews I decided to try it. The reviewers here are right! It's really tasty, with a smoky flavor- and it satisfies my lunchtime hunger.

review/summary: Very tasty in a meal-size portion
review/text: This is a very tasty soup for a dehydrated-then-reconstituted product--better than other similar brands I've tried, and all natural too.  Plus I like the larger size (it IS available in a smaller size as well) for making a meal out of the soup.  This along with some crackers and fruit makes a convenient lunch for those dining-at-the-desk days.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I stumbled across this particular soup in my local supermarket looking for another brand of dried soup besides the boring stuff I've eaten up to that point.  It was only after I got home and decided to eat it that I discovered that it was a vegan-type product.  I am not a vegan, nor will I ever be, but I can respect the reasons for not eating meat, or related products.  Anyway, to my surprise, this soup is really good!  Despite the fact that it does not contain any animal-related substances, Dr. MacDougall has successfully proven that animals are not needed. The broth is very tasty and it has a good consistency.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that the sodium level is somewhat high, at 300 mg. per serving, and the cup holds TWO supposed servings, but, fortunately, the seasoning comes in a separate packet, so you adjust what amount you prefer to add.  I put only half of the seasoning in, and it still tastes good, but maybe that isn't for everyone, especially those who don't need to watch their sodium intake.

review/summary: Easy, quick, healthful snack
review/text: I'm a huge McDougall cuppa soup fan. I've tried them all and the Split Pea is my favorite. It's creamy with bits of barley and reconstituted dehydrated veggies. I always feel good about reaching for a cuppa instead of some unhealthy snack with lots of useless calories.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers regarding the portion size. There's no way to eat half the contents of the cup and save the rest for later or share with someone. The labelling should be changed to reflect that the container holds one serving, not two, and all the nutrition facts should be changed accordingly.

review/summary: Best I have tried
review/text: I usually would not take the time to go to amazon and write a review of split pea soup, but this is so good, I made the effort. It has little chunks of carrrots and ground parsely in it, and it's delicious. I took a star off my rating because of high sodium - 600 mg per container. That's about a quarter of the RDA, so for people watching their sodium intake, it may not be a great choice.

review/text: I have tried most of the Dr. McDougall line.  This one isn't my favorite, but it's pretty darned good.  People think of Split Pea soup as a bland choice.  This one isn't.  It has a smokey flavor that is surprising from a vegan product.  Pretty healthy for an instant soup, but the idea this is two servings is ridiculous.

For people who are less knowledgeable about food allergies and purchase this for themselves or another, it could cause some serious issues.  Whoever classifies this food, Amazon or the manufacturer, should probably explain their labels better or remove the gluten free classification.  It's very misleading.

I followed the instructions to a T and the stuff was gross and had the weirdest consistency of any soup I've ever had.  I'm only lucky I bought this using a $5 Amazon gift card I had, otherwise I would have been out $10 of my own money instead of just $5.<br /><br />Bleh, the smell is pretty gross too, its still lingering in my kitchen.  Think I'll just give these to my health freak friend, she'll eat anything so long as its organic and vegan, no matter how crappy it tastes.

Finally, a friend of mine gave me a pack of this and I used it with EZ cup and EZ filter on Keurig B60 system. 1.5 tablespoon of this finely ground coffee brews a great 8/10 oz cup of rich, bold coffee. This is BOLD but DOES NOT leave bitter taste in your mouth. The seller is quick to ship and has great communication in addition to offering free shipping.

review/summary: Flavorful Change
review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.

review/text: stumped by a hard to chew review, maybe with no teeth, as this is easy to cut and chew, not like nearly rock hard cured italian meats; taste is slightly spicy- about halfway between sweet and hot sausage for comparison; and a very good deal; ordered a top-rated pepperoni, one stick, was $13 and over $9 for ship+handle (won't do that again); this is 4 chubs, probably 6+ times the weight and size, but only $23 and $6 ship+handle; can't say it very often but a good product that's underpriced

review/text: My family loves the Bridgford Italian Salami chubs. You can cut it, slice it, chunk it any way you want. It's very tasty,not too salty or fatty like some other products. Once you taste it, you are hooked. Since it is cured and doesn't need to be refrigerated, it's perfectly safe to order by mail.We had to mailorder, since the supermarkets in this area don't carry it anymore.

review/summary: So-so quality, bland taste
review/text: Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.

review/text: I just tried Bridgford Hard Salami for the first time. I'm no salami expert, but I have been eating food my whole life, and this tastes really good in my opinion. The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again.

review/summary: Other then greasy, an excellent salami
review/text: To be fair, I didn't purchase this product.  But I found it outside of someone's home as I was wandering the streets.  What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like "Mntijo" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.

review/summary: Core Power: HoneyMilk reincarnated
review/text: Core Power is the rebranded product that was once known as HoneyMilk.  I was really excited to be able to order this product easily through Amazon (HoneyMilk was only available through their original website and some stores, but none in my state).  I'm rating this product a 3 because I'm comparing it to the old version that I was really happy with.<br /><br />2 quick notes about the rebranded product:<br />1. Sometimes I feel a little silly drinking something called "Core Power" in front of non-athletes and HoneyMilk never had that weird serious-athlete-connotation.<br />2. This product definitely tastes different, and I prefer the original version.  That being said, I will probably still purchase it and drink after long runs and races, I will just not consume it as often as I used to (several times a week).

review/summary: BEWARE - This is NOT the same as the old Honey Milk Light.  Has sugar alcohol in it!
review/text: Very, very disappointed with this.  I was a huge, huge fan of the original Honey Milk Light Chocolate and waited very anxiously while the brand conversion was made from Honey Milk to Core Power.  I did NOT expect the product to change, and from their message boards it didn't sound like it was.<br /><br />Well, guess what?  It did.  Amazon finally had cases of the Core Power Chocolate Light available and I excitedly ordered one even though the price had gone up $10.  This morning, I took one sip of the new chocolate drink and instantly knew something was wrong.  It tasted disgusting - like diet milk - and had a strong aftertaste like I had just drunk a Diet Coke.  Sure enough, when I compared the ingredient list to a Coffee Honey Milk Light that I still had, they had changed the formula to use a sugar alcohol as a sweetener!!  Yuck!<br /><br />It looks like the "regular" version of Core Power stayed true to the original honey milk formula, but I don't really want the calorie/sugar trade off to get 6 extra grams of protein.  The original light version of Honey Milk was perfect.  Thanks for screwing it up.  You should at least tell people that the formula changed before the blow $40 on this lame product.  I want my money back!<br /><br />BTW, the picture of the nutritional label that is currently posted on the product page (as of 6/14/2012) is not accurate and does not match what is on the bottle.  The ingredient list does not show that it contains erythritol (the sugar alcohol).

review/text: I purchased a case of the Core Power Chocolate Light for my daughter to drink after her high school Cross Country practices. Her coach made a `big deal' out of the importance of "nutritional recovery" at the parent meeting, and I liked the fact that Core Power is all-natural and a good source of protein.<br /><br />My daughter loves the taste of the Core Power Chocolate Light, and because the product is shelf stable, she can grab a bottle on the way to school in the morning and have it ready for the 30 minute recovery window after practice or a meet.<br /><br />I also ordered a case of Core Power Strawberry-Banana Light for my older daughter, and had it shipped directly to her at college. She works out in the morning and Core Power serves not only as a recovery drink, but breakfast, as well!<br /><br />Great product, thanks!

Then I added some cubed chicken (mostly cooked) and coconut milk to coat the chicken completely.  At this point I also added some chili powder and cayenne to increase the spice level of the dish.  Lastly, I simmered on low for a while until the chicken finished cooking and then I served the curry chicken over white rice.  The only thing that would have made the meal better is some naan bread!

But, what you have to realize is that those prices reflect Amazon's 3rd party vendors, and not Amazon themselves. Once Amazon starts carrying the Hunts Snack Packs, prices will be more closer to reality. But, in the interim, 3rd party's fill the void.

But, lately, I've been disappointed with the amount of pudding in the cup, which is rather small to begin with.  Now, I keep finding an air bubble in the center of the cup, reducing the amount of pudding a good 20% - 30%.  I hadn't noticed that in the past.  Is it a fluke?  Or is it a covert price increase?  Well, so far, I've found a substantial air bubble in three snack packs, a total of 12 cups.  What would have been 5 stars is reduced to 3 stars until the air bubble disappears from the pudding cup.

review/summary: Natural OR Artificial Flavor, your choice
review/text: So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a "spice flavor not found in nature," they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

review/summary: My exclusive relationship with Good Earth Original tea
review/text: Saying I love this tea is a huge understatement. I have been drinking it exclusively for about eight years. The taste of this tea is rich in cinnamon with a hint of orange. Some people find it so sweet that no sweetening is needed even if you like your tea sweet. Surprisingly, there's no sugar or artificial sweeteners in it.<br /><br />I once called the company to find out what is in the tea that makes it so sweet and was told that the ingredients are a proprietary blend of the herbs listed in the package ingredients, plus some artificial flavor. One might expect to see stevia among the ingredients since it's a sweet tasting herb, but it's not there so we are left to ponder the mystery of what makes this tea so sweet.<br /><br />If caffeine is an ingredient you want, or want to avoid, be aware that this tea is available with or without it, and the packages look similar. The main difference in the appearance of the packages is that the caffeinated tea has some printing in grey whereas the herbal blend package is printed almost entirely  in brown. It's fairly easy to mistake them, so if you want the herbal blend you need to look for the words "Caffeine Free" and "Herbal" on the package or in the product description. Both the herbal and herbal blend say "Original" on the packages.<br /><br />A few years ago I started adding a splash of soy milk to my tea which cools it and gives it a slightly creamy taste. When I serve it to friends for the first time, they invariably ask what it is. When I take it with me in an insulated cup, people nearby often ask what I'm drinking that smells so good!

review/summary: Alert! No longer the Good Earth you remember
review/text: I've been drinking and evangelizing Good Earth for probably close to 20 years, and have turned a lot of people on to it. A lot of "natural" brands emerged over the last 20-30 years, and most felt like they were sort of greenwashing exercises. Good Earth was a product and company that I actually loved and trusted. The original herbal Good Earth tea is sort of irreplaceable as a sweet, caffeine free natural beverage. Two hours ago, I would have given it a 5-star rating based on the box that's in my cupboard.<br /><br />But I just got back from the store, where I discovered that in addition to changing the package (sad but no big deal), they've changed the recipe to include artificial flavorings. I'm absolutely flabbergasted that they have decided to throw away decades of customer trust this way. Artificial flavors in Good Earth tea! I want to die, just so I can roll over in my own grave.<br /><br />Is the tea still tasty? I expect so, though when you throw chemical flavorings into the mix, my beverage options just got about a thousand times broader, and I don't think I'll ever find out. Are artificial flavors really that bad? Again, maybe not, and when I'm lazy I'm sure I consume a lot of them. But that makes the loss of a really great natural product that much harder to take.<br /><br />If it were any other product or brand, I wouldn't give it a second thought. But as I said, Good Earth was special. Almost sacred, as I could do a little relaxation ritual during my day that centered around it. Now it feels like that tiny but precious sacred trust has been broken, and I feel curiously hurt by it.<br /><br />It's hard not to feel like they've turned their back on the natural ethos that the original core customer base embraces, and corrupted the name Good Earth irreparably. They certainly have for me.

It possibly was contaminated with something. Even the small cardboard tab with the string had an oily residue on it. Good Earth says it was made in China per the numbers on the box. I reported to the store where I purchased. They are talking with the corporate office. Good Earth will be getting one of the two boxes I have for testing. I will not use this product again. I have been using this tea for approximately 10 years. About a year ago, they changed to the "new look" box. I could no longer get 1.5 cups of tea per tea bag. It was barely enough for one cup. And it didn't taste the same. Have any other Good Earth "Sweet and Spicy" tea drinkers experienced the same?

review/summary: New look but not same great taste!
review/text: I have loved the Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy caffeine free tea for as long as I can remember.  For some reason, Safeway and Trader Joes stopped selling it, so I ordered 12 boxes from Amazon.  Before ordering, I noticed they had changed the box design, but also noticed the new box said, "New Look, Same Great Taste", so I felt I would get the same great tea I have loved for many years.  Not the case!!!  The tea tastes very different from the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea I love.  When I called Good Earth to speak to someone about this, the customer service representative told me there was no change made to the tea, but new packaging.  I told him that couldn't be true and he finally told me that they have added artificial sweeteners and flavors to the Good Earth tea that comes in the new packaging.  He said if I wanted to get the tea I was used to tasting, I would need to buy the 25 count tea box not the 18 count box.  This doesn't make any sense to me at all, but I wanted to let Amazon customers know how to get the tea that they have come to love from Good Earth.  The representative from Good Earth said I could call 1-866-972-6879 to order the true original Good Earth caffeine tea in the 25 count box and it wouldn't have the newly added artificial flavors or sweeteners that they put in the tea that comes in the 18 count box.  Amazon may also sell the 25 count box, I will have to check.  Note: I just realized I selected the wrong product for my review. I purchased the 18 count Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy Tea, not the 25 count box.  If I had purchased the 25 count box, all would have been fine.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: If you don't want artificial ingredients, you must buy the 25 bag box.  The 16 count box description lists the ingredients incorrectly. Artificial flavor is the 3rd ingredient in the 16 count box. Despite the pic, this is the tea in the tan, not purple, box. Some claim the artificial ingredient variety tastes better. It might be slightly weaker without the artificial ingredient but this stuff still rocks! My husband thinks the natural tastes better, I'm not convinced I can tell a difference. I enjoy tea but I'm not a tea fanatic. I first had this stuff at the Garchen Institute and haven't been without it since. I now hoard this tea. I buy it in bulk and keep it in my emergency food supply.  If I could pack one suitcase before being dropped off on a deserted island, this tea would go in that suitcase. One negative is it seems to make me cough a little sometimes.  I think the cinamon is slightly irritating to those with sensitive respiratory/digestive tracts, but no one else I know has this problem.

review/summary: Best Tea in the World!
review/text: This is my favorite tea and has been for over twenty years. It is naturally sweet; you do NOT have to add any sugar. It has a mild cinnamon flavor and a hint of clove. This is a tisane; it's made of herbs and does not contain any tea, but it has a full-bodied flavor. For medical reasons, I have to drink caffeine-free tea now. This "tea" has more flavor than another other caffeine-free tea I've ever tasted. I used to drink the regular, caffeinated version of this tea, which is made of tea and the same herbs (tastes the same). The regular version is fantastic for stopping headaches (contains caffeine). If I sipped a cup or two of the regular version at the first sign of a migrane, it would prevent the migraine developing any further. Try this caffeine-free or the regular version. Both are delicious, hot or iced.

review/text: I purchased this tea after reading about its benefits in helping lower blood glucose levels.  I have Type II Diabetes and thought I'd at least try this to see if it works!  It does!  Since I've been drinking a cup of this everyday, my blood glucose levels have gone down about 30 points!  I'm really glad I tried this!  But I have to say, you have to add some Splenda or Sweet n Low to make it easier to drink!  The cinnamon is VERY STRONG, but with the sweetener, it makes it very enjoyable to drink!  Also, the smell is wonderful!  It makes everyday feel like Christmas!

review/summary: Much better than the "organic" version
review/text: I have two cups of herbal tea sitting in front of me right now. One has the original herbal tea and the other has the organic herbal tea. The organic version has more rooibos flavor and less cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />I am not a fan of rooibos and I'm a big fan of cinnamon. So, count this as another vote for the original, "inorganic" version of Good Earth herbal tea.  It is a better price, too.<br /><br />While waiting for the tea to arrive I went through all kinds of contortions to brew my own.  I ended up settling for a concoction consisting of 6-8 whole cloves, 9 3-inch cinnamon sticks, and 4 bags of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFM7U6">Numi Tea Dry Desert Lime Herbal Tessan, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> brewed in 1.7 liters of hot water in a thermos carafe.  It wasn't half bad but definitely not as good as the real thing!

review/summary: My bassett hound LOVES his food now...
review/text: Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try "Canidae". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.

review/summary: Good price for a highly rated dog food
review/text: I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.

review/text: I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website.

review/summary: Great choice for the active young dog!
review/text: I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.

review/summary: Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull
review/text: I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).

review/text: We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food.

review/summary: best food out there
review/text: Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My dog has a very sensitive digestive tract.  She's been in the hospital for severe diarrhea and vomiting.  We switched her to this Canidae food (as well as putting her on some meds and making sure she doesn't get outside food/treats) and she's done great since.  And she loves it.  We haven't had any issues with it what so ever.

review/summary: Cost effective & so far a good alternative
review/text: We have a 52lb Basset/Beagle/who knows. For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains "gas" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.

review/summary: Dog loves the Canidae
review/text: My dog has had diarhea problems with all sorts of dog foods in the past.  We switched him to this a couple months ago and he is doing great.  This food was recommended by our pet store and I agree that it is not only healthy, but gentle on my dogs touchy stomach.

review/text: This brand of dog food was recommended to us for our Black Lab, Sadie, as it is very healthy. She absolutely loves it, and her coat is very shiny. We can tell that this is good food, as she is very satisfied. Will definitely order this and possibly other flavors again.

review/summary: Great dog food... A little expensive
review/text: Ingredient wise.... one of the best dog foods in the market. Of course, a bit on the expensive side. Our 3 dogs love this food.

The canidae has a good name, top ingredients and at time great price<br />Went to order another bag 1 mo later and price had changed by $6-$7 per bag.  Am now looking again.

review/summary: very good
review/text: Bought this a month ago and it seems to be working very well for my dogs and me.  My dogs can not have any wheat or corn and it is hard to find a dog food at a reasonable price that contains neither.  I'll keep ordering it.  It is handy to have it delivered to my door.

review/summary: Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
review/text: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.
