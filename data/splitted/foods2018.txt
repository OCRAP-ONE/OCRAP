review/summary: Love the concept, love the taste, but they changed something recently!
review/text: I found this at Marshalls over a year ago (spring of 2011), and I immediately fell in love with them.  I bought everything that they had in the store, but after that I decided to look for it on Amazon.  Sure enough, Amazon had it and it was great.  Although there were a lot of reviews about these gummy bears melted when ordered during the summer, that never happened to me.  However, I did see some very thin layer of crust, or more like powdered sugar around each gummy bear.  It was also a little softer than normal gummy bears, but still chewy.  I just LOVED the texture that was so perfect!  Although some people complained in their review about the "crust" (or white powdered sugar looking effect", in fact, I actually liked that, and it not only bothered me, but I thought it was far better than supper rubbery gummy bears that are sold at supermarkets.<br /><br />I have chosen the subscribe and save option to keep getting them for my kids (and myself), but since around April 2012, something has changed!  The gummy bears inside the package are smaller and they have 12 gummy bears vs they used to have 9 in each packet.  They are also a little harder/more rubbery...:(  I liked the softer, easily chewable aspect about these gummy bears so I don't really love the ones we get through Amazon these days, which is really too bad...<br /><br />So, I went to TJ Max today and saw some sold there, so I felt the gummy bears over the bags, and they didn't feel as hard, so I took a risk and bought a few bags (of 10s).  Guess what - they were exactly like what they used to be like!  So, somehow, they are totally different!!!<br /><br />Then I was looking at the packages after I got home, and compared the ones from TJ Max and from Amazon, and found the small prints, saying Made in Mexico or Dominican Republic.  I am guessing one kind might be made in Mexico and another in Dominican Republic.<br /><br />Since I like the taste/texture of the ones that I used to receive, and the ones that I receive from Amazon are not quite the same any more, I will be canceling my subscription and buying them from Marshalls/TJ Max in the future.  The only problem is that I need to buy a whole lot whenever I see them, as I don't think they carry them all the time...

review/text: These are my go-to snack when I need a little sugar pick me up. Since these have natural sugars, they are better for you than the high fructose gummies that you'll find in your office's vending machine.  These are gluten free, and super tasty. As another reviewer mentioned they are made with gelatin, so they're not vegan, but I prefer the consistency of these gummies, compared to say the Sharkies fruit snacks. Subscribe&Save saves 15%!

review/text: I ordered these based on the opinion of an athletic trainer.  They are very delicious, not full of nasty things like corn syrup, and help maintain your energy on long runs without making you feel sick to the stomach, like a lot of the sports gels do.  OK, I'll admit that I also snack on them sometimes when I am not training since they are so good!  They are perfect for this purpose - take one or two small bears every few miles and you keep going.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Unfortunately, I had the same experience as several other reviewers.  The Gummy Bears were obviously very old. They were hard, white on the outside and many were cracking. And I might have been okay with them being a little stale, but they were gross.  I had read the other reviews that said the same, but thought maybe that had just been a bad batch at some point a long time ago. My order in December 2011 was definitely not within the freshness date. I looked all over the package to try to find a manufacture date or "fresh by" date and there wasn't one, which is likely part of the problem, if the packages were dated, the shipper would be able to verify they weren't sending out old food. I would order somewhere else. As much as I pay for safe treats that my kids can have it's worth it paying a little more for a fresh product.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: Weary of what others had written, I ordered these. I instantly liked them. So much in fact, I ate too many. I got a headache.<br /><br />I got mine during 70-degree weather, and they were soft and chewy and stretchy. They are very juicy, and have a natural taste to them (which I expected, after all, no artificial stuff in these). They come in portion appropriate bags, where each little bag has 90 calories. There are about 15 bears in each bag, red, orange and yellow. I liked the yellow ones best.<br /><br />When they arrived I was eager to get into the bag to taste, so I tried to open it by pulling on the sides to open in the top. This was not very successful! I eventually noticed the slit at the top, which facilitates opening by pulling it open on the side.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars because I had a problem stopping eating these, and as a result I got a nasty sugar head ache and an icky feeling in my tummy. If I had more self discipline, I would have given these 5 stars, but they are irresistible.

review/summary: He Loves The New Friskies Seafood Sensations.
review/text: Well it was time once again to visit the grocery store and the prime item to pick up was at more cat food. Boy, the stuff really goes fast! I have two cats and both are neutered males. One (Boo) is about five years old and the other (The Fuzz) is about six. Both will gobble up any kind of cat food and eat as much of it as they can get. They're not fussy eaters at all. However, there's one problem. Boo has a condition that requires an expensive prescription food (Hills Prescription Diet C/D Multicare) or he develops little crystals in his urinary tract and that requires the expensive services of a vet. The Fuzz, on the other hand, will gobble down any kind of cat food you give him and beg for more.  However, I question giving him the same thing over and over, or even the same brand. As such, I switch around through about a half-dozen kinds my nearby store has to offer. This time I picked up a 3.15 pound bag of Friskies Seafood Sensations containing four seafood flavors plus a bit of seaweed. I gave it a first try with The Fuzz this evening. As predicted, it was gobbled right down, just like any other cat food I feed him. Evidently, the people at pet food manufacturing companies have it down as to exactly what like to eat. I might be concerned about their long-term health. However, The Fuzz has been 100% healthy on his dry catfood diet so. He loves the new Friskies Seafood Sensations, I should add. Please note that the product offered here is in a bag that is twice the size of that which I had purchased. I'd prefer this larger bag, but my neighborhood market doesn't offer it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

There is no sweetness, as one should expect, given the name "Glazed."<br />This is really false advertising.  There was no "glaze" on this product.  I feel very cheated.  Amazon should drop these from their product line, and refund money to customers like me who were misled into ordering them.

review/summary: The Cure
review/text: It is the 11th of May, 2011. My doctor has just informed me that my Jimmies are terminally rustled.<br /><br />I had no idea how to react. Would any reaction I had be legitimate? Or would it be tainted by the state of my Jimmies?<br /><br />I've been living with RJS (Rustled Jimmy Syndrome) for almost a year now. I've tried more "cures" than would intimidate even a cancer patient. At first I tried wearing a three-wolf shirt. It helped with my self-esteem, but it didn't do anything about my Jimmies. I even tried buying a $2,000 HDMI cable, hoping the multidimensional X-Rays that would be exuding from my television would be enough to unrustle my Jimmies on a molecular level. That was $2,000 wasted.<br /><br />I had no hope. That is, until I found Gorilla Munch. The primary ingredient in Gorilla Munch, Love(tm), provided high enough levels of necessary nutrients to unrustle even my Jimmies! After consulting my doctor, I've received the news that the rustling in my Jimmies is in regression, and I should expect to have completely unrustled Jimmies by August 2012.<br /><br />I cannot thank this cereal enough for what it's done for me.

review/summary: I'm a Believer
review/text: Everyone knows the old saying: "A box on the table keeps my jimmies stable."  But is that just more of an old wives tale, or does this archaic rhyme actually hold some truth to it?<br />I, like many others, had a tough time making it through the day.  I would drag myself out of bed at 7'oclock, and sigh as I began my daily routine.  Shave, shower, put on my suit, hastily eat a bowl of Cheerios, and then hurry out the door.  That's when I would begin to feel my jimmies being rustled.  Sitting there, stuck in traffic, as a BMW cuts me off.  I finally pull into the parking lot, and somebody has stolen my usual parking spot.  My jimmies become rustled even further.  I get into the office, head to the break room to get a cup of coffee, and there's nothing left in the pot.  It's only 9'oclock in the morning, and already my jimmies have been extremely rustled.  By that point I figure my jimmies cannot be rustled even further, when my boss comes in and yells at me for only working 12 hours yesterday.  What he doesn't know is how late I stayed up working my *ss off for him, only to have my wife walk in on me making cereal at 4'oclock in the morning.  She asked me, with stress in her voice, what I was doing up that late and I reluctantly replied, "because I've lost control of my jimmies..."  By lunch time, where they're always out of hamburgers, my jimmies lay on their deathbeds from the constant rustling.<br />I didn't think there was anything I could do.  I had come to accept the fact that my jimmies may be eternally rustled, a condition my physician diagnosed as Rustled Jimmie Syndrome, or RJS.  I looked on the internet for answers, but it seemed like nobody knew how I could keep my jimmies unrustled.  Finally, somebody contacted me with a tip: "There is no need to be upset, try the cereal Gorilla Munch.  A box on the table will keep your jimmies stable."<br />At that point, I was willing to try anything.  I rushed to Whole Foods and found a box of Gorilla Munch.  Even after just looking at the box, I could begin to feel my jimmies becoming unrustled.  The gorilla on the front had such a calm look to him.  I got home a placed the box on my kitchen table.  That gorilla on the box seemed to stare in to my soul, as if trying to hush me, and plead with me, "Shh, no tears.  Only dreams now."  After my first bite of the delicious cereal, I could tell my jimmies were heading back to a peaceful, unrustled state.<br />The next morning I went through my normal routine, but this time, I munched on breakfast with my new gorilla friend and his amazing cereal.  The world seemed brighter, as if that gorilla's laid-back, calming attitude had pulled a golden blanket of deliciousness over my jimmies and tucked them into bed.  Suddenly, being cut-off didn't rustle my jimmies.  They were no longer rustled by having my parking spot stolen, or even there being no hamburgers left at lunch.  Even after a yelling from my boss, my jimmies remained unrustled.<br />I cannot recommend Gorilla Munch any more highly.  I'm a new person.  You cannot even imagine how unrustled my jimmies are.

review/summary: Unable to eat it
review/text: I eat almond butter because I am allergic to peanuts.  I usually purchase almond butter from my local health food store, a good, reliable but pricey product.  I thought I'd give the Maranatha from amazon.com a try to save a little money.  I looked all over the product listing for ingredients and info, but there was none, but I ordered anyway.  Not only does it have sugar and palm oil, but it also may contain traces of peanuts according to the label.  I ended up having to give it away because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, but I sure won't be purchasing more.

review/text: I absolutely loveee almond butter and I know it is super healthy for you... making it a win win situation for me. I am very health conscious so I love when I can find something that is enjoyable. The texture is perfect not tooo chunky and not to "mealy". For those of you who like a little touch of sweet and mostly just the natural earthy taste of almonds I recommend this.<br /><br />It is very thick so a little would go a long way for those of you who would spread this on toast or something, which is a bonus at the price per jar. (though without mentioning names I have seen more expensive brands of almond butter in smaller jars and not as tasty so I personally cannot complain about the price)<br />I personally eat one tablespoon for extra energy in the afternoon before the gym but I would imagine this nut butter is fantastic anyway and probably straight out of the jar with your finger! Enjoy!

review/summary: Papaya leaf tea fights cancer (all types) & increases platelets
review/text: To the person who said they need more info on papaya leaf tea: Recently Florida researchers found that a water extract of papaya leaves and twigs inhibits many kinds of cancer cells in vitro. The stronger the tea, and the more you consume, the better. They said you could take it for as long as you want, as it is harmless to normal cells. It is also very helpful for kidneys and liver. It is kind of bitter tasting, but mixing it with peppermint or marjoram improves the taste. If you take it regularly you will find you learn to like it, however, because of the good way it makes you feel. I haven't bought this brand-I get mine from  or from . I had heard for many many years that papaya leaf was used for cancer, but I didn't pay much attention until I read the research. Try it.

review/summary: Not bad coffee candy, but not great either
review/text: Bali's Best Original Coffee Candy is a round dark brown hard candy, not overly sweet, with a good coffee taste from the start. Bali's Original had a nice coffee flavor. After all they use a coffee extract for the flavoring and it is #4 on the ingredient list of 8 items. But when compared A B with one of the truly strong coffee flavored candies, it comes up way short.  6 out of 10.<br />  Bali's Best Latte is a round dark brown hard candy with a creamy center. Neither the hard candy nor the creamy center is very sweet. It was a real surprise that the coffee flavor wasn't as pronounced as the Bali's Best Original Coffee Candy reviewed above. After noticing coffee listed twice in the ingredients list (coffee extract & natural coffee) I just expected more. So although it is better than no coffee candy at all, it wasn't a top scorer.  4 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless. Mike

Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!!

review/text: The Lindt Lindor candy company has always made outstanding quality chocolates. Happily, they're widely available now, even in my local supermarket. But unfortunately I can still only order these Raspberry Truffles online or drive an hour to Cost Plus.<br /><br />I love raspberry and chocolate together, and this combination is absolute perfection. The flavors are beautifully balanced, rich, and decadent. The glossy shell has a delightful snap, and the silky truffle filling melts on your tongue. I sincerely hope Lindt Lindor never compromises on quality in their candy making like so many other American chocolate makers have in recent years - like substituting cocoa butter for partially hydrogenated fats, skimping on portions, exporting factories to Mexico, etc.<br /><br />If you love quality chocolate and raspberry together - look no further!

He swore it was the best, beating out all other brands.  I had a couple of pieces and fell in love.  I love dark chocolate, first of all, and I put it in the fridge to chill it.  The raspberry was mild but flavorful, not over-powering like other brands.  I will definitely buy these again!  And I know I will get a special Christmas kiss for finding his favorite candy.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Let me first state that I love Lindt products.  That was the main reason I purchased this box of candy, because I had a good idea of what I was actually buying.  I was also aware that it is a terrible idea to purchase chocolate via mail order during the summer because you will probably end up getting a melted chocolate mess instead of what you wanted.  I thought that it would be ok since I was making this order in December,therefore not much danger of the candy melting. So - what went wrong? - why wasn't I happy with my purchase considering that the chocolate was not melted and I love Lindt?  I've had these chocolate truffles before and they have always had a creamy center.  So the raspberry chocolates were supposed to have a creamy raspberry center - all liquid, gooey and delicious.  The ones I recieved do not have a creamy center!!  I have no idea why this is.  Maybe these chocolates are defective?  I don't know.  But there is NO raspberry in these chocolates.  They sort of smell of raspberries.  But when you eat them they are just chocolate - which is not what I thought I was ordering.  The chocolate is a little old with some white spots on it, but that doesn't bother me that much. They still taste like high quality chocolate.  I'm thinking about melting them into a fondue.  I'm just dissapointed because I wanted raspberry filling :(  At the same time I also ordered the mint truffles as well.  I have not recieved them yet.  I'm hoping that they will have the mint filling.  I hope it works out.  I might order Lindt chocolates again from Amazon, but probably not the truffles.  I'll see if I can get the truffles from somewhere else.  If you are really into high quality - mass produced chocolate I recommend buying from Russel Stover.  Last summer I bought 2 boxes of Mint Dreams, a box with milk chocolate and a box of dark chocolate.  I had to pay more for shipping during the summer because they packed the shipping box FULL of ice packs.  Nothing was melted and the Mint Dreams were AMAZING.  And Mint Dreams are almost impossible to find in my area - So I was extremely happy with Russel Stover.  They cost a bit more but they were worth it.

review/summary: The easy way to clean your dog's teeth
review/text: Our vet suggested these chews for my young hound, who was starting to get some soft tartar buildup on her teeth. I've tried to get in the habit of brushing my dogs' teeth, but it's just never worked for me. It's like flossing my own teeth--I'll do it for a few weeks, then forget a few times and eventually stop. But these treats are so easy! And my dogs love them, too! I give my dogs one of these treats every evening as a way to relax and wind down from the day. After my younger dog ate the first one, I could see a noticeable improvement in her teeth. After eating several, her teeth are now gleaming white! Yams will only do so much, though. These only work to remove soft gunk on the teeth that could be removed with a brush. Any hard deposits will require a dental at your vet's office. My 13-year-old husky/shepherd mix (multiple health issues) got a little ill after the first one and threw up, but we tried again another night with a smaller piece, and he was fine with it. It's the only thing we've found that he enjoys chewing in his old age. We do only give them ONE per day, however, although both dogs would happily devour an entire bag of them every day. I'm pretty sure you can overdo the fiber in these, and that could lead to all kinds of issues, I'm sure. The extra fiber seems to make their stools slightly softer, but they haven't seen actual diarrhea from them. In fact, I think the added fiber helps to keep the dogs more "regular." The vet also said that the yams are a good source of beta carotene, so they're even nutritious. One thing to keep in mind is that the Big Boyz size is really not that huge. My hound is 60 pounds, and they're fine for her size. My elderly shepherd/husky is 70 pounds, and he is fine with one of the smaller ones in the bag (the sizes within the bag do vary, as do the sizes of sweet potatoes).

review/summary: Big Boyz dog chews
review/text: Our dog absolutely loves these chews; they do not stain household surfaces and they have no offensive odors like some other dog chews (bull pizzle for example).  The chews help to keep her teeth clean and the fiber keeps her regular.  I highly recommend these chews for your companion animal.  I would recommend starting out with a small trial order first since not all dogs seem to be so smitten with these like ours was(one of our family members tried the chews with her 2 dogs but they, the dogs, prefer traditional chews so we were actually first introduced to the chews by our relative and we have been ordering these ever since).

review/text: I loved the concept - an energy drink made of healthy stuff useful not only for hydration but for energy. I had hopes of eliminating all soda and using this drink on hikes, workouts, etc. However it doesn't taste good, dilutes with very little water, and doesn't mix well. Did anyone at the company taste this stuff? Please go back to the drawing board. You had a great idea but this stuff doesn't work.<br /><br />Edit: the company has reached out to me and attempted to revisit this product. Amazing really in today's age of corporate and customer service indifference. I appreciate that kind of support and will try this product again because of the company's dedication to customer satisfaction and support. Thank you.

review/summary: Not a fan of the flavor, but gave me energy!
review/text: So, on the individual packets, this does not say how much water to mix it with. I would have liked that part to be on the individual packets so when I am preparing one at work or elsewhere, and I forget - I can check.<br /><br />When I poured it into the water, it started bubbling like alka-seltzer. This drink is effervescent, but does not retain the bubbling effect while you drink it. It mixes fairly well with cold water.<br /><br />Sadly, I was not a fan of the flavor. It gave me the feeling in my stomach that I get when I drink a diet soda. Not sure what it is or if others feel it too, but it is as if I can feel the liquid in my stomach. And the flavor was not very strong. The best way I can describe it is by comparing the flavor to a green tea, where the flavor tastes like it was lightly added and kind of dry. The flavor might be favorable to some, but I was not a fan.<br /><br />I did, however, feel more energy than normal for the remainder of my work shift. I generally feel tired about 75% of the way through my shift, and after having this in the beginning of my work shift, I did not get the tired feeling.<br /><br />So, in conclusion: This EBOOST drink did not meet my taste requirements, but it did indeed provide me with energy so I guess it was a small price to pay for the benefits. I would have rather enjoyed a better tasting drink though.

review/summary: Smells so much better than it tastes
review/text: I love pomegranate flavor and love all things fizzy, so I was excited to try this new energy boost supplement. The powder dissolved rather easily in water though it left a bit of a chalky pink color to the water.  The smell was very fruity and promising.  However my first taste was disappointing...the fizziness is underwhelming...much more "alka seltzer" type fizzy than sparkling water.  Also the taste is neither fruity nor would I saw it is really a pomegranate taste. Also left a bit of an odd after taste - it was not completely unpleasant but not a great taste either.<br /><br />I didn't feel really noticeable changes in energy level, as advertised. Also a bit pricey at ~$1.30 - ~1.40 per pack which yields an 8 oz serving.<br /><br />Although the product boost a number of beneficial vitamins and supplements and a relatively modest 20 calories, I will stick to supplements with a more powerful and much more pleasant taste.

review/summary: Good dietary supplement, great packaging
review/text: While I have tried EBOOST before, with a different flavor and packaging, I would say that I like the Pomegranate flavor better than the orange, and I prefer this type of packaging over the square packets. This packaging is more convenient when pouring the product into a water bottle.<br /><br />Now having said that, I would share pretty much the same perspective on all of the EBOOST products, that being that I like the fact that the product provides the essential vitamins of Vitamin C, B6, B12, Zinc, Green Tea Extract to supplement a person's dietary requirements. However, as far as the "energy boost" that is suppose to accompany the use of the product . . . well I am more than a little skeptical. Overall I think it may be a helpful/easy way to supplement your diet, especially if you are not receiving the appropriate and necessary vitamins/minerals, but I am not convinced it will add to a person's vitality or daily energy level. I will probably stick with Emergen-C.

review/summary: TUMS + Alka Seltzer = Drink Sick
review/text: I am a junkie for drink sticks and am always looking for a new flavor.  The fact that this is also a healthy energy drink, with no crash is a plus.  In addition EBOOST puts some of their process towards the National Breast Cancer Research.  Sadly, this is where all the positives end.<br /><br />The flavor of this beverage is almost medicinal. This drink is almost like a cross between TUMS and Alka Seltzer.  Speaking of Alka Seltzer, when I put the powder in the water it started fizzing like Professor Honeydew was going off the deep end.  I digress to the taste, I really do not detect pomegranate at all.  If I had to pick a flavor I would say a very, very bitter mixed berry. Overall I am very disappointed with this drink stick.  At least the color of the beverage is rather tranquil, once it is mixed.

review/summary: Disappointing Product
review/text: I was very underwhelmed with this product for several reasons.<br /><br />1) It's caffinated. Caffine actually gives me migraines and there was nothing on the Amazon description to indicate this. It's also odd for a powdered drink supplement like this to have that. This thing packs as much caffine as a cup of coffee and I actually had to go to the Eboost website to discover this as the packaging doesn't say so. Very uncool.<br /><br />2) This doesn't taste at all like an Acai Pomegranate drink. It tastes more like a generic fruit punch product.<br /><br />3) Very foamy. This plus the colour of the product reminded me of something out of a Jeffrey Combs film.<br /><br />4) I'm not really sure why the tagline of the product is "For the Planet," when it doesn't do anything green or ecological. In fact, the 30 count box involves 30 little pouches you'll be throwing away (but they are recyclable) so it's actually less "green" than something like Crystal Light where you can scoop the flavoring out.<br /><br />I can't honestly think of anything positive to say about the product other than it is a nice source of zinc, chromium, copper and selenium, but even then you're getting those as strange chemical compounds rather than in fashion you would normally intake them.<br /><br />Definitely pass on EBOOST. Nice idea, but bad follow-through.

review/text: I only got to test one packet which gives limited testing results. I found the one packet gave me no extra energy, the taste was OK but too sweet and a bit artificial tasting. Since I only got one little packet I can't see the print well enough to read the ingredients, there was no box. The color is too bright to not be artificial. This reminds me of koolaid but more expensive. I really don't feel it is worth buying and I won't be buying it again. I think if they would make it all natural then maybe it would taste and look better.

review/summary: Interesting concept.  Flavor of the Acai Pomegranate was ok.
review/text: I got just one tube packet of this and there were no directions with it so I went to the Eboost Website [...]  which told me to add to 8 fluid ounces of water then allow to "effervesce" before consuming.  Which I did. Once the bubbling calmed down (probably due to citric acid and other ingredients hitting the water) I took a sip.<br /><br />The taste wasn't bad, I think my expectations from some of the reviews I read made me think it would be awful - but it wasn't.  It wasn't as sweet as I would think... but it wasn't as sour.  There was kind of a almost carbonated acid-y feel to it though the drink is not carbonated.  I could easily drink this stuff in place of pop, or juice since it is supposed to be better for me.  I think the weird carbonated not to sweet taste is why - if something is too sweet I can't drink a lot of it, and this sort of makes me want more of it because after one drink you feel like you need more to feel hydrated.  So this would boost my liquid intake for sure.  It has the same effect on me as Gatorade - I just keep wanting more of it because the flavor is more subtle if you know what I mean.<br /><br />There is naturally occurring caffeine in it from the Green Tea extract, but I didn't notice it.  I am pretty immune to caffeine I think.<br /><br />I think I would recommend this to someone trying to break a pop habit, or who wants to try something more healthy anyway.  There is a warning not to exceed 4 of these in a day - probably because some of the vitamin levels are so high, but note they are water soluble vitamins so what your body does not process would naturally flush out of your system without using.  I didn't feel any different after having drank one of these, but I only had one to try so maybe after 2 you start feeling more energy.  Hard to say.  I have never had an energy drink before that really made any noticeable difference in my energy so maybe I am an anomaly.

review/summary: I wouldn't buy it for the taste! Too Sour and causes discomfort!
review/text: I received the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate and decided to try it one afternoon. My first impression was it smelled like jello. I added the content to a glass of cold water and took my first sip. I'm not sure if I would buy it for the taste. It tasted sour, artificial and somewhat carbonated that seem to irritate my throat a little bit.<br /><br />As I took additional sips, perhaps I liked the taste a little better. But the sour effect was strong and some people might get some stomach discomfort.<br /><br />Again, the taste is sharp, sour and not very enjoyable to drink on a daily basis. It almost tasted like squeezing a lemon and drinking it on an empty stomach. I usually eat my lunch around 12:30 and it was around 3:00 pm in the afternoon when I tried this product. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but you feel you need to eat something after you drink it to take away the sourness.<br /><br />One thing that caught my attention was the warning on the package against using this product if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />Final note: About 30 minutes after taking this product, I felt my blood pressure rose to a high level - the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee for me.<br /><br />Conclusion:  The sour effect during and hours afterwards and the risk of raising the blood pressure to a dangerous level with some people make me not recommend this products. I think there are many more natural and healthier choices out there.

The flavour is pleasing, but, since one packet contains four grams of sugar, those who need to be careful of sugar/carbohydrate intake might prefer a vitamin tablet. I would say that this is a typical vitamin product, with no particular pros and cons.

review/text: I received one tube of this drink mix via the Amazon Vine program.  I mixed it with water and liked the fizzy-ness of it.  It has a good taste, much like a lot of the other drink mix tubes we've tried.  The difference is the addition of vitamins, acai and pomegranate - Acai is known for its caffeine boost and pomegranate is known for its anti-oxidant qualities.<br /><br />This was a nice tart mixture of flavors - not too sweet or artificial tasting.  It dissolved well in tap water.<br /><br />Whether or not it really boosts immune systems or benefits health with the additional vitamins is up for debate.  But it's a refreshing drink mix that I liked. Because of the caffeine, I wouldn't give it to my kids.<br /><br />At $1.00+ per pouch, they're a little pricey, too.

review/summary: Artificially refreshing
review/text: Let me start by saying that I haven't yet liked ANY packets that you add to water.  (So far I have tried the One a Day - yes the same as the vitamin maker.) I was hoping I would like this one since I didn't like the other kind.  So take this into consideration with my review.<br /><br />Instead of pouring the packet into a water bottle, I filled a Guinness pint glass about 3/4 of the way full and added some ice before adding the packet.  I wasn't really sure how much water was the appropriate amount to be mixed.  I was delighted by the hot pink foamy action at the top of the glass, but after stirring it around with a spoon, the foam quickly disappeared and the powder all dissolved into the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the powder all dissolves.  There is no junk left at the bottom of the glass.  The color is very bright pink - almost fuchsia.  It seems a little artificial to me, but I'm not sure if it's a natural color for the pomegranate.  The very first taste was really good.  After the first sip, however, I realized it was going to take a lot for me to drink the entire glass.  It might be easier to drink this while you're working out very hard and are super thirsty and are more apt to take big, quick gulps.  There's also a little bit of a funky smell to it when my nose enters the glass.  This may not be so much of an issue if you're drinking out of a water bottle where you nose doesn't catch much of a whiff.<br /><br />To give a fair review, I thought I'd let my seven year old taste this concoction.  Maybe I'm just too old for the overly sweet taste?  Verdict? Seven year old didn't like it either.  I won't be buying this in the future.

review/summary: Great taste and full of vitamins
review/text: These pouches are small and convenient to carry around. Just pour the powder into the water and let it dissolve. It becomes a pinkish drink. It is very easy to take down and it's not too sweet. It kind of reminds me of a Red Bull drink but not as strong as one. It boasts a lot of different vitamins and acai, which is suppose to help promote weight loss. It is too soon to tell if it really does anything. It did make me a little bit more energetic but that was just one packet. I personally did enjoy the taste but unfortunately, cannot say one way or another if it does help lose weight or really boost energy. I may buy some more for later but at the moment, it's a bit pricy so I will probably wait until it goes down in price a bit.

review/summary: Fizzy, sugary, and phony flavor
review/text: This product reminded me of sour Koolaid with a bit of  fizz.  It looks like it is mostly sugar (though package is small), so I do wonder how much of an energy boost you get from this.  I didn't feel anything, though maybe if I have tried it a few more times (Amazon only sent me one packet to sample) I might have seen a detectable and consistent effect.  Buyer beware here - maybe this stuff works but I couldn't tell.  The taste won't win you over.

review/summary: hard to tell if it is working
review/text: Although it is hard to judge this product with only trying it once, I cannot give any real proof that it does give one energy or the immune system.<br /><br />The taste is tart; although it isn't not bad, it isn't exactly the taste one would seek for a refreshment.  If you drink it down quickly it makes it taste a little better.<br /><br />Considering the price of this product, I probably would not buy it.  It is pricy for a product that is hard to tell if it is working.

review/summary: Good flavor, beware has caffeine
review/text: I received one packet of the EBOOST Acai, mailed in an envelope. From the individual packet I was unable to determine any nutritional information, or directions for taking. It did warn against anyone who has diabetes, is pregnant or nursing from taking the product.  I figured it was probably like doing a packet of Crystal Light, so I added it to a glass of water at about 2 pm and drank it. It had a good taste, kind of tart and not too sweet. I think it would be better without the fizz, but that is more a personal preference for not liking fizziness.  Per the website, there is no sugar, no gluten/wheat, no peanuts, no artificial colors or flavors, no soy, no lactose, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />At midnight that night I was still AWAKE. I was rather annoyed by this and figured this thing must have some form of caffeine in it. I searched for the EBOOST website and sure enough listed as one of the ingredients was anhydrous caffeine.  (Click on the "What's In It" link on the EBOOST website.) Per the nutritional label there is 1050 mg of green tea extract which is the source of the caffeine. In the FAQ, it warns against children having it due to the caffeine. It also has:<br /><br />* 5 calories<br />* 1 g carbohydrate<br />* 1667% Vitamin C<br />* 75% Niacin<br />* 100% Vit B6<br />* 50% Folate<br />* 41667% Vit B12<br />* 50% Zinc<br />* 143% Selenium<br />* 50% Copper<br />* 100% Chromium<br />* 14% Potassium<br /><br />I think it's a decent drink supplement. Just be aware that there is caffeine that will wake you up for hours, albeit without the jitters that come with too many cups of coffee.  Caffeine content should be considered if you have already had other caffeinated beverages during the day.

review/text: I only had one packet of this so am unable to evaluate it on it's health benefits. Truthfully, even if I had more I probably wouldn't be able to evaluate it properly because I doubt I would be willing to choke down any more of it.<br />I can say it didn't affect my energy levels whatsoever. As far as the taste goes, it is absolutely disgusting and has a long lasting aftertaste to boot. Imagine bitter splenda and that about sums up the flavor...

review/summary: Got to be kidding !
review/text: First of all, there is no way to evaluate the "health" efficacy of a single dose that, by appearance and taste, represents a merger of KoolAid and the archaic tablet, FIZZIES. Moreover, anyone who can stand the taste but who is diabetes or metabolic syndrome prone should still avoid this product. Finally, any claim that the product contains, in addition to sugar, more than token, trace amounts of substances that improve and/or maintain "health" is wholly unsubstantiated. Was overrated as 1 because there is no ZERO(or a minus rating)!

review/summary: Just a spoonful of sugar....
review/text: Now I'm all for healthy drinks to boost my immune system and I'll take at face value any claim to supply my aging body with extra energy and vitality, but I'm not sure I'd be able take boost on a regular basis. The taste, though not unpleasant was a little tart and to paraphrase Mary Poppins, i could have done with a spoonful of sugar in mine. It made me feel a little bloated at first - probably due to the effervecence. I'm not sure if I'd have a different response to one of the other flavors, maybe a lemony  taste would have been acceptable given the tartness of my ACAI Pomwgranate blend. Not bad but I don't want to hold my nose and swallow for the chance to boost my immune system even if Julie Andrews is singing in my ear.

review/text: I took one sip of this and could not drink any more. I regularly drink Emergen-C and love that. Maybe it's the extra herbs or something, but it has a yucky after taste, kinda medicinal. It smells amazing, but I will be dumping this out.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: The product simply tastes horrible.  I can only describe it as chaulky and disappointing (for my taste).  However, not too sweet.  After taking this, I did not feel any more energetic than I normally do.  According to the product label, one serving contains 2,500mcg of B-12, which is large by any measure.<br /><br />It should be pointed out this product does not contain artificial ingredients and travels well in its self-contained single serving packet. However, such packaging typically costs more than it should.
