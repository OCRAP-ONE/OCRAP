review/summary: Sticky brown sludge
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>Based on the microwave method.<br /><br />This side dish is very easy to prepare, and takes only 10 minutes.  All you need to add is water and maybe a tablespoon of margarine.<br /><br />Taste wise, it's fine - even comforting on a cold or rainy day, but be warned that it looks NOTHING like the picture on the packet, which was taken of a professional pasta model with full make-up and airbrushed to boot.<br /><br />Sorry to say it, but the finished product actually looks like a bowl of sticky brown sludge, with the consistency of swamp mud.<br /><br />Kids will probably love it for the above reasons, but please don't go serving this when your boss is coming to dinner.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 12, 2007

review/summary: Allergenic Dog Food?
review/text: This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed "elephant skin" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the "elepant skin" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an "allergenic" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with "therapeutic baths", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of "gravy".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic.

review/text: If you liked Tazo Black Iced Tea in the past - you may not like it anymore.  My wife and I have been buying Tazo's Black Iced Tea for several years.  It was the best iced tea we ever found, and we enjoyed it immensely.  Recently we ordered two more boxes from Starbuck's through Amazon.  When we brewed the first bag, something wasn't right.  The taste was bland, not at all like every other time we had it.  We tried a second bag, and it was bland as well.  VERY disappointing.  My wife Googled and found on another web site that Tazo changed the formulation of its Black Iced Tea.  It is a flop in our opinion.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect.  I wanted to mimmic a certain starbucks iced tea.  The Passion Fruit Tea with Lemonade.  These tea bags make 1 gallon of tea.  Directions are on the box and are easy enough.  I used a powder lemonade to make a pitcher of lemonade and then mix the two as I want a drink.  Equal amounts of each.  When I want it to be a little sweeter, I simply add some agave nectar and it is absolutely perfect for me.  I'll be buying this box of tea regularly.<br /><br />Update:  Now my favorite way to drink this is as 1 gallon passion fruit tea with 1/4 cup agave, which I also bought on Amazon at a great price!

review/summary: Starbucks lost a loyal customer
review/text: Since the formula change, this tea is nothing special.  For many years, I have been addicted to Starbucks Black Iced Tea.  I live in a little town in the midwest that doesn't even have a Starbucks, but I have a gold Starbucks card.  I would check every route when travelling to plan stops for this iced tea.  I have purchased the quart sized bags from Starbucks and Target when available and ordered the gallon bags when that was my only option to brew this tea daily.  I started noticing a change when I was in South Carolina in March, 2012.  I thought maybe southerners just have a different tea preference.  I then noticed it in Nashville over the summer.  Since I spend time regularly in Nashville, I knew a change was on the way.  The tea has lost its crispness and citrus finish.  It seems Starbucks has purchased Tazo from Steven Smith and decided to change it.  I hate to think it was to make more money with a cheaper blend, but I haven't been able to find another reason.  Given the fact that I was paying over $3.00 per Trenta, I can't imagine the mark up was unfair to them no matter what the cost of the original tea.  By buying Tazo, Starbucks cut out the middle man to make way for more profits, then made major change.  Couldn't it just have started its own tea brand?  It has lost a loyal customer in me (and many transfers from my bank account to the Starbucks card).  If you are loyal to taste rather than brand, start your search for a new tea.  I have started my search with the former owner of Tazo who has opened a new business.  Maybe the old formula will come back before we find something we like better.

review/summary: I'm a Starbucks Passion Iced Tea addict...and finally found my fix.
review/text: There are some products that make our lives better, and some that make us happy, and this does both for me. It's on my list of things that make me happy. Seriously.<br /><br />I love Passion iced tea at Starbucks. I always get it unsweetened with ice.<br /><br />I had one of those moments (after handing nearly five dollars to the barista for just one glass of this stuff) and I thought, "You know, if I could have a bunch of this at home, I'd up my water intake, and I bet my kids would love it."<br /><br />And I was right. I drink it and so does my husband three kids. Its refreshing, a little tart, and just a nice break from water. No sugar, no additives, and that makes it feel healthy.<br /><br />I started with the regular sized bags and found 6 bags per gallon works. I boiled a half gallon of water, let it steep, then added extra water in the pitcher until it hit the gallon mark.<br /><br />I bought a new gallon pitcher here at amazon to cut down the amount of times I made tea, and when I found the gallon sized iced tea bags were available, I was thrilled. One bag per gallon is perfect for us. I know there are those out there who want it stronger and tarter, but I have two reasons. One, it saves money by using less and honestly, if I let it steep for a long time--- leaving the bag in the pot for an hour or two until it cools--- it's plenty strong.<br /><br />It's a big hit with guests, too. People are so pleasantly surprised when I offer them a cold glass of passion tea.

review/summary: Good thing this tea tastes great, otherwise...
review/text: Tazo Black Iced Tea is fantastic. Always has been. It is a brilliant blend of black tea and citrus that is simply beguiling. I drink a lot of tea. I am always struck by how refreshing and complex the flavor notes are, especially when I haven't had it in a while. The citrus notes are quite subtle on the tongue, but much more present in the aroma. It serves to highlight the black tea in much the same way that coffee brings out the flavor of chocolate-you don't really taste the coffee, but the chocolate is more pronounced and accessible. Very pleasant and delicious.<br /><br />I wish I had such praise for Starbucks the company. Dealing with Starbucks in ANY capacity other than in one of the ubiquitous coffee-stores is irritating and unpleasant. Starbucks Store, the online retailer of Tazo, is especially egregious. Like ALL Starbucks products, Tazo teas are considerably expensive, almost to the point of price-gouging. To order the large filter-bags in the past was to recieve a resealable, coated bag to keep the tea fresh. Then when the Starbucks "Store" was created, they quickly ditched the resealable-bags for a crude cardboard box, with a gaping hole for commercial use that can not be resealed, with the unwrapped tea packed in helter-skelter. Moreover, they shipped the whole package in boxes literally big enough to fit a computer, filled with Earth-friendly styrofoam peanuts. Not only does the majority of their coffee benifit large corporations that rob the growers and harvesters of fair-trade, but their shipping practices are out of the Stone Age and, true to form, expensive. Stryrofoam is non-biodegradable and no cheaper than other, greener products, and those big shipping-containers take up unnecessary space on cargo-planes resulting in lost efficiency and increased use of diesel fuel.<br /><br />Now, as if Starbucks wasn't making enough money off their overpriced-products, they have the audacity to short their 24-count Tazo Black Iced Tea by four filter-bags. Now 20 bags for the old price of 24 bags. Nice work if you can get it, I guess. They know that people love their products and will pay for the convenience with which they are offered. But their arrogance is systemic in many of their policies, and certainly no more apparent than dealings with customer service. God help you if you have a problem with shipping or product. I was treated with rudeness and indifference both verbally and with the resolution of my issue. It's like I said, it is a good thing this tea is so good.

review/text: We LOVE Starbucks' Tazo passion iced tea, and having a pitcher of it at home in the fridge is terrific. They have directions on the side of the box, which is helpful, but I like to steep it a little longer than the directions say (7-10 minutes instead of 5). I add 1/3 cup splenda/sugar blend to the pitcher and it's just as good as getting it at Starbucks--my husband says it's even better. The directions also say to leave it out and then throw it out at the end of the day but once it cools to room temperature we stick it in the fridge and enjoy it all week.

review/summary: Iced Tea for Iced Tea Connoisseurs
review/text: A friend sent me two boxes of this tea two years ago for my birthday (and that now qualifies him as a really good friend), and since then I can't bring myself to make anything else. I make a large bottle of sun tea once a week with the exception of winter. This tea completely spoiled me for any other iced tea. Living in Texas, liquid refreshment is a necessity in the summer. The problem is finding a drink that's satisfying and not sugar-laden. The choices are limited to diet drinks (which I don't drink), water (which is nice, but you yearn for something with taste), and iced tea (the Texas kind, unsweetened). And because of the heat, we drink a lot of tea in my house. I've tried all kinds of teas including those "specially blended for iced tea" and froo-froo specialty teas they don't hold a candle to Tazo iced tea. Why? It has a distinctive rich and full tea taste...and I'm sorry but sweet tea covers true tea flavor. It's a shame that this is the only way you can buy it, but it beats not being able to buy it at all. Have an iced tea fanatic at your house? This will be their new "crack tea"....I know it's mine.

review/summary: Not as good as their old blend, but it's still decent
review/text: Like every other Tazo iced tea lover, I was heartbroken when I read they changed the blend of their iced black tea. I had 6 of the old bags left and rationed them as long as I could. I broke down and bought a 3-pack of the new blend. The first batch was disappointing--it was a weak pitcher of iced tea that lacked color and taste. I didn't think I'd be able to drink another pitcher, let alone 3 full boxes of tea. But then I started adding 3 Irish Breakfast tea bags to the water, and I let the pitcher sit in the fridge overnight before drinking. Finally I've made a decent pitcher of tea with this new blend. It's dark and full-bodied and not half bad. I've got one bag of their old blend left and am going to try to concoct my own blend to match.<br /><br />If you like sweet tea, try taking 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, mix with enough water to cover the sugar, then microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. Pour into the pitcher and stir, then let sit overnight. It's a delicious guilty pleasure.

review/summary: Never Received Product- Starbucks Poor Customer Service!
review/text: After enjoying Passion Iced Tea at Starbucks brick and mortar stores, I was excited to make some at home with the filter bags. I would have never ordered it if I knew that it would cost me not only $27 but hours of dealing with customer service with no resolution, no filter bags, and no refund.<br /><br />In short:<br />At the end of the day, only purchase from companies you can trust. Starbucks is no longer in my list of go to trust-worthy companies. I now purchase Mighty Leaf Teas instead.<br /><br />The full story:<br />I purchased two starbucks products the Passion Iced Tea Filter bags (PITFB)and Earl Grey Tea Bags. I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.<br />We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.<br />After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.<br />Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of your<br />order."<br /><br />When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their "counts matched", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.<br /><br />I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.<br /><br />Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing. I expected more from a company that is praised for its customer-centric attitude when in reality Starbucks neither offered to replace the unreceived merchandise nor refund the cost of the PITFB.<br /><br />I have attempted to obtain a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Program on June 16. As of 09-02-11 and several inquiries to Amazon, I still have not received a credit to my Amazon account nor a refund to my credit card.<br /><br />This has been my worst Amazon experience to date.

review/summary: Good stuff...
review/text: I'm a beef jerky, sausage, and all-things-meat junkie. So I figured I'd order some stuff in bulk off the net. These are pretty darn good. The trick is to let them hang in the open air for as long as you can resist eating them. The longer the better. I imagine letting them hang for a really long time (months) would be detrimental, but I never managed to let them hang for more than a week or 2. After the first week or so they hit their stride and are prime for eating.

review/summary: Marvelous sausage
review/text: These people from Bavaria really know how to make this stuff. The Landjagers are super (you have to let them dry for them to develop their full, intended flavor), and it is worth any sausage fan's time to check out their complete offering of German style sausages and hams.  Due to the perishability of some of their products their S&H charges appear outrageous but I guess that sending frozen or refrigerated foods costs money.  Personally, I recommend their coarse grind liverwurst but that is a matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Fantastic product, WAY overpriced, shipping unbelievably expensive.
review/text: I purchased both the regular and peppered Landjager by Bavaria.  Followed the recommendations of other purchasers and immediately unwrapped the product and placed it on a cookie sheet between layers of paper towels in a cool dry space to dry.  Tried some the following day, it was excellent and it improved even more the following day as it continued to dry.  Terrific flavor and consistency, once it dries more will surely be as good as that I ate in Germany hanging in the bars.<br /><br />The cost is another issue, $20.63 per pound plus freight which adds another $6.32 per pound for a total of $26.95 per pound (shipping would have been far more had I only purchased one package) and that's for Postal shipping, not UPS or Fedex.  There was no notice of shipment from Wisconsinmade, so I was informed that it was here with a friendly postcard in my mailbox left by the postman who wouldn't walk up the drive to the house.  So after making a 10 mile round trip to the Post Office the following afternoon after work I had my Landjager.  Please be advised you will pay a dollar amount for shipping that would pay for UPS delivery, but the product is shipped USPS and you'll discover that Wisconsinmade makes a substantial profit on the shipping end as well as their exhorbitant product costs.<br /><br />Again, the Landjager is great !  I just can't afford it.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Landjaeger!
review/text: This landjaeger is the REAL DEAL! I have actually been hunting in Germany (for boar, which was a blast and a TOTALLY different story), and, lo and behold, what did we eat in the field? LANDJAEGER! No lie. The product from Wisconsin made must be made by the cousin of the guy in Germany because it tastes exactly the same, and believe me, both were excellent. I had one little problem with a shipment (and I am POSITIVE that it was an aberration in the shipping process) in that the vacuum seal on the package was not intact. Well, let me tell you, within 12 hours, not 24, TWELVE hours of my feedback on Amazon about it, I had been contacted by a very nice and concerned person @ Wisconsin who was 1. apologetic (how rare is THAT in today's bad customer service world, and 2. Sending me a whole new shipment. This place is the BEST! Get your landjaeger here! I am going to explore what other goodies they have, too. SERVUS!

review/summary: Best malt I've had!
review/text: I remember as kid having malt shakes (back then it came in a 10lb tin from Carnation) and I wanted to relive that experience again but found the quality of Carnation/Nestle was not nearly as good as I remember.<br />A few sites said that Soda Fountain brand blew all the rest out of the water so it thought I would give it a try.<br />Its great in malt shakes and prob the best that I've found and its also very reasonably priced.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose (sugar) which surprised me as most other brands don't so this might be a deterrent for folks with diabetes or a sugar free diet.<br />I prefer to add my own sugar into the shake or get the sweetener from the ice cream but I suppose its OK as its one of the last ingredients on the list next to salt and baking soda.<br />5 star for the quality and great deal available on amazon (especially if you have prime w/free two day shipping)

review/summary: Alert -- this is designed for fountain drinks, not for plain milk
review/text: This is a tasty product, but I want to alert other malted milk lovers that this is not suitable for simply stirring into a glass of milk with a spoon. It does not dissolve as well as the Carnation/Nestle malted milk powder.<br /><br />It is perfect for drinks where you are using a blender to mix everything together, but if you just stir it with a spoon you will end up with malt powder floating on top of your drink.<br /><br />As far as taste, I think it does taste richer and more genuinely "malty" than the Carnation/Nestle product. There's a kind of bread/beer/bakery overtone in the flavor that makes it taste more old fashioned.

All of the malt powders I looked at in the grocery store had way too much sugar resulting in too many carbs for me, I am diabetic, and craving a malt. I have a frappe machine to make coffee frappes. It will also make drinks not using coffee. I can make a drink without ice cream using ice, the malt powder, little milk, sugar free flavoring and end up with a big drink that has only 1 carb choice. Great tasting all because of this malt powder. Thanks!

review/text: Expensive, but a lot better than any store bought powder.  As a person who makes REAL Malts on a regular basis, I know a good tasting malt when I see one.  This tastes like the what malts used to taste like in the old days.  I used to use carnation, up to about 2 or so years ago until they changed their taste.  Now Carnation tastes excally like saw dust.<br /><br />Like I said high price, but great product....  If you make a lot of malts go with the 50lb bag.

review/text: If you enjoy puffed whole grains, this is one of the best to eat because millet is very nutritious, and it is one of the few breakfast grains that is alkaline instead of acidic.<br />I like to toast these slightly in the oven for best results (these are very small puffed grains, so they will get soggy if you leave them sitting in milk too long), and at breakfast I mix them in my bowl with a sweeter flaked cereal to balance out the sweet taste with a more mild taste and different texture.

review/summary: Is what it is...puffed millet.
review/text: I bought this item because the Arrowhead Mills Puffed Millet was unavailable. At first I didn't think Nature's Path tasted as good as Arrowhead and I figured that was owing to the very different composition of the bags the two companies use. But it's more likely I just got an older box.<br />At this point, I've developed a preference for Nature's Path millet. They do a much better job of filtering out the seed hulls than Arrowhead. The hulls are pesky little buggers that get caught between your teeth and such. They are virtually absent from Nature's Path. Arrowhead on the other hand always gives you a heaping helping of them.<br />I do miss the Arrowhead bags though. They are perfect for bagging up the cat's litter clumps.

However, every time I have ordered it I have received a shipment that is not very fresh and why should I buy a product and then have to place it in the oven in order to make it less stale tasting? When I buy it from the store at least it is crisp and enjoyable to eat which is the way millet should be. I have purchased this product three times but will not again-- yes, I have finally learned my lesson. IMO, cereal should not be limp until you place it in milk or other beverage.

While it hasn't caused any serious reactions, we're not seriously allergic to gluten, just intolerant.<br /><br />For those who are dairy free, we've served it with rice milk, (we tend to avoid soy milk as too much if it isn't good for kids due to the hormonal influence), hot cocoa (dairy free; this makes it into a hot cereal that can be more fun than simply cooking hulled millet.)<br /><br />We buy it by the case on subscription to save money as it's difficult to find any plain millet where we live.

review/summary: Part of a Healthy Breakfast
review/text: Some students of nutrition believe that it is good to balance your intake of nutrients in terms of the effect the food will have on your body's pH balance.  Some foods are thought to be more acidic, and others more alkaline.  I like oatmeal, and I feel that it is a very healthy food to eat for breakfast, but it seems that it may be somewhat acidic, from what I can gather.  According to one source of information about the role of foods on one's pH balance, millet is one of the few grains that is more alkaline.  So in the interest of seeking a better pH balance, I ordered Nature's Path Organic Millet Puffs Cereal, and I was not disappointed.  I mix these millet puffs with some oatmeal, a little spelt, some wheat germ, a dusting of cinnamon, and organic nonfat milk.  These millet puffs are tasty, and easy to chew, not to mention that they are very reasonably priced.  I am pleased to include them as part of my breakfast, and I recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Gluten free  cereal base
review/text: I really like cereal, have for years.  I was probably eating too much pumpkin flax and other granolas from nature's path and some local granola from Kingston, WA, Mirracole Morsels.  More expensive the latter and more energy dense.  I haven't ever had a weight problem, but it is easy to get too much of a good thing with the granolas, and I got out of my comfort zone, as in, if I keep eating this am I going to go past my usual set point.  So, I decided I'd wean myself off to something else gluten free and less energy dense.  The 12 packs of puffed millet are a good deal and are much less energy dense.  I like to mix a bowl with a little Himalayan pink salt, stevia, cinnamon and crushed walnuts, 1/2 to 1 walnut per bowl.  The walnuts probably help with the glycemic load.  I'd like to see Amazon carry amaranth puffs, or puffed quinoa.  Puffed quinoa would be ideal.  I'd stock up on it if the price beat what is out there, namely Azure Standard mail/web order truck delivery.

review/text: This is a black tea with french vanilla essence, so obviously it's not going to taste like most vanilla people are used to. Black tea has a strong flavor so the vanilla doesn't stand out as much and also natural unsweetened vanilla tastes a lot different than commercial vanilla products or artificial vanilla.<br /><br />I'm guessing a lot of people are used to artificial vanilla since it's a lot sweeter. The difference between real vanilla and artificial vanilla is like the difference between a watermelon and watermelon flavor.<br /><br />I do have one complaint though, the tea leaves smell like maple syrup and vanilla. Kind of weird, but it tastes good.

review/summary: Great Tasting Gummy Bears
review/text: I like this as much as my favorite Haribo.  Just like the later, Black Forest started from Germany and got it here in the US when Haribo cannot meet the demand when gummy bears became such a big hit.  It is not as rubbery and more fruity in flavor.  It is not sticking to your teeth.  Not too sweet neither.  If you like Haribo, you should try this brand too as individual tastes is very subjective.

review/text: I ordered this for my diabetic daughter.  I found some not so great reviews from people  so I only ordered one bottle.  My whole family loves this stuff!!!  I even like it and I am not a sno-cone fan.  It has an excellent flavor!  The syrup is light and doesnt overtake the ice.  I will order all of my syrups from Back to Basics sugar free collection from now on.  I highly reccoment this product!!!!

review/summary: Reishi Green Tea.... overpriced, but good.
review/text: I refuse to refer to the mushroom in this tea as "Ganoderma".  It's Reishi.  It's been Reishi for thousands and thousands of years.  I don't know why the Organo company tried to get all fancy and used a lesser common name for the medicinal mushroom.<br /><br />With that said, onto my review... I like the tea.  I notice beneficial effects of drinking it.  Infused with the Reishi, it seems to sustain the energy you get from the caffeine, rather than a crash and burn I get from other green teas.  I feel the beneficial effects of this tea over a period of sometimes, 3, 4, 5 hours.  It's balanced, easy going energy, and I feel like I do get a slight bit of oxygenation in my body as well.  I can even drink this tea right before bed, and I'll sleep like a baby.<br /><br />The taste... not great.  It does taste like Green Tea, but it tastes like you diluted a normal cup of green tea with 8 oz of water.  It brews very weak.  The color is just an ever so slight tint of green.  It doesn't seem like much even comes out of the bag, and it tastes like it.  I'm assuming since there's the Reishi in there, that's why.  The Reishi actually brews clear, so it would make sense that the tea is a lesser color.<br /><br />All in all, do I think this stuff is worth almost 90 cents per cup?  No.  Certainly not.  I buy bulk organic japanese green tea for literally, 10 cents per tea bag.  So paying 9x that for tea isn't really too appealing.  I'm a big Green Tea drinker.  I usually drink 3 cups a day.  That would be almost $3 per day for this tea.  What I do, to save costs, is buy Reishi tea, and dump that into a cup of green tea for the ultimate cup of tea.<br /><br />Amazon offers Reishi tea (again, which Organo calls Ganoderma)[...], as well as super cheap bulk organic green tea.  Try this recipe -- 1 cup Reishi, mixed with 1 cup of Green Tea.  Put them together in a large cup or thermos, and enjoy.  You're getting the same stuff (more Reishi, actually, which is truly the good stuff) for less than half the cost.

review/text: The main benefit of this "tea"(a list of actual ingredients for this drink is apparently non-existent, so the viability of this "tea" is questionable) is the Ganoderma extract it apparently contains, as the taste leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The distributor I got this tea from claims the teabags can be used 2 or more times, but I found that getting even one cup of decent tea out of the teabag was a challenge.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy, but boring "tea", this is definitely the tea for you!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy and fuller tasting tea, I would pass this one up.

review/summary: I don't normally drink green tea, but...
review/text: OG Organic Green Tea is very aromatic and if I still have a photo of the nutrient panel I will upload it for you here: lots more in this green tea than probably any other you've seen.  A few people I asked have said that this brand of green tea has a very calming effect, even with the infusion of 100% certified organic Ganoderma Lucidum.  Like the black, latte, mocha, and hot chocolate, this is VERY flavorful.<br />By the way, even though the packet (this is in tea bag form) reads to steep in one cup of hot water, many of us OG distributors know that one teabag makes 3 to 5 cups of water.  Perfect for a small pot to share with guests.  I would not doubt it if someone loses more weight with this brand because of the Ganoderma, than with all other green teas out there.  What I liked the most was the aroma: to me, I noticed a bit of a lemon scent, and a tiny hint of mint.  Feels like a cozy morning when I drink it.  But, as I said before, I'm a OG girl coffee lover all the way. :) research 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease'' and see for  yourself how this can help you or someone you love.

When I was younger I've always heard of ganoderma but never had a chance to try it. Back in the days ganoderma was very rare and expensive!! People think $40/box is expensive??? Growing up my parents drink it sometimes and one box cost thousands!!!!<br />This product is now available to us for cheap, I can't wait to drink my tea everyday!<br />Oh btw one teabag makes 3 cups, I use 3 teabags in a pitcher and put in fridge.

One day when my body was sore from working out and I was feeling  a lot of tension in my shoulders, I decided to try my free sample out. After drinking some of this tea, I noticed that alot of the pain went away and stayed away for a while.

Products meeting the requirements for "100 percent organic" and "organic" may display these terms and the percentage of organic content on their principal display panel with the proper certification. All the Organo products do not meet this terms.  As for trying the tea, it was rather bland and quite stale as if it had been stored in briefcase for weeks. Is it also quite overpriced. Good luck in deceiving the masses with the overpriced inferior tea.

This stuff will add a little zing to your recipes.<br /><br />I started buying this several years ago when I had a Sam's Club near me. A couple of years ago I moved to an area with no Sam's Club and when I ran out of my Tone's Lemon Pepper I was having a major tizzy fit because I couldn't find it locally. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon. Even though I had to pay shipping, it was worth it to get this product.<br /><br />Every Tone's spice that I've tried has been high quality and I highly recommend them.

review/text: This might seem like an absurd idea, chocolate-flavored vinegar, and I can reassure you that the uses described on this product page -- especially marinating meats -- are guaranteed to nauseate your gourmet family and guests. But there is an interesting use for this and for the other Xtreme balsamics ... in home-made ice cream!<br /><br />Vinegar-flavored ice creams are currently a flourishing fad in parts of Europe, especially in Spain. The idea is to streak thin veins of vinegar through an otherwise too simpering a flavor. Balsamic works very well with strawberry, which is normally too sweet for my taste. This chocolate balsamic works in only very specific flavor contexts: with medium dark chocolate, with raspberry, with orange or blood orange (ice cream, not sorbet). Of course, you can experiment in any way you like. If you never make ice cream, or if somebody gives you a bottle of this stuff for the holiday, you're on your own. The latter was what happened to me.

review/text: The Twinings green tea has what I call an American taste i.e., not too Asian or adulterated in any way.  It seems very pure and clean to me, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (the very good flavored version that I mix with this) but a bit finer.  I look for it in the stores and often cannot find it.  Get it here by subscription with your Amazon Prime free 2-day shipping for about $2/box.  Also, this one is available in the 6-box lots while the Lipton Green Tea is only in a 12-box lot.  It will become a staple for you with lemon and honey (lime, orange peel, etc.)<br /><br />Green tea is also an extremely healthy drink with all the special polyphenol antioxidants that it contains.  It may even prevent Alzheimers disease.  (Black tea is dried which destroys a percentage of the antioxidants.) Although green tea also contains a small amount of caffeine it has another calming effect that is almost a high in itself.  Over a year ago, we quit coffee in the AM to go to green tea and have never looked back.  Now we only have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6UX0Y">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> (with some Starbuck's cocoa powder or carmel sauce) in the afternoons a couple of times a week and our nerves are perfect.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: When I first found that fresh garlic was available on Amazon, I was stoked.  We go through LOTS of garlic at home, to the point where we'd be buying at least six large heads of garlic every week.  Super, I thought, three pounds of garlic delivered so I'll be stocked all the time!  The price for the size of the bag was very good, I thought.<br /><br />When I received the garlic, however, I was very disappointed in the quality.  I began using the garlic the very night I received it, so it was not sitting in my pantry for months.  Here is what I found:  Fully half the bag was either rotten, shriveled, or sprouting.  This is indicative of garlic that has been sitting around for some time and/or improperly stored.  When stored properly, fresh garlic remains fresh, firm, and crisp for weeks... or months.  Many of the heads in the bag were completely rotten all the way through.  Some were just light for their size and the cloves were wrinkled and shriveled.  An equal number were in an advanced stage of sprouting.  Those that were suitable for use were OK, but only just that.  These were not fresh heads of garlic.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I contacted Casa de Fruta via email.  After my second message, they were kind enough to ship a brand new bag immediately.  To their credit, the new bag of garlic arrived very quickly.  It was definitely better than the first, but I still lost about 10 heads of garlic to rot and shriveling; that's still a lot in a 3 pound bag, and what would have been a great deal for a full bag of fresh, crisp garlic turned out to be just a real disappointment and a bad deal for a bag of average-to-poor-to-unusable garlic.  For reference, I went through the entire second bag in less than a month, and it was stored in a cool, dry environment.  It was stored properly, in other words.<br /><br />So, at this point I don't know what to think.  I based my original purchase on the few - and all excellent - reviews and, indeed, I would have rated the garlic at 4 stars + had the second bag contained what I was expecting from the reviews.  That was not my experience, however.  It is possible, I suppose, that I was just twice unlucky.  Still, you'd think that the company would have made certain that the second bag sent, DUE to a customer complaint of quality no less, would have been totally primo.  I've got to go with the odds on this one then, and take my garlic business elsewhere.<br /><br />One final note:  Had it not been for courteous and timely response from the vendor, I would have rated this product at one star rather than two based on the quality.

review/summary: Very satisfied - with product and research results
review/text: My wife, child, and I have been very satisfied with this product. We are primarily feeding with breast milk, but we are supplementing with formula. We knew that we had to make sacrifices by including formula in our baby's diet, but we wanted to find the best formula we could. Thus far we have been happy with "Bright Beginnings Organic." We looked at Similac's organic formula, but we were turned off by this NYTimes article. [...]<br /><br />After researching Bright Beginnings, I found this write-up particularly helpful in making my decision: [...]<br /><br />In practice, we have not noticed a lot of gas with this formula, and our baby shows no hesitation in taking this formula. I will say that I see a bit more gas when I get lazy and shake the bottle to mix the formula rather than stirring it - but I can't blame the product for this.<br /><br />Thus far, we are very happy with this product, and we feel good about our choice for now.

review/summary: Best Yet!
review/text: This is the best tasing kraut I have had so far. The flavor and the texture are both exquisite. It tastes like real German sauerkraut. Most of the kraut we buy at the store today does not have much taste, this is the exception.<br /><br />The only thing that would make it better is if it were offered in a form that was packaged without pasteurization. That way, you would get the benefits of the good bacteria that naturally comes with sauerkraut. But, I realize that the packaging methods are much dicier that way. And the end product needs to be refrigerated for saftey.<br /><br />Until I find an unpasteurized kraut that tastes this good I will keep buying this brand.The flavor is unmatched and very authentic taste.

review/text: I have a 12 year old siamese mix who's diabetic. Being able to buy this food online has saved me a little bit of $$$ in vet appointments to get the product. the price is a bit higher than what my vet sells it for but when you factor in the cost of the vet appointment and the food its about even and buying from amazon saves me from having to take my cat out and spend a day at the vet. The product always arrives on time and is in good shape. I'll continue to order as long as its offered.

review/summary: These are really good!
review/text: There are only a few ingredients in these cookies, so they are very simple, but hey... simple is good! They have a buttery flavor with a crumbly texture that goes very well with coffee or tea. They arrived very fresh. The cookies are about one inch square each. I thought it was nice that they come in 5 oz. portions, sealed in individual cans; they don't have a chance to go stale before you get a chance to eat them all. My three year old really loves them as a treat.

review/summary: Great vitamins, but a little large
review/text: I received these today, alot earlier than expected which was a good thing.<br /><br />The bottle is large with about 1/3 of it used for vitamins.<br /><br />It DOES have a child safety lid on it where you have to push down and then turn for it to open. It is easy for me to open, but not my son which is a good thing.<br /><br />The vitamins are very thick and chalky like tums. They are purple and smell like grape with a chalky vitamin smell, but twice the size i thought they would be..maybe the size of 2 flintstone vitamins.<br /><br />They are chewable and vegan which I like and my son tried them and liked them and wanted more (i didnt give him any more of course), so I guess he rates them higher than me..lol<br /><br />He is 2.5 years and had no problem chewing it even though it was a little large. I would just watch out if your child is not a good chewer or doesnt have a lot of teeth.<br /><br />I did like that this vitamin is for 2 years and up. 2 and 3 year olds take only one a day, so this bottle will last 2 months. 4 years old and up take 2 a day, so the bottle will last 1 month.<br /><br />Nutrition facts: per 2 tablets (remember dose will be only HALF of this for 2 and 3 year olds!!)<br /><br />*There IS iron in these vitamins<br /><br />Per 2 vitamins:<br /><br />calories:10<br />Carb:2<br /><br />Vit A: 5,000IU<br />Vit C: 60mg<br />Vit D2: 400IU (as vegan ergocalciferol)<br />Vit E: 30IU<br />Thiamin:5mg<br />Riboflavin (B2):5mg<br />Niacin (B3: 15mg<br />Vit B6:5mg<br />Folate:400mcg<br />Vit B12: 10mcg<br />Biotin: 50mcg<br />Panthothenic Acid: 15mg<br />Calcium: 30mg (calcium citrate)<br />Iron:10mg<br />Iodine (kelp):100mcg<br />Magnesium:15mg<br />Zinc:10mg<br />Selenium:5mcg<br />Copper:0.05<br />Manganese:2mg<br />Chromium:5mcg<br />Potassium:11mg<br />choline Bitartrate:5mg<br />inositol:5mg<br />PABA(paraaminobenzoic acid):1mg<br />stevia leaf extract:7.5 mg<br /><br />beside the vitamins on the bottle, there is the source of each nutrient, but i didnt write them all on here.<br /><br />It states these are tooth friendly because they only include natural sweeteners as sorbitol and xylitol. NO sucrose, fructose, artificial sweeteners, or artificial flavors are added.<br /><br />it also states 100% free of animal by-products.<br /><br />It has an ingredient list, but my hands are getting tired of typing after all those vitamins I typed..lol<br /><br />Hopefully this will help someone out there that had questions before purchasing like I did!
