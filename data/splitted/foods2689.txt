review/summary: THE BARBEQUE FLAVOR IS GREAT!!!
review/text: These POPCHIPS are fantastic!!! I tried them at Target, on Sunday and I was hooked. I bought one bag. I came back on Monday evening, and they were sold out!!! I had to go to another store. The barbeque is my favorite!!! My kids enjoy them.  I have everyone at my job eating them also. They are a little pricey at the grocery store, but I have to have them on a daily basis!!

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.

review/text: These chips are awesome, simply awesome! I purchased a 24pk order of popchips from amazon a few months ago (Original flavour) and I absolutely fell in love!!! It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same "crunch" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D... POPCHIPS ROCK and are a part of my daily 3pm snack routine :D

review/text: Well the main thing here is that you are trading oil for starch. I found that it had a slightly funny taste at first, but the salt and vinegar flavors are true to form so its a very workable substitute for oily chips. When I eat chips I tend to eat them for the salty flavor, not the oil.

review/text: I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.

review/text: My parents were visiting us in Las Vegas from the east coast. I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said "you have to try these chips, (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy. I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them. I sent a case to their home since you can not get them on the east coast and they are almost finished with them. Time to order another case. BEST CHIPS EVER. We keep many bags in the house.

review/summary: ADDICTIVE
review/text: After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you.

review/summary: Popchips are the BEST
review/text: Popchips are so much better than, say, potato chips with about 1/10th the calories and fat.  I have tried the variety case and absolutely love all the flavors.  Instead of chips and dip, I now have popchips plain or with fat-free dip or salsa and still loose weight eating something that I truly enjoy!!!  Popchips are the best tasting 120 calorie snack on the market.  It truly does replace your craving for salty, high fat potato chips, doritos, fritos, etc.  You may be amazed when you try these popchips!!

review/summary: THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :(

review/summary: super super yummy chips, minus the guilt -- Salt & Pepper
review/text: These Popchips are my absolute favorite. I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended.

review/text: Oh, these chips are wonderful. They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips. Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty. Problem solved -- Amazon's are much more reasonably priced and I can stock up -- and this snack is as close in flavor to actual potato chips that I've found to date.

review/text: I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, "sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil." Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil.

review/summary: Good alternative to potato chips, but very salty!
review/text: After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.

The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.

review/text: I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.

review/summary: Other Flavors are Great, these Not So Much
review/text: The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of "jalapeno". Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!

review/text: If an old-fashioned potato chips and some rice cakes had a love child it would be this!  It has 100 calories per pag(3g of fat, 0g sat fat) and a sweet taste that reminds you of a rice cake that has a potato chip taste.  While it will not make you forget the classic potato chip, those who are looking for a salty 100 calorie snack will greatly appreciate this.

review/text: Mixed reviews for this product. Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!

review/summary: Suprisingly light and tasty
review/text: I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version. I wasn't sure if the texture of pop chips and the sweet potato flaver would work together.<br /><br />I liked and enjoyed them but they aren't a flavor I would have as my 'go to' snack. I think for sweet potato I prefer real veggie slices.  These are light, crunchy, a little sweet and a little salty and perfect for times when you crave both sweet and salty. They are only 100 calories per bag and they came 24 bags in a nicely packed in a box. Great for lunches, or to keep in the car/desk/purse for a little pick me up snack.

review/summary: Yummy goodies!  But are they any healthier?
review/text: Yum! Yum!  I liked these and they are certainly yummy chips.  They are a tad sweet and a tad salty mixed.  I guess they are more sweet than salty, though. Why only four stars?  These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case, sweet potato), and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me, "pop") them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost, I would imagine.  Still, a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)

review/text: The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.

review/summary: I loved them!
review/text: I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.

review/summary: The crunch has it!
review/text: We frequent Whole Foods and love to buy the larger "Pop Chips" that they make. They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack.

However I can't complain because I got the 3 ounce bag for only $1.00 at the store while they were on sale. I tried the BBq flavor and they are delicious. I bought the sea salt & vinegar, and cheddar but haven't tried those yet.

review/text: I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat, low calorie, and still delicious.  The single serve bags are ideal for lunch or to throw in the car when on a short trip.

I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.

review/text: The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.

review/text: I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through.

review/summary: I love the way these smell
review/text: I love eating these chips. They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa's butt when he walked by. Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it brings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.

review/summary: Tastes like cardboard!
review/text: I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!

review/summary: Not great
review/text: My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.

review/summary: Did NOT like the taste of these.
review/text: I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the "modified" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said "I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again." My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain.

review/text: I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for "heath" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste "hallow", "empty", too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the "that's it" sensation, satisfying, full flavor.

review/summary: Dissappointing
review/text: To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.

review/summary: Love the texture and the flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.
