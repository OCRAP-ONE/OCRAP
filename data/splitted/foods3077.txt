review/summary: Toaster Patries a Winner!
review/text: I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial "icks". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D

review/summary: Not the quantity I expected and expires soon
review/text: The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly.

review/text: I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!!

review/summary: Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame
review/text: I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the "original"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with "natural" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)

review/text: Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets.

review/text: For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.

review/summary: Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or "pomegran" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!

review/text: These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up.

I've ordered it twice from Amazon.  Yesterday, July 16th, I tried to re-order more of the Tuffs mix, only to find that Amazon has raised the price from $17.12 (Feb 11, 2012) to $27.00 for the same 6 bag package.  Now I love Amazon as a vendor, don't get me wrong, but there is something wrong with this price change.  So I am trying another brand of mix....hope it works as well for my needs.

As Orijen was so highly rated, I was not so sure it was the Orijen food, but after reading some other reviewers stating that Orijen had caused the same in their dog, I decided to switch foods.  Well since the switch, the air quality has improved and the stooling seems more normal and less frequent. The pup  is very healthy, robust, and has a shiny coat. We do alternate with homemade meals, but he does enjoy his meals with this food. I think it is a great choice of food for a grain-free diet.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy food !
review/text: My new 7 mo puppy I got from a shelter has demodetic mange. I was told by the staff there to wait until his immune system kicks in, but I felt sorry for him being itchy and that it was getting all over his mouth. Took him to a vet who dipped him with amitaban , but he got very lethargic right after, and he still needed to go through few more dips. I didn't wish to dip him any further. Looked around for alternative approach. Got him into Taste of the Wild Grain-Free Pacific Stream Dry Dog Food for Puppy, sprinkling supplement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YFBF8">Solid Gold Seameal Mineral and Vitamin Supplement for Horses, Dogs, and Cats (1 pound)</a>, and lastly, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O5K0Y2">Goodwinol Ointment (1 oz)</a>. He loves the food, he'd devour it until the bowl sometimes flips...:-). After a month, things are clearing up; he shades a lot (not sure whether it's because of the warm winter) - but his new coat - though feels thinner - turns to be really soft and shiny - and can't tell that he used to have mange. People would complement on what a softie he is, not just the fact that he's a sweet dog, but his coat is gorgeous and healthy. I am just glad these combination seems to works better than all those chemicals!!!

review/summary: Great food and my puppy loves the taste
review/text: We recently got a Mini Aussie puppy and I was determined to not feed the Science Diet my pets had been eating for years now.  My vet had recommended the aforementioned kibble and I was horrified when I actually took the time to read the ingredients.  Shame on me for not looking at them before now, but I suppose it is better late than never. I started to research the best dog foods available and this one came up on several different lists.  I tried Wellness and neither my Pug or the puppy would touch it, this food however, has been a winner.  It provides a grain free, nutritious meal for my puppy and he loves it as well.

review/summary: Great Healthy Litter
review/text: The regular or the multi-cat wheat litter works just the same.  I prefer to have healthy cats that are not breathing in clay which absorbs the moisture in their lungs and the moisture in my lungs.  I love the fact that it is all natural, does not harm the environment like mining clay does and the ease of flushing it down the toilet.  It absorbs the smell beautifully.  I have 6 boy cats - from 8 lbs to 20 lbs and they all use it willingly.  Trekking the litter around the bathroom - no different from clay.  Great product!

review/summary: Best Cat Litter I've ever found...  And I've pretty much tried them all...
review/text: This litter works great.  I agree with one reviewer that it doesn't clump quite as well as clay, but I have never had any of the problems that he had with it tracking any more (or less) than clay.  It definitely is much more convenient to be able to flush the refuse so that it doesn't stink up the house between garbage days.  But best of all, my asthma is almost completely gone since I switched my cats over to this litter!!!  I changed over for environmental reasons, but was completely shocked and surprised to find that it had such a beneficial affect on my health.  I used to have severe asthma and took three asthma meds daily.  Now I take one asthma medication only occasionally, when I meed it.  Unbelievable difference.  I am positive that it was the litter causing my problem too because now when I pet sit a neighbor's cats who use the old litter that I used to buy, I instantly get an asthma attack when I have to clean the box.

review/summary: A Better Choice than Clay
review/text: I've been using this brand for about a year, buying it at Target.  The cats (I have 4) had no trouble switching from clay.  I used to scoop the poop and the clods into a doubled plastic grocery bag and tie it carefully before dropping it into my garbage bin.  Now I just scoop the poop directly into the toilet, and the clods into a small bucket where I break them up with the end of my scooper.  Then I flush and shake the broken up clods into the toilet slowly as they flush down the drain.  So much easier!  And the smell is much better---not the heavy deodorizer smell, but just fresher.

review/summary: Tabasco is the best... Forget others.
review/text: I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. This gallon costs me only .41 cents an ounce. You cannot get that in Wal-Mart or anywhere else except right through Amazon. Tabasco sent me a free Tabasco salsa as well. Thanks to both great companies with excellent service, Tabasco and Amazon. Simply Bravo...<br /><br />I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco.

review/text: Simply put this is what you'd expect, a gallon of sexy, hot sauce. If you love Tabasco sauce and will use enough in the few years before it expires, I'd suggest picking this up and using a glass dispenser or similar device to hold a usable amount. The gallon jug is heavy for a smaller person and it's costly up front but much cheaper over time so long as you use it. The gallon also came with a complimentary salsa and a catalog for me. The salsa was good but please note that you may, or may not, receive it, I did, and saw others have as well.

review/summary: Shake well
review/text: My wife got a gallon of Tabasco original a few months ago and I took one look at that big heavy glass jug and thought "There is no way we are using all of that."<br /><br />I was wrong, we are about half through it now. If you're looking at this, it's a safe bet you know what Tabasco tastes like and you like it. Its vinegary and peppery and mixes very well into all sorts of things.<br />We pour it into smaller bottles for regular use and you do need to shake it every time you decant some, otherwise what pours off the top is a vinegary, watered down sauce instead of the bright red you are used to. It's size and weight can make it tricky to shake so be careful and use both hands.<br /><br />We use it on eggs, in ketchup, in bean soup, on burgers, we use it on so many things. My son thinks it's wonderful having a whole gallon because he'll use it by the spoonful on rice and ramen.<br /><br />The only person in the family who doesn't eat it is my wife, she says she just wanted the nice glass jug with the Tabasco labels.

review/text: Not much to say about a gallon of Tabasco, it is what it is. I wanted to write a review because the bottle said it would expire about 4 months after we got it. Well that was over a year ago and the Tabasco is still red and delicious. We just make sure to reinsert the rubber seal that is under the cap each time we refill our smaller bottle. Do that and I think this stuff will stay good for a while.

review/text: My son and I love Tabasco Sauce.  For college, I purchased this gallon jug so he could enjoy the sauce all year long in his dorm room.  The only draw back is you need a smaller bottle to pour the sauce into in order for you to be able to use the product.  What I did was I purchased an Olive Oil bottle and a measuring cup.  My son loves this!  He needed a measuring cup.  The way he uses it now is he pours the sauce into the measuring cup and then pours the contents to the Olive Oil bottle.  The Olive Oil bottle looks great in his kitchen, he can use the measuring cup anytime he likes and he had a great conversation piece in the gallon jug of Tabasco Sauce!

I am not an expiration date decoder but I know freshness when I taste it. They are not too sweet which is something that ruins perfectly cookies in my opinion. As good as the strawberry are, the boysenberry are even better. At $ .37 a package this is a heck of a deal. The boysenberry as a few dollars more but well worth it. Especially for Prime members. I used to buy these for $1 from the work vending machine in 1999.

review/summary: Another great product from Knott's BF
review/text: I ordered the Boysenberry Shortbread cookies from here.  And I've tried to raspberry from my local grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.  Both were awesome.  They are small, so they make for a great light snack.  The shortbread is perfect to me; it isn't overly sweet or overly buttery.  The only thing I wish Knott's would change, would be the amount of the fruit center.  I know the cookie is small, but I think if the fruit center were larger, it would balance out the cookie nicer.  Plus, without each cookie being individually wrapped, the shortbread crumbles & sticks right to the fruit center, so it covers up the taste even more.  To me that would make it perfect, but as is I'd still highly recommend these to anyone.

The only way I can get some now is from the clearance website. Pretty pathetic, they have so many awful brands on the market and the good one, like this, should have stayed.

This happened about six months ago and again recently.<br />Just for the record I didn't chew more than two sicks a day and my tongue was sore for two days.<br />I wanted to chew this gum because it supposedly had no dangerous sweeteners.<br />The search continues for a worthwhile gum...

review/summary: Simply the best of the gluten-free pancakes
review/text: My wife and I make these for our son and eat them too.  We could make "regular" pancakes for ourselves if we wanted to, but why bother... these are so damn good.  I read some complaints in other reviews about taste and the batter not cooking all the way through.  We have been making these for two or three years now and have NEVER had a problem.  Here is what we do... for the most part we follow the instructions but we use 1 cup of rice milk and 1 cup of water (I usually add a little extra water because I like for the batter to spread very easy when I pour it out).  I add a dash of cinnamon to the mix and also a dash of vanilla.  Not that it needs it, but we just like to be a little creative.  We use canola oil, no butter.  Sometimes we add chocolate chips (Enjoy Life brand) or blueberries.  The batter smells great and is a little sweet.  It is awesome.  I don't even miss the Aunt Jemima pancakes at all.  Most all of King Arthur's products that we have tried have been really great.

review/summary: even better than arrowmills gf pancake mix
review/text: i didn't think there was any product out there that could surpass arrowheadmills' gluten free pancake mix, but i've been proven wrong.<br />this buttermilk pancake mix is absolutely wonderful. it's light, fluffy and soft and just so delicious.<br />there is no off flavor at all-it's just like normal tasting pancakes but even better because it's gluten free!!!<br />i got it at whole foods and i was excited to get it here in bulk but they don't have it in stock-poopey!<br />i'm going to hustle to go back and get a few even though it's pricey over there-it is just that good!!<br />i used an entire box the other morning for my three kids (i just had a little piece and i wanted more) and we couldn't get enough.<br />hope to stock up soon again<br /><br />updated (1/3/11):<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see amazon finally have it in stock, unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed that it's priced at $8.15, while Wild by Nature has it for $5.99 and Whole Foods is around that price as well.  Oh well, thought I could have ordered in bulk.  Guess I'll have to make the trips to the specialty stores after all.<br /><br />updated (3/23/11):<br /><br />Now I notice amazon reduced the price to $5.12, however, I still get it cheaper at the specialty grocery stores because I buy it in bulk-when you buy an entire box that has at least 6-8 of these you get a discount and in the end each box comes out a little less than five dollars.<br /><br />In regards to one review that complained about the middle of the pancake batter not cooking, it's most likely because the mix was made too thick. This gluten free mix is really, really good and I've tried it in many different ways, with coconut milk, almond milk, no matter what I do, it comes out beautiful and cooked through and through. I have nothing to gain about pushing this product, I'm a regular mom of three, but I know the struggle of providing nice "normal" tasting foods for your family when you can't have gluten in your diets. This mix is worth the try and if it's not cooking well, which I never have a problem with, then just add a bit of water to thin it out and also watch that the heat isn't too high or else the outside will cook faster than the inside (this is common advice for regular pancake mix as well).

review/text: I ordered this pancake mix because I recently found out I am sensitive to gluten. I thought I'd have to go without, being a King Arthur flour devotee I had to give them a try and found them to be delicious. The first words out of my 11yo mouth was that they didnt taste like regular pancakes, which is true, much in the same way that a brownie is different than a chocolate cake, however, these pancakes are delicious and I will buy them again - so much better than going without.

I thought they were a little chewy if I made it too thick but the taste was good. I added vanilla and used egg replacer (another allergy) and rice/soy milk so they were dairy free. Delicious!

review/text: This is delicious.  I have been looking for gluten-free bread type things, and I used this as waffle batter.  My kids pooh pooh'ed it and said it would be awful - they don't care about gluten free, none of us officially diagnosed, but I have my suspicions about my own sensitivities.  ALL of us agreed after eating it that it is better than our flour recipes used in the past, and so much easier!!! Very light and tasty.  I am writing this, because Amazon has the price triple of what it should be.  Someone messed up, unless this is the price for 3, 15 oz. boxes.  I got it locally for $4.99, and the manufacturer offers it for one dollar more.

review/text: I have been using Pamela's Mix for the last few years, but got King Arthur while on vacation because it was cheaper. Loved it! Very fluffy and soft pancakes. Tastes like a white flour "regular" pancake cake. My boyfriend who likes/tolerates Pamela's loved these and even said he should start getting the gluten free King Arthur instead the standard gluten Betty Crockers. These pancakes don't feel whole grain or healthy at all like some other products, but that's ok. Highly recommend.

Not too sugary or grainy which I found to be the case in some of the other mixes. I used it to make waffles and it tasted almost exactly like the regular Aunt Jemima's mix that I used to enjoy before I started my gluten-free diet.  What a nice surprise!!!

review/text: My family gobbled these pancakes up so quickly!  I prefer a thinner pancake so I added milk until it reached the consistency I desired.  I also added some cinnamon and a little Stevia sweetener for the second half of the batch.  The whole batch easily fed 4 adults and 2 children with a few servings leftover.  I also paid less locally for the 15 ounce box than the price advertised here on Amazon.  I give a general thumbs up for the King Arthur gluten free products we have sampled- the cookies are excellent too!

review/text: I was really disappointed with this mix. While mixing it, the consistency was just right, and the taste was perfect, there was a hint of maple. I added a little vanilla and I was so excited about the taste. After I made them, my mom tried one before I did and she spat it out and told me it still wasn't cooked all the way in the center.. so I tried one and found the same issue. Then the next batch, I left on until they were more golden brown and crispier, and they were still VERY dough-y in the center. It was like eating raw dough. The only thing I really liked was the flavor, with maple syrup it was wonderful, because I made myself eat them not wanting to waste money.<br /><br />I usually love King Arthur GF flour-I think it's amazing. I use it to bake a lot of regular things and substitute it for regular flour, but this pancake mix was a real letdown.<br /><br />I hope others have more luck than I did.

review/text: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Expeller Pressed Soybean Oil, Sesame Seeds, Bulgur Wheat, Salt, Beet Powder and Turmeric.<br /><br />That is pretty much it for ingredients in this product. I don't eat snacks very often, but occasionally am in the mood for croutons on my salads. The ingredient lists for almost all croutons on the market are not conducive to my diabetes, so they have been eliminated from my diet for years. When I do feel like I want/need to cheat and have a little crunch atop my salad, I use a few of these. Granted, they are processed with soybean oil and that is a no-no for me, but a couple once in a blue moon satisfy my crunch-attack.<br /><br />They come in a resealable foil bag and I keep that in an airtight plastic container as well. One little bag lasts me a long time.<br /><br />For those of you who love sesame sticks and want a healthier choice, this is it. Great flavor, great crunch, almost too easy to eat a whole bag in one sitting so beware. These are good; very good.

review/text: I should have named my Yellow Lab Thief because he seeks only to kill and destroy. (Gospel of John 10:10). He ate the outlets off the back of my house. He ate part of my car...You get the idea. The only toys  he can play with are the solid Nylabone (no rubber , no matter how hard). He even breaks through bones and figured out how to chew the top off a Kong to get the treat inside. But he loves hidden treats. So I begged Nylabone to make a hollow Nylabone and sure enough they did. My Lab absolutely LOVES it. He carries it around and the only thing that comes close is his Frisbee. Can't recommend this enough. There are plenty of teeth marks on the trunk but it's still great and keeps him busy trying to get treats out of the "log." I even tweeted Nylabone a photo. This is literally just what I asked for? You'll love how your furry friend will love it!

review/summary: Loose pieces!
review/text: I love Nylabone products, but I don't like this one!  My dog loves to chew, and Nylabone makes great products.  This is the worst one.  After chewing on this bone for a while, the little red "plugs" or pieces come out.  This posses either a potential choking hazard, or a possible obstruction for a dog.  I will continue to buy Nylabone products, but this one is dangerous!

review/summary: It's hollow!
review/text: My dogs are 55lbs and 25lbs, within a few days they chewed through this bone which started to fall to pieces because it is hollow. If your dog is not a super chewer it might be good for them, but if your dogs gnaw nylabones into shanks like my dogs do, I would not recommend this.

review/summary: Great Idea for Solid Chewer
review/text: We bought this item for our dog (a pit/lab mix) as a christmas gift. Straight out of the box, he loved it. Its been almost a month and the toy is still going strong, which is saying something because our dog really loves to chew. Be warned, though, it does smell strongly of bacon scent so if you are scent sensitive, you might be turned off.

review/summary: Something for the super chewy dog
review/text: I have purchased many nylabones and have had success with dogs that love to chew toys.<br /><br />I got a new dog who doesn't like chew toys but does like food, a lot. And at the same time, if he does chew something he could easily destroy it.  I thought that if I put peanut butter or something like that in this hollow part of the dura chew he'd enjoy working at getting the food and not destroy the nylabone in the process. In addition it has 'branches' for him to help hold the chew bone in place.<br /><br />It didn't work out the way I expected.  It's too heavy for him to want to carry around and he can't get his tongue very far in the hole so he gets frustrated. I'd almost say it's a little too indestructable. Once he gets the food that is accessable to him out he puts it aside.<br /><br />It's a good toy for dogs that like nylabones. The hollowed out part didn't work like I thought it would.

review/summary: Good for powerful chewers
review/text: I ordered these for my two Boston terriers, both of whom chew and tearup most soft toys. Now I only get them powerful chewing toys, but the chew product must have a flavor or they lose interest fast. These are bacon flavor which they like. The dogs have not lost interest, but I have to get them out of the toy bin, so they remember them
