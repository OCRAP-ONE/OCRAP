review/summary: Wonderful, great tasting tea!!
review/text: I'm an avid tea drinker, have been since I was a child.  I never leave the house without my glass of tea.  I first had this tea in France several years ago, and loved it so much I brought some home.  My daughter travels to France frequently and would bring some back for me whenever she could.  I'm SO HAPPY to have found it on Amazon.  My family, all avid tea drinkers, will hardly drink anything else, now.  We just love it!  The flavor reminds me of tea I drank as a child (don't know if it was orange pekoe) and is much, much better than the black tea sold in the supermarkets here in the US.  Lipton, you need to sell this in the US!!  LOVE IT!

review/summary: An excellent all-around tea drink
review/text: We first saw this tea for sale in Nassau, Bahamas while on a cruise, but didn't buy it...thinking we would try it when we got back to the states. Except, it is not for sale in any grocery stores in our area.  We took a chance on ordering the pack of 6 (for the free shipping), and love the tea..!  It has a slightly milder taste than the regular Lipton black tea sold in the grocery stores here.  The individual bags are slightly smaller than the regular Lipton bags (200 grams/box of 100 vs 226 grams for regular Lipton), but the difference is only one-quarter gram per bag.  The yellow label tea bags are a refreshing and distinctive difference from the regular Liptons.  Not necessarily better, but just a change of pace, and very enjoyable whether served hot or cold.

review/summary: Not your Domestic Lipton Tea
review/text: Yes there is a pleasant difference in taste between the domestically (US) sold Lipton tea that is marketed in a yellow box, and the "Lipton Yellow Label Tea".<br /><br />As with many other reviewers, I discovereded the Yellow Label Tea while on a trip to Japan. Yellow Label does have a more pronounced and better flavor, much like I remember tea having many years ago.<br /><br />If you are concerned about how long it will take to use up six boxes of 100-count bags, any tea drinking friends that you bestow a box on, will love you for your gift.

review/summary: BEST TEA EVER
review/text: After years or bringing boxes back from various countries in Europe and returning just yesterday from Italy with another large supply for myself and friends, I, just to satisfy my curiosity, decided to Google this to see if it had become available anywhere here.  Amazon, of course, popped up!  Whatever the difference may be, there IS a difference.  I have introduced this to so many people, all of whom have requests that begin, "The next time you go to Europe, would you..." and, of course, I have to bring back a supply for them as well.  How exciting to learn that I can, once again, locate something at Amazon that I cannot get locally!  This tea has a special "something" that makes it my favorite.

review/text: I too, had this tea for the first time in Italy 5 or 6 years ago and was hooked after my first cup.  Ever since I've been bribing friends of mine who go overseas to get me a box and I can't believe amazon is selling it now!  I'm so bummed I recently bought a regular box of lipton and it's not the same.  Why don't they sell the yellow label here it's so much better!!  now I have to quickly drink the whole box I just bought so I can order the good stuff!

review/text: Whoever thought I would be addicted to tea?  I was introduced to this tea over a year ago in Italy and actually brought home a few boxes.  When that ran out, I couldn't find any stores, even international or specialty stores who stocked it.  Found this on Amazon and have just received my second order.  This tea has a full-bodied, "zippy" taste and is never bitter.  Great with milk.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Tasted better in Japan
review/text: Like other reviewers, I was smitten with this tea while traveling abroad. Amazon's price seems unbeatable, and the subscription offer makes it even more attractive. Unfortunately, when our order arrived, I found the tea to be just...okay. Whether the box we received was an inferior product, or whether it tasted so good in Japan because I was jonesing for black tea after weeks of drinking nothing but green or barley tea, I don't know. In fact, my favorite part of the order was the exotic packaging, which was half Arabic. But once we've finished the 600 bags (!!!) I ordered, I'm going back to PG Tips Special Blend while I continue my quest to find the world's best (reasonably priced) English Breakfast tea.

review/text: It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

Since returning to the US I have looked for it everywhere and will definately be using amazon for my future purchases.

Most tea over here in the US just doesn't have the same punch as Lyons. That's not to say that it's unrefined. It makes a very smooth cup. Try it - you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I was looking for a tea over the net and came across with this one. I'm really fed up with American teas because it doesn't taste that good and I wanted to try other tea brands. At first I was hesitant to buy this, but after reading some good reviews I decided to buy this. It came with a good packaging but when I opened it, so much tea powder were like dusting around the bottom of the box which the only thing I don't like. Just like by after a few seconds of opening, I did a taste test and I was like "O God this is so good". It do really tastes delicious. And the fact that, you don't need to steep it longer. Even 20 seconds of steeping you'll see instantly how the tea color diffused in the hot water. Im happy I finally found this product. Imma' order this over and over again. I'll try other Lyon's Products after finishing my 80counts :) I really recommend this. This is perfect with whole milk! The best!!! :)

review/summary: Rich Breakfast Tea, NOT LOOSE LEAF
review/text: I've recently fallen in love with Irish Breakfast tea, and due to the rave reviews, purchased the Lyons Brand. The tea did not disappoint me. It was full bodied and delicious; because it's from tea dust not leaves, you don't have to steep it for a long time, a few minutes will do, unless you like it dark of course. I give it the four because of the false advertisement that it is loose leaf, plus it was not well packaged. Tea dust were all over the box. I will be trying the Yorkshire Gold tea next, hearing great things about it.

review/summary: No longer 100% Vitamins & Minerals
review/text: I would normally not have given Multi-Grain Cheerios just 3-stars. But General Mills recently changed the ingredients so that it's no longer fortified with 100% vitamins and minerals (might be sweeter, too). Someone wrote on the internet that they called General Mills, and their reason was simply that they wanted it "to be more like regular Cheerios" as if people were somehow confused between the two. The real reason was probably "to save money." There was also no notice of a change on the box except for the nutrition panel, so, I'm writing this FYI.

review/summary: very good although still not the healthiest
review/text: MultiGrain Cheerios is a wonderful cereal for breakfast or really just about any other time of the day! Although it's probably not quite as healthy as General Mills would like you to believe, it's really not bad for you, either. In a 1 cup serving, it contains very little fat, no cholesterol and it has some fiber in it, too. It also has 100% of the daily recommended amounts of things like iron, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12. It does fall short on other things including Vitamins A (10% of recommended daily intake) and C (25% of recommended daily intake). You can click on the "nutrition facts" link above to find out more about what this cereal contains. Please note that this cereal does contain 6 grams of sugar per 1 cup serving, so if you need to watch your sugar intake very carefully you may want to find another breakfast cereal.<br /><br />On top of what it gives you health wise, it tastes delicious without being overly sugary; and I like that. A 1 cup serving also gives you 10% of the recommended daily intake of fiber and I think that must come from the whole grain ingredients of this cereal. In addition, it's kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't have to watch your sugar and you're getting a good diet with vitamins and fiber in it already, this is a very good cereal. It's not the very healthiest but it's far from junk food and it tastes great! I recommend it.

review/summary: Fun Cheerios Variety!
review/text: This might be my favorite type of Cheerios (even though my husband is the Original Cheerio type fan) but with the regular Cheerios I get bored of them before I get to the bottom of my bowl! I love these because there are a few types of Cheerios in them and the flavor varies and keeps it interesting. It is a little sweet but not as sweet as the sugar cereals. I think that they're healthy too (compared to most cereals!)

review/summary: Another good Cheerios variety
review/text: While Honey Nut Cheerios are my favorite, this multigrain variety is also very tasty. These are not the healthiest of the multigrain cereals out there, but they're not terrible for you either. They are a very nice middle ground between a sugary "kids" cereal and a true whole grain cereal. They have a light, sweet glaze, and the delicious crunch typical of Cheerios. Also like all Cheerios they're beloved by toddlers and make as good a snack as they do a breakfast meal. They go really well with half a banana sliced over the top.

review/text: I am totally disappointed becauseI signed up for Subscribe & Save for the Multi Grain Cheerios for three (3) one Lb. .2 Oz. boxes to be sent to me once a month.  It was a GREAT price compared to buying it in the grocery store and I love it and eat it every morning.  After receiving the items for a couple of months, the other day, without ANY reason given me for it happening, I was informed by Amazon that I won't be getting the product any longer.  It was bad enough that it was happening; however, the worst part was Amazon couldn't even give me a reason for it - something I think they should have absolutely done!!  I oh so wish I could get that service back, or at least be told why!

review/summary: excellent product
review/text: I love cheerio's multi grain.  Even tho is has that sweet coating.<br /><br />Taste is far better than straight cheerios, but I do mix them.<br /><br />Why, oh why, does General Mills think that corn should be one of the grains, is beyond me.  There are far too many corn based foods in the American diet, they could have left that one out.<br /><br />Otherwise, excellent.  No corn, more of the other grains.  How about flax ?<br /><br />Ingredients label:  Whole Grain Corn, Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, Whole Grain Barley, Whole Grain Wheat, Whole Grain Rice, Corn Starch, Brown Sugar Syrup, Corn Bran Salt,<br /><br />Corn is FIRST, CORN starch, CORN bran salt.  Three corn based products in the first nine ingredients.<br /><br />General Mills used to have a cereal that was like Rice Crispies:  Triple-something.  I LOVED it.  I'm sure it didn't meet their sales goals, but truly they didn't give it time.  It too was corn, wheat and rice.<br /><br />Lets leave corn for bio-fuels and get lots of it out of our diets.  I truly love corn-on-the-cob; I love sweet corn;  I love corn pudding, but it doesn't need to be in our cereal supply so much.  General Mills?  Make corn the LAST of the multi grains....I bet it would work.

review/text: If you hear "multi grain", you think cardboard.  Not the case with these... yes, the taste is a bit different from good ol' Cheerios you know from childhood, but if you're trying to be a bit more healthy the transition to multi grain Cheerios should be an easy one.  My wife & I both thought they were pretty good, and we'll be buying again in the future.

review/summary: Product good Packaging may not be.
review/text: I was really happy when I found this deal on Amazon!  Great price for my Cheerios!  However, I did see the note about the packaging may contain more and different information... I figured how bad can that be...<br /><br />When I opened my first box this morning, the first thing I noticed was the package inside was short. I didn't care too much until I poured the Cheerios into the bowl.  When I stopped pouring and stood the box back up a bunch of Cheerios slid down the inside of the box between the packing and the box!<br /><br />So to avoid wasting some Cheerios each morning I'll need to tell everyone in the family to lift the bag up above the box top before you pour your cereal in the morning (which probably won't happen much).<br /><br />The bottom line is these are so cheep because they are factory rejects.  The interior or exterior packaging may not be up to standard.  I would hope that they would all (at least) be sealed, but I'm sure you could get a little more or a little less cereal than what's printed on the box (hence the disclaimer on the page).<br /><br />So as long as you understand what your signing up for then this is a great deal.  My Cheerios tasted real good!

review/text: I was shopping at Safeway and didn't like the prices that they were asking for for this cereal so I went to Amazon. A few days later, the box arrived and I was amazed at the bigger boxes than the standard cereal boxes that you can generally find in the grocery stores. The taste of the multigrain cheerios is a bit more on the nutty side if you are used to regular cheerios. There is none of the sweetness that the honey nut version has however, the multigrain should be healthier than the other cheerios. Overall a good purchase.

I was checking out of curiosity if I could get it via the subscribe and save program thinking that perhaps I may get a better deal...but I guess I will be sticking to my local market for this. As a whole I have been very shocked and disappointed at some of amazon's prices for everyday items. I think that if Amazon is going to offer these products, especially through the subscribe and save program, they have a responsibility to be competitive and fair for the public.  Buyer's should definitely beware!!<br />Oh, and by the way, this is fantastic peanut butter.  The best natural peanut butter out there in my opinion.  Look for it locally and give it a try.

review/text: I've recently found a retailer for this in my area. (Western NY)  It sells for about $3 a jar.  I find this to be my favorite peanut butter now.  It is available in unsalted and salted smooth, as well as salted chunky.  I have not seen a jar of unsalted chunky.  The smooth is ground to a grainy texture and there are small bits of bran.  I prefer the salted variety.  The salt is added in moderation and is not at all like the sensation one gets from eating salted peanuts in the shell.  It stirs easily at room temperature and then stays that way when refrigerated.  The roasted flavor comes through very well and the lack of sweetness is great.  So many "natural" products have palm oil and sweeteners, so this is a welcome change.

review/summary: Not great, not a great amount
review/text: I assumed for the price I would get as much mix as I would from carb quik or some of the other low carb baking mixes I have purchased.  What you're actually getting is a whopping 2 cups of mix (notice how they say "2 packs" in the description and then label the amount by weight). The 10 servers is horse manure - they increase the serving count to lower the per serving carbs and mislead as to how much you actually get out of it. I got about 8 medium sized pancakes out of this.<br /><br />It's also a dryer, slightly more bitter mix than either the atkins or carbquik mixes.<br /><br />I haven't been this disappointed in a purchase in quite a long time.

review/summary: Thick, creamy (be sure to shake well), nice for a change
review/text: These add a creamy, thick chocolately flavor to almost anything but once in a while I experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor,usually when I use 2 vs just one in my beverage.<br /><br />The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives, you might want to rethink this purchase. In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks.  This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br /><br />Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all. I sure won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Cat likes it and a more pleasant litter box!
review/text: We've been feeding this Nutro Max Cat for a few years now.  We started with the Indoor Adult Roasted Chicken and switched him to Senior Roasted Chicken about a year or so ago.  He likes both flavors and didn't seem to even notice when we switched!<br /><br />But here's the real plus: We ran out of food and couldn't get to the pet store quickly enough, so I picked up a different (premium) brand at Target when I was shopping for other items.  While he went crazy for it, two things happened.  First, he ate way too much!  We've been in the habit of just putting food in his bowl when it's empty and he was always good about restraining himself.  That tells me the food is very tasty, but he's actually gained weight on it.  The second thing is that his littler box smells awful on the other food!  His urine is very strong (and cat urine really doesn't need any help in that department!) and his poop smells terrible.<br /><br />We are switching back to Nutro Max and we won't make the mistake of switching again!

review/summary: My cat hates it
review/text: I decided to change my cat's food to one that is labeled as specifically for seniors as my cat is 12+, and I thought this food had to be better for his age. There appeared to be good reviews of the product on other sites from owners of picky cats. My cat won't eat it. I tried to go the 25% mix, then 50% mix, up to 75% then full 100% change. He still won't touch it and waits until he can go outside to eat the regular Friskies I leave out for the strays. I believe that the levels for the Friskies is close to what is listed on this bag, so I'll save my money and stick with the Friskies for him. My review is not based on my opinion of the product, but what I perceive as my cat's opinion.

Why, because my dog loves it and is healthy and happy and seeing is believing.  Cheers!

review/summary: Not nutritionally sound
review/text: I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).

review/summary: Please avoid!!
review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.

review/text: Our dogs and cat love these liver treats. They are solid enough to keep their shape in training pouches, yet soft enough to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, because of their softness, when shipped in the larger-size container, the pieces breakdown into dust before arrival, so you really don't get too many more actual pieces than you get with the smaller container.<br /><br />They are "real" rather than processed, and appeal more to the animals that way. They last a long time (at least 2 months). I heartily recommend them.

review/text: I bought these as a healthier training treat for my dogs.  They absolutely love it!  In fact, they love it so much that I have to post a warning: Dogs love this stuff so much they'll do almost anything to get to it!<br /><br />When this product was delivered we did not hear the delivery van arrive.  As usual he put the box next to our side door.  When we came home later that day, I let the dogs out into the back yard to romp and do their business.  I heard a little growling going on so I went out to check on them to find that the dogs had found the delivered box of treats and proceeded to rip the box open and then they opened the bucket (It's a pretty weak lid but I believe they would have eaten the bucket if the lid didn't come off so easily) and they devoured about 1/3 of the bucket! Three days later, I had this bucket o'treats on top of my buffet where I dispensed it for dog training sessions in the house. (I leave dog treat bags in this spot regularly and they've never tried to take them before.) We were gone for the afternoon and the dogs decided to go counter surfing for it this time and ate a bunch more right out of the bucket.  Because this treat is so rich, they were not feeling well after it happened!  So do not leave this treat out where it can be reached!  It's too tempting for the dogs. And man, oh man, if you need a high value treat to work with your dog this one really does the trick for mine.
