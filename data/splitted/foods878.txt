review/summary: Excellent taste
review/text: As always Haribo Products are the best when it comes to taste. This product is hard to find but is great specially if you are into sour gummies.The only reason I give it 4 not 5 stars is the cost. over 5 dollars for a small bag (175gm-5.8 ounces) seems a little pricy to me.

review/text: This is amazing tea with deep, interesting flavor and a nice caffeine kick. The mallow flower and licorice root provide a smooth finish that can't be beat. I've been making a circuit of sorts through much more expensive loose leaf teas and this is one of the best I've found at any price.

review/summary: My favorite Earl Grey
review/text: I bought this tea years ago and always remembered it being wonderful. Living farther away from a store that carries it was sad; so glad I found it on Amazon. The packaging is different from what I remember, but it is the same wonderful tea. It has a somewhat mild flavor that marries the vanilla and citrus beautifully. I was worried when I saw the "sour grapefruit" review, but I can't taste a distinct grapefruit flavor at all. I am not a fan of citrus teas but this one is so mellow and light on the citrus. I definitely recommend this tea to anyone that a nice smooth earl grey. Enjoy!

review/summary: Great Earl...different and unique!
review/text: I absolutely bleed this tea! I enjoy the balance between the bergamot and citrus (I take mine with plenty of milk and a single sugar). I really drink alot of different earl greys and while this one tends to offer some subtlety in terms of traditional boldness, when compared to other rich black teas, it offers a little something that the others don't. Perhaps thats what makes it so enjoyable, but I find the infused citrus essence simply delicious.

review/summary: Earl Grey Tea
review/text: One of the better Earl Grey teas out there that I've had. Hits the right floral and citrus notes for me, very smooth when brewed per the can's recommendations. People's tastes vary widely, of course, but I can't see how anyone could *hate* this tea. The only downside I can see is that it seems a bit dustier than some other loose Early Grey's that I've had. I use Adagio's IngenueTea to steep, which has a micro fine filter it in, so that doesn't bother me. Could be an issue with other types of filters though.

review/summary: Not rice....
review/text: I'm British, and this is one of the most popular candy bars in the UK (along with Cadbury's Flake).  This bar does not contain either rice or 'popping candy' as stated in the description.  Crunchie bars are old-fashioned 'honeycomb toffee' otherwise known as 'cinder toffee' covered in creamy milk chocolate.  Honeycomb toffee is basically a regular toffee to which a very small amount of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda is added, causing the toffee to puff up into an airy, crunchy, light toffee full of tiny holes.  The tiny amount of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda added does not adversely affect the toffee taste.

review/text: I bought a box of Milka white chocolate because I love white chocolate and there are a ton of good reviews on Milka chocolates.  Well, I am afraid that for me, these Milka bars are nothing special.  They are somewhat hard in texture and do not taste as creamy/buttery as other white chocolate.  I would almost call these waxy.  I still prefer Toblerone white chocolate, even though the bits of nougat in them is somewhat of a distraction.

I was excited to see them for sale here.  But very disappointed that the bars here didn't taste like the ones in Germany.  It tastes like US white chocolate not European.<br /><br />I guess it's like how some products are different between the US and Canada.  (Ever try Canadian Oreos?  Even better than the US ones!)<br /><br />Disclaimer: The US product I tried was not from Amazon.  I'm confident that Amazon is selling the same American version though.  For a small sample get just one bar at Target.

I love this stuff as you cannot find this easily and it tastes good on almost everything plus the convienance packets enable you to take this as a packed lunch/dinner or on camping or trips traveling or a big event such as a wedding/reunion etc.  The ingredient label is as follows : water, mustard, strach, salt, vinegar, turmeric, capsicum, 1/10 of 1% sodium benzoate.  NO MSG.  Now,  only if I could locate the matching sweet and sour packets as nothing on the market is as sweet as the restaurant brands.  I give this 5 stars & will order again for a big event as there are 500 packets.

review/summary: Cats need chew toys too!
review/text: My male cat, Timmy, loves to chew.  But let's be honest.  When you go into the pet store, looking for toys, what do you find? There are things that roll, things to hunt, feathers and fur to tantalize and tickle.  Only PetStages has recognized that, yes, sometimes cats do enjoy the feeling of chomping down on something and giving it a hard shake for good measure.  That's why I love this company so much.  Their toys are not only unique, they are also intuitive to what cats both enjoy and need.  As for this particular item, my Timmy has never outgrown it.  From kittenhood to almost 4 years old, he's gone through a long string of Catnip Chew Toys.  In fact, many's the morning when he's hopped out of bed, groomed himself momentarily, and started chewing and tossing his catnip ring.  I think he likes this one better than the other chewing rings by Petstages because the cloth is smooth and has a firm filling of fibers.  He will literally drive his teeth through the cloth as hard as he can.  Personally, I'm happy because:  A# He's happy.  B) He's cleaning his own teeth.  C)I'd much rather he be chewing on a ring then on my fingers or somewhere inappropriate!  #Which has never been a problem, btw.  Then again, he's always had one of these toys!)  Anyway, when my local pet store stopped carrying them, I panicked.  Thank goodness Amazon and KV sells them online.  And for a far cheaper price, I might add!!!

review/summary: No joy with the chew ring
review/text: I ordered three catnip chew rings, mostly to justify the shipping expense.  As it turns out, the ring is not large and easily could have been shipped in a padded mailer for a fraction of the cost.  I had hoped my new kitten would use this as a teething ring and my older cat would also enjoy one.  Neither cat has the slightest interest.  Thinking perhaps the catnip was past its prime, I rubbed them in some fresh to entice the cats to at least play with them.  One mouthful of the fringe was enough for each cat.  I gave the third ring to a friend who fosters kittens.  Not one of the five she has would use the ring.  I sure can't call these a good deal.

This is canned and for being canned it is very good.  As I'm cooking dinner, I open a can of these to nibble on...I do save a few to put on a plate for others for a burst of color on their dish.  I don't heat them, just open the can, drain and enjoy.  They are small and whole, so they are tender, and the best for a canned beet.  They don't need slicing since they are bite sized.  Makes a perfect little snack.*<br /><br />* I also eat the pickled whole beets from Libby's straight out of the can for snacks instead of candy.<br />And I eat hole green beans for snacks, again from the can.<br />Hint: put drained whole green beans into the pickled beet juice and marinade for a day.

So, go with the internet order: the price is right and you'll be glad you did as you dip into your beet supply a lot more regularly with them on the shelf [unless you can't stand beets, of course].

Enter: Libby's small whole canned beets...With these delicious little guys you can serve them whole, sliced or pickled...They enhance salads and other foods at mealtime...The cans hold beets to capacity and you can leave them whole or slice them and serve them plain or add apple cider vinegar,a little sugar, and a dash of cinnamon to the canned juice, heat them to a boil for a few minutes, let them sit for a short time  and you've got yourself very tasty pickled beets..If you dice them and add corn starch at the end of your heating and pickling process, cook until thickend to taste, and you've got Harvard beets...Actually, these are good enough to eat cold right out of the can as is...Canned whole beets are more expensive in the stores and you also pay more for the sliced pickled beets...For me, the Libby's beets are a winning option...They are nutritious, easy to work with, economical and available in lots of 12 cans so you have them at home when you want them...Amazon delivers them free with Prime and they arrive quickly...What's not to like unless you don't like beets?!

review/summary: Beets! Another 5-Star Diet Essential and Cheap
review/text: With a slightly earthy taste these gems are a nutritional powerhouse even in the can. Via Amazon Subscribe & Save with an expiration date of "DEC 2014" I got a good deal. Always better fresh but beets are a mess to prepare. Go with canned. As I usually mention in many of my reviews, we are in the produce wholesale business in Japan and Hawaii, and generally know what we're talking about versus casual consumers. So get these beets and eat! One beet uncooked out of the can and sliced in half works in a salad easily. Aloha,  John

review/summary: Great for traveling with your allergic child!
review/text: My daughter is allergic to many foods and has a pretty restricted diet.  She absolutely loves this spaghetti.  It's very tasty and so easy to prepare.  When we travel, finding food on the road for her is almost impossible.  I take these and have always been able to find a microwave either at the restaraunt where we are eating or even a corner mini-mart.  I do think they are a little on the pricier side, but worth the convenience.

review/summary: Finally, Good Fast Food for the GFCF Crowd
review/text: I purchased this product as well as the Allergaroo spyglass noodles for my grandson who has asperger's syndrome and is on the GFCF (gluten free and cassein free)diet.  It's hard to find good food that he can have so I was delighted to find these.  The best part is that he loves them.  He does need two packages for a meal because they're rather small.  By purchasing online in bulk the price is much more reasonable than buying individual packages at the grocery store. It's difficult to give a child a tasty meal when on this diet without doing a lot of home cooking and health food store shopping, but the Allergaroos are a nice break from all that; sort of "fast food" for the GFCF diet.

review/text: I decided to contact Dentyne about my favorite gum.  I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden all I could find was Dentyne ICE, which is SUGARLESS!!  I want my Dentyne with sugar in it for heavens sake.  Dentyne answered me saying I should ask my favorite store to carry it, yeah right, like they are going to listen to me.  All they care about is carrying the "latest and greatest (not)" junk.  It's ridiculous that I have to order it and pay postage when all stores SHOULD still sell this!  At least they sell Beemans throughout the year (if you're lucky enough to run across it), of course, they want twice the price of any other gum, I suppose that's what they'd do with Dentyne if they sold it.

review/summary: Chewer Beware Of Gum Problems
review/text: I did some research on this gum and found that the flavor crystals can burn or hurt your gums. One of my gums began having a problem shortly after I began to chew this old classic favorite of mine. I threw the whole big package of it into the garbage when my Dad said his mouth bothered him from chewing it as well. I suggest that if you feel anything different in your mouth you discontinue chewing this gum. Maybe there is a reason why it is no longer sold in stores, and this is it.

They work well because you are able to push them as far down into the pot as you need to unlike other traps you would just hang in the general area.  They seem to be helping control our gnat problem though I would recommend a pesticide to go along with them.  The sticky paper helps cut down on the number of flying adults but eggs still exist in the pot that need to be taken care of as well.

review/summary: Lacking product description
review/text: The production description did not mention the size of the traps. SAFER previously sold "Sticky Whitefly Traps", which I liked a lot but couldn't find in my store any more. So I ordered these traps, assuming that the size of the traps would be similar. But these traps (1.25"x3.75") actually came less than 1/5 of the size of the previous traps (6"x4"). Besides, these traps are only sticky on one side, while the previous ones were sticky on both sides. So counting the sticky surface, these traps are 1/10 of the size, but I paid 1/2 of the price comparing to the previous ones. These did come with stakes which were not included with the previous product, but I don't seem to care much for them. I think the size information will be very helpful for consumers to decide whether the product meets their needs.

review/summary: Great aide when using insecticide
review/text: 4 stars only because I think they're too expensive, however, it is an effectice and convenient product - easy to use (the yellow flags have a small area on the edges that aren't sticky, which makes them easy to grab and bend in half to fit onto the stake - you'll learn that quickly, as grabbing the yellow flags in the sticky area is something you'll want to avoid)<br /><br />If using insecticide, these are a great aide/indicator as they'll let you know if the plant is free or still infested.  When I used these to catch white flies, I staked all my plants.  Within days, the flags in the two plants that were most infected were full - letting me know which soil(s) were the ones that needed complete repotting.<br /><br />Then, after using insecticide, I checked the flags each day to see if more flies were getting trapped and thus still present.<br /><br />If you think you have an infestation these flags will catch the little ***kers and help you determine if more insecticide treatments are necessary.

review/text: Just got these in the mail today and immediately tried it out. I have to admit I was disappointed  that a packet only contains 7 yellow stickies, while it has 7 pegs each with two slots for stickies. So technically they should've supplied 14 yellow stickies to complete the set.<br /><br />However, within 10 seconds it already caught 1 fungus gnat...few minutes it caught another. By 15 minutes, it's got 4 total. I had tried the Safer Kitchen Pest kits, but they didn't work. I guess the yellow color really does attract the flying pests.<br /><br />Don't care about the price....I just wish it came with more stickies

review/summary: These are OK...
review/text: These do catch fungus gnats as advertised, and they are relatively inexpensive.  If you have more than just a few gnats I would recommend you get some of the larger two sticky sided traps available from amazon and elsewhere.  They cost a bit more but are a much better value.  These traps are small and one sides, and are quickly filled up and no longer of use.  Most double sided commercial versions are about 3 times as large or larger, and have sticky material on both sides.

review/summary: Works as advertised, but isn't enough on its own.
review/text: I goofed! I didn't know you could (or should) sterilize new potting dirt fresh from the hardware store before adding it to a small indoor garden.  I'm now older, wiser, and dealing with a fungal gnat infestation.<br /><br />In two weeks, I've caught 25 gnats on these yellow suckers.  I'm using all of them in a 6-8 sqft indoor garden.  That's even after I cut way back on watering, a measure the mint and bell peppers aren't too happy about.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a success story, but it isn't sufficient: the emerging adults avoid capture long enough to lay eggs.  The situation has improved, but I'll have to use gnatrol or other means to finish the job.<br /><br />These are SO very sticky that woe betide any plant that brushes up against it.  It's quite like sticking your tongue to the frozen flag pole, I'm afraid.  Any dirt that splashes up also sticks.  This doesn't *sound* surprising, but I'm continually surprised by how often one of the leaves I try to carefully keep out of the way gets stuck and rips away.<br /><br />Conclusion:  this helps, and could be useful to keep a nuisance (i.e., fruit flies) from being too bothersome.  For more harmful fliers like fungal gnats, however, you'll have to use it in conjunction with other methods or skip this and head straight for the larger guns.  I'm glad I tried it, but I'm moving on.

review/text: Purchased these to combat fungus gnats that appeared in big numbers after repotting plants.  The little black gnats are pesty and seem to land in any open glasses of fruit juice etc. you might have. After reading an article recommending another brand for gnat control I decided to purchase these after researching info on the Amazon site.  The concept is quite simple, has no pesticides to endanger pets and isn't obtrusive in your plant pots.  It helps control but not eliminate the gnats.  Additionally limit watering of plants and allow top two inches of soil to remain dry to put a dent into the gnat population. Although it doesn't seem like you get a lot with these pest strips they are worth having and I have already reordered.

review/text: I had an infestation of flour moths and black beetles during the summertime due to the fact that there has been renovations to the area around where I live. And these buggers are all over my flour, plants and just flying around being annoying to myself and my hubby. Therefore, we ordered this houseplant stakes and put the in all the houseplants around the living room and kitchen. I am surprised to say that the stickey stakes caught a lot of the nasty buggers. I must advise that the stakes are not exactly easy. The stake to put the stickey in is small and sometimes the tape gets stuck to your fingers, but with persistence, once the tape is attached, you show find it yields good results.

You just put one in the dirt with provided stakes in each plant. When you no longer see gnats, you can just toss these in the garbage. Make sure to have some on hand for when you need them again. They keep the gnats from spreading if you put them out right away. Very reasonably priced. (If you are unable to watch the gnats dying, and it makes you sad, do not look at the strips.) I have given many of mine away, because as soon as someone asks me what it is, they want some!

review/text: This sticky trap is way smaller than I have in mind but it really traps small insects in the garden. I was having some gnat problems and some other small garden insects that's why I purchased this. The next day after I put it a little under the leaves, I found a lot of insects trapped in it. There was even a moth, which was also another problem I had. When I put a new one again I didn't realized that it would be raining that night and it got wet. When I checked it though it was still really sticky enough to trap some more insects later so I didn't changed it. I didn't have to change each and everyone of it until full. I would suggest to put it in a place where butterflies won't get to it as the color seems to attract them too.

review/text: I would have given these 5 stars but I believe they are expensive for just 7, although I ended up ordering a second set anyway.  The first set got covered with gnats.  My gnat population reduced significantly after using these but I still felt there were more gnats than I wanted so like others I ordered the Bonide Product 951 Systemic House Plant Insect Control 8 Oz. in the Patio, lawn, and garden section. (sorry I couldn't get insert a product link to find this, although I can search and still find it.)  The Bonide product really got rid of almost all the gnats left around after using these sticky traps so like other reviewers I would say if you are trying to eliminate all your gnats you should probably use both.  My review of the bonide product shows how much of the product you'll need according to the size of your house plant containers if you're interested in using it.

We'd tried all different methods to get rid of them to no avail.  I saw this product being reviewed in a gardener's video blog, and thought 'why not?'<br /><br />Within hours those pesky gnats were getting stuck, and over the course of a week, have traps filled with these pests. We've definitely had a decrease in gnats flying around in our faces when we're trying to watch TV. Now we just need a solution to kill the larvae, so we can end their life cycle completely.

Unfortunately, we waited too long to use them and had to resort to additional means to get rid of the problem.  If your problem is just starting, these should do the trick.  We, also, use them to keep track of the decrease in gnat population as we treated our plants.  Good product.  Because they are bright yellow, they are a little unsightly in the plant pot but it's better than having gnats flying around the house.  Would definately purchase these again.

review/text: Pros: I have tried poison sprays to get rid of fungus gnats in my houseplants. So far I think I poisoned our home and killed more plants than any gnat. These little sticky traps are the only thing I have found that will alleviate the problem by 50 to 75%. They are not gone, it does help that it is freezing here right now. Gnats can't live below 65F, so between the cold and traps I have slowed them down considerably.<br /><br />Cons: They are a bit pricey @7USD with only 7 per pack. This time I bought 4 packs. It would be nice if they offered a larger package at a bulk price.

review/text: I'm in Florida and every insect that  breathes, moves or flies is hovering around my plants, chewing on my plants, nestled between leaves, lounging in the soil or crawling around the outside of the pots they are everywhere - tiny tiny bugs, gnats swarming around my head while I check these strips for GNATS, spiders, mosquitos,ants, flies, little beetles, etc. I have looked in my plant books and online and watch them munch under a magnifying glass - I don't know what they all are but I do know that I have had these strips in every single plant-some on a covered patio and others outside and unprotected.<br /><br />NOTHING HAS STUCK TO THESE except my fingers the first time I put them in a couple plants, then my gardening gloves the next time I put them in the patio plants thinking maybe it gets breezy (which it just isn't at the moment)and that's why they don't work outside, or maybe there's dew in the morning, the leaves of the plants stick just fine when I move the stick but NOT A SINGLE INSECT BUG OR ANYTHING OF ANY KIND!!! What a complete waste.<br /><br />Also very important to not, these are for relatively small plants.  My hanging plants and some other potted ones are in 12-14" pots and need at least three if they were actually going to do anything helpful (but since they don't it doesn't matter anyway) but it is something to keep in mind if you are going to buy them - they are very small and for a well growing healthy plant, they are not tall enough, they tend to curl over sometimes, and you really would need several per pot to try it.<br /><br />But obviously I would not recommend this product since I did not get a single bug, while I can see the clever little suckers everywhere.

review/summary: a huge time saver
review/text: I have so many recipes that call for grated lemon peel and it's just so time-consuming to have to get a lemon, wash it, find the microplane and then get enough to measure out a tsp. It can take a good 5 or 10 minutes. The Gourmet Collection by McCormick is a godsend in the kitchen. The lemon flavor is great and tastes just as good as fresh. This also stays fresh for ages, I just purchased a new jar and it doesn't expire until sometime in twenty-eleven. Also this equals the same amount as fresh so you do not need to adjust your recipes. This is "California Lemon Peel" but I do not see or taste any difference in this from any other regular fresh lemon that my supermarket sells so do not be afraid about the flavor at all. The price on Amazon is about what you would expect to pay in the store, I just wish they would start offering 1 bottle at a time or at least give a discount for anyone that purchases multiple bottles because as it stands now there is no benefit from buying this online as it is readily available in supermarkets coast-to-coast. McCormick Gourmet Collection also makes a wonderful dried "Valencia Orange Peel" that comes in a 1.5 ounce jar as well. This is also highly recommend as it is a huge convenience and very cost effective in the brick and mortar stores.

review/summary: The best 100 calories!!
review/text: This is the PERFECT SIZE!!! I love Raw Revolution's bar variety...but the full size bars can be a bit too rich and filling, especially right before a workout. I'll eat half of the regular size before and the other half for recovery, but its so slippery/ oily that I've lost the "other half" a few times. I actually wish all flavors came in 100 calories. The Cashew agave is my fav everyday bar. Perfection would be more 100 calorie mixed packs!!!

review/text: these have to be the best energy snack food I have ever found!<br />I carry extras with me in my purse and car ,in case I need something quick to eat.<br />The smaller version has been the best portable size for me.
