review/summary: Oh so Tasty
review/text: My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it.

review/text: Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.

review/summary: individually wrapped
review/text: I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.

review/text: The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).

review/summary: Everyone in the family loves these cookies.
review/text: These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an "oatmeal" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.

review/summary: Tasty but a little dry
review/text: These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices.

review/summary: Soft and tasty
review/text: These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced "soft" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips Ahoy "chewy gooey" for instance).

review/text: These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are "soft-baked", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter.

review/text: I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative.

review/text: I was worried that these were going to be dry and not as "soft" as some cookies claim to be, but these were amazing. there was a great cinnamon taste that reminded me of fresh baked cookies, and I honestly was not expecting them to be so good! I have forced many of my friends and family to try them, and they love them as well!!!<br />if you love oatmeal raisin cookies..you will LOVE these!

review/text: My daughter ate this cookie and loved it.  She stated that it was soft and moist and not too sweet.  My baby also liked this cookie, his review was a little more understated though.  He cooed and smiled and tried to steal more from his sister.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in my normal grocery-shopping routine. I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. @Quaker #quakersoftbaked @influenster

I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from influenster.com)

review/text: I received a quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie from Influenster to try and review. I shared this with my son who does not like oatmeal and he loved it! I love that it is made with whole grains and could be a good substitute for an on the go breakfast when I am running behind. The flavoe is very good, I love the soft texture, I really don't care for hard cookies and this one is perfect. I would recomeend this product to others and will probably purchase some more for my family.

review/text: So, I got a sample of this product in the mail. After a few hours I thought well maybe I'll try it and it just happened to be the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, but the cookie was gone. My daughter just happened to "go missing" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies
review/text: When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this. They actually tasted like homemade to me. And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, "That's really yummy, Mommy!" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.<br />I received a sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own.

Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!

review/summary: Soft & Delicious Oatmeal Raisin
review/text: I received Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie as a sample in the mail. The cookie is really soft and a very nice size. The raisins taste very fresh and it's just like eating a freshly baked cookie; you could even put in the microwave for a bit to get the fresh oven baked feel.

review/summary: One Year Old Son Loves these! @quakeroats
review/text: This morning I gave my son a quaker oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing. I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are quaker oats!

review/text: I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to Quaker considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories. I will for sure be buying these cookies again and recommending them to all of my friends.

review/text: I received this from Influenster in the Mom Voxbox. When I offered to my kids to try the Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie I literally had a crying baby on my hands. She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says "I's MINE!" Even getting a new box "It's mine" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G

review/summary: Great Taste and Super Soft
review/text: I know they say "soft baked" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: Great tasting and very filling!
review/text: The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one.

review/text: Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again.

review/summary: Nice texture, not so much taste
review/text: This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!

review/summary: Good Buy Here......Average Oatmeal Cookie
review/text: As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )

review/summary: Great Flavor But Too Dry
review/text: Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!
