review/summary: Reviewers are right
review/text: Definitely a few things I agree that other reviewers noted:<br /><br />1) Small loaf - only really makes a 1 lb-er even if it gives instructions on a 1.5 loaf<br />2) Rise problems - my boxes don't expire until 2012 but I still had rise problems. A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.<br />3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.<br />4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.<br /><br />It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far.

review/summary: Whole Wheat Bread Mix
review/text: The Hodgson Mill Honey Whole Wheat Bread Mix is a excellent product. In fact most of the Hodgson Mill "whole grain" products are very good. It is hard to find healthy "whole grain" products locally and I ma glad that I can order them from Amazon and receive the shipments on a timely basis.<br /><br />The product from Amazon is a little more expensive than when I have found the product in a local store but I keep in mind that it includes "free shipping."<br /><br />I like the idea of buying and using products that I can make fresh that contain no preservatives and other "add-in" chemicals that you find in off the shelf products.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious, easy to do with a breadmaker!
review/text: My wife and I got a breadmaker for Christmas and were very excited to get some bread mixes to try out.  I'm a health nut, and this seemed like the healthiest mix I could find.  So, just pour in the wet ingredients, then the dry, then hit the "whole wheat" setting on the breadmaker (1.5 pound loaf), and 3:45 later, fresh whole wheat bread!<br /><br />I use this bread every day for my sandwiches. Just slice some in the morning (I store it in a large Ziploc bag), and several hours later I'm eating a super fresh sandwich. Even though the bread is a "honey wheat", I taste no honey in it, and it's definitely NOT sweet. This is a good thing, as I wouldn't want sweet bread to use for sandwiches.<br /><br />The bread keeps very well in a ziploc bag for roughly 10 days. It may not rise as much as some other wheat breads you buy in the store, but it's still adequate for sandwiches and very tasty. I tried the whole grain white bread, and it rose twice as high as the wheat, making it impossible for me to fit into a bag!<br /><br />The only complaint I've had is the way Amazon has played with the price. When I got it the loaves cost roughly one dollar, and now they're close to three dollars. So if you get lucky, it can be very economical to use this instead of buying commercial, processed bread. But if the price stays where it's at, it makes it much more challenging to decide which way you want to go, unfortunately.

review/summary: Did not rise.
review/text: The smell of this bread in the bread machine was amazing.  Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this product.  It did not rise, so what came out of the bread machine was a misshapen clump of doughy stuff that tasted horrible.  I use my bread machine frequently with the Hodgson Mill White bread mix and it turns out great.  This Honey Whole Wheat mix was definitely disappointing.

review/summary: I added cranberries / raisins to mine ...
review/text: This particular Hodgson Mill mix is very different in texture than the white loaf. It makes a more dense bread, that actually slices a lot easier. Since I don't have butter on hand normally, I have been using a vegetable oil, and it tastes nice. I suspect the butter will add an even nicer taste.<br /><br />I like my crust soft, so I not only set the machine on light crust, I lightly spray the crust with "butter flavored" oil after it comes out of the pan so that it remains soft.<br /><br />I added cranberries to one batch, and raisins to another. I then sliced the bread and spread it with my low-cal margarine, then sprinkling it cinnamon and sugar. It was ideal. Since I eat the whole loaf myself, I can't smell it as I wake up each morning, but I can toast it to bring out the freshness.<br /><br />I love this bread a lot better than the Krusteaz I can get at the grocery store, and by ordering it as a subscription through Amazon, it actually comes out very low cost.<br /><br />Healthy bread, Good taste, great price, delivered right to my door. I do love this one a lot!<br /><br />(Just a quick note - if you have trouble with your raisins clumping around the outside of the bread, be sure to "coat" them with flour ahead of time. I didn't have a problem with the cranberries, but my "sticky" raisins required a bit of extra attention.)

review/summary: Makes Perfect Bread Everytime!
review/text: I was a little hesitate to buy this bread mix, because I am used to making my bread from scratch.  I could not have done better myself!  This has the perfect blend of ingredients to get a nice perfect loaf of whole wheat bread, without all the hassle of buying, storing, and measuring ingredients.  Everything you need is in the box.  Just add warm water (be sure and heat the water about 30 seconds in the microwave, should be warm to the touch but not so hot it hurts), add 2Tbs. oil or butter, then carefully pour the flour mixture over the water/oil in the breadmaker pan making sure to evenly pour it into all the pan corners and then smooth the top with a spatula, add the yeast they provide on the top, tap the pan several times firmly on a counter or table, and that's it ! Place in breadmaker. Perfect bread everytime !

review/summary: Not happy
review/text: I've tried many of the Hodgson Mill bread mixes, and this is my least favorite. This mix does not rise the way I'd like a mix like this to rise. At first, I thought maybe I got a bad batch of yeast, so I tried using my own (which I know is good) with the same results. It's almost as dense as a low gluten bread (like the Barley mix), which I was not expecting with this one. Their Caraway Rye mix has the same protein content, but rises much better than this one. I may try it one more time to see if I got a bad batch. To be edited later.

review/summary: Too salty tasting.
review/text: Maybe I'm just use to mixing my own bread in my bread maker, but this one didn't have the taste to please me.  The texture was great and it was super simple to make and it baked up with a perfect mounded top.  My problem was with the taste.  I could taste salt but no honey whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't taste a good yeasty sweetness either.  I bought the box I tried at a local store and then when I saw what a deal they were here, I ordered some.  Then I baked it, tasted it and cancelled my order.  Mine is better and when you only have a few ingredients to add, it's not that difficult.  Especially since I buy my yeast in an Amish town where I get a pound of yeast for under $3.  Now THAT'S the deal!

I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED EVERY VARIETY OF HODGSON BREAD MIXES AVAILABLE THRU THE "SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE" PROGRAM ON AMAZON. THEY ARE ALL EASY TO MAKE AND ALWAYS TASTE GREAT. AFTER A WHILE I MAY LEARN MORE ABOUT BAKING BREAD FROM SCRATCH, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE HODGSON BREAD MIXES TOO.TAKE MY NOVICE ADVICE AND TRY THIS, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY REGRETS!

review/text: I bought a used Breadman TR555LC for $20 figuring it was worth trying out. Good decision.<br />Next step was to order this stuff in S&S - good value.<br />The first loaf was tasty but a bit dense. I figured the water needed to be a little warmer and added a pinch of salt for the second loaf<br />and it was better. Increased the amount of butter for the third loaf and it' even better.<br />I've upped the S&S delivery frequency on this mix and also ordered the barley bread mix. Fresh hot bread - yummmmm.<br />I'd appreciate some advice from bread machine veterans on what the best water temperature is and anything else that may be helpful.

review/text: I have used about 18 of these mixes over the last year and have had varying results. I have used them all in my panasonic bread machine. One-third did not raise properly though the taste is always consistent and good. When they don't raise they are somewhat crispy but still usable. I just wish I could count on them to always be great so that I could be confident making them just before a meal rather than always half a day ahead.

The Wholesome White, Herb and Cheddar always bake perfect.

review/text: This is my favorite of all the boxed bread mixes so far. I do set my bread maker to the lightest crust setting, as I prefer a softer crust, but it is great. It barely gets to cool down before my kids have finished off half of the loaf. With some homemade apricot preserves, it is just fantastic. Also, I like the texture too. I find it very easy to cut. I have been experimenting with my from scratch recipes trying to get that texture that is not too squishy and airy.

review/summary: Great Mix
review/text: I absolutely love this mix.  While marketed as a whole-grain product, it is not entirely a whole-grain product.  However, it is still a great product.  We (me, my husband and my four kids) generally make the bread sticks and then dip in extra virgin olive oil seasoned with oregano, basil, and a pinch of salt.  We occasionally sprinkle with cinnamon and a little brown sugar.<br /><br />Because of its whole-grain content, it does have a slightly heavier and grainier texture which IMO adds to the experience, but initially it may take some getting used to if you are not accustomed to whole-grain products.<br /><br />When I first purchased this product I was set up on a 3 month delivery (12 boxes every three months).  I had to add an order after a month because we had used all 12 boxes.  I am now on a monthly delivery.  The cost is about 2 dollars a box which is a good price.

review/summary: Happy All-in-all
review/text: I was afraid to buy this product because of the split on positive and negative results, but I guess I am one of the lucky ones. It came out really well, I have a Hi-rise bread maker if that helps. All you do is add warm water et voila. It sliced really well with a bread knife and it was fluffy on the inside with a harder crust, but not too hard. I also used the "medium crust" on my bread maker just to see how that would turn out. I may try light next time to see how it does. All-in-all very easy, no mess when using the bread maker, and very yummy for toast, sandwiches, and french toast.<br />I gave it 4 stars because eating it just plain like you would with bakery style loaves isn't all that tasty. I need it toasted with butter or something.Then again maybe this isn't the bread to do that with.<br /><br />One last thing-- I wasn't expecting 6 boxes of this stuff when I ordered it, so if you're tight on space you may want to consider that. I thought it was 6 envelopes in one box. Not a negative since we have room, but could be bad if you aren't expecting it.

review/text: I am a toast and jam with coffee morning person. White bread has no substance. This has a slightly nutty flavor to it. More substantial and flavorful than white. Makes great french toast. Did not detect the taste or sweet of honey. And if you are going to advertise it on the front of the package it really should be a main ingredient. If a slight addition then omit from front of package. I was hoping for a bit of sweet.

I run hot water in the container, hot water for the mix, olive oil, make sure I can not see any water once the mix is added, yeast goes on top in the center. Easy. When done, I cool it in a towel. I eat the top crust right awy as I like it before it gets softer. Great for sandwiches. Have been using the whole wheat setting. Will be trying the Rapid rise setting next just to see what that does. PS I have the bread-maker sitting on some (1/2") dense foam rubber. (Just be sure to keep an eye on it for the first couple times.) Really quiets things down, especially for my downstairs neighbor.

review/text: I make 2-3 loaves of bread a week.  Some members of my family prefer a healthy wheat bread as opposed to the white flour breads so I bought this Honey Whole Wheat mix.  Each time I make this bread, it doesn't raise nice like my other breads do.  I only use the bread machine for the dough mixing and raising part of the prep.  I then remove the dough punch it down and place it in a 9 x 5 bread pan so that I get a nice loaf shape rather than the crazy loaf that bakes in the machine pan.  Anyway, I have made 6 loaves and just can't get this bread to raise as nice as others.

review/summary: Yummy and Tasty without the Drudgery
review/text: WOW ... Hodgson Mill Honey Wheat Bread Mix AND my automatic breadmaker make a yummy, tasty loaf without the drudgery I recall with my Grandmother's homemade breads. The mix box even contains a yeast packet, you only need to add warm water and butter in the order your breadmaker requires and voila, a few hours later you have a hearty loaf of bread waiting for you. The smell of fresh baking bread and warm bread and butter still are my weakness. It's so good I make at least a loaf a week. I waiting for my next Amazon order containing Hodgson Mill White Bread Mix.<br /><br />BACKSTORY: My automatic breadmaker was a yard sale purchase for a whopping $7! The seller "couldn't get the hang of the Mother-in-Law gift" so it wasn't used much. It was like NEW but didn't have the instruction manual. I scoured the internet and couldn't find it's instruction/recipe booklet. I did find many bread recipes, helpful hints and raves about Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes. Of course AMAZON carries Hodgson Mill, and has customer reviews which helped me take the plunge...GLAD I DID!<br /><br />**UPDATE** OMG... made Hodgson Mill White Bread Mix for open face leftover Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches...didn't happen. The inviting smell as it baked had everyone looking at the timer anticipating a hot bread-fest. The BASIC-RAPID setting yielded a tall, hot, yeasty loaf; just like a big dinner roll yearning for a slathering of butter. ALL of which was eaten BEFORE the turkey was out of the oven. I had to make a 2nd loaf for turkey leftovers! My $7 yard sale Panasonic SD-BT55P Automatic Breadmaker has become a family favorite while Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes are my secret for the yum-fests.

review/text: The quality of this bread was very good. It made a beautiful loaf, but I thought it needed to be a little sweeter, especially since it was called HONEY Whole Wheat Bread Mix. It must have had a miniscule amount of honey in the mix. The next time I make it, I will add probably at least 1/3 cup of honey to the mix. Overall it was very good.

review/text: I ordered 6 of these at once and the first 4 of them were not good at all.  They smelled good while cooking but did not rise well, did not form a good loaf shape and were too solid after they were finished cooking.  I may have received old or bad yeast, but the date on the box said 06/06/12 so it the yeast should have still been good.  I kept trying thinking the next box would be better. By the time I decided to return what I had left, it was too much trouble to return as Amazon would not allow it.  I will not be buying any more of this brand again.

But the resulting loaf from this mix came out hard, seemingly already stale, and just falls apart when trying to make/eat my sandwich.  Not very tasty at all either.  Easily, I like the White best (so far), and the 9-grain also good, especially being so healthy.  Will NOT buy this Honey Whole Wheat again nor would I recommend it.  But, who knows, maybe I just got a bad batch?  But will not risk buying another...

review/summary: Good Bread
review/text: This is a great tasting bread that the whole family likes, but I seem to have trouble getting it to rise enough and turn out with an even top (have made 4 times now).  And yes, I have carefully measured the water and checked the water temp. and otherwise followed the directions on the box.  I am using a Breadman Pro machine.  I think I will proof the yeast next time to see if it is still good (order arrived in September).  We are at 4,000 feet elevation so that could be affecting how the bread rises, yet I have had no problem using other recipes (no tweaking necessary) with this bread machine.  So for now, I give it only 3 stars as I am not sure what is causing my bread to turn out with an uneven top and a little flat.  I will try butter next time instead of oil as one other reviewer said that helped it rise a little higher.<br /><br />25 January 2010:  I did use butter instead of oil in the recipe (thanks other reviewer!) and that seemed to do the trick in getting the loaf to rise.  I do find that it bakes up consistently better in the oven than in the bread machine.  Yum!

Retail prices on whole wheat flour have gone up, that's no secret. But not almost double... In my book, this price hike is way over the line of reason and that ate 4 of the 5 possible rating Stars. Terrific bread, outrageously priced.

review/summary: good doggie food!
review/text: My Boston Terrier absolutely loves this. In fact, now he doesn't want to eat his dry food anymore unless we mix it with this. It claims that it is a complete diet, but haven't quite decided to stop the kibble yet as I want the dog to have to chew some food too. He used to wolf/gobble down his kibble as if starving, but since mixing the Grandma lucy's in with his food at night, he just sniffs at his breakfast, and sometimes walks away leading me to believe he is not hungry. I feed him less than the recommended amount since I am mixing it with the dry food. Maybe this will help him loose some of the extra weight he packs on as a sedentary housedog? I actually buy this at my local pet store, but was planning to order it online when first learning about it from a friend. Overall I would recommend this product.

NO sugar.<br /><br />it is important to note that it has alcohol.<br /><br />i couldn't find in generation tea website information about this tea levels of polyphenols and egcg.<br /><br />also, they don't include information if this tea doesn't have fluoride, herbicides, pesticides, heavy metals. but assuming that it is organic i take that it doesn't have those elements.<br /><br />the way i drink it is adding the tea extract to room temperature water so i can have an immediate drink, and not a hot drink.<br /><br />the reason i titled this review not sure yet and i only gave the product 4 stars is due to the lack of information to my above comments. if i find out the answers to those questions i will add them to this review.

Drop a touch into mac 'n cheese, and they'll wonder what your secret ingredient is.  Spread out some Ritz crackers, lay a little square of Swiss cheese on each one, then top it off with a tiny dollop of this, and your crew will polish off the whole box.  Good stuff!

Moist, extra chocolatey, and so tasty! They do take much longer than the package says to cook through (keep testing, because they do not carry-over cook!). Also I line my 8" x 8" pan with parchment to help get them out of the pan and cut them. So tasty! Also, to be fair, I can get them for 6.99 each at Whole Foods, so this isn't really any cheaper, but that's OK!

review/text: As-is, this is the most perfect brownie mix in existence for gluten free brownies. If I'm adding chips, I go with Namaste foods. But as-is, King Arthur Flour is, frankly, better than a normal brownie in every way. BTW they are less nutritious and more fattening than normal brownies because of all the starch, but awesome. I bake them using butter. Once I cut them into squares I take all the uneaten ones (if any) and freeze them. They are perfect reheated in the microwave, with ice cream or frosting or with brandied fruit, whatever. A must, if you want your brownies!

review/summary: Good Mix and Good Price for Gluten Free
review/text: I have made these before and this is a better price than buying them directly from King Arthur. I add a little more cocoa powder and chocolate chips to make them really decadent. My husband says this has made Celiac's Disease much less depressing -- good sweets are hard to find!

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: I just want to say that these are by far hands down the BEST cake mixes that I have found that are Gluten Free. My family has Cealic disease and we love our sweets, I have tried several diffrent types and others are very heavy, these cakes acutually rise up and are fluffy. Hard to find in our local stores, so for thanksgiving I made a difftrent brand. Needless to say, my 9yr old daughter said to me "Mommy, this isn't a King Arthur cake is it"? Thats saying alot from a kid! The Amazon price is very reasonable in comparision to me driving to town and searching for them. They shipped promptly as well.

review/summary: can't tell they are gluten free
review/text: Had these at a friend's house tonight, and I like them better than regular glutenful box brownies. I baked gluten, egg and dairy free for several years mostly from scratch, and these rival anything that I've tasted aside from a flourless chocolate cake. They are very chewy and chocolatey without being sickly sweet. Worth trying.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: My son is completely gluten free, I am not, we both thought these were fantastic!  I even froze the rest of them and I have been eating them a little bit at a time.  The only drawback is that it was difficult cut them because they stuck to the knife.  This made the edges rough, not a big deal to us, but might be irritating if you were trying to serve them at a party.  Overall this a fabulous mix that I will buy again.

review/text: These brownies are by far the best I've tried. They rise well, and are rich and moist. The first time I made them, I froze several to make them last and they tasted great even straight out of the freezer. I made them for the second time yesterday, and added chopped walnuts. Delicious! The only problem is slight difficulty in determining appropriate cooking time, as this last batch ended up a little underdone in the center even when the edges got crusty. Well, there is one other problem: my secret fear now is that I will stop thinking of brownies as a "forbidden" food and accidentally eat the gluten version at a party someday!

review/summary: Rich Chocolate!  :)
review/text: This brownie mix is expensive and I like the ones that I make at home better. (though they take a lot more work!)<br />I liked how I could just go to the store and buy a gluten free brownie mix for once, it saves a lot of time. They had a very rich chocolate taste, so I would advise that you cut the brownies small so that the taste isn't too overpowering. I'm not saying these brownies are bad or (though that might be what it sounds like from my very first sentence of this review.) that you shouldn't buy the mix and make them, I'm just saying that homemade is always better, though not too many of us have the time these days to make everything homemade. (especially us who must eat gluten free) Anyway, back to my review. They also have a nice texture which was not what I expected, and they rose very high. I didn't use the pan size they said to use, but I will next time. (the brownies didn't get cooked in the middle, but they got cooked on the sides, so I had to keep cooking them and the sides got hard.) Overall, this gf brownie mix is good, though you may need to boxes if you play to share them with your family! :)

review/summary: Cat addiction
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OSL2J6">NEW! 6- PACK Kitty Kaviar (6 oz)</a>  My sister-in-law gave me a can of Kitty Kaviar for my cats when she came to visit one time.  Two years later I am still buying it as 2 of my 3 cats appear to be addicted to it.  They have a set time when they get it and believe me, they let me know when it is time.  One of them literally yaks at me and runs ahead of me down the hallway watching to make sure I am following.  I make sure I have plenty of cans and when I go away, the people who feed my cats are also instructed to make sure the cats have their Kitty Kaviar.  A little bit goes a long way.  It's all natural with no additives and preservatives, does not need to be refrigerated and apparently has a great taste according to my cats' reaction to it.  Can't be without it.

review/text: My cat would not eat any other treats on the market until someone introduced me to this. He can't seem to get enough of it, and will just about open the can by himself. He knows where it is, and jumps on the counter in anticipation of his next serving!! My husband will leave the empty bowl out, just so "Kitty" can't get one past me and trick me into a 2nd helping!! Definitely a must have if you want to spoil your cat even more.<br />This is also a great value, as compared to local retail outlets.

review/summary: Cats Never Go Along With The Crowd
review/text: Well, I have not personally tried Kitty Kaviar, but I recently got the 2-can special as I was ordering something else and wanted to avoid shipping costs by having my final costs go over what ever the top was then.  I have eight cats - several of them love anything fish - none of them are especially fussy.  And with eight cats, even if X number do not like Y product, some cat[s] will eat all or most of it.  Not in the Kitty Kaviar case.  Not a single cat was moved by the scent of Kitty Kaviar.  I left some sprinkled on a large plate; the KK was nibbled at, then ignored until I tossed out what was left [most]. Have continued to offer it, no takers.

review/text: The product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it. However, Kitty Kaviar or "Bonito Flakes" as the Japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on Amazon, there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here. You can also find this at your local Korean/Japanese grocer in big bags that last months.

review/summary: delicately, ridiculously delicious
review/text: I first tried this wonderful little cheese about four years ago when I lived in a town that should have been named some fancified version of Foodie Heaven. Nowadays, in my little town of five hundred, this little hunk of dairy nirvana is a little harder to find. Imagine my surprise when on a whim I did a search for this cheese today and it popped up immediately!<br /><br />If you've had and liked ricotta cheese or fresh mozzerella it's very likely you will LOVE this cheese. The flavor of this Greek sheep's milk cheese is delicate and light, similar to the aforementioned Italian offerings. It slices in slightly brittle but firm rounds and goes beautifully with plain crackers and crusty breads.<br /><br />According to my former cheese monger, sheep's milk cheese is much easier to digest because the fat molecules are smaller than in cow's milk. For some reason as I've hit my early forties, this matters, digestively speaking. I feel much better eating less dairy overall but sheep and goat dairy products work very well for me.<br /><br />If you can source this locally and save the exorbitant shipping, consider yourself having won the cheese lottery.

review/text: I just started to purchase vinegar drinks for the family as an alternative to sodas and even sweet juices. After researching and talking to the other health nuts, I realized how much healthier it is for my kids to drink this. The product is used to help cleanse the system, which is especially important for those like me who eat a lot of fried foods. I think the best part of it all, is that this product does not taste like it is good for you. It actually taste decent. I also like how the twist on cap allows you to save the rest for later. It come in pack of 24. We go through all of it in about 2 weeks. I will definitely keep buying and trying the other flavors to change it up. Very much recommended.

review/text: This new white rice bread with flax is great.  The flax adds a nutty, wheat-like taste to the bread.  The bread is light and delicious, and more flavorful than just the plain white rice bread.

review/text: The taste is bad, the texture is bad--the only way we could eat it was to crumble it up to make meat loaf.
