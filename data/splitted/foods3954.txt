review/text: Got a bag of these for my Old English Sheepdog at a local "Pet Health Food" store. Nice enough store but a bit too "New Age, Alternative Health, BS" with prices to match.<br /><br />OTOH, the treats are great and he loves them so I was glad to find them much cheaper and Amazon Prime as well. I have ordered a couple more bags.

review/summary: My pup loves em.  Good enough for me.
review/text: At first, my dog (a 10lb Maltese-ish mutt) didn't seem to interested in these.  I've since decided it was because before these I was essentially handing him fully artificial crap.  I think it just took him a week or two to get used to the good stuff.<br /><br />Now, he sprints to his kennel whenever he hears me opening the bag!!<br /><br />Just ordered my second bag.  I do wish the other flavors came in individual packages, though.  It feels terrible to me to pay $50 on dog treats even if it is a bulk buy.  But that's certainly not a knock on the product!

review/summary: Threw them out
review/text: This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be "organic" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money.

review/summary: cookies, not jerky -- and the dogs are not pleased
review/text: I was searching for USA-made chicken jerky for my two chows and the Plato line came up. My goof not to realize these 'strips' are baked cookies, not dried chicken meat strips, and the dogs have made it very clear -- they definitely prefer real jerky. They don't seem to like the (sort of dry-fudgy) texture of these treats, but will 'accept' the chicken and the salmon, while simply rejecting the duck version. Broken up as training bits for the puppy these will probably be usable, which is good since they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Later I found Bellyrubs brand chicken jerky (at about half the price of Plato) at a feed store, and I am back in the dogs' good graces.

review/summary: Not chicken jerky
review/text: I bought these two months ago in a relentless search of made in the USA chicken jerky treats.  They are not jerky, but two inch formed pieces.  Also in the two months since I purchased them the price has increased 30%.  I feel that consumers looking for jerky that is made in the USA are being taken advantage of.  Also, my dogs agree, this is not jerky.  I love organic, but I will keep looking.

review/text: My dog loves dried chicken jerky treats, but almost all are from China which concerns me.  Trying to find a safer alternative, I stumbled on these.  If you're looking for whole chicken breasts which have been dehydrated, these aren't the same.  They are pieces & parts molded together and almost look like cardboard.  My dog likes them, but they don't seem like anything special to me.  They do say organic, so hopefully are safer, but I'm not really impressed.

review/text: Firstly, these are a really great price compared to the Milo's Kitchen treats we normally buy. The only problem is our Pomeranian is pretty underwhelmed by them. When he gets his regular treats he is really excited and does his little "doggy dance". When I first gave him one the Plato treats he ignored it and our cat tried to eat it, I broke it up into pieces so kitty did get to eat it. The next day I left two on the floor and withheld his usual Milo's Kitchen Chicken Grillers. After awhile he finally ate both of them! So he will eat them but isn't too excited about them.

review/text: I have two fussy dogs (Yorkshire Terrier/Poodle mixes), who reject any kind of hard biscuit after trying them for a few times. I've lost count of the number of bags and boxes of biscuits I've tried and then sent to my sister's dog, who'll eat anything.<br /><br />The Plato Organic Chicken biscuits are the only exception for my girls. When I offer them, they grab them and run to their favorite spot to crunch them right up. A little pricey, but worth it. I've finally given up trying anything else.

My dog loves all the flavors that Plato offers and I love them because they are good for him and are produced right here in the U.S.  The price is very good compared to some other made in the U.S. treats I had tried before these.  I highly recommend these for your four legged family members!

review/text: I used to feed my dogs the "made in China" chicken fillets and they all loved them but the more info I gathered about them the more I questioned feeding them to my dogs.  I switched to beef jerky but with 2 large dogs and 2 small dogs that became very pricy.  I found these by doing a search on Amazon for chichen treats made in the USA with free shipping.  All four of the dogs love them and I feel much better about feeding these to them and while they are not cheap they are a lot cheaper than beef jerky.

review/summary: Great Deal
review/text: My everlasting quest to find cheap and healthy dog treats has eventually lead me to this brand.  I have yet to find any healthy treats cheaper than this when looking at a cost/ounce comparison.  It's made in the USA, which is a necessity.  I refuse to buy any dog treats from China, and so should you.  I used to buy the Waggin Train brand until I researched it.  Please research your dog treats!<br /><br />I would say these fall somewhere between a hard and soft treat.  They are not chewy, but will not crumble when you break them.  I usually break them in half so the bag lasts longer.  My Lab likes them, but I wouldn't say they are his favorite.  He will sometimes turn these down if he has a more desirable toy in his mouth.  This is the only reason I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5.  I do plan to try the other flavors to see if he likes them better.

review/summary: Wellness is Good Food
review/text: Wellness is a food we like for our dogs both because of what's in it and what's not in it. Why does it cost a little more than some other foods? Think about what's not in it. No meat-by-products. No wheat. No corn. No white rice. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br /><br />Our bichon had been having major problems with itching and skin allergies. Our vet suggested we put her on a bland diet and gradually introduce foods to determine the cause or causes or her discomfort. One day an employee at a local pet store suggested we try Wellness with whitefish and sweet potato. I wasn't sure about feeding fish to our dogs but gave it a try.<br /><br />The switch to this Wellness formula was a great success. Evie loves the flavor of this recipe and eats it eagerly. While on the Wellness diet her itching and scratching decreased tremendously. If you think your dog may have food allergies that trigger itching and excessivve scratching, give this Wellness recipe a try.

review/summary: Its pretty much the same as normal pasta
review/text: Great for most people that are trying to control blood glucose impact of their foods by controlling digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />This stuff tastes the same as regular pasta.  Just be sure to read the label on your pasta sauce so you don't inadvertently take in a lot of sugars via the sauce, or better yet, make your own.<br /><br />A few things to be aware of that I have discovered:<br /><br />Don't overcook it!<br /><br />Don't put cooked pasta in the sauce and heat it - that is, do NOT pour the sauce into the pasta and mix it up in the pan and heat it!  Cook and drain the pasta firs according ot the directions ont he box, THEN plate the bare pasta first (possibly tossing it lightly in olive oil) and only then pour the sauce and other toppngs on and serve immediately.<br /><br />Again: Don't put the sauce, meat and cheese on the pasta until you actually plate it and serve it.<br /><br />I've found if you "re-cook" Dreamfields "angel hair" pasta in normal (acidic) tomato based pasta sauces that it does hit my blood sugar a lot harder than if they are put together at the last minute.  Same goes for overcooking it (aside from the fact that any pasta that's overcooked turns to mush).  My guess is the extra heat or acidity causes the "sequestered" carbs to break out and become available for digestion.<br /><br />All in all, this stuff in incredible, and tastes no different than most other boxed pastas, and doesn't cause the blood sugar spikes and weight gain that the normal pastas do.  I bought a case of it, and have some of the other types of Dreamfields as well.

review/summary: Fret no more!
review/text: Here at last is a low-carb pasta so good that you will be able to enjoy your favorite dishes whenever you wish.  [My concern is low carb eating to lose weight;  I can't address the blood sugar situation.]<br />But a major bane of a low-carb diet has been the necessary elimination of pasta.  And we all know that whole wheat pastas just aren't the same.  Well, Dreamfields is just the same.  Welcome back, quick, easy, delicious pasta meals.  A jar of that wonderful Costco White Linen Collection Marinara Sauce, 2 carbs per 1/2 cup, and a quarter cup [cooked] of Dreamfields pasta, and: Bob's your uncle! You have a lovely dinner, with a simple salad, and the next day your weight will not be affected negatively [don't eat any cake, though!].<br />Happy days are here again!

review/text: We love this pasta.  We don't have any blood sugar problems, but like to limit our carb intake.  Dreamfields is great tasting pasta, but you don't have to pay a fortune for it.  We have an imported pasta we like better, but it's $8-$9 for 12 oz. at a gourmet shoppe.  We like this ALMOST as much, it's low carb and MUCH less expensive.  I can heartily recommend you try it.

review/text: This product tastes great and, I'm sure, is the great white hope for MANY Type II diabetics...just not me and probably others like me.  I am quite insulin resistant and a couple of hours after my meal of Dreamfields my blood sugar was 149.......4 hours later it was 229 with NO additional food of any kind.  I found out later that this is a known issue with this pasta with some insulin resistant diabetics.  I feel that the Amazon page for this product should say that as should Dreamfield's website.  Just thought someone should warn people. (But it tastes great)

review/text: I tried the Argan oil after watching a documentary on TV. I originally ordered it 1) by curiosity (I wanted to see what the hype was about) and 2) because of it's alleged health properties.<br />I was amazed by the taste. I will never revert back to olive oil, EVER! The  antioxidant virtues are really an added bonus for me, my salads have become amazing and very special. I love the nutty flavor!<br />I also ordered the raw version for my skin and hair, and its equally as amazing. My skin has recovered its elasticity and radiance.

review/summary: Don't waste your money on this!
review/text: I usually don't write these but I had to for this item. I bought this as a present for my nieces. It arrived today and my sister sent me pictures of it and what was inside. I was very disappointed when upon seeing the pictures I saw that everything that was detailed on the item page as being included was not.<br /><br />Item was not as described and I contacted Amazon and the rep "Taniya" initially just gave me her opinion on the matter instead of a real answer to my question. I asked if I had to call the company directly to just have the missing items sent. At no point did I ask for a replacement or a refund, just wanted the missing advertised items. After I expressed my dissatisfaction of her reply (her opinion) to my question a refund was offered only if I placed the order again. This did not resolve my problem at all. I am very disappointed at Art of Appreciation Gourmet Gift Baskets and Amazon customer support.<br /><br />So don't waste your money on this item. You can easily buy all this yourself for $15 or less. Lesson learned.

review/summary: Still "Mmm-Mmm Good" After All These Years!
review/text: I typically like to make my own soups, but when I want bean with bacon soup, I buy Campbell's Bean with Bacon. I can't seem to replicate the flavor of this, and prefer it to my own version of bean with bacon soup. I've been enjoying this Campbell's flavor since I was about 12 years old when I first had it, and it's still one of my favorites.<br /><br />This comfort-food-feeling soup has a hearty flavor and density that keeps me full for hours. In the thick broth, there are little soft bits of bacon, as well as tiny pieces of (soft) carrots. The main attraction of this soup, the beans, are plentiful, have a great flavor and are nice and soft. Nutrition fact wise, the total fat per serving is only 3 grams of fat, calories per serving 160 grams, protein: 8 grams and 5 mg of cholesterol.<br /><br />Not only for the great flavor and protein, but also because this is a relatively healthy soup, I recommend this to anyone that needs food every now and then :)<br /><br />As a side note, it's a nice little bonus that each Campbell's soup can has a 5 points "Labels For Education" label which is worth actual money (5 points = 5 cents) to participating schools.

review/summary: Delicious thirst quencher
review/text: After a long flight, I arrived in Moorea, tired and thirsty.  Weather was very warm and humid.  At the lobby of this 5-star hotel where I was staying, a smiling hotel employee at the front desk handed me a beverage.  One sip of this cold, refreshing, drink and I just had to ask what it was.  It tasted like freshly squeezed lemonade, without the tartness or after-taste of sweetener. She then left and came back with this bottle of Teisseire Lime from France, a product which I was not familiar with.  I insisted on buying an unopened bottle to bring back home.  Upon returning to the USA, I immediately hunted for this product and found it on Amazon.  I promptly order several bottles in Lime, Strawberry, and Grapefruit flavors.  All were delicious, and I will definitely continue buying them.

review/text: "We repackage k-cups into a new bag. We use a recyclable and compostable bag that is eco-friendly."  So how would they "gift wrap" the crumpled and stapled brown paper bag in which these arrived?  I bought these as a gift, expecting a box or company gift bag as the eco friendly container. Mediocre collection of coffees that could have found while dumpster diving.  That's what the presentation leads one to imagine.  Will not be giving as a gift and probably won't use them.  Go to a local market instead!

I don't regret trying these, but it's very unlikely I would buy again because of the unflavored coffees they included and the fact that 6 of those unflavored were decaf.

I can not say the same.  There were at least a dozen different flavors in the box.<br /><br />The packaging isn't so great.  The cups just come loose in the brown box they are shipped in.

review/text: This variety kcup pack was pretty good. My fav out of them was the Green Mountain brand. I'm not really a chocolate coffee lover, but I tried them all. I've noticed since I got a Kuerig machine for my birthday I have been practically using it almost every day taking my coffee to work. Pump the breaks, I needed to slow down, I started getting the caffeine headaches. So now I'm down to maybe taking the coffee in twice a week and everything has been fine. I would order again and maybe next time some decaf. Good variety.

But as others reported, I got repeats in the assortment, as many as 4 of the exact same product.  Furthermore, I received two CIDER products, which are not coffee.  I don't want cider, I want coffee.  And thanks for the iced coffee sample, which I also don't drink.  Lastly, the k-cups are packaged in a brown paper bag which is stapled shut.  I'm guessing that doesn't even meet food packaging codes; there's no product info, ingredient info or nutrition info.

It seems a bit random,  but that is ok with me because I am a new user and wanted to try lots of choices and see what I really liked.<br /><br />So far I really love the Pumpkin Spice, the Cinnamon Roll and Supreme Vanilla.

review/summary: Came packaged in a plain, brown paper bag
review/text: I bought this variety pack to go with the coffee maker I purchased as a gift.  The variety I received was decent, but I was totally unimpressed when I opened the shipping box and found that the coffee assortment was packaged in an unlabeled plain, brown paper bag.  I thought the assortment would at least come in a labeled box of some sort, but the samples were literally stuffed in a bag with the top bunched up like a brown bag lunch.  It literally looked like someone just tossed 24 random coffees in a bag and threw it in a shipping box.  Not the best for gift-giving.  I thought that was pretty tacky, especially for the price.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: By the letter of the description, the order was accurate--I got 11 "different" types of coffee. That is, if you believe that regular Donut House, Folgers Lively Columbian, regular Caribou Blend, Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend are different types of coffee. They're not. (I also got five other cups in four actual varieties: pumpkin spice, gingberbread, french toast and eggnog.) Furthermore, they all came shipped loose in a box. Again, no special packaging was promised, but I was planning this as a gift, and it's not really gift-appropriate.<br /><br />All in all, I have no grounds to stand on in asking for a refund, but this isn't what I was expecting.

review/summary: crumpled up brown bag packaging
review/text: I ordered the coffee samplers for a christmas gift. I was very excited that received the order really quick. I was expecting it to be in real packaging. Opened the box and found a crumpled up brown bag, hole on the backside with the k-cups tossed in and stapled shut. There's no way I'm going to give this as a gift. There was a good variety if you are buying for personal use, but the packaging dies not cut it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OAZ36I">24 Count K-cup Flavored Coffee Sampler</a> Huge disappointment!

review/text: This is the third time I've ordered the flavored sampler, and in the 24 K-Cups, about 10 of them are hot chocolate!  When you're ordering for your office, and expect a coffee sampler but get a majority of hot chocolate, it's very disappointing!  I guess there's no way to confirm what flavors they decide to throw in your box.

review/text: Flavored coffee sampler is how this product is described.  What I received were 12 flavored coffee's and then an assortment of capuccino,tea and cider.  To be fair I ordered this item one more time and the exact same thing happened.  I also contacted customer service and they sent me out another 24 pack and once again it was the same thing.  They told me they would pull the item from the listing and get it straightened out one way or the other.  I will be looking to see if it is still listed.  I love the idea of trying new flavors but not at the expense of not getting all coffee.

review/summary: K-cup Flavored Sampler Pack
review/text: I received the K-cup sampler and immediately sorted through the flavors upon its arrival.  The  selections should have been titled "Vanilla Assortment," since the majority of cups in the box were variations of that flavor.  There was nothing from Celestial Seasonings, but I enjoyed the coffees I did receive.  One other note - there was no packing slip with the order, so if I was not satisfied, I'm not sure how I would have filed a complaint.

review/text: The fist time that I bought a batch I was pleased because as a result of a review (I think) they were more careful with the selection.  The later purchase was not very good but still was not bad enough to make me give them a bad review and I decided to give them another try.  My las purchase was really, really bad.  They sent 7 Hazelnut DECAF (7 DECAF!!!! And of the same!!) and like 8 hot cocoa, so more than half the order was not coffe that I could use for my morning caffein rush.  I had never received more than 2 decaf and 2 of other (hot cocoa or tea). Do not buy, look for other seller, even if it's a little more expensive it will be a lot better purchase than this.

review/text: I bought the 34 count. Maybe I caought the packaging department on an off day. I recieved 10 flavors in my package, which would be fine, but 4 of the flavors only had one sample. Several of the flavors were very common flavors and not that exciting. A majority of the box I received was Donut shop chocolate glazed (5), Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream (6), and of course Kahlua (8)... that is 19/34, so almost 2/3 of the package was 3 flavors.<br /><br />This sampler was not what I was hoping for and seemed to be a compilation of the flavors you see on the discount shelves at the store all the time. I could have bought a box of 18 Kahlua at big lots for $7. I would think that any sampler should limit themselves to know more that 4 of any given flavors.

I ordered this sampler once before and got lots of great coffees and only a few cappuchinos and a mocha something-or-other, which was fine.  But this just wasn't what I wanted - cappuchino and coffee are very different things.

review/summary: Fair selection of flavored coffee
review/text: I like to try a lot of different coffees with my Keurig and frequently buy random assortments like this one.  The k-cups came in a small box, just thrown in there, but they were packed fine in my opinion.  They box was the right size for the 34-count option I ordered and I even got 1 extra k-cup.  The assortment was ok.  I got commonly liked flavors, several were duplicates, and more than half the box was Green Mountain coffee.  I also got 6 decafs which I really don't drink, but I hold on to them for guests.  I generally prefer to get more of a variety of flavors and brands, but the flavors I received are ones I like, so I'm not really complaining.  Here's the breakdown of what I got.<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee:<br />3 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />2 Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 French Vanilla<br />2 Mocha Nut Fudge<br />2 Southern Pecan<br />1 Wild Mountain Blueberry Fair Trade<br />2 Hazelnut (Decaf)<br />4 French Vanilla (Decaf)<br /><br />Gloria Jean's:<br />1 Hazelnut<br />1 Butter Toffee<br />2 French Vanilla Supreme<br />5 Mudslide<br /><br />Donut House:<br />1 Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />2 Kahlua

Even if you get one that you don't like, oh well, it's only one K cup and you're not stuck with an entire box of a flavor that you don't like. I might never buy regular packs again, and just buy this variety pack. Fast shipping and good variety. I have no complaints!

review/text: Great selection of flavored coffees!  I received 2-3 of each flavor in the pack, except the Island Coconut.  I received about 5 of those, but I wasn't disappointed since it's a seasonal flavor (and delicious).  My personal favorite is the Cinnamon Roll.  Yum!  They were packaged in a sturdy cardboard box-- not a paper bag like so many other posters commented about.  This is a great way to try a bunch of different flavored coffees without having multiple boxes taking up space in your pantry or kitchen cupboard.  I will be ordering this again!

review/text: The Flavored Coffee Samples were packaged in a paper bag which busted open and several of the coffee's had spilled all over my other products.  These products were the Monster High 1600 Draculaura Doll, and the Monster High Skull Shores Ghoulia Yelps Doll. These were birthday present's that I had to give with coffee and the coffee smell all over it.  Very dissatisfied with the packaging and also didn't get to experience some of the flavors of the coffee..I would have returned the package but like I said the doll was a present and no time to replace the gift. The coffee smell was very obvious, and I was embarrassed with this as a gift.  I wish I would have thought to take a picture!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!! I think the coffee should be replaced and will be reporting this to Amazon!!! READ other similar comments!!!!  DON"T buy from this Seller....

review/text: I ordered two 24-packs of the K-cup portion packs and got exactly what the description said: there were 24 k-cups in a brown paper bag (shipment came in a box, the box had 2 paper bags) with a variety of different flavors. The most repetition I found was 3 of the same flavor. Because it was a grab bag, you do risk getting those gross (or at least to my pallet) flavors of eggnog flavored coffee, but it's still worth getting if most you will get is 2-3 of that flavor. There are brands of coffee I know I will not purchase a full box of because of this grab bag (Grove Square.. hardly tastes like coffee. I need to add regular coffee brewing next to the keurig to dial down the creaminess of the orignial). All in all, money well spent.

So I ordered two for 48 K-cups of "flavored caffeinated coffee" and received 9 ciders, a few cappuccinos, and a hot cocoa - about 30% of my order was not coffee!  Two cups were so damaged I threw them out as the top seal was broken.  Several others were "dented." Guess this is a lesson in you get what you pay for, as this was the most reasonable value pack offer, but I'm afraid to drink the product as they came in two paper bags packed in a cardboard box, which looks like someone put this together in their kitchen with scrap K-cups they've collected.

review/text: I bought 2 variety packs and the  flavors seem to be fairly decent and varied especially taking into consideration the low price. My only problem and the reason for knocking off 2 stars is the inclusion of 4 cider K-cups in each package. 1/6 of the order consisted of non coffee products and the description specifically states "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee".<br /><br />I purchased this for $14.25 and noticed only 3 days after ordering, the price had increased to $17.18. I know it's only a few dollars, but as the price increases I find it difficult to justify buying this product again. Especially since the package is NOT exclusively coffee as the description states.

review/text: This was not only a good deal but also a great variety of coffee flavors.  You get about 8 or 9 different flavors with anywhere from 3 to 5 of each.  The ones we've tried are great and the others sound tasty too.
