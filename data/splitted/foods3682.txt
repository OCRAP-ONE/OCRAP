review/summary: Not a bad introduction
review/text: I received six small samples of very different teas -- a good opportunity to get a rough idea of the different types at a very reasonable price.  The pu erh was undrinkable for us (not a surprise -- smelled like the bottom of a decaying boat), but the rest were quite satisfactory, the jasmine and lychee black especial favorites.  If you're a tea veteran, perhaps this purchase would not please, but for the novice just moving beyond the tea bag it's a terrific deal.

review/summary: Good Tea...
review/text: ...For the price.<br /><br />I also received two green teas, one black, one jasmine, and two oolong. It seems that is the package, judging by the other reviews. As this was the first loose tea I have ever purchased online, I was not upset by this at all.<br /><br />Loose tea rocks my world.<br /><br />It came in a very timely fashion, however, the packaging left something to be desired. The tins were dented, making it pretty hard to get two of the tops off (think: rubber husband plus bending the lid w/ a knife)<br /><br />The teas are very delicious. Fragrant, tasty, and good quality.

review/text: You get four different teas in these air tight metal boxes.  The tea is wonderful.  The tea cannot go bad because it is sealed in an air tight container.  There is enough in each for about 10 cups of tea, depending how much you use to steep.  I received 4 very different teas, (two of them were repeats) but that's what I wanted was to try something new.  These are it.

review/summary: You'd better be able to read Chinese
review/text: Received this e-mail back from the seller after contacting Amazon customer service. Tea was shaken loose all over inside of package, the tins were very tiny and instead of Dragonwell and Pu Erh, I got 2 Oolong, 2 Black and 2 Green Tea.  I assumed one of the two greens was the Dragonwell but nothing was labelled Pu Erh...in English that is, and Pu Erh was why I bought the assortment.<br /><br />From seller<br />"Hi, we are sorry that you are not happy with the tea. However, Pu Erh (in Chinese) Tea is inside, it is labeled as Yunnan Tea.<br /><br />Since  the tea was not made by us, it is by the local Chinese people, whose English translation is not as good as it should be.  Sorry about it.<br />However, the Pu Erh is definitely inside.<br /><br />We have authorized the Amazon to give you the full refund , and we would appreciate you to have a kinder feedback"<br /><br />Cannot recommend this seller.

I like the new containers they came up with for their product, it's a lot less messy than a jar and a knife, especially at group occasions. Definitely a product you can't go wrong with.

review/summary: Tangy and sweet
review/text: Remember the commercials that said "A sandwich just isn't a sandwich without the tangy zip of Miracle Whip"?<br />It's not a sandwich, it's something else. Possibly with mayonnaise and mustard, a nice thick slice of ham and a pickle between two pieces of bread. But it is not a sandwich. A sandwich needs Miracle Whip. It also needs American cheese and possibly fried bologna.<br />Miracle Whip has less fat than mayo and a lot more flavor. Lots of spices and a ton of sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup give it that signature sweetness. It's not to everyone's taste. People who grew with Miracle Whip consider it mayonnaise. People who grew up with mayonnaise are surprised to have a sandwich made with this instead.<br />It's also very good mixed with tuna.

review/text: This is the best of Hormel's pasta line of Compleats meals.  The sauce is very tasty, the tiny bits of beef don't surprise you with bone or grizzle, and the spaghetti isn't particularly mushy.  I find most of their other forms of pasta to be highly overcooked and starchy, and even among their other spaghetti dishes, the sauce in this one tastes the best.  The day they make this with 100% whole wheat pasta instead of unhealthy white, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.

review/text: I love Italian food especially spaghetti. When I cannot make my own spaghetti at home I resort to canned store bought spaghetti. Recently I purchased Hormel's compleats spaghetti and was really surprised just how tasty this product is. While the canned product can be runny with the noodles soaked in overpowering tomato sauce, Hormel spaghetti has a really full flavor with the right amount of sauce,tomato flavor and spices. The chicken and noodle variety is also very good. Give them a try you might like them.

review/summary: One of the better Hormel meals
review/text: The spaghetti with meat sauce is one of the better ones of the Hormel line but it does have its faults. The sauce is sickly sweet and has a tang of too much acidity for my liking. The noodles, though, are surprisingly good and the texture of the bits of meat add just enough to the meal to make it better. The meat itself, like most of the Hormel line, doesn't really have much of a taste of it's own but without it the spaghetti would fall much flatter. This would be definitely a five star for me if only the sauce was a bit more robust in flavor with less of the overwhelming sweetness. The other pasta dishes of the line can be doctored up easily by adding some hot sauce to mask the sweetness but for some reason I'm not a fan of spicy spaghetti so I can't bring myself to do it :)<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to spaghetti you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.

review/text: The spaghetti is not mushy--comes out just right, which surprised me. There isn't much "meat" in the sauce and the sauce is slightly acidic but if that bothers you, add a tiny pinch of sugar to it and it will take that acidity away. Honestly, this is a really good shelf-stable product for that occasional meal that you don't have time to cook and don't want to spend a ton of money ordering out. These are about $2 each and that's cheaper than a fast food meal. Probably better for you, too. :)

I served it with basmati rice, sauteed garlic spinach, heirloom tomato, avocado, fresh mozzerella cheese, and arugula salad w/ good olive oil and lemon.  I will try the rub on more meats, and see if I can duplicate last nights raves.  However, I do think the price is very steep - $9.00. I bought the spice in Missoula where their restaurant is located, seems like they could offer a discount or something. I'll see about buying it locally where I live (California) and test it out. We have eaten at the Silk Road in Missoula twice, and it is an excellent dining experience.

review/summary: You Can Blame It On The Gravy, I Guess
review/text: My apologies to all who give this particular Hormel Compleats good reviews.  I've tried several in the Compleats line, gobbling all six in the box myself.  This is the very worst of all I've sampled.  Really sorry.  Please remember, these all are personal opinions.<br /><br />The chicken is tasteless; but would be so-so when compared to most Compleats.  The dressing is...well, I don't know really how the dressing tastes because any flavor is "compleatly" wiped out by the true culprit in this disaster.....<br /><br />That would bring us to the gravy, or whatever they call that stuff on top.  I don't know how the good folks at Hormel accomplished this; but they produced a substance that not only is tasteless in itself, but draws flavor from everything around it.  That had to be quite an accomplishment, scientifically; but not good, gourmet-wise.  Certain brands of glue might be better, I'm afraid.  At least you could taste them.<br /><br />While doing this, let me again apologize to the dressing.  Just too much gravy to have any idea what it might be like.

review/summary: PDQ Chicken-N-Stuffin'!
review/text: The wife and I sampled these all-breast-meat chicken dinners and found them to be surprisingly good! The chicken was all white meat, as advertised. Moreover, it was an adequate portion size, very tender, and quite tasty. Though the stuffing was way sogged-out by the gravy, it wasn't overly spiced and was flavored very nicely. We especially liked the embedded celery pieces, which lent a home-style touch. If it weren't for the somewhat slimy texture and elevated salt content, these meals could have easily have earned five stars. Throw in some fresh or canned fruit, and you've got yourself a pretty fair lunch in just under a couple of minutes.

They are still on the shelf, and I will probably wind up trying to get rid of them at a loss or give away.

This is one of my 6 favorites. The best price that I found was at Walmart where I have often found them for $1.98 each. They take only 90 seconds to cook and then open. They are fast and good if you are a calorie counter like I am. I usally have one of these many different meals 3-4 evenings per week. My lunch is usally chicken or fish along with steamed green vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts or green beans. I use fat free spray butter.

review/summary: Salty but filling
review/text: My husband will not make more of an effort to feed himself than to heat something up and if I'm not around to provide for him or leave him something already made in the fridge, his immediate go-to is canned soups and canned pastas. As such, I thought these Hormel meals would be a brilliant thing to have around the house. Not only are they right up his alley with being extremely easy to prepare but there is a very wide variety, they come in their own bowl, and you don't need to refrigerate them. I had visions of him keeping a stash at work or in his car and never having to buy lunch if he forgot it at home. Or even him grabbing one for a late night snack and being pleased that he had so many different kinds to choose from.<br /><br />Well, he quickly killed that after trying about four of them. He now will only eat them as a last resort. He's really not all that fond of them. Which leaves me to eat them seeing as how we have so many in the house.<br /><br />The chicken breast and dressing is one of the better ones of the Hormel line but it does have its faults. The gravy is too salty like many of Hormel's products. The dressing, though, is good and filling and I actually prefer it over the potatoes you can find in many of the red meat meals. I'm not normally a fan of celery but the occasional crisp it adds to the dressing is very welcome. The texture gives what would otherwise be a pretty mushy meal, a tiny bit of contrast. The chicken in this is one of Hormel's better meats, mostly because I feel like I'm actually eating meat (which unfortunately isn't always the case with Hormel). I would say that the gravy would be much better with way less salt but I'm afraid if you took the salt away, the flavor would just be a bland, blah bore.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.<br /><br />All I know is that if the end of the world were to come, we have so many of these that we would be set for some while. Well, as long as the end of the world didn't mean the end of working microwaves, that is :)

review/text: well.... I REALLY wanted to like all these compleats to make lunches at work simpler... but I don't.  They would be fine once in a great while if you forgot to bring something good or didn't have time to run out for lunch, but overall they aren't very good.  I've tried about 6 varieties now, and this one was the better of them all, but that's not saying much.

review/summary: Brown bowl of mush
review/text: If you don't have a refrigerator and can't cook, and you're ok with industrial-tasting foods - this is for you.  I bought this because it was on sale, and to try something different for days where I'm running late and can't pack a proper lunch.  This was my first, and last, experience with the Compleats products.  It cooked up just fine.  Peel back the plastic - and it's just a bowl of brown mush.  Yes - there's real chicke on top, which falls apart when you try and cut it - and it just mixes in with what I assume was supposed to be stuffing and gravy.  Eat it with a spoon.  The picture on the package is NOT what you get inside.

review/summary: Hormel Chicken and Stuffing Dinner
review/text: I really liked this dinner. The chicken is very good quality and tasty. The gravy is really good. The stuffing is a bit moist but the taste is very good. I actually liked it alot. I know the sodium is a bit high, but the meal was piping hot and ready to eat in 90 seconds. What more can you ask for? I will buy these again. They are great for work or when you are just so tired and dont feel like going to the store. They keep forever.

review/summary: not Awful but not very good
review/text: I found this variety of compleats to be ok at best and closer to not very good. It has the same stuffing as the turk/stuff variety. It has 1 real chicken breast-no skin. The chicken breast broke apart easily enough with just a fork but it didn't have much taste and it was dry. The worst part is the gravy. In the turk/stuff they have a brown gravy_but in this chick/stuff they have a white gravy- and it doesn't taste very good_ if they used the same gravy as they do in the turk/stuff, i would have liked it better. And since there is so much gravy in here it kinda makes or breaks the taste experience-<br />The stuffing was good. The chick breast was ok> The gravy wasn't good. If you're good with jazzing up premade meals with your own spices or condiments you might be able to give it some better taste. It's much better than the chicken and mashed potato variety if that helps anybody- the sauce/gravy in that one is the absolute worst-kinda like a white paste--yuck.<br />I like the turkey/stuffing if that helps you judge my taste buds in relation to yours.<br />To some people this really will taste good- and to others it will be horrible_ that's the thing about everybody having different taste- some people like chocolate and some vanilla-<br /><br />I ordered mine in June 2012 and the 'use by date' or 'expire' date is June 2013_ so a 1 year shelf life is very good and convenient- especially for long term storage and emergency supplies and desk drawers incase you need a quick meal at work, for the kids when you don't feel like cooking_ only 90 seconds in microwave is a miracle.<br />I only paid $2 per meal and s/h was free

review/text: I've tried and enjoyed several of the Hormel Compleats over the past couple of years. Before I tried the Chicken with Dressing, my favorite was Turkey with Dressing, followed by some of the Beef varieties. Once I tried the Chicken Breast with Dressing, it quickly became my favorite. I'm 77 and a widower and sometimes I simply don't feel up to cooking a meal. These are certainly easy to prepare and I prefer them to a frozen dinner. Plus the price is less than a quality brand frozen dinner. I keep several on hand. I try to avoid salting the dinner... there appears to be enough sodium in the package already. I like these. Hint: look into Amazon's subscription program and get free shipping!

review/summary: So many recipes, so little cost
review/text: I thought myself a bit crazed to be buying a dozen bags of dried coconut, even if inexpensive at $1.35 per bag. (in my pantry, I had one 7.5 oz container from a supermarket that cost a while back $2.99, more than double the price of this).  I offered up a few bags to my daughter-in-law who bakes, and then I dug up a few Indian recipes to try it out for myself--I still have a few more to try. So then what to do with it? I proceeded w/baked goods.  That I found much easier.  Adding this to any cupcake or banana bread, cookie, or 'bar' type recipe works great; since sugar is already in the batter, you do not need added sweetness in the coconut.  I also use this to roll up truffles in, to sprinkle on top of icings, even mix it into savory items such as bread crumbs/panko for frying fish, shrimp, with an exotic flair, sprinkle it into white rice for a backnote of texture and subtle coconut flavor, put in pancake batter...the list goes on.  Also, since my 4-yr-old grandchild is allergic to dairy, eggs, and peanuts, this product is safe for her to eat. The ingredients list has only one item listed: COCONUT! Quite honestly, ways to use this product are only limited by your imagination, and at this price, it's a no brainer to play with ideas. I don't think I'm so crazy after all.

It arrived in a huge box, and it was really big."  I'm so glad I bought it for them as it was obvious that they were genuinely impressed.  It always makes me proud to send a gift that turns out to be so great - unlike ordering $100 in flowers that look like $10 worth.  I will not hesitate to buy from this company again.  And thanks also goes to Amazon for their bringing such a nice gift box on a lightning deal.

Most salsa's fail to please in either the chunkyness or spice department, this salsa qualifies in both respects.  When a salsa says hot, I need it to be blazing.  If I wanted a mild hot salsa I would purchase mild (or medium).  La Victoria is one of the few that bring on the sweat and hiccups if you eat too much. LOVE IT

review/summary: Naaaaasty stuff. Yuck.
review/text: After a hard day at work today, I was seriously craving some chips and salsa for dinner. So I went to my neighborhood store and all they had on offer was La Victoria and Pace. For some reason I thought the La Victoria might be the lesser of two evils. Boy, was I ever wrong! This salsa tastes like Satan's ingrown toenail. It is the worst-tasting salsa I have ever put in my mouth. It manages to be both slimy and pasty, with a texture not unlike mucilage. The label doesn't list any added sugar, it has that deathly-sweet taste that defines "horrible salsa" in my book. There's only one good thing I can say about this product: one bite, and my intense craving for chips and salsa is completely gone.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/text: When I received this item, immediately I read the directions and planted everything. I got about 12 seeds to sprout (I only expected one, maybe two) and they grew pretty well for a while.. Then I forgot to water them and they all died. Then a few days later when I went to throw them away, I noticed one seed just started sprouting! I was pretty happy. This tree is about 6 inches tall now and looks very healthy. The only thing I didn't like was the pot they sent it with. It's tiny!! But all in all, pretty good little set. =]

It is a 2 inch diameter bonsai stand, not sure if they say that anywhere in the product description but be aware it is a very small kit. I wouldn't order this again, I would find something larger for the same price.

review/summary: Eden Hiziki is nutritious and safe to eat in moderation
review/text: Anyone worried about this should read the review from Eden Foods website about Hiziki. They tested the arsenic levels after the Hiziki was prepared according to package directions (soaked with water discarded after 15 minutes then rinsed) and found it to be well within established limits.<br /><br />[...]There are more worrisome levels of arsenic in other foods such as chickens who are often given arsenic laden feed. Eating hijiki in moderation is unlikely to hurt you and the alginate in hijiki is thought to actually draw out heavy metals.<br />I don't work for Eden or anything I just really like sea vegetables and find them to be a good source of trace nutrients

review/summary: CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF INORGANIC ARSENIC
review/text: Unfortunately, I did not know about the warnings issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in Britain advising people not to eat hiziki because of the high level of inorganic arsenic that it contains until searching the internet for recipes on how to use my newly bought Eden Hiziki. Do some research before buying this product.  "Hiziki" is also called "hijiki". Most sellers now call their product "hiziki" as the word "hijiki" is the term used in the CIFA and FSA warinings.<br /><br />Of course the warnings were addressed by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare when they posted a statement July 30, 2004 on the Internet stating that, "There are no records of cases of arsenic poisoning as a result of the arsenic content of sea vegetables." AND On September 24, 2004 the Japan Consumer Press reported online that the weekly dietary intake of hiziki (hijiki), based on the daily intake of 0.9g, does not exceed the provisional inorganic arsenic level set by the World Health Organization. Well, OK, as long as I'm not feeding my family over the "provisional" arsenic level, no worries!<br /><br />Grocery items cannot be returned, even if you just found out reputable national food agencies have issued warnings advising people NOT to eat the product. Wish the companies would include "INORGANIC ARSENIC" level on the package, but understandably, this might turn some people off. Hope this review will prompt others to research this product before buying. I, for one, would not have bought this product had I known of the high level of inorganic arsenic content. BUYER BEWARE.

review/summary: ARSENIC IS POISON
review/text: Any level of arsenic is unaceptable.  The way they establish safe levels is they try  to determine what amount you can eat before you die of another cause besides arsenic poisioning based on the average life expectiancy.  That does not mean that a low level of arsenic is good for you. It's not. It's poison plain and simple. Protect you health. DON'T EAT ARSENIC.

review/text: German sweet licorice is nothing like American; it's flavored with licorice root, not just anise oil, and it's darkly delicious. Haribo, that German maker of gummis, makes a fine licorice wheel or snail; you unroll the licorice into a long whip or else you can bite into the wheel like a cake if you are not prone to play with your candy or blow bubbles with your gum. Your choice; either way, this is excellent licorice and a real treat.

review/text: I like licorice.  That I ordered 5 lbs of the stuff on spec should drive that point home. This is very good--not the best I've ever had, but very close. It's not too sweet, not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, a little chewy--very good, overall, and very reasonably priced.  Perhaps if I eat it all I will finally 'od' on licorice and leave it alone for a long while.  Update: Did not overdose on licorice.  Note to self: never order 5 lbs of any candy again.  Note to others:  Licorice can raise blood pressure.  If you are watching your blood pressure, don't buy 5 lbs.  The best licorice I've ever tasted was Lucky something.  It's made with beet juice as a sweetener.  Tastes wonderful and has perfect texture, but is pricey.

review/summary: Outstanding Black Licorice In Wheel Form...
review/text: While I am not a big fan of Black Licorice, my mother is.  It has started to become very hard to find good Black Licorice in my area so after various attempts (both positive and negative) I figured I would try out the Haribo brand.  Not only is the price very fair (per pound), but the taste is outstanding.  This isn't your every day black licorice, and in my opinion ( and my mother's ) has a much more authentic taste to it.<br /><br />These remind me a bit of the Red-Vine European style black licorice that my mother also likes, but Haribo wheels pack more flavor into them.  The product itself comes in a 5lb bag, like the preview image shows.  The wheels are essentially thin strips of black licorice wound up into a wheel/snail-shell design.  I find the best way to eat them is to slowly unravel the wheel then attack slow and steady.  The flavor comes across very subtle at first, but the longer the licorice piece sits on your tongue the more the flavor begins to bloom.<br /><br />Haribo Black Licorice Wheels taste outstanding, and to top it off the price is rather cheap per pound.  On sale these were just $2.96/lb which is pretty cheep for licorice of this quality.  If you are a black licorice lover then look no further.<br /><br />*NOTE: The back the product comes in does not contain nutritional information.

review/summary: Black Licorice Wheels by HARIBO
review/text: HARIBO BLACK LICORICE WHEELS<br />  i was born in Germany where we eat HARIBO Licorice/Gummi Candy the way we eat Popcorn in the US.  Once you start eating, you just cannot stop.<br />  The licorice wheels are just the REAL THING and have been around in Europe forever - around 100 years.  Quality and taste ... through and through. Many licorice/gummi producers have been trying to imitate HARIBO... but no other brand comes even close!!!  The wheels are chewy with a medium licorice flavor....not too sweet and not too salty.  Besides that, you can have fun with them by peeling them apart into many different strings.<br />  And to find HARIBO at Amazon.com is just as wonderful - the price cannot be beat.<br />  You  do not pay taxes, no shipping charges and then delivery directly to your place . . . what a bargain!<br />  Keep those wonderful HARIBO products coming, Amazon.<br />  Your grateful customer.

review/summary: Strong flavored licorice lovers beware
review/text: I've developed a taste for licorice over the years starting with the Italian licorice chips, wonderful strong licorice flavor there.... then I tried the Australian licorice, soft and chewy with good flavor, then I tried the licorice coins, firmer texture but strong, very good, unusual licorice flavor, and finally the Haribo Licorice wheels, firm , almost crumbly texture I didn't care for, and definitely the weakest licorice flavor (but good fragrance).... reminded me of the automatic bread maker I had a while back, the bread always smelled better than it tasted!

review/summary: Can't Eat Just One!!!
review/text: These wheels are as addictive to me as potato chips are to others.  The taste and texture of this licorice definately ranks with all the good to fine commercial black licorice products on the market today.

review/summary: Not too sweet--I think they're great!
review/text: These black licorice "wheels" are a staple at my house.  I also get the red ones because my nieces and nephews have preferences.  The licorice flavor is not too strong but is also not too sweet.  The kids like to unroll them a little at a time so they last a while.  The deal at Amazon is the best because the "wheels" are typically a hard-to-find item and in stores the price can be anywhere from $1.29 - $1.89 per 5-ounce bag.
