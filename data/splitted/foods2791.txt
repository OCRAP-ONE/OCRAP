review/summary: Yummy, even to an carni/omnivore
review/text: I'm an avowed omnivore.  I love me some jerky, too.  Meat in all forms, really.  An exchange with an old girlfriend summed it up quite well... "You know, you don't have to eat meat every day," she said. My response was stunned silence.  The point?  These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring, too!<br /><br />Bottom line: it ain't meat, but it's amazing for a plant!

review/summary: Great taste and texture
review/text: The teriyaki seitan strips have great smoky/sweet barbecue taste and a nice stringy, "pulled" texture. They're full of protein and 100 calories each (I wish it were even a little less), which makes for a great snack. They dont't taste like beef jerky, but it's not supposed to. They're isolated soy-free (there's a little soy from the soy sauce in it), as the base is vital wheat gluten. I carry one in my purse all the time just in case I get hungry.

review/summary: Decent, but a little odd
review/text: I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.

review/summary: AMAZING
review/text: This is just simply delicious! I have so far tried the Texas BBQ and the Mesquite Lime and I can't describe how tasty it is! I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review, is if it doesn't taste how someone would expect but whatever it taste like believe me, it's delicious! The jerky is not dry, because they seal in the perfect amount of sauce so its not wet, but moist!<br /><br />The particular packages I tried however looked different than the picture amazon has here so I'm not sure if Primal Spirit has changed their marketing recently and these are old pictures, or if when you order it, it will actually look like the picture shown. If you go to their website, the pictures on the website are exactly what I purchased from Whole Foods. I'd love to buy them online for the convenience but, I'd like to be sure they are the same packaging and not an older version<br /><br />Anyway, great product! Hope to try all the flavors soon!

review/text: I loved this!  I am a vegetarian and a mom that loves to have something in her purse for weak moments!  This totally fits the bill.  I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!

review/text: I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories. It's a great non-soy protein-filled meatless snack. Plus it's totally portable so you can keep one in your desk drawer or your handbag for when you're stuck for a snack.

review/text: I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick.

review/summary: A Very Satisfying Snack
review/text: I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!

review/summary: Really terrible! Try another flavor. Don't waste your money!
review/text: I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The "lime" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.

He also mentioned that it is put in the plastic while hot, which is of concern to me, because bpa leaches into food when it is hot.  Love love love this product with this one caveat.

review/summary: Hard to open and messy, but good..........
review/text: This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.<br />I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.<br />Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.<br />I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.<br />I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!

review/summary: Good flavor, but a wet mess
review/text: I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.

review/summary: Very tasty and healthy jerky snack!
review/text: Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

review/text: My wife and I really didn't like any of these flavors, with the exception of the Texas BBQ.  It is a sweet barbecue, which I normally don't like.  Our kids selected the Texas BBQ as a trail snack for camping combined with some round crackers and ooh baby did it hit the spot.  That said, I think all the spicy Stonewall's jerky varieties and peppered Tofurky Jerky are a superior jerky.

review/summary: The Best I've Found So Far
review/text: Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!

review/text: SO GOOD.<br />Just in case anyone was wondering. I know every vegan/vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous brother liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though- savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat-comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say "it's all about the sauce". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim-jim texture I remember (though we can argue- is that really meat? hah)- moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!

review/summary: Spirited Jerky Product
review/text: The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right--you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a briefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!

review/summary: Mesquite Lime flavor is the bomb diggity
review/text: As an omnivore, I loved beef jerky. My family would eat it all the time. As a vegan, I don't really feel the need to mimic the experience of eating beef jerky so I'm not really inclined to try out the various soy jerkys and what have you that are available. However, the mesquite lime (green packaging) is so good that it makes me say phrases that I never say (bomb diggity) and praise its deliciousness here so that all may come to know the little bit of tongue heaven that it is. Strong, bold flavor and perfect chewy texture. The only down side is that once you're done, you want more. Hence, get the pack of 24. The mesquite lime flavor is so good that I dare not try the other flavors any time soon and taint my Primal Strip food-gasmic journey.

review/summary: We LOVE this stuff!
review/text: I haven't tried the other flavors because they don't sound as appealing as Thai Peanut, which my whole family loves.  I don't know if "jerky" is quite the word, as it obviously throws off some people who only call the hard, dry stuff jerky. But this is a yummy, flavorful snack with a nice, chewy texture and just a touch of that tough-to-bite-off feel.  A great toss-in-the-bag snack for when we go out that satisfies the craving for something savory.

review/summary: Highly Recommend
review/text: I ordered a box of the Mesquite Lime after finding the Texas BBQ at my local organic grocery store. I love both flavors but am glad I got a bulk of the lime. It's delicious! I love that its only 75 calories and yet so high in protein. It's hard for me (as a vegetarian) to get enough protein while still keeping my carbs low. The standard protein bar usually has way too much sugar for my liking. These are a great afternoon snack and perfect after an intense workout.

review/summary: Good texture, bad taste
review/text: I'm not a vegetarian, but I have trouble finding decent jerky and decided to try the Texas BBQ flavor. I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!

review/summary: Yummy - even for non-vegetarians!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!

review/text: I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)<br /><br />Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!

As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.

review/text: My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like "real" jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less "saucy", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a "stringy" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line.

review/text: I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 3g fat, 8g carbs.). The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick. The texture is somewhat firm, which I enjoy, but it often gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy. I would say that of all the varieties of Primal Strips, this is currently my favorite.

review/text: I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!

review/text: WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.

review/text: This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on-the-go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.

review/text: Like other reviewers have mentioned, I fell in love with this hot sauce while traveling in Belize. It really is found on nearly every table - similar to ketchup here in the US.<br /><br />The description says the red habanero is the hottest pepper known to man. This isn't true - at least not anymore. If you are looking for a sauce that will make you cry, you should look elsewhere. The original hot flavor is spicy, but isn't too much hotter than your mainstream brands like Tabasco or Cholula. The carrot base makes for a different (better) taste than any other sauce I've tried.<br /><br />It is rare to find it stocked in store shelves in the US, but it can be found at some specialty food stores.

Then I moved to "civilization" where folks think that "Tabasco sauce" is hot sauce. I have tried every other hot sauce out there thinking there has to be something else the same...but no. There isn't. Marie Sharp's is "hot sauce"...yes...but it's not really about the "hotness"...it's about the "flavor". There is nothing it does not make taste better...and nothing tastes the same without it!

review/summary: Finally found it again
review/text: I bought a bottle of this hot sauce at a grocery store in Pasadena California in 1999 while out of town for work. It was the best hot sauce I ever tasted so I kept the bottle so I'd remember the name. I've been checking Amazon and other hot sauce web sites for years and years now, and I'm glad to finally see it offered on Amazon. The label has changed. The old label was a light blue color. It's close in flavor to Melinda's but for me it's slightly better. My favorite applications for this hot sauce is scrambled eggs, breakfast sandwiches, home fries, soup, fish fries, french fries, tacos, turkey and tuna sandwiches. I can also use it in a pinch if I'm out of habaneros when I'm making sauce for fish tacos.

review/text: I received the items purchased damaged and rancid.  I have been to Belize and actually visited and purchased this very product from an airport the first time I ever bought it.  I had been to Belize twice and was introduced to this product while staying in various areas.  I can't believe this person sent this great product to me and<br />expected me to believe it to be the same as I have had.  What a big disappointment!  I won't buy it through them again.  I threw both bottles away immediately.

review/summary: Tiki Cat food didn't satisfy our finicky cat.
review/text: I hoped that Tiki cat could end my long journey to find the best cat food, but unfortunately it didn't. Our 6 month old kitten is very finicky about her food, and I have been looking for her food on a weekly basis.  To make the matter worse, our cat has urinary crystals and the vet suggested to give her "wet food only." So far, I have tried Science Diet (all flavor), Natural choice (all flavor), Natural Balance (all flavor), Merrick's Before Grains, Fancy Feast and so forth. I got excited when I found Tiki Cat at Amazon.com. It looked perfect because it said "Many vets across the nation approve for use in UTI, CRF, IBS, and other serious health conditions." It also said their food was  a "human grade." However, when I opened one of the Tiki Cat canned food, I really doubted if it was a human grade food. At least, it didn't smell nice or look yummy to me. Moreover, our cat walked away as soon as she smelled the food. Now I have to think what to do with the left over cans of Tiki Cat. I have tried to feed it to our cat by adding some shredded cheese. It sometimes works, other times doesn't.<br />I would like to add that Weruva Cat food which I ordered together with Tiki Cat looked and smelled much better than Tiki Cat, it looks like high quality cat food. Our cat prefers Weruva to Tiki Cat too. The prices of Weruva and Tiki Cat are about the same on Amazon.com, and if so, I would definitely choose and recommend Weruva to a friend.

review/summary: My finicky cats think they have died and gone to heaven!
review/text: Over the last couple of years, I can't begin to tell you how many healthy moist cat foods I have tried, only to have the product sit in the cat bowls untouched.<br />I had just about given up on finding any moist food that Kali and Kipton would even consider eating. But much to my surprise, my two picky eaters love, love, love this stuff!  The little stinkers wake me up every morning now crying for their "Tiki Cat" tuna flavors (can't believe the variety that's offered).  You would think they haven't eaten in weeks.  The minute their bowls are down, they inhale this food like it's their last supper.  Tiki Cat has made a believer out of me!

review/summary: In disbelieve how much my cats love this...
review/text: I have 2 extremely picky cats... Have been going crazy, trying to feed them healthy, while searching for food that they actually enjoy. Found Tiki cat online, and decided to give it a shot. Was prepared for them to walk away from it (just like every single other healthy canned food, I tried to introduce in the past). The ingredient list on the label was very impressive: human grade food, first ingredient is actual fish or meat, no by-products, etc. Once I opened a can - the smell was very pleasant. Smelled like actual human food, looked very good.. and most importantly - was instantly approved by both of my cats!!! (even by the one, who refused to eat canned food, no matter what I offered her...) So far we tried salmon, and few different kinds of tuna, and they all were equally loved.<br />WOW! Very happy/impressed/excited/amazed, and finally can rest from endless searching, and enjoy watching my kitties love their food time! Highly recommend!

review/summary: Quick and apparently yummy toy
review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

review/text: I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: grapeseed
review/text: Oil is light and does not have a distinctive flavor of its own<br />to pass on in food prep.<br />Blends well and performs excellent when used in sauteing.

review/summary: The oil tastes great, works well on skin and holds up great to high heat
review/text: I want to say first off that this is A LOT of oil, I would guess that 12 bottles would last you a year or more - so try a bottle from the store to be sure you like it before ordering so much.<br /><br />That said, there are a lot of ways to use this oil so having a years supply of it would be very handy:<br /><br />-  I use it in high heat cooking since it has a very high smoke point (over 400 degrees) so it doesn't break down like olive oil if used in frying or grilling.<br /><br />-  I use it in baking since it has a very mellow flavor that stays out of the way so it is good in sweet or savory.<br /><br />-  I keep one bottle near the bath and use it on dry skin, it soaks in nicely and doesn't leave behind any scent.<br /><br />-  I have used it on my small children's dry skin because it is very gentle and odor free.<br /><br />-  I use it for oil pulling which has really boosted my oral health, I was such a skeptic.<br /><br />The oil comes in plastic bottles that don't have any baddy ingredients, which is great since they don't shatter if dropped on our tile floor if found in the bathroom by the afore mentioned small children ;)<br /><br />I got a box of 12 bottles that were all due to expire in 3 months, but amazon customer service made right by that problem.<br /><br />I really like this oil and will be getting more when we run out.
