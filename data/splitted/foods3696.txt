review/summary: Flip chips
review/text: I have been getting these chips for my dogs for a long time.  I have noticed lately that the chips are thicker and therefore the weight of the box is more so for a 9 oz box I may only get 6 or 7 chips and I have 4 dogs.  They get one at bedtime every night so this can get expensive.  The dogs also prefer the thinner chips.  I have four Yorkies.

review/summary: Superb white wine vinegar
review/text: This Terri Medi white wine vinegar is exceptionally good.  I had been purchasing it at our local Target until for some disappointing reason they don't carry it any longer.  So my search led me to find it on Amazon.  Thank you Amazon!!  I have just placed an order for 2 bottles and when they run out I will order more. You won't be disappointed with this vinegar.  Superb when preparing your salad dressings, and compliments olive oil beautifully.  Wonderful in cooked skillet dishes.  Made a rigatoni pasta dish today with this vinegar along w/ cherry tomatoes, fresh pearl mozzarella, fresh snipped basil, and sauteed onion and garlic.  Drizzle in the Terri Medi white wine vinegar and a good olive oil and --what a delicious treat warm or cold!

review/summary: Yummy Biscuit for sure!
review/text: Was introduced to HobNobs while recently vacationing in the UK.  Absolutely loved them so I brought back a couple of packages and after those were gone I went looking for them on line.  Was thrilled when I found them at Amazon. Didn't care that I was paying double for them in the States, because they are worth it.  If you like a thin dense cruchy oatmeal "oookie" with a modest layer of milk chocolate, then these biscuits are for you.

review/summary: The biscuits are 5 stars, but the packaging is horrible with open gaps.
review/text: ****Food Safety Alert****<br /><br />(see my pictures)<br /><br />I have asked amazon.com to update the product pictures, just like I have posted here over the months.<br /><br />I did get some open plastic wrap issue before. But the recently changed loose white plastic wrap inside the orange box has more open gaps, ruining the taste. And, I would rather not get sick from tasting it with these repeated issues.<br /><br />I have reported this issue to Amazon.com. And I am now reporting this poor packaging issue to McVitie's International. but I have not received any feedback from the manufacturer yet. And, there is no suggestion other than emailing them from their homepage. Frustrating.<br /><br />The package is definitely different from the one you will find in UK.<br />This export packaging, however, results in more problems. By doubling the packaging, still the company could not prevent the exact same open gap issues, and, the result is, the buyer has to deal with finding the product gone bad, and spending more time reporting the issue, yet not hearing back from no one from Amazon.com or McVitie's, unless you call.<br /><br />The result I deal with here is, The Chocolate coating get gooey, and, because of this, the biscuits are all glued together and almost impossible to separate them even with a knife. And. it is already soggy(Yes, I attmpted to eat one unsuccessfully) Maybe some of this all happened from the hot sunny day delivery during the June-August period?<br /><br />For now, I suggest not buy this. I will never recommend this to Amazon buyers like myself. I even told amazon.com not to sell this unless they resolve the issue with McVitie's.<br /><br />If you still have some at home, carefully examine the white wrap like I do. Instead of enjoying the British Taste, I get frightened opening the orange boxes, or I stopped touching what I already have. Disturbed I guess?<br /><br />I don't think I will enjoy Hob Nobs experiencing this repeatedly.<br /><br />The product should be all 5 star, but the pain I had to deal with the manufactring/packaging issue definitely is 1 star experience.<br /><br />++update++<br /><br />After I wrote this, I still called and spoke with a CS rep from Amazon.com. She said the company would refund the unconsumed portion and I voluntarily suggested suspending my monthly prescription for fairness.<br /><br />Still, dead seriously warning you to examine the white wraps.

review/text: This is a good coffee with a nice chocolate flavor.  The flavor is just right, not too weak or overpowering.  The coffee itself seems a bit stronger than in some of the other flavors, which in my opinion is a good thing...some flavored coffees end up weak and watery tasting. In this case the flavor balances with the coffee very well. Not too sweet for people who don't like sweet things in the morning (OK, I am not one of those people, but I hear they exist), but flavorful enough that I do not need to add much to it, a little skim milk is fine. No, it doesn't taste exactly like a mocha coffee drink from your favorite coffeehouse, but then it doesn't have all those calories, either! To me this is the best alternative to stopping by Starbucks for a $4 coffee...brew one of these into my travel mug and go!

review/summary: Loved this coffee!!!
review/text: We got our Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying out different varieties of coffee.  This Mocha Nut Fudge is by far our favorite.  It has a great combination of mocha and a subtle nutty flavor.  We'll be drinking this one for a while!

review/summary: A pleasant change
review/text: The coffee is not strong and you can taste the added flavors.  I first tried this as my first cup of coffee and decided it was definitely not the coffee I would start my day on. I prefer a stronger, bolder flavor for first thing. Love the taste of espresso double shots. I do like a flavored coffee, tend to go for one in the afternoon.  So I found this to be on the sweet side but then I never add any sugar or sweetener to my drinks. (nor syrup to my pancakes, gotta have butter) You get the idea I prefer savory to sweet.  If you like nut flavored coffee and chocolate you would probably like this. I like it.

review/text: This is a nice jasmine tea, that doesn't get bitter if you forget it and steep it longer than 3-5 minutes (as I have done). There isn't a lot of jasmine aroma in the steam or the flavor, which is why I took a star off, but as an economical everyday jasmine tea it can't be beat. I liked it enough to order more.

This is just delicious tea, doesn't go stale quickly (ie, will last on your shelf for several years if you go in and out of tea-drinking phases), and reminds me of being in Montreal because so many of the restaurants in the Chinatown area serve it.

Not up to homemade variety in quality, or variety formerly available in, say, Boston-area bakeries who got it fresh from a now-defunct wholesaler. When this is done right, it is delicate and flavorfull. When it is done heavy-handed and unskilled, it can be a chore to tolerate. Delicate is not one of the words that go with commercial bakery rugalach.

review/summary: Good chocolate, disappointing presentation
review/text: I received this item as a gift.  It was really strange and unprofessional in the way that it arrived.  The return address had a personal name on it with "Heartwarming Treasures" underneath, the box was damaged,and the basket was kind of crunched and not very nicely wrapped.  Adding to the unprofessional presentation, there was a card with it that was inappropriate (a spring design card was sent for a Christmas gift) and the card was sloppily signed with cursive handwriting.  And there was no other note about this supposed company that sent the gift or what it was (it should have said something about being Pacific Northwest chocolates, which would have made it more meaningful since that has some significance to me).  Needless to say, these factors made the entire gift less desirable.  I opened the chocolates anyway and the one redeeming thing about this gift basket was that they contained amazing chocolates.  The mint chocolate truffle was the best I've had.  That said, if you're going to send Seattle Chocolates as a gift, I'd pick another gift basket vendor besides this one.

review/summary: Good, but expensive.
review/text: I used DaVinci for years, until Walmart stopped selling the entire brand. The brand they switched to carried sugar free Hazelnut but for whatever reason Walmart elected not to inventory the flavor. Bad decision, but that's another review.<br /><br />After using this brand, Torani and then Oscar's I have to say that I really appreciate this one the most. It has a great Hazelnut flavor.<br /><br />The only reason it gets four stars is the price. A whopping $8.20 per a 750/ml bottle is absolutely too expensive. Even Starbucks' own label isn't that much. The awful Torani is $5.40 (it comes with 3 bottles at $16.30 + free shipping), yet again, it's awful but it IS cheaper. Oscar's isn't available for now, but I only paid $5.06 per bottle (+ shipping)! Oscar's is almost as good as DaVinci. The only problem with it is that at the time of this review, Oscar's are out of stock here at Amazon.<br /><br />If you don't mind the expense, then you'll like DaVinci. It has a great flavor. If you're wavering over the cost, look elsewhere before buying. Just whatever you do, don't buy Torani's unless you like pancake syrup! Trust me.

review/text: Our cat loves these Temptations treats. This is his favorite flavor, although he likes many of the other flavors.  We used to buy them in supermarkets and Target, but they either stopped selling them or the price went way up.  I did some calculations and found that getting these mega bags with free shipping is the same cost as the price we used to pay, which is .51 per ounce.  Most of the offerings for these treats on Amazon have the per ounce price right next to the item price.  So, it's easy to compare.  Our cat highly recommends them, 2 paws up.

review/summary: This wild Alaskan salmon is right off the hook good ...
review/text: If you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for Bear & Wolf.  This is almost right off the hook good.  It has that "fishy" taste that I actually prefer, but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down.  If you've tried the Kirkland brand, which is delightfully pink and flaky, you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild.  I do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed ... some farming conditions are less than optimal (such a turn off).  This is wild Alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it.<br /><br /> On the label it says, "Satisfaction Guaranteed or your money refunded."  If you like that right off the hook taste, you'll love it.

review/text: Eat more fish. Eat more fish. I seem to read the advice everywhere. Well, that's not a bad idea for health reasons, and I like fish now and then. It just doesn't seem to work it's way into our diets often enough. Well, I discovered a way that may get around that problem. While shopping at my local Costco warehouse store, I discovered  a wrapped set of six six-ounce cans of Bear & Wolf Pink Salmon. It's wild Alaskan salmon, packed with a little water and salt, and it's skinless and boneless.<br /><br />I opened up a can when I got home. It has very little "fishy" odor, although my  cats certainly got excited when the top came off the can, and the taste is fresh and mild. Excellent! One of the reviews suggested eating it raw, so that's what I did with a variety of salad veggies. Mmmmm, good. Nice lunch. I'll surely repeat this. Plus the unused portion in the can was easy to cap and return to the fridge. Another suggestion was to put it in casseroles for baking. Of course, I can hardly wait. A scalloped potato dish with salmon ought to be excellent. Or salmon with noodles. I can even take it along as a quality source of protein when I go camping. That's what I like about this product. It's high quality, real handy and easy to store.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Fully packed cans of a tasty salmon.  Not as good as fresh salmon, however makes great sandwiches and salads.  I add lemon juice...and last night ate it straight...put it in a dish and ate it ( I was in a hurry)..No bones...no odd questionable pieces.  I make sure I have an extra supply of this on hand at all times.  it was helpful during the power outage of 5 days last October.

review/summary: This used to be a great product, used to be
review/text: I used to buy this at Costco when I used to live near one. After moving, I had a lot of difficulty finding canned wild salmon that is boneless, skinless, tastes descent, and won't break your wallet (I eat salmon every day). I lead a very busy schedule, so I don't always have time to prepare meals from scratch, but want to stay healthy, so I look for products such as this salmon in a can. I gave up on finding BPA free cans a long time ago, so I don't bother checking for that anymore, and couldn't tell you if these cans are BPA free or not.<br />With all that said, I was excited to find this product on amazon, as I used to eat this brand all the time. I ordered it, and opened a can expecting the same great taste. I was soooooo disappointed! They must have changed the recipe or something, because now it tastes like one of those cheap brands where you're not even sure it's real salmon. It's no better in flavor than the stuff that I do find on the grocery store cans, which are all real gross in flavor.<br />I gave it two stars because the flavor is

review/summary: Great product, GROSSLY overpriced (on Amazon)!!!!
review/text: I love this product! It isn't as salty as some of the other canned salmon products I've encountered. I often use it in raw garden salad. It's moist and needs little to no seasoning, in my opinion. The salmon comes in nice meaty chunks (think albacore tuna) that flakes apart easily if that's how you prefer it. The product is 5 star all the way. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for the outrageous price here on Amazon.<br /><br />I originally found this at Costco several months ago. I didn't recall how much I had paid for it when I stumbled upon it again on Amazon. My prevailing thought was, 'with the gas prices, I have to be saving money by purchasing it online'. I could not have been more wrong. I had already purchased two 6x6 sleeves on here when I ended up visiting Costco with my mother-in-law to find that the exact same product was only $9.99. That's half the price. How can Amazon justify doubling the price on the exact same item?! I was fuming. Never again will I buy this on Amazon. If Amazon (and its sellers) would be willing to come down off the price a bit, I would again purchase from here but until then I will have to trek to Costco to get my Bear & Wolf pink salmon fix.

review/summary: Good, but they're not K-Cups
review/text: Contrary to the name of this item, "Ghirardelli Premium Hot Cocoa K-Cups", these are not K-Cups. They are just individual packages of hot cocoa, like any other kind of packages you could buy. The pictures and description do say packets, so hopefully the name will not be misleading for purchasers. I received one of these packages in the sampler pack of K-Cups that came with my Keurig. It was strange to have a packet of cocoa mix in there with all the K-Cups but I thought maybe there was something in particular that made them special for the Keurig. Nope.<br /><br />You just put the powder from the package into your mug and run hot water through your Keurig and stir it up. Basically, you use your Keurig just to heat up the water. The hot cocoa tastes good and everything, but there is nothing that makes it specially made for the Keurig (except the marketing line that says it is).<br /><br />They have some line about it being the right "portion" size somewhere on the box, but there is nothing special about that either. They're just regular everyday packets of (tasty) hot cocoa mix..

I don't need a special brewer for this and the chocolate is the same as if I'd bought the regular Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix.  Granted, Ghirardelli makes really good hot cocoa but don't spend the extra money just because the description says "specially designed for Keurig".<br /><br />I haven't tried them yet, but Green Mountain has recently come out with real hot cocoa K-Cups.  I just ordered a box from another website and if Amazon carries them later, I'll let you know if they're good.

review/summary: Best Cocoa for Keurig so far
review/text: I had one sample envelope of this but thought it was far superior to Green Mountain (which I bought a box of.)  Green Mountain is good but a little thin for someone addicted to European style strong cocoa.<br /><br />However I notice a Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa comes in containers and by the pound and suspect it is the same as the so called "specially brewed for Keurig."  .<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H70Q0K">Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa, (2 lb Bag)</a><br /><br />Using the cocoa in the make your own filter may be a cheaper way to go or it may work just fine dropped in the bottom of the mug as you do with the envelope.  I have not tried this or priced it out.<br /><br />I would not buy a Keurig just to make cocoa, but it is great for tea and coffee and there is a wide selection.  It is for someone who has a couple of quality cups a day.  If you are drinking pots of coffee, it is going to be expensive.<br /><br />I have a lot of cocoa.  So far I have not found any that work better with the Keurig.  If they call for milk, they won't do well for sure.

review/summary: A healthy snack food; bet you'll eat the entire package in one sitting
review/text: Arare is an excellent snack food, a crunchy, soy sauce-flavored puffed rice.  In America, puffed rice would be an icky sweet breakfast cereal.  In Japan, puffed rice becomes a slightly salty, satisfying snack food.<br /><br />Traditionalists will eat arare with beer or sake.  About the only adult beverage that goes badly with arare is red wine.  One caveat:  this stuff is crunchy, LOUDLY crunchy.  There is no way to eat arare in silence.<br /><br />One variation of arare is this product, slightly sweetened soy sauce-flavored puffed rice covered with thin seaweed.  This seaweed is called nori by Japanese; the closest American eqiuivalent is laver.  Yes, this arare snack is actually healthy; you will get your share of green veggies with every bite.<br /><br />Nori will definitely give arare a fishy flavor.  Most people who have tried it the first time came back for more.  In fact, if there is a Japanese snack food that can be described as:  "Bet you can't eat just one."  - it will be arare.<br /><br />Arare is low calorie and low cholesterol.  This distributor of arare has had a near-50 year record of supplying top-notch, high-quality foods to America and the world.  Give it a try.

I told them that they didn't have to send me out a replacement, but their reply said THEY WOULD send out fresh crackers once they got a new shipment in. Well, I haven't heard from them and it has been a few weeks. I know that they don't intentionally sell old products - who would?

review/summary: A little let down..
review/text: I was excited to try this tea sampler with my Keurig Brewer, as it's getting pretty hot where I live and all I usually brew is coffee.  I decided to try the peach tea first.  When brewing, the tea melted most of the full cup of ice that I brewed it into.  After brewing I just poured some up in a fresh glass of ice.  Sadly, the tea tastes much too strong, even after brewing it on the largest cup option.  It's sweetened, but not nearly enough, as the peach flavoring just tasted sour/bitter.  With a little truvia, and some more ice, it's pretty good, and stretched to two servings worth.  But I was hoping for more of a brew-and-go experience.  I don't think I'll purchase this sampler again, but I will do want to try the Southern sweet tea by the same brand.

The flavours are all delicious and if I add some Splenda to my iced cup before brewing the unsweetened black comes out quite nicely. A lovely addition to my k cup tower.

review/text: Faerie's Finest Vanilla Sea Salt was a recent birthday gift.  Since I opened it (the version I have came in a refillable grinder) I have been grinding Vanilla Sea Salt on everything.<br /><br />As one is grinding the salt, the smell of vanilla drifts up and is quite soothing and intriguing.  The flavor, once incorporated into food, is very mild.  It is not a "dessert"-y vanilla flavor, due to the sea salt, but when sampled in a bowl of hearty turkish chicken-lemon-egg-rice soup the vanilla smoothed out the lemon flavor a bit- made it almost silky and buttery rather than tart (I put in a little too much lemon this go around)... I had filet mignon and sprinkled a little of the vanilla sea salt on the filet and I think that vanilla sea salt was made for this purpose... Absolute perfection!<br /><br />Fantastic blend, fantastic packaging.  I'm one happy salt fanatic!

Once you try it you will want more. I like it and so do all my friends. I always keep a few extra cans here because I never want to run out. Makes good appetizers too.

review/text: You can make a fantastically delicious meal using these fried eggplants. This is one brand, but there are several, the best being "Sera".  Fortunately they are all pretty similar. It's so striking that that foreign eggplants taste better than the ones available here. The exception might be the Asian variety which you can sample at some great US restaurants, e.g. Mark's Duckhouse (Dimsum shrimp-eggplant) in Northern Virginia close to Washington DC; Kim's Chinese Restaurant in South Beach (Miami Beach). Kim's sauteed eggplants  is a work of art. We always go there when we are in Miami. Anyways the recipe is just to take boneless chicken breasts, put on some spices and then put the fried eggplants evenly on top, Cook in oven at 365 for one hour. You will have a very special dish fit for company.

review/text: It's not Mama's or Nana's but it is in fact pretty good. It has no canny taste. It is probablt best used in recipes rather than straight from can but it's not bad right out of can on some good Italian bread. I added it to pasta sauce and it was delicious. Eggplant is bitter and this is a tiny bit bitter but is easily fixed by adding lemon juice if you like. All in all a very good product to have in pantry.
