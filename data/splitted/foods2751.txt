review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: NOT "PURE PALM SUGAR!"
review/text: If you want PURE, 100% PALM SUGAR (and there are plenty of options), DO NOT BUY GOLDEN PAK PRODUCTS.<br /><br />I am beyond disappointed, and here is why:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Coconut sugar<br />REFINED SUGAR<br />POTASSIUM SORBATE-->the stuff they add to cheap brands of red wine vinegar and loads of processed foods; not the worst by far, but they couldn't leave it at that :(<br />SODIUM (aka disodium) METABISULFITE-->E223 for countries that require chemical additives to be labeled (ie not the USA)--see below<br /><br />What's worse is they are distributed out of Kent, WA!! Just a stone's throw from Amazon HQ! Seattle's supposed to be a bit better than this!<br /><br />There's PLENTY of REAL palm sugar out there--I've been using the stuff--pure, plain, preservative-free, CANE SUGAR FREE palm/coconut sugar, and THIS ISN'T IT.<br /><br />Every benefit of palm sugar--and most things--gets totally lost when you (in ascending importance)<br /><br />1) ruin the flavor with nasty preservatives--in this case a sorbic acid salt to kill mold and a particularly nasty sulfite that kills just about EVERYTHING good and bad<br />2) do not clearly state it contains SULFITES, which happen to be DANGEROUS FOR SULFA ALLERGIC PEOPLE *hence needing to be labeled--which they only reliably do, from what I could see when I went back to get REAL palm sugar, on their 17.6oz vac-sealed single-slab packs (Na2S2O5--the disodium metabisulfite--is an inorganic, lab-made DISINFECTANT meaning ... yep, they threw it in to kill junk from poorly harvested/stored/transported stuff! ick! It's what you CLEAN equipment with... not to mention it can eat through hardwood floors and top grade lumber!)... Na2S2O5 is also dangerous for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions<br />and...<br />3) Hello, when someone wants PALM/COCONUT sugar... pure straight forward stuff... don't give them nasty refined sugar cane! One of palm sugar's great benefits, beyond tasting awesome, is *glycemic load* and if you toss in REFINED cane (not even the less-abrasive, still-has-some-molasses Florida Crystals or succanut etc), you are just asking blood glucose to spike. Agh.<br /><br />So yeah. This stinks. I'm upset because this is a huge, central part to my career and I get really angry knowing that most people I work to help day in and out trust these companies to sell what they say they are selling and not hide behind "no MSG added! (tiny print: "except for the amount contained in yeast extract"=>yeast itself isn't a free glutamic acid containing product; it's autolyzed yeast, ie break it down so much it's not yeast at all anymore and has ZERO properties of yeast, merely a derivation from it like fuel from corn or sugar not being corn or sugar to your body). So yeah, Golden Pak FAILS. Golden International Corp is their head company, so there are undoubtedly things under that parent name, too. Should've known better when I saw a FISH as a logo on sugar--something fishy indeed. Negative stars.

review/summary: You May Want to Eat These Yourself
review/text: Good Grief! These biscuits are for dogs? Unbelievable....<br /><br />When you open a can of Wagatha's "Breakfast Dog Biscuits" you get a smell like fresh baked banana nut muffins. And according to my wife, (who is very rigorous about such things), that's pretty much the way they taste. There are good reasons for that - the bicuits are 100% organic, (they are also kosher), and contain dried apples and bananas as well as maple sugar and cinnamon. They are also wheat and lactose free - the cereals used are spelt, oats, brown rice and barley. There's nothing in "Breakfast Dog Biscuits" that you wouldn't eat yourself.<br /><br />There are about 30 biscuits to a can - but the biscuits are easily broken in half and a half is a nice mouthful for a small to medium sized dog. They are not inexpensive, but the quality is extremely high - and the banana-apple-cinnamon flavor is a nice change of pace from the usual flavors. The "Three Muske-Terriers," (a male Westie, a female Scotty and a male Cesky ), give Breakfast Dog Bisquits five stars.

I doubt I would pay this much (over $40) for it but fortunately there is enough that it will last for awhile.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: I've been feeding my cats science diet for probably 3-4 years and the one thing they've had in common over time is that the reseal freshness "lock" seems to always be flawed in some way. I've used this sealing technology on lots of food and non-food containers for probably 20 years so I think the common denominator here is Science Diet. Someone at Science Diet probably needs to look at the QA results for their bags and figure out how to create a working "lock" that seals.<br /><br />I've resorted to just pouring the contents out into a large jug and feeding Sassy and Hoshi from there.

Frontier's has a rich flavor and color.<br /><br />The item description, or at least the picture, doesn't emphasize the brand name, and when I bought it, I didn't know it was Frontier.  I had tried Frontier in the past, when I had purchased loose tea at Whole Foods.  It comes in a foil bag (or is it plastic that looks like foil?).  You'll need a container  in which to keep the loose tea, or a twist-tie, since the bag isn't resealable.

review/summary: Great snack item!
review/text: I had had these at my parents' house but there are no local stores that carry it so I decided to place an order. I was worried that they'd come broken or that they wouldn't be as fresh as they are from the grocery store. They just arrived and they're perfect. They were packed beautifully and are incredibly fresh. These are great as a snack when you're trying to eat healthy or reduce calories. I eat them alone but my mom has them with spreadable cheese. I'm also looking forward to trying them with salsa. Great company -- they were VERY responsive to my emails and shipped these out the very next morning. And they arrived a day after that. So I ordered on a Sunday and they arrived on a Tuesday. Wow!

review/summary: Better than other seasonings
review/text: We tried the Nesco Teriyaki and Nesco Hot/Spicy seasonings, but really preferred the "ORIGINAL" flavor.<br /><br />Our favorite thing to do with it is make the beef jerky with ground beef. I even got my boyfriend to use the beef jerky gun.<br /><br />Single serving packets, no measuring required. Open packs, mix with ground beef, put meat in extruder gun, squeeze onto drying racks. BAM! Good to go!  Well in about 6-8 hours (give or take).<br /><br />If you are trying to decide which seasonings to buy, go with the Original flavor, it really is the best.

review/text: I ordered the Nesco beef jerky spice after using it in a batch I made some time ago! I have used wet rubs and dry rubs for years to get that jerky taste everyone loves! Nesco makes the only jerky spice that gets everyones attention. I give it to people who have the look of "Oh Great..... another guy who makes his own jerky" and after the first bite I usually hear "YOU MADE THIS? IT'S FANTASTIC". I usually make a few pounds and give it to friends at work and tell them to give it to their families to taste and give me feedback. VERY LITTLE makes it home if any! The "other" jerky makers at work are very jealous!

review/text: The spice works with both ground meat (which I didn't try) and full cuts of meat, which is what I used it on.  It was simple, directions on pack tell you how much water to mix so you can marinate the meat.  Just put the meat in the freezer for an hour, cut it up in 1/8th inch, put it in a ziploc bag, poured in the spice.  Let it sit overnight, put in the dehydrator.  The jerkey spice it good (I put in a little less of the salt the second go).  Everyone who tried it liked it, and I have bought it again.

review/text: Prompt arrival of product. I used some mixed with water to make a liquid to marinate my strips of meat. The spice is mixed directly into hamburger meat as you make that kind of jerky. I had some left over after marinating so I stuck it in the freezer so as not to just waste what was left, and i think it will be fine to thaw and add to for my next batch. ( I liked the hand striped solid meat better than the hamburger meat jerky). Good stuff if you aren`t into making your own spices for jerky like me.

review/text: I looked and looked for the flavor I used years ago to make beef jerky.  I was hoping Nesco BJ was what I was looking for.  Hurrah, it was!  I wanted a flavor that was not too hot but had a little zing.  I decided to use it as a marinade in order for the flavor to be distributed evenly since I was making up 7 pounds of beef. It was not easy, at that, because the beef was sliced so thinly and had sooooo many slices.  I put the flavoring in 1 1/2 cups of water, tried to cover all the slices and put it in a zip-lock bag in the fridge overnight.  It turned out just like I remembered.  Thank you, Amazon,  so much.  I will probably be ordering more next fall.  Helen

review/summary: Makes jerky that is better than store-bought
review/text: I usually prepare about 3 lbs of meat at a time. I have not used ground meat yet, but instead thinly sliced roast or london broil. This marinade is excellent, not too peppery, and cures the meat very well. I experimented with madinade time, and found that overnight is not enough time. The meat goes into a gallon storage bag (3 lbs with TWO marinade packs stirred into about 1 cup of water) for a minimum of two days. I massage the bad to ensure the meat is well coated with marinade. Then about 7 hours in the dehydrator is all it takes to have outstanding jerky. I made a few batches last Christmas and gave it away as gifts. My grown children raved about it. Look for the 18 pack box to save money.

review/summary: Really Good spice and cure, but be warned
review/text: The hot and spicy sauce was apparently created from the fires of Mt.Doom, or some plasma laced meteorite.  I wasn't paying attention when I made the jerky with the hot n spicy, and didn't get the spice/cure evenly applied.  Apparently in the 1.25 pounds I was curing, about 7/10ths of the spice got on one slab of meat.  So suffice to say I witnessed my tongue dissolve into thin air as my mouth exploded in pain.  4 bottles of water later, I pulled a tom hanks and was wiping my tongue with a towel.<br /><br />Maybe they took "spirit of habanero" and cloned it, intensified it, and poored some sulfuric acid crystals on there for good measure.<br /><br />All kidding aside, the Original is top notch --- I prefer it over any store-bought ready made jerky.  Flavor is great.  The other two are good too, but the spce pack gets a 5 star based purely on the taste of the original flavor.  I wish I could buy a box of just the original.

review/text: I buy this at WalMart...it's by the food dehydrators/blenders/coffee makers.  It's a little cheaper there than I see it here...but honestly if you calculate how much the meat and seasoning is, you are saving a lot of money.  We love commercial jerky, but it's too expensive.  We use our Nesco dehydrator, jerky gun and ground beef.  I just buy whatever beef is on sale, mix it with this seasoning and it's amazing!  We've only make ground beef jerky with this, but that's all we eat anyway.  Excellent product...delicious jerky.  I like to make batches as gifts for people...trim the ends of the jerky strips so they look nice and put them in a glass cylinder, tied with a ribbon.  People LOVE getting it and it's an inexpensive gift.  Buy it!

Buying this set of winter coffees in June, I didn't think they'd be the freshest of coffees, but I needn't have worried since these are vacuum packed.<br /><br />The coffees have good flavor with just a hint of chocolate, peppermint, or cinnamon. I was hoping for something more pronounced, but these coffees taste good though not exceptional. I was wavering between three and four stars for this purchase and went with the four stars because you get a generous amount of coffee for the money in this two set package of Winter Wonderland coffees.<br /><br />The sets are attractively packaged and would make nice, inexpensive gifts.<br /><br />I couldn't find any expiration or packaging dates anywhere.

I found it in concentrated form at a local warehouse grocery store, but it seemed I could never 'get the flavor' of the original put out by the manufacturer.<br /><br />I was so glad to find it marketed again.  The only thing better would be for them to put it in glass bottles.  But I have to say, that just having it available again commercially is great.<br /><br />If you like a non-carbonated grape soda with a smooth, rich flavor, then Delaware punch is for you.  Even if you don't normally like grape type drinks, give it a try.  There is something unique in the flavor.  Beats all the others of its type hands down!

review/text: My 85-year-old dad loves Delaware Punch and we're not able to get it where we live.  I was so excited when I found it available from this seller.  Her communication was very uplifting and my dad is still enjoying his Delaware Punch every time we barbecue hot dogs.  Thanks!

review/summary: Delaware Punch
review/text: I ordered two twelve-packs of this childhood memory.  Cost came to about $2.00 per can (only bottles in my childhood).  Flavor was as remembered and I am enjoying this rather expensive treat.  Unfortunately, the twelve-packs were packaged in an ordinary cardboard box with no protective padding.  Almost all of the cans were dented, with 6 cans burst open or leaking.  All cans had to be rinsed of sticky soda.  This raised my cost by about .50 per can.  Can't beat the as-remembered taste but was more expensive than hoped and packaged problematically.

review/summary: Hard to find... depending on where you live
review/text: I have learned that Delaware Punch is sold at most Central Markets in Texas[call and check but Houston and San Antonio have it] for 6.99 for the 12 pack of cans. The manager said there were no plans to discontinue carrying it. The Delaware grape is the reason for the name...not the state of Delaware. Like Fritos and Pace Picante Salsa, it was first made in San Antonio ... this beverage in 1913. I remember it as both tart and sweet with a mostly "grapey" taste. I wonder if the current product tastes the same. Google it for more info.

review/text: The candy was a gift and was a great surprise!  My wife has fond memories of these candies from her youth - but the candy is rarely found in local stores.  She really loved getting 5 pounds of them for her birthday.  She said the product was just as nice as she remembered from the old days.  I just wish the people who sent them to us had done a better job of packaging them for delivery.  They put the candy in a double plastic bag and then into a standard mailing pouch.  The pouch split open during transport and although the candy didn't spill out as the plastic bags were not torn, the pouch arrived all taped up by the post office to hold in the goodies - so a disaster was avoided - but only just...

review/summary: I love El Yucateco
review/text: I love El Yucateco, but you are better off just buying Habanero Red and Habanero Green at the local bodega. The Caribbean Habanero has an odd flavor that is too fruity and clearly not El Yacateco's strength. The Kutbil-Ik or Habanero Extra Hot sauce is, well, extra hot and lacks the balance of the standard Habanero Red. If you want hotter sauces, seek out the products of the specialty producers, but if you want a standard well balanced hot sauce without vinegar as a base nobody beats El Yacateco.

I also tried the other ones, the Carribean which is good, and the Habanero Extra Hot sauce is exactly what its called, it is hotter than all the others. I think the best El Yucateco I've tried was the Chipotle one, which sadly is not included. Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor.

review/summary: Can't go wrong with El Yucateco
review/text: I've always liked browsing through the ethnic sections at different grocery stores for new hot sauces. Found the El Yucateco sauces (green, red, XXXtra hot, Chiptole) at a local store- so I bought one of each. Green is mild, red has more spices and good heat, and the XXXtra hot is as advertised - great long lasting burn! The Chipotle is the least favorite -too sweet for my tastes. (La Costena chipotles make a great pureed smoky/chipotle sauce.)  Haven't seen the Carribean sauce yet - I still would have to try it even though it gets bad reviews. I buy the Red & XXXtra sauces for the crew at my workplace. We go through a bottle per week of each. Great tastes and good heat.!!!!

review/text: I've been buying Yucateco for about 4 years now, it's a great hot sauce, I started with the green, then moved on to red and now I only use the XXXTRA HOT but I still buy the other two for my wife and kids. I wouldn't recommend the Caribbean Sauce, it's just totally different from the other three(I've had that one for over 6 months and no one at home will touch it)<br />To be honest, once you try the XXXTRA HOT (it usually lasts a week at home)  the red and green will not taste as good as they used to...<br /><br />One last thing, most stores have them now in the "Mexican food" section, I usually buy them at Food4Less for about $1.50 a bottle, it wouldn't hurt you to look around.

review/summary: Ain't no Tex about it! This is Mexico baby
review/text: I get a real kick out of 90% of American consumers that think everything spicy with a Mexican name is TexMex. El Yucateco products come from the Yucatan not the border. The wonderfully ripened chilies and the fresh flavor they produce is what sets this product apart from their competition. I beleive this is the finest brand of Mexican hot sauce on the market because you can taste the chilies as if they were picked yesterday.<br /><br />All 4 in this set pack some powerful heat however it is a digestable heat that will not trouble you down the road. Get the burn on your tongue and enjoy without any complications. I have been using these products for at least 10 years and they are quite common in our local Hispanic markets here in Arizona. This is a very good Internet price for the gift pack.

review/text: El Yucateco hot sauces have excellent flavor in the red Habanero, green Habanero, and Chipotle varieties. The red and green have plenty of heat for me, and I would rate the heat as 1 step past Tabasco. The chipotle is not Habanero, but good heat and great flavor. The XxxxHot Habanero sauce was well past my upper limit and several friends agreed. So, I gave it to the only one who could handle it! Great stuff and I will definitely buy more.

review/summary: Kutbil-ik best+ freshest  flavor for me.
review/text: I like the Kutbil-Ik best followed by the Caribbean. The Kutbil-Ik tastes really like a fresh Habanero with nothing added. It has a nice smoky aftertaste. The Caribbean tastes fresh. I find it hot, definitely hotter than the red one. These 2 to me have the most natural taste. I liked the green too, the red so so (it reminds me of more generic hot sauces with tomato base - just a bit hotter and better than most). Once I tasted the Kutbil-Ik I could not go back to the green.  The Green and the Red contain Acetic Acid, FD&C Yellow 5, FD&C Blue 1 , FD&C Red 40, while the Caribbean and Kutbil-Ik just natural ingredients. The originals are good, but the Kutbil-ik is the winner for me, especially if used for finishing up. I would probably buy my favorite ones individually, but the 4 pack is nice so all the different kinds can be tried and compared.<br />Basically the Kutbil-Ik can be compared to the green and the Caribbean to the red.<br />I had posted this to a reply to another comment but I think it may be useful to repost these thoughts in a more visible spot/

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: The green is my favorite hot sauce I've used while dining in Mexican places. They ship 4 different sauces in this kit. The XXX hot is just a little too hot for my taste. The red has good flavor and is actually not as hot as the green unlike most other sauces the green is more mild. IMO the green has just the right amount of heat and flavor. The last one is the Chipolte and was not very hot and has a little smokey flavor to it, I found it nice on certain foods you don't want to heat up too much. Overall I think next time I will just buy the green.

review/text: This pink salmon is just perfect for a protein punch in the morning! FISH, canned fish, for breakfast?? YES!! This delicately flavored, not too salty, American salmon from Alaska is pure salmon - NOT packed in oil, just gently salted and canned. Excellent value, too, at under two dollars a can! I find a protein punch in the morning gets me started right and keeps me strong and NOT HUNGRY all day. The Omega fatty acids in salmon are reason enough to eat it at least twice a week, and the convenience of this size can makes it an easy meal to go. Per can: 270 calories, ZERO CARBS, 36 grams protein, 15 grams fat (the good kind) and just 810 mgs sodium! Recommended!

review/summary: Mocha flavor is yummy, but nutritional profile could be better
review/text: I usually don't buy chocolate-flavored protein bars because 1) I tend to eat them for breakfast, so I prefer more fruit-type flavors, and 2) I find that the chocolate bars tend to be more artificial tasting.  However, I saw one of these bars on sale, and because I absolutely love mocha, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this bar is excellent.  It is rich, chocolate-y, and has a very good, distinct mocha flavor too.  It was pleasantly chewy without having the overly nougat-like consistency that some protein bars have.  Overall, I definitely enjoyed this bar, and from a flavor perspective, I would not hesitate to buy it again.<br /><br />The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile.  At 200 calories, it is about what you would expect from a protein bar; I was fine with that.  But both the fat content (7 grams, including 3.5 grams saturated) and the sugar content (17 grams, or over 3 teaspoons) were a little on the high side to me.  Some bars include fiber; this one has &lt;1 gram.  It does have 15 grams of protein, which was a big plus.<br /><br />So, in the end, I probably will buy this bar again, but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular, healthy part of my diet.

review/summary: Good Balance Bar Flavor
review/text: Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars, this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar, chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it, and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.<br /><br />Look at the nutritional information, these bars do have a lot of protein (15g), but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good.

review/summary: Similar to Frank's Hot Sauce
review/text: This is a much cheaper substitute for Frank's Hot Sauce. The tastes are very close. Tabasco is mostly heat to me. I like being able to put sauce on Mexican or Cajun food for the flavor. With Tabasco I find a sprinkle gives the heat but there is too little to really flavor the dish. Valentina is great added to enchilada sauce. I like the vinegar addition to tomato sauce and cumin.

review/summary: A pleasant hot sauce
review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It has a good flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a product that I can recommend.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I copied this from a post I wrote on my blog a while back. I only changed the price to XX.<br /><br />This has become my preferred hot sauce. I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try. I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot. It is about right for me. I go through a bottle or 2 a month.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Chili Peppers, Vinegar, Salt, Spices, 0.1% sodium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the 1 liter bottles are &lt;$XX. Made in Mexico. it comes in a smaller bottle as well, but I get the 1 liter size. I have one at work and one at home.

review/summary: Love this sauce
review/text: This is just so delicious. We consider food just a vehicle for this sauce. Not too spicy, has a nice flavor and the large bottle is huge! I bought a jar for my husband for Hanukkah (yes, there will be Valentina flavored latkes this year). We cannot find it where we live and are grateful it is on Amazon. The shipping was super fast and the bottle was wrapped very well to prevent breaking. Thank you.

review/text: A coworker from El Paso turned me on to this.  His whole family eats this and I can definitely understand why now.  It's great if you like hot sauce and not as expensive as some others I also like.
