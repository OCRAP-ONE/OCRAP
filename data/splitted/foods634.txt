review/summary: Revelation 10:9-10
review/text: Forgive the Scripture reference, but I am a professor of New Testament and Early Christian Origins. :) John's experience of eating the scroll was mine drinking this coffee: in my mouth it was sweet as honey, but my stomach became embittered. And I have a very strong stomach. It's a fine tasting drink, but I have tried it on several occasions over the course of two months to be sure and every time I end up feeling sick. Obviously this is not the effect for the majority of drinkers, but I would have wanted to have been warned myself before buying it.

review/summary: Best Almonds ever!
review/text: These are very pricey considering you can get the Jordon Almonds at the supermarket for a few bucks, however the quality of the nut, the coating as well as the variety of shades this company offers is of the highest quality.  I ordered it to make favor bags for the adults attending a dinosaur themed party for my son's 1st birthday.  They were great... whatever was left of them... as we couldn't stop popping them as we were packing them!<br /><br />Great product and arrives in a beautiful box with ribbons, great to give to a cook or avid chef as a gift.  Great housewarming gift as well since they bring luck, prosperity and all that good stuff :)

review/summary: Fantastic coffee!
review/text: I've wanted to try Gevalia for a while, but I haven't had the opportunity until recently, when I found it at a local Meijer. The coffee itself is mellow, not pungent like most espresso, but it still packs a decent kick. I definitely prefer it to the other locally available brands that are already ground (Bustelo and company.) My only complaints are that the ground seems a little coarse for espresso (although you wouldn't know it after brewing, the crema is excellent!), and that there isn't a whole bean version, which would be a very nice addition for espresso lovers. I also think that the Amazon page for this product could use a little more flair, it's a bit uninformative!

It was so cute, and I knew it would really be a pick-me-up for her.  It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off!

I have tried many others,but I still rate this tops. The only bad thing I can say about my last order, is that it arrived with one of the plastic jars, and its top broken. I think that is was dropped on the warehouse floor before boxing. I wanted the product NOW, so one was opened and enjoyed while one went into the trash. That ended up being the most expensive peanut butter ever bought. I just savored what I had.

review/summary: Homemade flavor, zesty, and versatile
review/text: This is my new favorite salad dressing. I went to an upscale Italian restaurant and fell in love with their homemade house dressing. In fact, I had to go there twice in a two day period just because I found myself craving the dressing.<br /><br />I went to the grocery store in search of a a similar dressing and scored a home run with this one. I'm not sure if the restaurants house dressing was better, or this one, but this one is really good.<br /><br />I like to marinate chicken in it, top a green salad with olives, tomato, and cucumbers, or even just drizzle it over a stuffed pita sandwich. I also like to finely dice carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and tomatoes and top it with this dressing for a quick salad or healthy topping after marinating in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It's also good for dipping grilled chicken breast strips.<br /><br />The calories are low on this dressing at only 60 calories per serving. Unlike thick dressings like ranch or honey mustard, this one really does only require the suggested serving of two tablespoons since it's thinner and coats everything very well.<br /><br />Diabetics will be glad to know there is only one gram of sugar per serving, and it also has no trans fats.<br /><br />For an Italian salad dressing, this is my top pick.

review/summary: Better than the box rice by far!
review/text: Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not "goopy" nor does it leave "rice-sludge" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Oatmeal, so much better than the Rice Cereal
review/text: Very good deal when Subscribe and Save which we have delivered every 1-2 months.<br /><br />Oatmeal DHA Cereal is not easy to find. Not available in most stores like Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Target, etc.  I don't know why they carry the DHA Rice, but not the DHA Oatmeal Cereal.<br /><br />Oatmeal Cereal my son eats mixed with breast milk and has no constipation issues like he had with the Rice.  He started this cereal at 4 months old.  Now he's 11 months.  Really enjoys eating this still.<br /><br />The 8 ounce canisters are better packed than box cereal I've opened.  I will definitely keep feeding him this.

review/summary: Good oatmeal, well packaged
review/text: My son loves this oatmeal, and we go through it so quickly that I'm glad to be able to order it in a pack of six canisters. I've previously bought this same product in boxes, and the canister design works so much better than the boxes. With the boxes, I always felt that I was having to throw away the last several tablespoons, because the packaging was so poorly designed. The canisters work well, and they can double as a cheap toy when the oatmeal is gone.<br /><br />The taste seems to be good (though I often add some cinnamon for good measure), and I'm glad to know my son is getting DHA in his regular diet. Those with food allergy concerns should be aware that this product contains B Lactis cultures.

review/text: I love this oatmeal, and so do my kids, but recently its been harder to find.  Wal-mart in all their infinate wisdom removed it from their shelves at our local store when they did their last store makeover.  You can get it at Target, if they have it on the shelves.  Since I found it on Amazon I just buy it by the case.  My 1 and 2 year olds both love it for breakfast and I think its way better for them than regular oatmeal.  I hope amazon never stops carring it. :)

review/summary: Life saver!
review/text: I use a small amount in my formula for my 8 week old son. He always woke up VERY VERY hungry and it really wares everyone down. So I did some research and tested it out and it worked!!!! 8-10 straight hours of sleep for everyone. You have to be very careful on how much you put in since it can cause constipation and make hard poops. Once we got the right nipples and measurements everything was a big relief! Also, don't use it for every feed. I only use it midday and that's it. I have no worries of him choking because it blends very well. I don't shake my formulas I use a chop stick and swirl it around till its blended completely, it really helps with reducing bubbles.

review/summary: Flavor made my son gag
review/text: I gave this to my baby thinking the DHA and probiotic aspects were a plus. In theory, they are.<br /><br />We originally started with another brand's organic rice cereal. It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves "normal" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber. Wish they could use algae based DHA rather than Tuna oil.

review/summary: Could be better
review/text: I bought several case of it, thinking my little baby girl will like it.  Nope, she does not like it mixed with water or milk.  It does not mix well with soup.  Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup.  She is picky, what can I say.<br /><br />Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal:  mix the cereal with formula/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed.  I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.<br /><br />We feed her this mix once or twice daily.  As she grows, formula/milk alone do not last as long as they used to.  To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night.  A bit of work, but I think it is worth it.

review/summary: Not environmentally friendly!
review/text: Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil.

review/summary: Gross!
review/text: My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy. Well, my son usually takes regular rice cereal fine. I fed him this and at first he would gag and most if it came right back out. I tasted it and holy crap is it gross. It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful! I threw the rest of the can away and went back to the regular stuff.

It is the source of DHA.  It's my fault for not reading the label more closely, but I really would have never guessed that a single grain baby cereal would have fish oil in it!  The formula we use also had DHA, but it is algae-based.  Just wondering why this has to be from a fish.  Gross.

Almost all of the cans were damaged, from a single dent to a can that was nearly crushed in two.<br /><br /> I  and most consumers do not use dented cans of food or food products. I can't rate the quality of the product because I will not jeopardize my health and safety and that of my family by opening one and ingesting the contents.<br /><br />The entire case is a total loss and as it is not accepted for returns I have to just kiss my money good bye.<br /><br />I am disappointed with Amazon, it was packaged by Amazon in one of their boxes, and they won't allow me to recoup any of my loss.<br /><br />I am out $27.10 and no one is liable. BUYER BEWARE!

review/summary: Allergenic Dog Food?
review/text: This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed "elephant skin" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the "elepant skin" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an "allergenic" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with "therapeutic baths", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of "gravy".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic.

I keep some on hand now for outings so he doesn't end up eating junk (fries, chips, etc).<br /><br />They are also great to mix with yogurt, or even milk, when ready.  Plus it is a great way to get organic fruits, especially if your local store doesn't have a great selection, like mine.

review/text: I bought several different flavors from Plum Organic in the pouch.  I really like this product.  You can screw the lid back on if you only give a portion of it to your baby and put it back in the fridge for later.  The lid seals it back up, I used to do this when my baby was younger and I didn't want her to eat a whole pouch in one meal.  But now, she is older and I can hand her the whole pouch to snack on.  She is able to get the food out with a good flow, not to fast that she is stuffing her face, but not so slow that she gets frustrated.  She is 14months old and can hold it and suck it out on her own.  There is also no mess, or no mess at least with my baby.  She hasn't spilled a drop.  I also like the ingredients for this product and feel like I am giving her a healthy fruit snack.

I've tried a bunch of other sauces (La Victoria, El Pato, and a few other off brands) and the others are always too hot (for the rest of the family)..

review/text: All the enchilada sauces for Old El Paso are really tasty. Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum.

Overall, I love this product as you can make dog treats and not worry about them melting or getting messed up before selling them or before the customer gets them home.  Yes, the dogs don't care what the treats look like, they only care about taste, and most things are tasty to them.  However, for someone who loves to make donated treats, this is a little expensive.  Not that I can find it anywhere cheaper than here, but just overall, a little more.  Just makes for having to charge a little bit more for the product you sell.

review/text: (ASIN: B004INAQMM)  Well, here we have white fish, with Cottie's beloved cheddar cheese.  But his consumption of it is not on par with that for the tuna, not by a cat's whisker or any other measure you care to use.<br />I do not understand it.  I have fed him white fish with a myriad of other foods, including fish and shellfish, and he has usually devoured them, one and all.  But not this!  The only thing I can know for sure is that he knows it isn't tuna, which is the food he expects to experience with cheddar.<br />Cottie will eat it if very hungry, but not with the same gusto.  I need to make an attempt to find something special to put in it so he will enjoy it more than he does now.  Does anyone have any ideas for me?<br />Your takeaway is, this is a super Fancy Feast flavor, most cats will love it, but mine is a shtoonk.

review/summary: My guys Love This Cheddar
review/text: I first fount this Fancy Feast with Cheddar at my local grocers about six months ago. My cats loved it and I have been waiting on Amazon to bring it on board for a long time. Finally they have. "Subscribe and Save" here I come!<br /><br />My cats especially enjoy this Fancy Feast Cheddar with Whitefish as a base. My store had Whitefish, Chicken<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INEW3Q">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Chicken, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>, and Turkey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INIUPC">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Turkey, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> available in their limited edition Display Case when the product first arrived. Whitefish and Chicken were equally popular with my cats, but they seem tired of Turkey and were not crazy about it. I let them try the Tuna <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INAQLI">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Tuna, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> when it arrived later. They also liked that. But Whitefish and Chicken topped the list of the things they liked in this line. They do not care for the Fancy Feast Souffles at all. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH0NC">Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys for Cats, White Meat Chicken & Cheddar Cheese Souffle With Garden Greens, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> I do not know if they use a different variety of cheese or what, but they do not care for those.<br /><br />So I have been giving the kittys The Cheddar Whitefish now for six months. The cats always gobble it up and show no signs of tiring of it. So, I recommend that you give your kitty's a chance to try it. They too should become Cheddar lovers. PS: I did put Cheddar Whitefish on my Subscribe and Save list and have it delivered every few months. I hope you are as pleased with it as I am. Thank You.
