review/text: Yes, these treats are made in China but take a trip to the Dogswell website and you will see the quality assurance program that they use.  I tossed several pounds of the Waggin'Train treats because of customer comments about sick doggies.  However, I have not seen anyone having any difficulty with the Dogswell products and my little dog loves them.

review/text: I'm sure I don't need to enumerate to this customer base the benefits of green tea: We've seen it in our family over and over again. Appetite control, nutrients, energy, healing properties--the list could go on. However, green tea alone isn't exactly going to win any taste tests for the uninitiated.<br /><br />The whole family enjoys this Bigelow Jasmine brew. We consume it in criminal quantities because it lacks the bitterness of other green teas. It is light, flavorful, and inviting. Add it to your Amazon shopping list, and you won't be disappointed.

review/text: After trying the Stash exotic blend of Jasmine tea I was hesitate to try this one thinking it may be inferior due to the price....imagine my surprise when it proved far superior to one that cost substantially more. A delightful flavor, very aromatic but yet natural. Does not come across harsh or artificial whatsoever. Soothing and so fragrant it makes the perfect time-out during a hectic afternoon or end-of-the day treat. No caffeine so great for use any time of the day or evening. Compares very favorably to Twinnings and Stash teas - far superior to Bentley.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea by Bigelow
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I've been a tea drinker since I was 3, when I first drank Jasmine Green Tea at a Chinese restaurant. My mom bought some Bigelow Early Grey black tea for me at home which I loved, but we never knew what flavor they had at the restaurants. 25 years later, I tried Jasmine tea (that was labeled) at a restaurant in Vegas and recognized the flavor instantly. I tried to get some as soon as I got back home, but I'm amazed at how hard it is to find Jasmine flavored tea in any of the local supermarkets here in CA. I was very happy to have found some on Amazon, and Bigelow is a name in tea I already know. However, when I first got the tea, I noticed it said "green tea with a HINT of Jasmine." I was really looking for a Jasmine tea with a strong Jasmine influence, like at most Chinese restaurants (by the way, the Jasmine flower has been banned in China, but I digress). Bigelow should have made this a Jasmine tea with a hint of green tea flavor. If you really want a strong Jasmine flavor, I recommend you look somewhere else, possibly even try loose tea leaves (like from Teavana). Considering how hard it is for me to fins Jasmine tea off the internet, I'm still happy with my purchase with Bigelow, but I'm going to try someone else's tea when I finish these 6 boxes (I went through 1 box in 1 week myself).

review/text: This is not a delicate tea like most jasmine green teas. I prefer it to the other jasmines that I've tried which have been many. I also like the fact that I don't have to play mother hen to this cup of tea and it still tastes good. It has a pleasing smell of jasmine but it's not overpowering like a perfume. I don't like my tea to taste or smell like a perfume. That being said, this still is not my favorite cup of green tea. I much prefer Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orchard and Salada green tea over this green tea.

review/text: I was very pleased with this tea. It has the characteristic light, grassy taste of Sencha especially on short steeps.  For longer steeps it becomes stronger bringing out more of the bitterness.  I found that the bags can be used 3-4 times depending on steeping time, temp, and amount of water used.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good Sencha or just a good pure green tea in general.

Even long steeping time (my preference) doesn't bring out as much bitterness as other green teas.<br /><br />As if the flavor weren't enough to give this 5 stars, it's organic, cultivated by hand, not irradiated, and prepared according to traditional Japanese methods. I'll spare all the details here, but if you will please buy some and read the insides of the box, you'll be just as hooked as i am.<br /><br />Oh, and the tea bag paper is unbleached too. This just keeps getting better!  (Why on earth bleach a tea bag, anyway?!)  Did i mention the price is a steal too, especially for an imported organic product?<br /><br />I don't even drink coffee every morning anymore, if you can believe that. This is a pleasing, comforting hot beverage, and my kidneys are thanking me for the reduced caffeine intake.

review/text: I'm currently stationed in Japan so while there I buy green tea on base and brands like genmai-cha with brown rice in it. I am currently back in the states since the natural disasters and wanted to buy some green tea while here. It helps to calm and relax my nerves. I only drink it hot. I tried a few brands in the grocery store and none of them tasted great nor made me think of the green tea I drank in Japan. I found my appetite went crazy and I was tearing up the house eating tons of food. I'm quite petite mind you but its crazy when you have to eat every 5 seconds. I found this in Earth Fare and since it said Sencha I gave it a shot, with a drop of honey, no sugar added it was heaven. It tastes just like the brand I drank in Japan, awesome, smooth and not bitter; my appetite (The great beast) is calmed again. Great stuff!!

review/summary: Every dog is different
review/text: I've always been interested in nutrition, and spent a LOT of time researching different dog foods.  It REALLY  bothers me that there's no longer an element of "common-sense" with how people view dog foods.  Scraps and treats do wonders for a lot of (less sensitive) dogs, and dogs on unarguably bad foods can be very healthy dogs if they have other sources of nutrition.  So, take all of this with a grain of salt - some foods, good or bad, will work and not work for some dogs.  Better foods do work best for most dogs, but A LOT of these foods are too rich for certain dogs.<br /><br />My now 2.5 year old standard poodle was eating Iams puppy for the first 4 months of his life.  He had mushy, grainy, light colored poop (like picking it up with a pooper scooper leaves behind a mess), occasional vomiting/diarrhea and was on the thin side.  I gradually switched him to:<br /><br />Wellness<br />Core<br />Innova<br />Blue buffalo<br /><br />Back to Iams in between for a couple of weeks, once it was obvious the food wasn't working for him.  Some of the above resulted in horrible diarrhea.  ALL were very smelly once they went through him.  Are they still good foods in my opinion? Yes, but not for everyone!  After months I'd rather forget, Castor and Pollux was honestly one of the best discoveries of my life!  I HIGHLY recommend it to people with dogs sensitive to very rich / high protein foods, as it seems to be less so.  My friends/family with dogs are jealous that my dog is "the best pooper ever" - firm, dark, moist poop with little odor.  And that is way too many adjectives to describe poop. Ew.

review/summary: Great for my little doggie
review/text: So I switched to Organix after feeding my dog Wellness since she was a pup.  Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm.  She also had farts that were like WOAH (especially when on the Wellness fish formula).  Once I switched to Organix, her stools firmed up and were consistent (and less frequent).  She still farts occasionally (who doesn't), but not nearly as often and not nearly as bad.  Since this is a premium concentrated dog food without all those nasty fillers such as corn, I don't have to feed my dog as much as I would with, say, Purina.  She loves the kibble and gobbles it up every time.<br /><br />She is a 12 pound very active doggie, and the 15 lb bag usually lasts me 3 months.<br /><br />I have found Organix at Whole Foods and Petco as well, but Amazon is the cheapest.

review/text: My dog is very picky to the extent that she will not eat anything if she doesn't like the food.  Then, of course. her hunger drives her to scrounge for food.  We lost a Thanksgiving turkey once...but that is another story.<br /><br />Anyway, she took to this food immediately and cleaned her bowl.  She is in good, trim shape, too.<br /><br />If your dog likes it, the food has awesome ingredients and is affordable, AND Amazon delivers it to your door, what more can a good owner need?

review/summary: Best Dog Food
review/text: When we adopted our dog last year, we started her on Wellness b/c I knew I wanted to feed her premium dog food and it had a good reputation. Well her stool was always loose while she was on it and we eventually had to add metamucil to her diet to make it more firm. Finally I decided to switch her food to Organix and couldn't be happier. It has a higher fiber content than many other dog foods and many of the ingredients are organic. Cameron loves the food and her stool is nice and firm. And she poops less often too. As one other reviewer said, because the ingredients are so nutritious, you'll end up feeding your dog less of this brand than other dog foods that are made of filler. Couldn't be happier now that the food's part of the auto-ship program.

review/summary: Great for my little doggie
review/text: So I switched to Organix after feeding my dog Wellness since she was a pup. Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm. She also had farts that were like WOAH (especially when on the Wellness fish formula). Once I switched to Organix, her stools firmed up and were consistent (and less frequent). She still farts occasionally (who doesn't), but not nearly as often and not nearly as bad. Since this is a premium concentrated dog food without all those nasty fillers such as corn, I don't have to feed my dog as much as I would with, say, Purina. She loves the kibble and gobbles it up every time.<br /><br />She is a 12 pound very active doggie, and the 15 lb bag usually lasts me 3 months.<br /><br />I have found Organix at Whole Foods and Petco as well, but Amazon is the cheapest.

review/summary: Great food for a Great Dane
review/text: C&P Organix is a great line of dog food.  I'm not sure how much I agree with some of the other reviews.  For instance, DogFoodAnalysis.com is a FOR PROFIT website - doesn't exactly qualify as non-bias.  Also, the reviewer who said their dog was 'itching' - don't know what that was about.  People are constantly commenting on Crixus' fur and how shiny and beautiful it is - I've fed him Organix since he was 9 weeks old and I would never change to another brand.  Unless a dog is in his/her 'golden years' or has a health condition, there really is no need to beef up on the GC&MSM.<br /><br />Everyone is going to have a different opinion on 'the best dog food'.  I'm just saying, if you don't mind paying a little extra, (significantly less than Orijen or Evo), and you're looking for a quality food - C&P Organix is great.  Their treats and wet food are high quality as well.<br /><br />Another important point - the dog food is made in the U.S.A.<br /><br />If you do decide to purchase it, I highly recommend subscribing through Amazon.  Best price and delivered to your door - no hassles.  The only local store I've found that carries this line is Petco.  Unfortunately, Crixus' favorite feed store doesn't carry it - but the owner was very impressed with it and is looking into purchasing it.  You won't ever find this line in a grocery store.  That says a lot.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Look no further then Organix
review/text: A happy healthy dog is whats important to most responsible pet owners.  I have a two year old German Shepard Police K9 and since discovering Organix I have no worries that his nutritional needs are no longer a concern.  He works at least a 40 hour week along with getting called out at any time day or night and he still has the energy and focus to do his job and have fun while doing it.  Living on an island in S.E. Alaska makes nutritional options very limited.  Thanks Amazon for the free shipping without it I would have to settle for the more comercialized  low quality dog food.

review/summary: My dog's favorite, bonus: it's organic.
review/text: When our boxer was a puppy, we went through countless brands of dog food. She either didn't like them right away or grew tired of after about a week.<br /><br />Once it was time to buy her adult dog food, we became aware of Organix in the holistic section of the pet store. It was more expensive but we justified the fact that it was organic, therefor it was better for our dog and the environment. What's an extra $10-$20 a month for a healthier dog/planet right?<br /><br />Our boxer aggressively scarfs this stuff down like those dogs on the puppy chow commercials (how do they get them to do that?). She'll even eat it with no wet food mixed, and she never seems to grow tired of it.<br /><br />I know that dog food is totally subjective to the dog's taste but I would definitely recommend giving this brand a try.<br /><br />On a side note, I wholeheartedly applaud any company that takes the path of organically produced food, even if it's for dogs. I hope more dog food companies follow suit so eventually it's more competitively priced.

review/summary: I am so happy to have found this food
review/text: I was kind of stressed out about feeding my dog crap because it seemed like such a daunting task of finding truly good food for my little guy.  All I knew was the expensive Natures Crap from Science diet was giving my lab-pointer mix really runny poo most of the time.  I stumbled across Organix after several days of reading everything I could find about dog food.  Amazingly, I found it at my local Jewel, Whole Foods, and Petco, and can easily shop around to get it on sale.  Now I buy large bags here on Amazon to get it delivered to my door, for free.<br /><br />My Chaze has been eating this food for about nine months now, and we are pleased that it has not only made his stool very consistent and healthy, his coat is soooo much softer.  He's like a puppy!  He also took off almost two months ago and darted out into a busy street, right in front of a car going about 35 mph.  It was horrific and tragic, and we didn't know if he would make it.  After very expensive "laceration repair" surgery that spanned from his little butt, and around his groin, up his waist, almost to his back, he healed miraculously within a few weeks.  We are thankful we were feeding him yummy good nutritious food for so long so that he was healthy and resilient.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying the C&T Natural canned dog food (not the Organix) in each of the yummy flavors.  The canned Organix is good too, but we favor the Natural canned because it has big juicy pieces of meat, and best of all, veggies like peas and potatoes.  I would eat this food in a disaster if it was the last thing we had and there was enough for all of us, and it probably wouldn't be so bad! I kid.  Anyway, to occasionally spice things up, we give a little less dry at two feedings, and instead top them with a half a can of the good stuff.  This little guy goes insane!  I hope they never ever stop making this dog food - both the natural and the organic!!!

But of the several brands we've tried (some "premium" and some cheap), he seems healthiest with this type. He stays "regular", is happy to eat this, and is consistently energetic. That's more than we can say about some of the other foods we've tried! We appreciate that the first few ingredients are meat, and that it's organic.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save prices, including free shipping, are hard to beat.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: No longer my dogs favorite food, causes vomiting.
review/text: This is was the only dry food that we have feed to our dogs for years but recently it seems as if they changed the recipe because both of my dogs are not able to digest the food as easily and now vomit periodically when this food is eaten.  I like the idea of feeding my dogs organic food and I am willing to pay more for it but certainly, if they are vomiting, there is something in it that is not healthy.  When I switched to another brand, sold by the vet, they no longer vomit but the vet does not sell organic.  I'm still not sure what the best alternative is.

review/text: Our rescue black lab/hound mix had parasites when we first got her so we knew she needed a good quality food.  We started her out on Blue Buffalo and even after the parasites completely cleared her body, she was still pooping 5+ times a day and nothing solid.  We slowly switched her over to the Organix and she hasn't had a single stomach issue since. We are very fortunate to have found such good quality food and food that she actually enjoys eating!! She is very healthy now and her coat is beautiful and soft as ever. It is costly but you can't put a price on the well-being of a loved one.  Only wish we had started her on it sooner to save her 2 months of misery.  Highly recommend this product!!

review/text: After shelling out $2K for cancer surgery for my 9 year old dog, I decided to go as organic as I could afford for both my pooches.  The older one does not like this as much but she pretty much eats anything.  But!  No recurrence of cancer 3 years later at age 12.  (I do switch them off with other organic foods every bag AND supplement with raw meat and cooked and raw veggies.)  My two year old pooch loves it and does really well on it - nice coat, good energy, digests well, etc.<br /><br />One note - the CANNED castor and pollux did not sit well with either of them. Indigestion, flatulence, frequent stools.  Won't buy that again.

We have tried so many different brands of quality dog food (Blue Buffalo, Orijen, Halo, Natural Balance, Merrick, Wellness, and Taste of the Wild) without any luck.  He'd have a runny stool and no appetite for any of these. We'd have to top them with canned food, treats, etc... to get him to eat. Then we came across Organixs and have been feeding him this for 2 months now.  This food is amazing!!!!  He loves it and gobbles it up within a matter of minutes.  We don't have to add canned food, treats or anything to get him to eat.  Woo Hoo!  His stool is back to normal.  He couldn't be happier and neither could we!  Thanks Organix!

review/text: I wasn't sure if my dog would like this since it's the weight management formula. Simply put, he loves it....Criteria #1 met! My second requirement was that it be organic, have healthy ingredients, & no corn or wheat. I knew that requirement was met when I bought it, because that's a feature of the Castor Pollux Organix line. There are lots of fruits, vegees, whole grains, and chicken in this dog food. Just what I want for my precious little Jack Russel! I used to buy the regular formula, and he loved that as well. Now I'm feeding him a mixture. To be honest, he's not picky so I figured he might be ok with it. But this is the first time I tried feeding him a "less active adult dog" formula. He scarfed it up!<br />Other dog foods may have nice pictures of vegees on the bag, but if you read the ingredients they are not up to par with this one. I live 100 miles away from a store that sells it so I'll keep buying it online!

review/text: I'm a proud owner of a yellow lab, who has suffered from soft stool.  I have tried several name brands including holistic dog food and none have worked to help with his soft stool issue.  I am so glad I never gave up trying different brands and Organix was the perfect food for him.  He has consistently been having firm stools since he has been on it.  He also loves the flavor. Amazon has the best price, thanks Amazon for carrying this brand.

review/summary: not any more
review/text: I was happy to find this food at my co-op. My long-haired miniature dachund was given to me when he was just over 1 year old (he is still under two) because he was not well cared for. I immediated changed his cheap crap diet to this dry food. He loved it and seemed to do very well on it. After several 6-pound bags which were fine, I bought the last bag a couple of weeks ago. He refuses to eat it. There is obviously something wrong with it, as he is not ill. My friend's dog won't eat it either.  I have also tried the canned turkey recipe (I just found out is made by Menu Foods) and right away he started vomiting white foam in the AM. I immediately stopped feeding it to him and he stopped vomiting white foam. I don't trust this company any more, much as I wanted to like their products.

review/summary: Most Amazing Sugar-Free Syrup Yet!
review/text: I recently bought a sno-cone machine to help me cut back on calories yet cool me off when the weather heats up over 100 degrees outside. To save even more calories, I wanted to use sugar-free syrups. I have tried the Back to Basics Sugar-free syrups and they are pretty watered down tasting. I was pleasantly surprised how sweet and tasty the Jelly Belly Sugar-Free Apple was! I am in love and will be buying the 3 pack next time to save money.

review/summary: Used These While On HCG Protocol
review/text: I bought these to use as part of the Simeons (Trudeau) hCG weight loss protocol because they are so much cheaper by the case than by the box in the grocery store. Of course, the case is more than enough for several rounds of the hCG protocol.<br /><br />For those who are searching for grissini for the first time: these are probably the actual breadsticks that Simeons refers to in his book. I have visited Italy and this Alessi brand was in all the grocery stores that we shopped at in Rome and further north. Even the box is nearly identical to the ones in Italy, except the writing is in Italian there, of course.<br /><br />This particular flavor tastes great. The rosemary is noticeable, but very light and pleasant. They are not noticeably salty. The breadsticks are crispy and fun to eat.  My family loves them, too.

review/summary: Rosemary Breadsticks - a Life Saver!
review/text: When you are on a strict diet like the hcg diet, you look for variety, and these are the perfect match! Alessi Rosemary Breadsticks give you just a little bit of flavor that makes it possible to endure the monontony of the diet. After the diet, these are a great accompaniment to any soup or salad meal.  I am going to purchase more when I am done with the stabilization portion of the diet, just to have around for snacks, soup and salad meals.

I also looked at these for the HCG diet plan BUT they are made with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  110 calories per 9 pencil sticks.  For that many calories, I would chose something else more satisfying.  They are light and cruncy so good if you have the munchies.

review/summary: Poor Packaging
review/text: I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them. Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.<br /><br />I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.

review/summary: Good.  Odd, but Good.
review/text: First, I want to confirm that these are tasty, appealing, and you feel good consuming them.<br /><br />Having said, that, I will say that I've never eaten anything quite like these before.  I've eaten plenty of bison (which just tastes like uber-awesome beef essentially); and of course I've had plenty of cranberries.  It's that this rendition of such a combo comes across as unexpected in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />The product is a slender, small candybar like shape and size.  Each is individually well packaged, so you can take one with you in your purse or etc. without leakage concerns.  The individual package opens by peeling back a loose bit of the upper part of the wrapper at one end (essentially splitting the wrapper along the seams).<br /><br />The bar inside is dark and looks pretty much like one solid piece of meat, although it glistens from the fruit content.  It doesn't look like a compressed bar of chunks, like a granola bar.<br /><br />When you bite into it, you discover that the bar consists of nicely sized chunky strips of bison which are compressed, heavily flavored with a juicy, saucy, fruity cranberry flavor.  It's rather like the meat bars were dunked into cranberry puree and absorbed it.  Here and there, in the little pockets that form between parts of the compressed meat chunks, you get tiny bursts of the fruit sauce and flavor.  The fruit taste is sincere, but not particularly tart.  The bar overall comes across as sweet rather than savory.<br /><br />If you have eaten meat with a fruit compote (turkey with cranberry sauce, for example or, as Katniss favors, lamb with prunes), then I think these bars will remind you of that more than anything else.<br /><br />So - not a savory, oily, tough, jerky or beef stick type of snack whatsoever.  But a goodly snack-sized amount of what seems like clean, healthy bison meat with a cranberry compote effect.<br /><br />I will definitely continue to purchase this product.  It's a great snack option to have on hand.

review/text: I've known about Tanka bars for quite a long time, but I never got around to ordering any until now. I thought the recipe sounded really interesting, but the bars are a bit expensive. I finally pulled the trigger, and I'm glad that I did. These are easily the best beef jerky bars that I've had. They are quite soft, and the cranberries provide a nice contrast to the buffalo meat. My only suggestion is to have a napkin handy, as they can be a little messy.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to order these, but having recently adopted a paleo diet I was looking for convenient, nutritious snacks.  The combination of buffalo and cranberry didn't seem too appealing.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that these are indeed tasty.  They are a little greasier than you would get with traditional beef jerky, but I'll get used to that.  The only downside is the price -- quite an expensive bar.

review/summary: Tasty TANKA bars!
review/text: Tanka bars are an amazing, super healthy, satisfying food. I believe vending machines should stock these healthy food bars in every college campus! I promote them in my Native American Culture courses, and I would love to see Tanka Bars become a national snack food! They are incredibly yummy!

review/summary: Tanka very much!
review/text: I've used beef jerky before for a low carb snack, but it's not really my favorite thing.  I rather like this one because it has a barbecue taste to it.  It has a sweetness that is also tangy, and is not a "sweet treat" that leaves one craving more.  Also thumbs up for the non-chemical ingredients.  As for it being "wet and greasy" as noted by some,  I just open the top and peel it down halfway, using the bottom part as the holder; keeping the hands clean.
