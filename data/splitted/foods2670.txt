review/summary: A bit watery
review/text: My wife and I found these to taste very much like a Margarita however, when mixed as directed, the flavor is a bit watery.<br /><br />We were excited to try this "mocktail" mix thanks to the very low calorie count.  After her first sip, my wife described the taste as "spot on".  We're hoping that by adjusting the mixture (using a little less water), we can get the flavor to be a bit more potent.  I'll update this review after we've done that experiment (and possibly adjust my rating).<br /><br />Another thing we plan on trying is figuring out if there is a way to mix this with tequila.  We've used Baja Bob's sugar free drink mixes in the past (they are great) but the ability to have a powdered mix makes us feel they will store better.  We're not frequent drinkers so that would be nice for us.

review/text: I've tried all of the Mocktails now and this is my second favorite after the Mojito.  The taste of this is basically like a margarita tastes, only a little more watered down and minus the salt.  These drinks are always a lot of fun, so I'd say if you are a fan of Crystal Light and like margaritas, you can't go wrong with this.

review/summary: Another good flavor from Crystal Light....
review/text: Someone had a great idea in making Crystal Light flavors from cocktails.  My favorite thus far is still the Mojito, but Margarita is another refreshing flavor and another one that I would buy.  Each container has 5 large packets in it that make up 2 quarts at a time.  I love making it, shaking it up and sticking it in the fridge for when I want something other than water that I can drink without having a ton of calories.  At 5 calories per 8 oz.  I can afford to have a couple glasses.  I've been very happy with all of the flavors of this beverage mix and would not hesitate to buy any of them.  If you are looking for something different outside the normal drink flavors, this might just be for you and there is no rule against making them a little more of an adult beverage with a little splash of something.  Overall, great idea and would definitely purchase this item as well as the other flavors I've tried: Mojito & Appletini.

review/summary: Taste it, don't look at it.
review/text: If you like Crystal Light Lemonade, you'll probably like this.<br /><br />The sweet, artificially sweet, too sweet flavor of tart lime hits you when you take a drink.  In about three gulps, the artificial sweetner aftertaste subsides and it is pretty refreshing.  I like to mix mine in a quart sized bottle of water - so the taste doesn't overpower me when I'm thirsty.  I also tried with a lick of salt on my glass, but didn't like the flavor mixture.  No, this doesn't taste like a primium margarita.... but it is tart and tangy.<br /><br />Now for the bad part.... when mixed properly, this substance makes water turn cloudy pea green.  Rather a bright pea green.. but certainly not the color of any margarita I've been served.  I prefer to drink this in a sealed travel mug just so I don't have to look at the color.

review/summary: Great sugar free alternative, although less exciting than the other flavors
review/text: Rounding out the new line of Crystal Light mocktail flavors is a non-alcoholic version of a margarita, following up the previously released mojito and appletini flavors.  Like the others this is a great alternative if you want a sugar free drink but are burned out on all the traditional flavors currently available through Crystal Light and the various other brands that are diabetic friendly.<br /><br />The flavor on this one doesn't quite match up as well with its inspiration as the other two, ending up more of a lime flavor than a margarita flavor. Although less exciting than the very sweet appletini or the tart mojito, it's still a satisfying and tasty sugar free drink.  And as with the others, tossing in a splash of vodka or tequila does work wonders, letting the drink act as a cheaper alternative to the cocktail mixes available at liquor or grocery stores.

review/text: I really enjoyed the Crystal Light Mojito Mocktail, but this one personally, was not as much of a hit for me.  At the end of the day, it comes down to personal taste, but this just didn't have the margarita flavor for me.  I think inherently a good margarita is a little bit sour, a little bit sweet, and this was just mostly sweet for me.  I don't expect a true margarita experience out of a powder, but to me, this didn't even come close.

review/text: My father drinks a lot of Crystal Light so I decided to get this so I could share it with him. We both thought it was okay but not the greatest. It comes in 5 packs that each makes a big jug of the mix. The color is right for the drink however the taste wasn't like a real margarita. It seemed a bit sweet and watered down to me. You can also taste the articifical sweetner in it.<br /><br />It's a good drink for a non-alcoholic party or get together. Or one of those summer daytime drinks. Otherwise, I'd stick to the real stuff.

review/summary: Pretty good, especially if you add a little something to it.
review/text: When I first tried this although it is tart its also a little too sweet. But, if you thin the mix down a little then its not quite so overpoweringly sweet. I also found that it goes pretty good with some Spiced Rum, Captain Morgan or Admiral Nelson, in it too! It should go real well with tequila but I haven't had any to try it with.<br />Overall, it does quench your thirst and I think its easier to handle if it isn't full strength. Although I think its OK, I'm not really wild about it. So you will probably love it or hate it too. I doubt that I will be buying any more of this particular one when there's so many other Crystal Light drink mixes that are a lot better and I like a lot more.

I'd just recommend that purchasers try the other varieties first (Mojito and Appletini), as those are very tasty!

review/text: I had really hoped to like this product.  I like Crystal Light, and I like Margaritas.  I wasn't expecting it to taste like a real margarita, just something tangy and refreshing.  I was so disappointed.  This tastes absolutely horrible.  The best way I can describe it is that it tastes almost like Lime Gatorade, but is much sweeter.  Gatorade isn't something I'd drink for fun, and it's better than this stuff.  I honestly had to force myself to finish a glass.  It was so gross.  My husband had one sip, and the rest went down the sink.

review/text: Let's face it.  If you drink any sort of Crystal Light product and expect it to taste as good as the real deal, then you've probably set your expectations too high.  Crystal Light's Mocktail Margarita mix is and comes across as exactly what it is . . . a mix.  Tastes incomplete on it's own, but does a serviceable job when mixed with alcohol.  Not horrible, not great, but squarely in between.  A compact way to keep a decent mix around.  Best used if you're desperate to sling a lot of drinks inexpensively or as a gateway mix for college kids (or both).

It not only tasted like one, but is quite refreshing and you can make one anywhere! It is quite similar to a Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix. I had friends over recently and made a pitcher of this without them knowing what it was. When they tasted it, they all were confused as it was good, refreshing and tasty, but tasted like a margarita but knew I wouldn't be handing them drinks either! They really enjoyed it and I would highly recommend. - Give it a try to on ice mixed up, really good!

review/text: Having tried the Mojito mocktail from Crystal Light I was a little apprehensive to try this because I really didn't like the taste of artificial sweetener.  I'm glad I did give it a chance because this flavor is very similar to the pre-mixed diet margaritas you find in your local liquor store.  My usual go-to margarita mix (which is delicious) is squeezing a few pounds of lemons and limes and adding finely ground sugar and takes at least a half hour to make.  This mix takes less than five minutes and is an okay substitute for the real thing.  It also isn't too syrupy or sugary like other mixes.  I add silver tequila to ice and top it off with this and am quite happy with the flavor.

review/summary: Yuck, and I liked the Appletini!
review/text: Any resemblance between this beverage and a margarita is purely coincidental. There is a touch of salt and it's a sort of cleaning product green. It kind of tastes like honeydew melon, and my family agreed that if you had no idea what it was supposed to taste like, you might not mind it so much. I'm no fan of honeydew, and honeydew melon is not a margarita! I suppose it somewhat resembles Gatorade in color, though not so salty.<br /><br />I even liked the Appletini flavor, although I have never drunk an actual Appletini--contemplating doing so conjures up Technicolor yawns from my youth. This "margarita" flavor is dreadful! There is no free lunch and no low calorie Margarita...

review/summary: Decent Substitute for Diet Sodas
review/text: Let's face it.  You don't buy Crystal Light or similar products if you are looking for a healthy beverage.  The list of ingredients is nothing but various chemicals and there is no nutritional value.  I'm not criticizing the specific product; this is no different than most soft drinks.  The reason people drink beverages like this is to get a flavorful drink, with little or no calories.  If this that is what you are looking for, this is a decent product.  Each 8 oz serving has about 5 calories. This particular container will make 40 servings. The taste is decent.  Does it taste like a margarita?  No, but, it's similar.  It uses aspartame for sweetening and is gluten free.  It does not contain caffeine.<br /><br />If you are looking for a low calorie beverage, and are tired of diet sodas, this might be worth trying.

The taste is great! But if you love your alcohol yet still need to watch your sugar intake what could be better than a DRINK MIX with NO SUGAR!!!<br /><br />Let the party begin! A container makes 2 and one/half gallons of drink mix. I wish they would make it an even 3 gallons. The mix comes in "pixie stick" type containers of 2 quarts each and there are 5.<br /><br />I only wish the flavor was stronger or maybe the word is more intense; but you can cut up some lemons and / or some limes and go crazy!<br /><br />DO TRY THIS PRODUCT!<br /><br />You will enjoy it. It is easiier to take home because you add the water at home, so no heavy bottles of drink mix. You can add more sugur or fake-sugar as you see fit and adust the lemon-lime taste with real fruit or your favorite soft drink such as "diet sprite".<br /><br />Have a drink and enjoy!

review/summary: Sickly Sweet, but Better Diluted
review/text: Many many moons ago, I was a big Crystal Light fan, back when all they had were lemonade and pink lemonade in the little tubs that made a whole pitcher.  They've expanded their product line over the years, but they lost me way back then, though I can't recall any reason other than general apathy.  Anyway, this sounded like an interesting variant, still with the whole-pitcher format, so I tried it.<br /><br />My verdict is that it's really really sweet, with that extra-special artificial sweetener tang and aftertaste.  It was hard to drink at full strength, and I usually felt even thirstier about 20 minutes later.  However, it made an OK low-cal margarita mix with some tequila.  When half the pitcher was gone I filled it up again with more water, and it's much more drinkable now.  The artificial sweetener taste is still there, but not so noticeably.  I personally wouldn't get it again, but I'm one of those freaks who thinks plain ol' filtered water is fine as is, or add a squeeze of real lemon or lime to jazz it up.

review/summary: Crystal Light Margarita Mocktail Didn't Fool Anyone!
review/text: I have bought and consumed Crystal Light products over the course of the product's existence, and mostly been really happy with the taste.  I expected a sweet-tart lemon or lime flavor, and looked forward to trying this new alternative to high caloric alcoholic drinks.  Mixing up a two quart pitcher of pale green liquid that smelled faintly of a chemical mystery fruit, I confidently poured generous servings into my most attractive Margarita glasses and passed the drinks around.<br /><br />The result wasn't just disappointing, it was nearly deadly, and made me very glad that I had served the "Mocktails" in the kitchen, preserving the bamboo flooring in the living room.<br /><br />Adding Tequila could have made a difference, but that would have defeated the five calorie objective of the product, and I can't imagine what adding a good tequila to Aspartame-sweetened mystery fruit drink would do for my reputation as a hostess.<br /><br />Personally, I found the product unacceptable and would not recommend it to friends, family or enemies.

review/summary: Crystal light as per usual...
review/text: I'm not sure what I was imagining what this would taste like but the results were less then stellar. Its basically crystal light as you know it with a hint of that diet taste that most sugar free drinks have. Slightly disappointed with this product since it seemed like a new improved flavored water.

review/summary: More like limeade than anything - add your own tequila!
review/text: This stuff is alright, for limeade - it tastes nothing like a margarita to me.  Hubby and I added tequila to this Crystal Light and poured it over ice and THAT was pretty darn tasty (and even better with a splash of Fresca I had in the fridge, adds a bit of carbonation to it).  So this can serve as a cost-efficient diet margarita mix for us and that's why we'll likely buy it again.<br /><br />NOTE:  Hubby and I are used to diet stuff... we use Splenda in our tea & coffee and drink diet sodas, so we're accustomed to it.  If you're used to natural sugars in your food and drink, you may not care for this Crystal Light.

review/summary: Are you kidding me?
review/text: This doesn't taste at all like a margarita--any margarita.  I've tried mixing per instructions, using 75% of the recommended water, adding vodka, and eventually Triple Sec.  The Triple Sec did help, otherwise it was just an odd green, though not unpleasant, drink that tasted nothing like a margarita, or anything I wanted.  Crystal Light makes far better, yet less ambitious, flavors.  Go for those instead.

review/summary: Yummy summer alternative
review/text: I love Crystal Light. I drink my 2-3 liters of water a day because of Crystal Light. So, when I found out Crystal Light made mocktail-flavored drinks, I had to try it.<br /><br />While the margarita flavor wasn't spot-on (it didn't taste like a freshly-made margarita with real lime but it's a powdered drink so I didn't really expect that), it was still a very tasty alternative to plain water and a nice change-up from my typical raspberry-lemonade flavor. The downsides were that there was a slight fake aftertaste that isn't present in many Crystal Light flavors, and it stirred up into an odd, murky greenish color. However, I did like that it wasn't too sweet, that it had a bit of a fruity flavor, like limeade. I could definitely see this mixed with a shot of tequila for a low calorie margarita. In fact, I think I'll go do that right now. Cheers!

review/text: I'm totally addicted to Crystal Light-type beverages, sugar-free Koolaid, etc. I hadn't bothered to try this in the store because I assumed it would just taste like lemon-lime and it's more expensive than the regular flavors. However, it really does kind of taste like a margarita! It smells more like it than it tastes, but still it tastes enough like a margarita that it feels weird to be slugging it back at work..... =)<br /><br />Yum...

review/summary: Nice flavor, neon green and does not taste anything like a Margarita
review/text: The flavor of this Crystal Light is light and citrusy and is a bright neon green color.  Would be great if you are making a halloween punch and wanted something that looked radioactive.  I don't mind the flavor but if you are expecting a non-alcoholic version of a margarita you will be disappointed.  That being said, it is refreshing and very low calorie.  I would recommend it and gave it three stars instead of more because it doesn't come close to the flavor it claims to be.

review/summary: Good tasting icetea
review/text: This is an easy to prepare, unique tasting ice tea. I have used Crystal Light now for a few years and so I was curious how it would taste.  I was not disappointed.  The flavor is tangy and pleasant, very much like a Margarita. I always have 'Natural Lemon' and 'Iced Tea' at home and this was an interesting addition.  One small difference is, though, that while my usual flavors can be prepared in an old plastic bottle, this one should be prepared in a glass pitcher. The flavor was a bit off coming from out of the plastic bottle.  But other than that, a enjoyable experience.

review/text: I have tried other Crystal Light flavors and liked them, so I had high hopes for this product.  It is really artificial tasting, strong artificial lime taste and even stronger artificial sweetener taste.  The product, when mixed, is sort of a surreal green color as well.  It is slightly more palatable when very cold, but not enough better to make it worth drinking.

review/summary: more lemonade than margarita
review/text: We ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>mix and really liked it,  so when this was offered,  we thought we'd try it as well.  It's perfectly okay,  but not more than that.  It just wasn't as flavorful as I expected,  I wanted something a bit tart,  a bit Margarita like,  but it's really kind of lemony and wishy washy,  it doesn't have the distinct flavor that the appletini does.<br /><br />I think if you weren't told it's name, and asked to describe it,  you would say something along the lines of a flavored lemonade,  but I don't know if you would say margarita.  So if you want a lemonade with a bit of a different spin,  try it,  but if you want a margarita mocktail,  this doen't work.

review/summary: Magarita Lite
review/text: Mocktails are quite the rage,promising a pleasting potable without the calories. Five packets making two quarts each come packaged in a convenient resealable canister.  The results are magarita-like.  There is a pleasant lime flavor that was a tad too sweet for my taste. The powder dissolves easily and is the an appropriate light green.  It is acceptable with a shot of tequila; non-purists probably would not notice the difference.  At five calories per serving, most dieters would be willing to overlook any shortcomings, such as a lack of natural ingredients.  I found this powder appealing when mixed with plain seltzer water and found the canister kept the remaining powder dry and clump free.<br /><br />It isn't bad for a chemical concoction.  It has a light, lime like flavor and mixes well.  I for one don't mind muddling limes and making simple syrup but if you were in a rush and wanted to whip up a pitcher of beverage for a crowd in an instant, this would fit the bill.  I wuld have preferred the powder in single servings but the canister ameliorates any freshness issues.  I suppose it comes down to calories or chemicals.  If you have a craving for a magarita but want to save on calories, this would most definitely satisfy the urge.

review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita provides a 4 pack each worth a pitcherful of a margarita tasting non-alcholic drink.  The taste is actually better than some of the mixes I've had for the alcholic variety but is inferior to a well made version of the real thing ... but who would expect that anyway?  It makes a refresing drink for a hot summer day and there is the possiblity of adding something for some kick but I haven't tried that yet.  I would advise mixing well as it can have a slight graininess otherwise.  It does give a good alternative to lemonade and iced tea for a non-carbonated beverage.

review/text: After trying the Crystal Light Appletini Mocktail, I wasn't' sure about the Margarita Mocktail. But from Crystal Light it can't be half bad. Easy to mix; just add water and stir. This one comes out a cloudy green color and definitely has the strong smell of a margarita. This would be a turn=-off to those who don't like the drink. Otherwise, when drinking it, it has a slight citrusy taste and is sweet. I don't know if I would try it again; not even with alcohol.

review/text: So, it doesn't really taste like a margarita, but I did enjoy the taste. It's sort of an artificially sweet lime juice taste , which makes it sound less appealing, but I don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />I do like that as it is  a powdered drink mix, you can make it as weak as strong as you like. What I did not like is that each packet makes 2 quarts- I'd rather have a canister of loose powder so I could more easily mix up one glass or bottle at a time rather than a whole pitcher.<br /><br />If you enjoy artificially sweetened drinks and are tired of the usual choices, give this one a try. It's fun and refreshing.

review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita has a faint taste of a real Margarita. But my first thought after taking a drink was that it tasted watered-down. I used the appropriate water-to-powder mixture though. I guess I'm just so used to the strong Tequila that this just tasted a bit bland. I thought this would be a good, non-alcoholic alternative as well as being low-calorie and better for me. I love most other varieties of Crystal Light drink mixes. But there just isn't enough strong flavor for me to continue drinking. My young niece did enjoy it, as it tastes just like a light, lime-flavored cool-aid.

review/summary: How to ruin a margarita
review/text: After reading some of the positive reviews, I was hopeful that this mixer would be a way to cut down my calories on margaritas at home.  Actually, I have only one margarita no more than three evenings a week, but they are a treat.  The difference in calories is about 5 for the Crystal Light versus 150 in most regular mixers, so I thought it was worth a shot.  I mixed up two quarts exactly as directed.  The color comes out almost exactly the same as my regular margarita mix, but from there the similarity ends.  Well, speaking for myself, this was absolutely the worst margarita I have had in my life.  This mixer has a terrible aftertaste to the point that I didn't even want to finish the margarita.  In my opinion you cannot compare this product to regular margarita mixes.  I'd sooner cut my three margaritas a week down to just one to save the calories.<br /><br />Ingredients from the container are:  Citric acid, maltodextrin, salt, aspartame (sweetener), natural favor, contains less than 2% of acesulfame potassium (sweetener), magnesium oxide, artificial color, yellow 5, blue 1.  This product is gluten free.<br /><br />A couple of days later I gave this one more try, just to see if it would be an okay drink without adding tequila.  I also asked my husband if he would be interested in trying it.  He took one look at the puce green color and said it reminded him of CoLyte.  You have to be over 50 to know what this is.  He is right; I tried it "straight" and the taste is very similar.  In any case, the strong aftertaste is very much present.  I couldn't finish a glass of this either.

review/summary: A bit fake-flavored but acceptable
review/text: This drink is okay.  It has that 'glow-in-the-dark' nuclear green look the same as the margarita mixer stuff they sell at the grocery store.  I am not a fan of that stuff at all.  To me, a margarita is simply tequila, triple sec, and lime juice, and if you want it sweeter, some orange or pineapple juice.  But for a non-alcoholic, sugar-free margarita, this might be as good as you can get.  I haven't finished the first bottle I mixed of it yet, (it's been a week or so), but if it were summer time, I might enjoy it more.<br /><br />A day later now, I did go ahead and finish what was in my refrigerator, but I did not like it too well.  Also the plastic bottle I used which I often use for iced teas and other homemade drinks had a strange residue in the bottom that would not rinse out even with hot water and vigorous shaking, so in to the recycle bin for the bottle - I found this just a bit disturbing and will not be using the rest of the product.

review/summary: Bad Medicine
review/text: Not sure what happened here, since usually Crystal Light puts out wonderfully refreshing and tasty powdered drinks.  They missed the mark totally here.  I eagerly served up a giant pitcher of this but immediately noticed that the powder smelled medicinal as I mixed.  After pouring over ice, I had high hopes the flavor would not disappoint.  I was wrong.  My guests all had the same instant reaction, "UGH!  THIS TASTES JUST LIKE MEDICINE!"  I ditched the entire box.  It reminded me of a bad flavored Alka Seltzer or even worse, a frozen drink that sat out in the sun too long and lost all its flavor and zest.  The artificial green coloring of the margarita was a turn off too, just too fake.  The only positive thing I can say is that there was no funny aftertaste at all, like is often the case with some diet drinks.  But too bad the actual taste was so awful!

And when I had hubby and daughter try it, they had an even worse opinion that I did!<br /><br />So, I am sorry Crystal Light to have to reject your new line, but at least the Margarita was not to my liking. Now I need to try one of the other Mocktail flavorings and see if one of those is something more to my palate!

review/summary: Nice Change of Pace
review/text: I made this beverage at work and everyone who helped themselves to a glass commented how much they liked it.  Inspired by the Margarita flavor, I dipped the rim of a glass in salt and drank a few glasses that way.  It was a good change of pace from coffee, tea, and water; plus, the fact that it has just 5 calories has definite appeal.  I would prefer the mixture use sucralose sweetener as there is a definite aspertame bite to the beverage.  I also think it would be good with lime or lemon wedges added but I did not try it that way.

review/summary: Tasty Light Alternative To A Real Cocktail
review/text: I have not tried this as a mixer to a real cocktail - but I found a great use for those days when you don't really want to drink.  Mix this us with cracked ice and you get a tasty calorie free treat that tastes almost as good a the real thing - but without the added weight and hangover.  Tastes great!

review/text: Not at all what I expected, the artificial tequila flavor is so overpowering.  I love concocting drinks, using ingredients to cut sugar and I expected this to be perfect - like a well made margarita with just a small tequila flavor, the smell was very heavy even in the refrigerator after I mixed a pitcher and the flavor was just unappealing. I think I will hand packets out for Halloween, since I have 39 pitchers worth.

review/summary: If you like Crystal Light, you will like this flavor
review/text: I like this Crystal Light.. my favorite flavors are Lemonade and Pink Lemonade.  Not only does this flavor compare to those and is just as good, but it very much has a Margarita flavor.  It does have a slight aftertaste, but no more than the other Crystal Light flavors.  Love that I can have a "cocktail" without all the calories :  My husband added a little lemon rum (only thing we had in the cabinet) to it and it complemented it well, but I mainly got this product because I love the flavor of lime that you find in a Margarita, and this definitely satisfies my taste for one!  Will definitely add this flavor as one of my favorite for the Crystal Light line-up!

review/summary: Not really the same as a margarita, but still pretty good
review/text: Okay, this product isn't going to fool anyone into thinking it's a margarita; however, on its own it's actually tasty.  A little on the sweet side, I added the prepared beverage with sparking water and a wedge of lime and it was actually quite refreshing (really hit the spot during a recent heat wave).  I also prepared it and put it into an ice cube tray, and when it was frozen through I put it in a blender and it was really pretty good.  We also tried adding a dash of tequila and that was really good (I really only added a tablespoon or so of tequila and a wedge of lime).<br /><br />By the way, when you make it it does have a weird green color.  I am thinking about serving this at Halloween - might be a fun way to use the interesting green color!

review/summary: Taste Testing against Cuervo
review/text: Our favorite motorhome vacation happy-hour treat is a blended margarita. We usually bring a bottle of that Jose Cuervo mix (you know, the one that you buy as a two-pack at Costco), add ice and some cheap tequila to the blender and voila! Mexican restaurant margaritas!<br /><br />Okay, it's not highfalutin, but it's relaxing and puts a smile on our faces.<br /><br />The problem has always been storing the Cuervo liquid mix in the miniscule motorhome cabinets and fridge. So the idea of a powdered mix was intriguing, and the removal of those Cuervo-mix calories would make our 5pm habit a bit more guilt-free.<br /><br />I made up a batch of the Crystal Light using 1 packet and only 1 quart of water (ice would make up the remaining liquid), the initial smell when opening the packet is truly awful - smells more like a cleaning product than anything I'd want to ingest. Fortunately once mixed with water that smell disappears and I'm left with a mix that looks and smells just like the Cuervo (neon lime with some white powdery substance that can settle out). From there, I poured it in the blender, added ice and alcohol, and let 'er rip. I then made a batch using the Cuervo mixer. Next, I poured samples of both and we commenced drinking (hey, it's for the review, we've gotta test it, right?).<br /><br />Both looked exactly the same in color, the smell is very similar between the two with Cuervo having a bit more lime-y scent. But taste is what's important, and unfortunately the Crystal Light tastes like a diet margarita. It's not awful, it's just not as rich tasting as the Cuervo, and it has a bit of an artificial sweetener aftertaste (this from two people who enjoy many flavors of regular Crystal Light).<br /><br />We put everything in the freezer for awhile, then took out the Crystal Lite Margaritas and drank them. Without the head-to-head comparison, the taste is ok. In fact, after a few more sips we were happy (okay, who wouldn't be happy after a few sips of a margarita?). Returning to the Cuervo drink mix, the difference is still there but definitely less noticeable than when we were sip-testing head-to-head.<br /><br />Although not party-guest-worthy in my opinion, the Crystal Light version of our Margarita is good enough for the two of us.  It'll make a great motorhome companion, easily tucked away in a cabinet and not taking up as much valuable space as the pre-made Cuervo jugs, but if space (and calorie content) aren't an issue, the Cuervo mix gets the nod.

I was initially afraid to drink it.  The beverage is bright neon green and it almost glowed!  I smelled it-okay, smells like a margarita.  I had a sip-and it actually tasted like a pretty decent margarita!  It was salty and the lime flavor was strong, but not too strong.  I thought that it tasted so much like a regular margarita, I almost felt bad drinking it before noon.  Honestly, I wish I would have had this drink when I was pregnant and hanging out with my girls!  You don't miss the alcohol, and it doesn't taste like some other powered drinks.  Thumbs up!

review/summary: Just add tequila...or not
review/text: While this makes a nice crisp addition to plain water, and while it actually has a nice tart/sweet taste to be enjoyed as a "mocktail" for someone avoiding alcohol but still at a celebration, one of the great things you can do with it, as well as their other flavors (my favorite is actually the appletini) is to enjoy some of your favorite drinks without the loads of calories.<br /><br />The cocktails they copied are actually quite high in calories. Margaritas can be STACKED with a caloric punch...to the point that one of them can surpass the calories you might in a dinner with them. I'm not a fan of consuming my calories in liquid form.<br /><br />Because a regular margarita can have 550 calories (calwineries has the lists of calories in drinks as one source but I actually already knew this which is why I tend to avoid margaritas in spite of being a Texan.)just one can really mess up your diet.<br /><br />So what to do if you DO want to the taste with alcohol? No need to get out a blender--though that would certainly be a step up from my way. I simply make a margarita using water and sprinkle some of one packet in to taste. The whole packet makes 2 quarts so I never make 2 quarts at a time. I simply get the taste how I like it in a glass with water then I add either one or two ounces of tequila.  One ounce is 69 calories. While it says 1/8 of a packet is 5 calories and one serving I'm not even sure I use an 1/8th of the packet. But we'll go with that for a guesstimate.<br /><br />So instead of your 550 calorie margarita you can have a 74 calorie margarita. I'll be honest, I like the taste with this BETTER due to the small kick of sweetness with the tart lime and margarita taste.  If you are feelin all party girl for the evening and want a super strong kick up yeer heels and dosey doe cocktail, even with two shots  2 ounces) you'll still only pack a caloric punch of 143 calories.<br /><br />Or if you are wanting to be one cheap date even if you are taking yourself on that date, simply order a glass of water and a shot of tequila at the bar or dinner rather than a margarita. Pour in your crystal light to taste in that water glass and dump the shot in the water glass. Money savings too! Should anyone question you, say it's Emergen-C vitamin packs as you felt tired that day and want to ensure you keep a cold at bay... mmmmm hmmmmm.<br /><br />So at home or on the town you save money and a hellalotta calories.<br /><br />Win/Win<br /><br />Only thing I'd change is to add stevia rather than the aspartame they use to sweeten it.<br /><br />I actually try to avoid most things with artificial sweeteners now but I also try to avoid calories and because you can have a cocktail with quite a bit of alcohol and so little calories this one is a toss up and I can see myself buying it again actually.<br /><br />But I still like the appletini with vodka best in a martini glass. The thing about appletinis is they look like antifreeze in a glass. This isn't nearly so alarming.<br /><br />Oh, and if you just hate drinking plain water it does add a nice crisp taste even without alcohol!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I'm not much of a drinker, very rarely touch anything alcoholic. I really enjoyed this drink mix though. Since it doesn't have any alcohol in it is perfect for children or adults. If you don't own a margarita tastes like it's a vaguely citrusy kind of drink. If you think about some kind of citrus flavored fruit punch you've got the basic idea.<br /><br />The packaging is a little wasteful for the product that's included as there are only for packs inside. However, the actual amount of drink you get out of the package is quite good. My wife makes them with the whole pitcher out of the single packet. We really got hooked on the stuff and will probably be buying it again soon.<br /><br />You really can't beat these kinds of things is a drink. Considering the amount of liquid you get by adding your own water it's still far cheaper than buying bottled juice.

review/text: I enjoy most Crystal Light flavors, and the Margarita Mocktail is no exception.  It tastes surprisingly similar to a margarita, but most would not confuse the two.  Once someone has had too many real margaritas, they may not be able to tell the difference.  The color is nice, though a little more neon than a typical margarita.  Overall, the Crystal Light Margarita Mocktail delivers.

review/summary: Tastes like Lime Kool-Aid
review/text: So I mixed up this Mocktails Margarita, not having a clear idea of what to expect.  Once upon a time I found a faux Pina Colada mix that was delicious and sugar free and could never find it again.  This kind of disappointed me; I thought it tasted familiar, and realized that it tasted very much like lime Kool-Aid.  If you love lime Kool-Aid, that may not be a bad thing, but I was at least expecting something a bit more subtle.  At least is not kelly green.  More like an apple green.  I've taken a photo, and I'll try to post it on here.  My husband said he liked it, but I'm thinking my kids (20 and 15) don't care for it too much because I found a half-full glass of it sitting warm on the counter.  Usually, Tropical Punch flavored sugar-free Kool-Aid gets emptied in a day.  There is still a half gallon (I made up two packets) sitting in my fridge after three days.  Its okay.  Maybe it would be better with the essential Margarita additive???

review/text: I'm a big fan of Crystal light, so I applaud their creation of new flavors.  I've tried Appletini, Mojito, and Mararita.  The Margarita flavor is probably my least favorite of the three, but I still like it.  If somebody gave me this drink without telling me what it was, I would probably say it tastes like kind of a subtle, lime-aid type of drink.  It doesn't have an overpowering flavor, but goes down very smooth.  I like it!  Just not as well as some of the others.

Each 8 fluid oz. serving contains just 5 calories! the drink turns a gorgeous green! A perfect match for the real thing!<br /><br />We were split on our review of them. I like the strong flavor of tequilla in real Margaritas, so to me they seemed VERY sweet. But Mom felt they were just right. I think if you mixed some lemon-lime soda (for some fizz) in place of the water, and added some real fruit, you'd have a pretty tasty punch for a party! Perfect for a bridal or baby shower! Plus they would make some tasty frozen pops for your Moms Party!

review/summary: Margarita substitute?
review/text: Barb:  I do like Margaritas!  I have a friend who comes over for an afternoon visit, and we sit outside on the patio sipping the real thing.  Well, that is not always wise considering the calorie intake, so I was intrigued by the Crystal Light Margarita mix.  After mixing up a batch of the unusual murky-green colored fluid, we tried it.  It's not as good as the real thing, but we figured that it wouldn't be, anyway!  We were actually surprised that the taste was close, maybe a little too salty.<br />My friend loves the Crystal Light Lemonade so she did not have a big problem with the taste.  I don't usually drink the "fake" stuff (have my own lemon tree)so I was a bit distracted by the aftertaste caused by the Aspartame sweetener.  But, because I'm diagnosed pre-diabetic, I am trying to stay away from sugars, so I am willing to give the Margarita Mix a second chance.  Maybe in the near future Kraft will consider trying any of the "other sweeteners" in their Crystal Light products?  Let's hope.

review/summary: Bring on the guacamole
review/text: It was maybe 6 months ago that I discovered that WalMart's generic version of Crystal Light water-flavoring mixes (marketed under the Great Value brand) included a Lime Margarita flavor. I tried it and liked it and have been drinking it ever since. But now that I've tried Crystal Light's Margarita mix, I won't go back to Great Value Lime Margarita, even though it is typically the case that Crystal Light mixes are more expensive than the generic versions.<br /><br />They do not taste the same, but then neither do all alcohol-based margaritas. (Crystal Light Margarita is of course meant to be mixed with water.) The Crystal Light Margarita is less tart than Great Value Lime Margarita - less of an acidic taste and aftertaste - and tastes better to me overall. Crystal Light Margarita contains sodium - 30 mg. per an 8 oz. powder-mixed-with-water serving - compared to 10 mg. per serving of the Great Value Lime Margarita mix. (A typical low-sodium diet limits one to 1500 milligrams of sodium daily.)<br /><br />Although Crystal Light Margarita does not taste like a "real" margarita (including Skinny Girl Margarita, which I have tasted), and although I cannot imagine using it as a mix for preparing "real" margaritas, I wouldn't hesitate to serve it - perhaps even with a bit of salt on the rim and a wedge of lime - with Mexican cuisine. It's got a flavor that I think would go well with such cuisine (I tried it over ice as an accompaniment to chips, salsa, and guacamole, and found that it complemented these nicely).

review/text: I really like the appletini and mojito flavors that Crystal light makes but unfortunately I didn't like the margarita flavor.<br /><br />When it first hit my tongue I thought it tasted good until I swallowed. There is a "note" in there - almost an aftertaste - that just did not taste good to me. I thought this would be more like margarita mix I guess than an actual margarita but it tastes to me like the mix plus a fakey sort of tequila type taste that I just didn't like at all.<br /><br />I think if you're someone who really likes margaritas but has to watch your carbs/calories then maybe this wouldn't be a bad alternative but for me it just wasn't it. Honestly, I don't think adding real tequila would improve it for me either.

review/summary: A good alternative to a high calorie margarita
review/text: I drink a lot of flavored waters and am a big fan of flavor packed drinks without the added calories. I have to say I was impressed with Crystal Light Mocktails and am sure that fans of Crystal Light will definitely enjoy this new Mocktails line as it's sugar free, low sodium, and offers only 5 calories in an 8 fl. oz. serving.<br /><br />I wouldn't compare this to drinking a real margarita because we're talking two totally different drinks here. However, Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita is a refreshing take on the alcoholic version and offers a great alternative to their usual lemonade varieties. The lime green color will make you feel as though you're on the beach in Cabo and you'll probably find the flavor sweet, salty and tart much like a margarita. This is a great drink for a hot summer day and I'd probably say the only negative is the fact that Crystal Light uses artificial sweeteners in their mixes (Aspartame). I usually find all artificial sweeteners to leave a slight aftertaste and this was no different.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a margarita without the alcohol and calories, this is definitely a good alternative.

review/summary: Very Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I usually only like Crystal Light lemonade because any other flavors have that artificial sweetener aftertaste so I was skeptical of a Crystal Light Margarita.  I have to say that from the first moment I opened the packet, I was impressed.  Even the aroma of the powder before you mix it is just like a freshly made margarita.  I did find that mixing it with a full 2 qts of water made it taste a bit watery to me so I cut it back to about 1 1/2 qts and I like it better.  It is tangy, slightly salty and very limey and with no alcohol, you can drink it anytime of day.  I am definitely going to try the recipe that another reviewer left that does include the tequila.  In my opinion, this tastes better than some of the margarita mixes that I have tried and it's zero calories so how can you go wrong?<br />I definitely want to try the Mojito flavor as well.  Don't know about the Appletini flavor since I don't really care for that as a drink.  If you like, Skinny Girl Margaritas, definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Not Even Close
review/text: l like Crystal Light products so I was intrigued by the Mocktails packages.  Mocktails Margarita is the second one I have tried.  As the title says it is not even close to a Margarita.  When I first mixed it up it was more like sweetened water.  After it sat for a few hours it had more taste but it still did not remind me of a Margarita.  I will stick to Crystal Light's Green Teas in the future and get the real thing if I want  Margarita.

review/summary: Barely resembles a margarita
review/text: What Crystal Light has managed to do here is to take a very well known drink and produce their own version whose greatest strength is that it is roughly the same color as the original.  That's about it.<br /><br />Quick background: We almost always have a pitcher of Crystal Light lemonade in the house.  We buy the mix in bulk from our local warehouse store.  The taste has become familiar to me, and I find it an acceptable substitute...It's not like real lemonade, but it's fairly comparable to sugar-sweetened "mix" lemonades such as Kool Aid and Country Time.<br /><br />On the other hand... I'm having a hard time enjoying this Crystal Light margarita flavored drink.  The smell is a bit strange to me.  And my wife and I both find it hard to notice even a hint of margarita taste.  There is something about the flavor that makes it seem more lime-like than the lemonade, but  that's about as close as it comes to resembling a margarita.  It's not that the flavor is bad, but I'd rather stick with Crystal Light lemonade instead.<br /><br />I am quite sure I won't get this again, and probably won't take a chance on the rest of the "Mocktails" line of drinks.

review/summary: &iexcl;Viva Crystal Light Margarita!
review/text: My wife and I both enjoy a Margarita every once in a while, so the Crystal Light Mocktail Margarita mix sounded very appealing.  We're glad we ordered it, since you get the refreshing taste of a frozen Margarita without the alcohol.  In addition, it's sugar free and low sodium, so there are only 5 calories and 30 milligrams of salt in an 8 fluid ounce serving.  Of course, you can add tequila to it and make a new version of the real thing.  To make a simple cocktail, mix a packet of Crystal Light Margarita mix according to the directions on the pack's label and set aside.  Rub lime juice on the rim of a margarita glass and dip it into a plate covered with salt to coat the rim of the glass.  Fill the glass with crushed ice and 1 ounce of tequila.  Then, fill the rest of the glass with the Crystal Light Margarita drink mix.  Stir and enjoy.  HOWEVER, be aware that this will increase the number of calories, the amount of sodium, and YOU'LL NEED TO TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AND FOLLOW ALL THE LAWS INVOLVED WITH ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

review/summary: Another winner from Crystal Light
review/text: I drink a lot of Crystal Light.  I'm a big fan of the wide variety of flavors, the insanely low calorie count and the lack of sugar and sodium.  The Margarita flavor has 30 mg of sodium per serving, most of the other flavors I've tried have zero).  They're a refreshing way to quench your thirst without feeling guilty.  I like the convenience too.  Each envelope (there are 5 per container) makes 2 quarts.  I mix it up in a large pitcher and refrigerate so it's ready when I want a cold drink.<br /><br />The Margarita flavor is delicious and tastes quite authentic, right down to the slightly salty tang.  While I enjoy it on its own and frequently drink it that way, sometimes I like to kick it up a notch and add tequila to my drink.  For all the ease of preparation, it makes a surprisingly good Margarita.  I'm adding this one to my favorites list.

review/summary: Refreshing, and very similar to Jose Cuervo Margarita mix!
review/text: Margarita mix is expensive and usually laden with calories (well, alcohol is too!). I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but when I do, I almost always order Mojitos, Margaritas, or Sour Apple martinis. I love the taste of them and thus the alcohol taste isn't overpowering for me.<br /><br />Therefore I was delighted to discover these new Crystal Light mocktails in my local grocery store (about three bucks a canister). The Crystal Light Margarita mix tastes just like Jose Cuervo Margarita mix to me, even the slight salty tang. This one and the Mojito are so good all on their own and I love them. The Appletini is a bit too much like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy, so I only like that one in small doses. They are obviously not as syrupy-thick as real Margarita mix, but that's a plus to me. It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts. An 8 oz glass of this is a no-guilt 5 calories. It's great both as an option for non-drinkers and to add alcohol too if you wish. I've been back to the store several times now and they don't have these any more - when I bought them they were marked "temporary".  So now this is the only place I know to get them.

review/text: Actually my whole family was impressed. Not that my kids drink margarita's for real, but they loved the taste of this. I was blown away when mixing it up how much the mix smelled like an actual margarita. Now, while you can never capture the taste of the missing tequila in any non-alcoholic drink, this one came as close as possible to doing so I think. Really good and really refreshing :)I've seen it in stores, and will now buy it!

review/summary: Not a convenient size for me
review/text: I'm not a margarita drinker, so I can't compare this product to the "real thing." The taste was OK, actually too sweet for me, though I like it better mixed with half again more water than recommended.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest drawback of the product for me: each pack makes 2 quarts, and I just don't want two quarts of it at a time, much less three quarts. I tried tipping just a bit of the powder into a glass of water but found it impossible to get a consistent strength. I could have measured with a teaspoon, I suppose, but it was just a lot of trouble for a taste that was OK but really not more enjoyable than a glass of water from the cooler at the office.<br /><br />Just not my thing, I guess, though I'd enjoy a glass once in a while. It may come in smaller packets, in which case I might be interested.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2012

review/summary: Reminds me of Margaritaville! Fun times! Fun drink!
review/text: I'm a non-drinker, but I like the idea of a faux margarita--a "mocktail" complete with salt around the rim of a frosted glass. I love lemonade, but lately I've had an urge for something different. Thus when I saw this on Amazon, I went for it!<br /><br />Am I glad I did! I just made a pitcher of "margaritas" and am sitting here in my Girl Cave, writing while imbibing in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LJ04">Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. It was a warm California day and the night is still a little balmy, so this delicious drink is hitting the spot!<br /><br />The cannister I received contained five packets that make two quarts each! Just think, ladies, I can indulge to my heart's content and never get intoxicated. And it's only five calories per serving. Isn't that wonderful? Actually, there's enough to go around, so come on over. :-)<br /><br />You can't beat the trusted name of Crystal Light! And this product takes me back to the days when I lived above the beach in Capitola, home of Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. Oh, the fun and music associated with that place are beyond belief...<br /><br />Here's to Jimmy Buffet, music, Margaritaville, refreshing margaritas, and you...<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, Octibert 19, 2011<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Really Like This New Flavor
review/text: I really like this new flavor by Crystal Light.  They got the lemon lime taste of a margarita right.  Because of the artificial sweetener in all Crystal Light mixes, it does have a slight aftertaste, but just slight.  If you drink Crystal Light on a regular basis, you won't notice this at all.  Of course, I like that a serving is only 5 calories.  If you are like me, and wondered whether this "mocktail" would taste like there was alcohol in it, I can tell you that it doesn't.  The drink tastes like a virgin margarita, which is fine by me.

review/summary: "Moon Juice"
review/text: The Crystal Light Margarita-flavored "Mocktail" yielded some interesting reactions in our house.<br /><br />I mixed a pitcher of it, which was pretty easy. Add a full packet of powder to 8 cups of water and stir - it doesn't get much simpler that that. The resulting drink is a cloudy green color. Then, we all tried it.<br /><br />My daughter thought it tasted like lemonade or limeade, but she couldn't figure out which. She also didn't like the smell of it, which almost put her off of drinking it at all.<br /><br />The first words out of my girlfriend's mouth after tasting it were "moon juice." She didn't really know how else to describe it - and she didn't finish her glass of it, nor did she go back for seconds.<br /><br />That kind of sums it up for me too. The Crystal Light Margarita "mocktail" has a nonspecific fruity flavor. It's more sweet than tart, with a vague citrusy tang. It's not as sweet as Kool-Aid but sweeter than Propel or other "health waters." It's labeled as "margarita" flavored, but it doesn't taste much like any margarita I've ever had, and like most of the Crystal Light drinks I've tried over the years, it finishes with a gritty, dry aftertaste.<br /><br />The end result is that it was worth trying out of curiosity, but we probably won't be going back for any more of this mysterious moon juice.

review/text: I HATE giving negative reviews, and I really tried my best to like this product, but it didn't taste like a Margarita to me. The taste felt flat and weak even though it had a strong afterstate of god knows what. At best I can describe this drink as sweet, mildly limey with a hint of margarita flavor but not enough.<br /><br />It has a green coloring when mixed and it has a limeade flavor. But if you want lime-flavored water, I think their mojito flavor would have been a lot better. I ended up giving it away, that's how much I didn't like it.

review/summary: Not like the real thing but surprisingly passable....
review/text: If you are expecting this to taste like a real margarita, one made with real lime juice and alcohol, you will be disappointed.  However, this is not a terrible fake margarita & of course there are only 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  Personally, I prefer the real thing but have friends who are doing Weight Watchers so they appreciate having this as an option.<br /><br />I added fresh lime juice to it and it tasted better.  You could even add alcohol to get closer to the real thing and still save at least 100 calories compared to a margarita made with real juice.<br /><br />One note:  The mix is a very light powder so when I poured it in to the pitcher, it puffed everywhere!  It was up my nose & like a cloud of margarita.  Next time, I put the water in the pitcher first & carefully poured out the mix - no cloud!<br /><br />Ingredients:  Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Salt, Aspartame (sweetener), Natural Flavor, Contains less than 2% of Acesulfame, Potassium (sweetener), Magnesium Oxide, Artificial Color, Yellow 5, Blue 1.

review/summary: Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)
review/text: I was actually surprised that this is as good as it is.  Despite being a powdered mix, it has a pretty good flavor that tastes like a margarita mixer and not just like powdered lime juice.  There is a hint of orange, that you would get from the Triple Sec or Cointreau, along with the main lime flavor.  I drink my margaritas on the rocks, not frozen, and this was as good as most of the store bought mixes that I have tried, without being too sickly sweet and syrupy (I think many mixes out there are overly sweet, for making frozen margaritas).  I also make margaritas from scratch with real lime juice, ice and liqueur, and this does capture the traditional 'rita flavor.  However, I did not rate this as a "mocktail", since I have never had a mock margarita to compare it to.  It does make a good enough mixer for a real margarita.<br /><br />Each container contains 5 envelopes of mix that make 2 quarts each, so it works out cheaper than most of the store bought margarita mixers that I have seen.  Plus, in addition to not being overly syrupy and sweet, each 8-ounce serving is only about 5 calories which is significantly lower than others out there.

review/summary: It's ok, but it's not a margarita, or even an alcohol-free margarita (updated)
review/text: I'll start with a confession: I make my own margaritas, the basic recipe with lime juice, triple sec, and tequila, plus salt.  That means I'm not expecting other flavors and I'm really not expecting it to be sweet.<br /><br />Take away the alcohol and what's left is lime, and that's what I was expecting when I tasted this.  It's not what I got.  There's lime, of course, plus what seems to be lemon for some reason, but no detectable orange or bitter orange (which would replace the triple sec).  It's fairly sweet.<br /><br />It's also a startling neon green-yellow, a great color for a kids' drink.<br /><br />If you like sweet margarita mixes, this might be for you.  After the kids have gone to bed you can add some tequila and triple sec and make it a bit more interesting, and from there you could throw it into a blender with some ice for a frozen drink.  If your margaritas are lime juice with a kick, you'll probably find this to be too sweet.<br /><br />Update: I mixed this in a bottle with a narrow neck, and left it for a couple of days.  When I poured myself a glass tonight, I noticed a white residue stuck on the bottom of the bottle.  I've poured out the Crystal Light and tried everything I can think of, but I can't clean the residue off.  You might want to keep this in a bottle or pitcher with a wide mouth that you can fit your hand into, to be able to clean it properly.

review/summary: Not bad for a Mocktail - but making it into a cocktail is better :)
review/text: I like Margaritas.  Good margaritas.  This doesn't exactly fit the bill.  That said, this isn't supposed to be exactly like a margarita - this is a flavored powdered drink mix that has considerably fewer calories than a real margarita.  And the taste isn't bad at all.  You're not going to fool anyone by dragging out a pitcher of this for your friends - it's got that kind of diet aftertaste that all non-sugar sweetened drinks have, but it's not as strong as some other diet drinks.  If you drink this with a lot of ice, it's pretty good!  And if you're drinking it at work, you feel like you're getting away with something - always nice.<br /><br />I just tried this with tequila in it, and it's pretty good!  I made it on the rocks, but I think it would be better frozen.  You don't need to add a whole lot of tequila - about 2 oz per packet, and cut back a little on the water.  Mix well.  Not quite as good as the "real" thing, but the diet taste is masked a bit by the alcohol, and the calories are MUCH less.  My husband, who is used to the diet aftertaste from other drinks, really likes it.<br /><br />Kool Aid for grown ups - mmm!

review/text: This is a delicious margarita mix alternative.  You can even taste the hint of salt and lime in it.  Very tasty, indeed.  Without alcohol, its a mere 5 calories, but what's the point? For me, I like margaritas because of the tequila.  So, I did some math and mixing.  Adding 1 cup (8 ounces) of Jose Cuervo Especial to the 2 quart mix makes each 8 ounce glass approximately only 70 calories (each 1 ounce of tequila is 65 calories).  This is more than 70% less calories than in a standard Jose Cuervo margarita which is 240 calories per 8 ounce glass.  How awesome is that?  Thanks Crystal Light, another product well done.

review/summary: Takes just like the real thing sans tequila
review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita Mix<br /><br />This margarita mix seems to get mixed reviews from my experience. I personally loved it. I am on the second packet as I write this review, and I gave one packet to a co-worker for her to try. To me, this mix tastes just like a real margarita but without the tequila. The co-worker said it tasted like pool water mixed with margarita but reminded her of Cancun sitting by the pool. Her boyfriend said the same thing about the chlorine taste.<br /><br />I've never drank pool water before, but I know the smell of chlorinated water and this margarita mix didn't remind me of any of that. It did remind me of lemonade with a slight lime and tangy taste if I diluted it too much. It is also important to drink it chilled and not warm. As I poured the mix and water together, it did smell rather odd. Once I got the right amount of water and with ice cubes, the mix tasted normal like a margarita without the tequila. I've drank 3 quarts of the mix with my meals and love it!<br /><br />Looking at some of the other reviews, I have to remind potential buyers that taste can be a subjective thing especially since not all restaurants, bars, and diners create the same exact margarita. I just know that with 2 quarts of water and 1 packet of the mix, it tastes fine to me!<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars, tastes just like the real cocktail without the alcohol or excess sugar. For the cocktail aficionados and snobs, you may want to pass and go with the real thing.
