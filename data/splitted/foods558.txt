review/summary: Its cheap, but it has too much added flavoring
review/text: No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

review/summary: Not worth buying on Amazon!!!!!!!!
review/text: Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up. This is the third shipment we received like this (I had one shipment damaged and had the shipments on automatic renew each month and the last shipments were damaged too) and I am fed up. I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Dog Food by the Case
review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I asked but they did not provide an answer if this was a monsanto genetically modified beet product. monsanto gmo products have roundup weedkiller genetically added to their seeds. the plant is a pesticide and weedkiller. so anything that grows on it(food) also has that pesticide weedkiller in it. you therefore ingest this and it alters your dna. monsanto gmos have been linked to organ failure and birth defects. so beware.

So this 8 oz. package ends up being a bargain for it will last most of us through several winters. I highly recommend it.  It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States.

review/summary: Perhaps the most misunderstood "Magic" blend
review/text: It's hard to pinpoint all of the spices in Sweetie Blend, but the more prominent ones are cinnamon and clove, along with rough granulated sugar.<br /><br />Although the suggested uses are things like cereal and fruit, you'd really be surprised how versatile Sweetie Blend is. Just off the top of my head, the way it compliments sweet potatoes is amazing. Seriously, if you have a microwave and a little butter or margarine, you can have an awesome side dish in about five minutes. Or use it on sweet potato fries, or sweet potato...<br /><br />Okay, it's good for much more than that. I use it as a substitute for brown sugar whenever I'm working with a recipe that uses small amounts (teaspoon / tablespoon or two) like stew, sauces, and to caramelize some things I cook on the grill. Without exception, Sweetie Blend adds an interesting dynamic that always goes over well.<br /><br />And yeah, it's pretty great with coffee and Cheerios.<br /><br />I was totally geeked to see Amazon carried this, and the price is unbeatable. The regular price is a few dollars less than buying direct from Chef Paul's site, but the Subscribe & Save price is nearly half-off when you consider shipping.<br /><br />"But what am I going to do with six of these if I don't like them?" Give them to friends? Take them to work? Make a Chef Paul gift basket? Seriously, if you can even find this in a store (I've never seen Sweetie Blend in a store in Michigan), it goes for about $4/can, not to mention the time and gas spent going to the store and back.<br /><br />Take a chance. Unless you hate the flavor of awesome, get the six-pack.

review/summary: Fantastic Nutty Taste
review/text: This matcha may not really jump out at you compared to some of the other divine sounding flavors Red Leaf offers, but it is not one to be overlooked! The nutty flavor is so good and really strong, it permeates the whole cup and you'd swear there were ground up Macadamia nuts in this latte! It's rich, creamy, and just divine. The flavoring is spot-on, super natural tasting and not at all artificial. One of their best!

review/summary: Best Macadamia Nut Flavor Ever
review/text: Well I have to admit I was not as excited to try Macadamia Nut Matcha as I had been other flavors. A nut matcha to me seemed to be something one would mix with another outstanding sounding flavor, such as white chocolate mixed with macadamia nut perhaps. Alas white chocolate has not been released yet. I am sure I could have found something else to mix with this flavor but since it is my first time having it and I wanted to do a review I had it on its own.<br /><br />I can only say WOW just simply WOW. This is the most amazing macadamia nut taste! It is such a strong flavor!<br /><br />All I can say is once again I am absolutely not disappointed in Red Leaf's quality and flavors. I was so worried this flavor would only be so-so, a little nutty but not really having any true flavor unto itself. Fact is this tastes more macadamia nutty than anything else I can remember having outside of macadamia nuts themselves straight out of a can or jar, and I rarely have the nuts that way. Usually when I have macadamia nuts they are in a cookie somewhere.<br /><br />Let me just say this, if I had to choose between a couple of the cookies, and this matcha - I would pick the matcha hands down every time! And know that while I say that White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies are may all time favorite cookies!<br /><br />As always RLT's base matcha is superior to any other I have had.

review/summary: HOT HOT HOT!!!
review/text: We love spicy food and chipotle powder is a great way to add smoky heat to darn near everything.<br />In fact we keep a little shake jar of it right next to our salt and pepper.<br />It's delicious and adds intensity and flavour to everything I cook.<br /><br />I should note that it's insanely spicy, at least the batch we got.<br /><br />It took a little getting used to actually, despite loving spicy food I over spiced a couple times not realizing how hot it was.<br /><br />I love that it's organic as well.<br /><br />Ultimately I'd like to find a chipotle pepper that has lots of smokiness and a little less heat so I can have more flavour and smoke as well as heat but that's just personal preference.<br /><br />This is fantastic and I will buy again when we run out.

review/summary: RATING IS FOR THIRD-PARTY SELLER, NOT MILK DUDS OR AMAZON
review/text: I LOVE AMAZON. I LOVE MILK DUDS. That said, this third-party seller is in Arizona and they did not properly pack the candy for their extreme hot weather. The Duds arrived completely melted in a solid mass at the end of each of the product boxes. The BLOB of Duds in each box were so badly melted that they adhered to the cardboard inside the boxes. The end that could be seen showed that the solid blob of Duds had turned white from melting. I called the seller and they actually recommended NOT buying their Duds until DECEMBER when it cools down in Arizona. WHY THE HECK DON'T THEY JUST PACKAGE THEM AS PERISHABLES SO THEY'LL ARRIVE UNMELTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!?! I receive perishables from sellers across the country without problems all the time. I've never seen anything like this - it's really UNBELIEVABLE! They also want the product back before issuing a refund. So, they're sending a prepaid RMA to me. They could've saved themselves the return shipping AND a customer if they'd just correctly packaged the product in the first place!!! Obviously, I do NOT recommend buying from this third-party seller (even in December!). Clearly, they do not even approach Amazon's high shipping standards and customer service.

review/summary: As good as candy gets in my book!  So why only 4 stars?  Read on...
review/text: Milk Duds and I have had a longstanding love affair.  Always delicious whether cold(chewier) or warm(melts in your mouth... no offense to M&M's) these are sometimes reason enough to get me to go to the movie theater.  Buy 4 boxes of these and even if the movie is awful(and how many really aren't these days?!) the night won't be wasted... just try to regulate yourself so you haven't killed them before the previews end(try to eat them one at a time rather than handfuls I've learned)!  So why only 4 stars then?  Well although the candy is easily a 5 star candy it can have DISASTROUS effects on anyone who has dental work like fillings or caps.  I have literally been brought to my knees in pain by this candy!  There is nothing worse than enjoying a Milk Dud, when all of a sudden... sharp pain and the sudden taste of chocolate dental cement exploding in your mouth!  So in closing, if you have perfect teeth then this is a 5 star candy easily(although if you eat too many of these you won't have perfect teeth for long but...), if not; 4 stars but still worth the risk... just eat carefully!

review/text: I'm a celiac and vegetarian; these candies are gluten-free and vegan. So, yay! I can't find these any more in store so I'm contemplating buying them here; the price is about $1.50 less per box than I've seen at Kroger or Whole Foods, so this really is a great deal.<br /><br />It's true that the texture with these is different than with regular Haribo-type gummies; they don't have the same chewiness. But I prefer their flavor by a mile, and they don't make my teeth feel weird like the other kinds do (it's hard to explain but the regular kinds leave a strange texture on your teeth, and you can almost hear cavities being chipped away into your molars as you chew). My only gripes are that sometimes an individual pouch will have somewhat dried out candy in it, and there are occasional hard spots in some of the candy. But I'm giving these five stars anyway. They're awfully good, pleasantly habit forming, and relatively healthy (no artificial sugars or coloring in the least), so if you're going to be having candy one way or the other, this is a nice choice.

review/summary: Not very tasty, strange texture
review/text: I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny, like there was perfume in them.  I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free "Gummi Bears", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.  I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.<br /><br />After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item.  I was impressed!

review/summary: good flavor, but the texture isn't quite right
review/text: As a vegetarian who loves gummi candies, I was ecstatic to see that these vegetarian gummi bears were available. They arrived yesterday, and I immediately ripped open a bag.<br /><br />They're good, but the texture isn't quite the same as gummi bears with animal-based gelatin. Something about he chewiness isn't quite right. You could easily slice these with the dull side of a knife. A regular gummi, on the other hand, would require a few strokes with a serrated blade. The consistency, however, is very good; they're not too hard or too soft. And the flavors were even better than many brands of regular gummi bears.<br /><br />Overall, they're definitely the best vegetarian alternative to traditional gummi candies that I've found. They're much better than the ones from the bulk bin at Whole Foods.

Moreover, these bars are both chewy and satisfying  SMILE<br /><br />However, this cereal bar is not perfect. Each bar contains 26 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of sugar; sugar can sometimes turn into fat in your body. These amounts of carbohydrates and sugar are a lot for a comparatively small cereal bar! Moreover, this food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains some salt; and people with allergies to wheat or milk should consult their doctor before they eat this food.<br /><br />These bars go down better if you eat them with juice, milk or water. I eat them with water or apple juice myself.<br /><br />Overall, the strawberry flavored Nutri Grain cereal bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthy alternative to a regular breakfast or a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I also recommend them as a nutritious snack food that is especially good for people on the run. They are far superior to any candy bar!

review/summary: My Boy Won't Eat Them.
review/text: I have a 4-year-old son and I try to at least partly manage his nutrition. Sometimes he'll eat almost anything we put in front of him and sometimes he'll eat almost nothing. It's these latter episodes that bother me, so I try to have some snack foods around just to be sure that he gets enough. Take chocolate milk, for example. I can almost always get a glass in him and it's good nutrition. Another item is whole-grain fruit bars. I shop at Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Markets and usually buy their store brand. They're whole grain and organic and taste rather  good. If I give one to the boy it will almost always disappear in short order. Well, the last time I was there they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-grain Cereal Bars on half-price sale. I should have known better than to pick up a box of eight of the strawberry variety. I had one and it tasted fine, although I don't think it was as good as the store brand. My son wouldn't eat it. He just took one bite and that was it. I tried again the next day and got the same result. I don't understand it, but there's something about these bars that he just doesn't like. Well, maybe the guy has good judgement. I doubt that most people would notice, but he does.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Nutri-NOT Bars
review/text: These bars are a great example of a sneaky marketing ploy by a major food corporation. By using the word "Nutri" as part of the name of the product, consumers are tricked into thinking these are healthy. These should really be called CANDY-GRAIN bars! Here's the nutritional low down:<br />1. These bars contain 13 grams of sugar. (Notice the first ingredient in the "filling" is strawberry preserves, made of high fructose corn syrup and strawberries. The next ingredient is...corn syrup, followed by fructose, which is also a sweetener.) More sweeteners appear on down the ingredients list. Out of the 140 calories in this tiny bar, 62 calories come from sugar.<br /><br />2. These bars have partially hydrogenated oil in them. That's the type of oil that contains artery clogging trans fat. Yuck.<br /><br />3. They contain less than 1 gram of fiber. That means that the bars include very, very little whole grain or fruit, either of which would increase fiber content.<br /><br />4. They do contain some vitamins. But these are all in the form of additives. (They are listed at the end of the ingredient list.) Essentially, they've ground up a bit of a vitamin pill into each bar. Obviously, there's no need to eat candy to get powdered vitamins. If you want the extra vitamins--just take a vitamin pill!<br /><br />5. While they were at it, they added 5% DV of sodium per bar.<br /><br />I am not opposed to enjoying junk food now and then. If these bars tasted great, I might indulge in one as dessert from time to time. However, there's lots of junk food I like better...so I won't bother with these bars. A better choice, for taste and nutrition, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JHL8I2">Kashi TLC Crunchy Granola Bar - Pumpkin Spice Flax, 6 - 1.4 oz Bars, 8.4 oz</a> or one of the other Kashi bars. Or real strawberries, of course!<br />PG, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family

review/summary: Store Brands Are Better
review/text: Kellogg's laid claim to the concept of this type of cereal bar, yet the texture of these is very soft and more like a cookie.  Likewise, both the fillings and the crusts are sickeningly sweet and almost overpower the fact that the idea is that the bar is supposed to taste like "real" fruit.  Any variety of Wal-Mart's Great Value brand of cereal bars trumps these in a heartbeat.  GV's crust is more dense the sweetness is subtle, allowing pleasant fruitiness to filter though.  I highly recommend those.

review/text: Although I like Nutri-Grain bars because they make a great meal or snack if you're in a hurry, they definitely aren't healthy as other reviewers have mentioned.  The strawberry ones are the worst of all the flavors.  I bought a variety pack a couple months ago for the office, and the box of strawberry ones is still sitting here virtually untouched.  If the office people don't want them (and they'll eat just about anything), you know they aren't very good.  I will continue to buy Nutri-Grain bars but I would never purchase the strawberry ones again.

review/summary: More Cookies than Nutrition
review/text: The name of these "Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars" might lead one to believe they have some whole grain nutritional value. But when you read the packaging the only nutrition comes additives. There is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as I would a piece of candy. These travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice.

If you are going to have candy or cake, this is better choice but just as artificial just slightly more fiber which is minimal for a healthy choice anyway. better to eat real fruit, but like i said, good for snack but not healthy. I eat the strawberry ones and I noticed blood on my toilet paper from wiping my behind almost every time I had some. That is not a good sign. Entenmans has similar fruit bars that are a couple calories less and you don't taste all that salt like you do with these. I am switching back.

review/summary: Both of our cats love this!
review/text: Both of our cats love this!<br /><br />I have paid special attention to the ingredients list and have been pleased to find that it does not include corn products or byproducts.  Sadly, most cat foods on the market have corn as their first, second, or third ingredient.  Sometimes it is both the second AND third ingredient (corn meal and another corn byproduct, etc.).  I wish I had known this fact a long time ago.  I have recently been looking for a healthier choice for my two cats and even the ones that state that they are a healthy alternative tend to contain ingredients that I would question and in amounts that are alarming.  This is the ONLY cat food at my market that does not contain corn as a main ingredient and it seems the healthiest alternative.  I have tried (through Amazon) other alternatives that are just as healthy, but sadly my cats did not like the taste.  This one they adore.<br /><br />Healthy and tasty.  I couldn't ask for more.

review/text: The food itself contains good ingredients.<br /><br />I was checking out different dry cat foods because my cat may be allergic or have some sensitivity to certain foods, mostly wheat.<br /><br />The only problem is that my cat is very selective of what she eats and when I mixed this with her food, she sniffed out what she wanted to eat. I tried giving this to her by itself and she sniffed and strayed off.<br /><br />My guess is that the smell or flavor is not the kind she likes. In addition to that my other 5 cats won't eat it either. I gave it 3 stars because the ingredients seem good enough, though my cats don't like it and won't eat it.

I was so happy I immediately went out and bought a big bag of it. The biggest plus side of this is its much healthier for her because it doesn't have as many harmful fillers like the other kitty chows do, I'm so happy with purina one beyond I would definitely recommend this to other cat owners.

After they started getting this I know as soon as their dry dish gets low because they start crying at me.  It also goes to note that one of my cats was having UTI's (which the vet said was likely from stress from our new dogs), but after a month of kitty prozac I switched the food and the UTI's stopped.

Give to little and you have a very vocal pet, who loves how oily and smelling the salmon is in this food. Just be sure to check the packaging for daily allowances.

review/summary: This espresso machine looks pretty and makes horrible espresso
review/text: This expresso machine is horrible... my last machine belonged to my parents and was gifted to me, it lasted over 20 years, it made consistent espresso and was wonderful, not saeco brand.. when it died I decided to put some money into replacing it with a nice machine hoping that it would last years, and make wonderful lattes. I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one. Now after another month I am at my wits end. I wake up every morning hope it's going to make a decent cup, and end up drinking a watery cup of awful latte... grumpy until I decide to purchase a latte somewhere later in the day. I'm done hoping, like my husband says you can piss in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.. Today I am calling to return this awful piece of junk... and hopefully I will at least get my money back. Never will I purchase another product from this company, what a disappointment. If you at all like espresso you will be displeased with this machine.

Takes longer to fill the coffee cup than one would like.  From start up to drinking coffee may be longer than 5 minutes but we did not really time it. Once running it makes good coffee but we like the flavored coffee and it does not recommend that.  Problem solved by adding some flavoring to the finished brew. Overall not that happy with it but it cost so much that I guess we are stuck with it. Return fees were so much that we decided to just keep it and try to live with the things we found troublesome.

review/text: Makes one cup at a time at the push of a button (without wasteful coffee sitting in the coffee pot). If you like frothing, suggest Vienna Silver Plus (with steam boiler). Understand the type of coffee you use with these machines. If using oily coffee, you MUST set the grinder to coarser setting;  clean the brew group regularly AND lubricate the brew group. Oily coffee pastes and causes stress on moving parts if not cleaned/maintained.<br />This machine works BEST with true Italian roast coffee as it does not paste so minimal maintenance. Descale every 3 months.

review/text: So far so good. Have owned the Saeco Vienna 4045 for about a month and it makes great coffee. It's a little bigger and bulkier than my Krupps, but that won't matter if it doesn't break as fast as the Krupps broke. It doesn't have a digital screen, so it actually is a simpler machine. The grounds drawer is large and holds plenty, but the machine doesn't let you know when it's full and ready to be emptied. Otherwise, it's a great machine, that requires a bit of time to get used to. But once you learn how to use it and figure out the settings you want for your coffee it runs great and makes delicious coffee.

review/summary: So glad we purchased this item!
review/text: My husband and I both drink a lot of coffee and have wanted a nice espresso machine for home use for quite some time. I splurged and purchased this for his birthday last week. We have used it every single day and are very pleased. While we've had small machines for home use, we were always disappointed because it was difficult to make a decent latte with them. This machine is so easy to use, pretty quiet and I feel like I'm getting a coffee house product in my own kitchen.

review/text: The product arrived poorly packaged and damaged. Once we got it out of the box, my wife didn't like it all -- it looked cheap. In any event, we made one coffee with it before it completely failed. We sent it back and more than a month later are still waiting for our refund.

review/text: Very poor quality construction. I had to push in the control panel when I go it. Plastic, cheap and won't last long. I had it 24 hours before I went through all the trouble of trying to package it back up and shipping it back to Amazon.<br /><br />Save yourself the $25 in shipping fees and find another Automatic Espresso Machine.<br /><br />Clearman

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: We have just returned our Saeco after having it one day!  We called the Saeco number for advise on why coffee will not brew...they were helpful but now have returned the machine to them rather than Amazon.  Hopefully, they will do as they said and deliver a new one to us.  Otherwise...we are prepared to go to the Better Business Bureau and will hire a lawyer...this was not a cheap purchase!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LVWR">Saeco Vienna Deluxe SuperAutomatic Espresso Coffee and Cappuccino Machine</a>

review/summary: Good Superauto for the Money
review/text: I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is "graphite" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.<br /><br />I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.<br /><br />I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you'll know what I mean if you've owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).<br /><br />The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don't mind this for reasons I'll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it's ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.<br /><br />My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you'll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.<br /><br />I'm sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker.

review/summary: Best value in Automatic Espresso machines
review/text: Vienna Plus is my third fully automatic machine. I loved my first, Saeco original Vienna, hated the second, Saeco Incanto classic. The original Vienna worked for 3 years every day, making consistently good espresso before the pump gave. I should have paid for repair, but I succumbed to that stainless steel twinkle and went for Saeco Incanto classic. More expensive for sure. Worse, better said inconsistent, coffee quality, constant small problems relating to built quality concerning the brew group, the grinder and the steamer wand. After a year of irritation a pump seal has failed while making espresso, nothing like a small explosion in the kitchen in the morning, I tell ya. Well, gone back to the trusted Vienna, now with  the plus in the name. Good old days are here again .... Compared to previous- it is a lot quieter, when both grinding and steaming, it is also a lot quicker to warm up then before, steam is ready a mere 15 seconds after pushing the button. Espresso has a beautiful rich crema right out of the box, I didn't have to experiment with grind setting at all. The steaming wand (Panarello) has been redesigned and is now foolproof maker of perfect frothed foam. For the newbie I would like to add that I spent a lot of effort to find the right roast - tasted more than a few before I settled on one (Peerless Coffee Espressp Perfection) that I buy now in 5 lb. bags and keep in the freezer. I should for fairness add that I never want any other coffee through the machine like some decaf or flavored stuff, so I don't miss the alternate ground coffee option that Incanto had. My priority has always been flavor and consistency and that the Vienna Plus delivers. My friends drive miles to "see me" and, by the way, get a cup of espresso, praising each one as "this is the best espresso in the world".  If that is what you desire, don't get mesmerized by stainless steel shine or computerized display magic and save yourself some money by getting this machine. You won't regret it. And I am unanimous in that. ;)

review/summary: Not at all reliable
review/text: Overall, I cannot recommend this machine.<br /><br />The machine made excellent espresso for the first few weeks we had it.  Once it was broken in, the espresso was average, and the crema was more of a large-bubbled foam.  The grinder is able to create a fine grind, but unfortunately the machine can't pass any water through it, so you have to use a mid-level fine grind.  The machine is able to adjust the amount of water used per shot, but anything more than the smallest available setting creates, well, coffee.  Not even an Americano, just coffee.<br /><br />After three months the grinder broke.  When I opened up the machine's door a broken part flew out.  Amazon sent me a new one.  One month in on the new one, the brewgroup jammed.  I thought it was broken, but after four days, the machine was able to pry itself loose.  Ground coffee was all over the brewgroup, as if it had exploded.  We'll see how it works out.<br /><br />A bright spot--Amazon was astoundingly helpful and gracious.  They replaced the first one, postage payed, express delivery, with no questions at all.  They offered to refund the original purchase price on the second one, until it broke loose and started working again.  I cannot complement them highly enough!
