review/summary: Better than 5 stars!
review/text: We were supplementing our DD with about 1/2 formula due to my low milk production.  I was pumping regularly in addition to breastfeeding in an attempt to raise production and freeze some milk in preparation for my return to work.  My OB prescribed metoclopramide but after three days my production hadn't changed yet, and I was so sleepy from the drug that I was having trouble taking care of my girl.  I stopped the medicine and started looking for other alternatives.  After reading the reviews on this tea I decided to give it a try and am so glad I did!  Most feedings I can now breastfeed without having to supplement with any formula afterwords. This morning after she finished feeding (and was full!) I was able to pump an additional 2 ounces! There seemed to be a small increase within 24 hours of starting the tea, but the big change occurred after 3 days of 4-5 cups a day.  Extremely impressed with the results, and I actually like the taste.  Yes, it is pricey but so is formula!  (And, of course, breast milk is better for the baby!)

review/text: I had trouble producing milk after my daughter was born. Two weeks after she was born I still had hardly any milk come in, so I purchaed this product, it seemed to help with my milk production. I would recommend it to anyone that does not mind smelling like maple syrup becuase you will for some reason smell like it when you drink this product :).

review/summary: It works.
review/text: I have a  4 month old baby and he stopped nursing  as i had to introduce the bottle early. However since I was determined to give him breastmilk and my supply had gone down to 1oz I was desperate to look for solutions. After reseaching many websites and then reading reviews on amazon I decided to try this tea.<br /><br />I took 5 bags of tea and let them soak in hot boiling water and drank it through the day. My supply gradually stated going up even though my son never nursed. I then started taking 3 bags for maintaining my supply.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes even though it has many contents it tastes like you are eating the fennel seeds. Its not the best taste for a tea but its not bad especially if it works.<br />Also you get used to the taste.<br /><br />I am planning to continue to use it as long as I want to give my son breastmilk. At one point i was consistently making 4 oz everytime i pump. I have stopped it and since then my supply has gone down but I am going to start again.<br /><br />Update 1/8/2012<br /><br />I was able to provide breastmilk upto 10 months for my son using tea. At one point I was actually producing 8ounces each time. Will definitely use it again in the future for our second one too.

review/text: I tried this tea because I was worried that my daughter was not eating as much as she should be eating. After seeing my daughter's appetite increase and her not getting her fill, I decided to try this tea as I heard that it works for some mother's. It worked for me after two or three days of drinking it about four times a day. It tasted like herbal tea to me not black licorice. Honey makes it taste better.

review/summary: WOW!!  This stuff is amazing!
review/text: I have tried everything to increase my production.  My son is almost 4 months now and I've just barely been keeping up with him since he was born.  With this tea, my production has improved dramatically!  I used to struggle to get 4 oz, now I'm getting about 8 oz per pumping session. I've been using this product for about a week now.  It's wonderful.  If you're committed to breast feeding and having trouble with supply, this is a MUST TRY!  The taste is ok.  When I first started drinking it, I hated it.  But I just discovered splenda.  One pack of splenda makes it taste really good.  Definitely recommended.

review/text: It's a good thing this tea actually works as it's supposed to... because it tastes so, SO bad!  I went from pumping 8 oz/day at work to 11 oz/day by the end of a week, and that was only using the tea twice a day.  I'm not a tea fan to start with, and this has a very strong anise flavor... also not a favorite.  With enough honey, I can tolerate it.  The results are worthwhile.

review/summary: this tea is a lifesaver
review/text: I have been drinking this tea since the first week that my daughter was born.  She is now 8 month sold, and I still rely on it.  I have enormous mugs (~3 cups each) and I drink about 5 of those very day.  I can not completely vouch for the power of the tea, but it does taste great and reminds me to drink my water throughout the day.  I can't imagine drinking as much water as I do of this tea.  I do notice a drop in milk supply when I am away from home and forget to make myself a cup or two throughout the day.  I order a 6-pack every months and almost always run low by the time the next one arrives.  I highly recommend this tea to any breastfeeding mother who wants to nurse for as long as possible.  (sigh up for the monthly delivery and save lots of money.)  Nothing beat the benefits of breastfeeding.  If you think the tea is pricey - try purchasing formula! :)

review/summary: Worked for me!
review/text: I was given this tea in the hospital (a regular hospital, not anything alternative) while recovering from a c-section with my first child. I could not recommend it highly enough.  I wasn't sure what to think of drinking a "medicinal" tea, but I was converted by this one product.  It really did make a difference, at least for me.  Used it again after the birth of my second child when I encountered some milk production issues and was pleasantly surprised all over again.  It really made me rethink my attitude on herbal remedies- not something I gave much thought to before.  The taste isn't great to be honest, but after your first few cups you adjust and it tastes just fine.  I paid far less for it than it is currently listed for here, so shop around, not just online but in your local community.  My local big chain grocery store stocks this and other Traditional Medicinals tea.

I'm very happy to say that I was able to continue our little guy on mommy's milk and I think that's why he's such a happy and healthy moose!

review/summary: This is a great product at a great price
review/text: I'm currently breast feeding my 3rd baby, and I've never been one to have an abundant milk supply.  I first tried this tea with my first and I felt that it worked, but I bought it at the grocery store (1 or 2 boxes at a time) and didn't drink it more than twice a day in order to make it last.  When I saw that I could get a pack of 6 in Amazon for such a great price, I jumped at the chance (I got a cheaper price by choosing the subscribe and save option) and religiously drink at least 3 cups a day. Not only does it work; it's delicious! I have more milk now than I ever did with my 2 previous kids. And did I mention how yummy it is?  This tea is available in most grocery stores and health stores; buy a box, give it a try, and if it works come back and buy it in bulk.

review/summary: The Only thing that works for me!
review/text: I had a c-section so my milk came in late as it is, and not to mention that I also have PCOS, this really boosted my supply! I was supplementing the first 2 months with formula until i started taking this. I notice a definate drop if I stop, so this is something you have to stick to if you want the production of milk. Also, I noticed that it works better if you sip it hot instead of gulping it down cold, so now i make enough for one serving at a time. Another thing that also helped me was the herb "SHATAVARI", you can also get that on amazon, and info on it at [...] GOOD LUCK!

review/summary: Good tasting, and generally effective
review/text: Mother's Milk Tea, by Traditional Medicinals, is a common drink of nursing moms wanting to maintain a healthy milk supply. The tea relies on the herbs fennel, aniseed, and coriander, believed to increase milk production. I like that Traditional Medicinals uses organic, vegan, non-GMO, pharmacopoeial-grade herbs (at least in the organic version of the tea, which is the only one that I have seen sold for some time now).<br /><br />To use the tea properly, it needs to be steeped, which can be a minor inconvenience, but necessary to get the full effect. The teabag should be added to 8 oz. of boiled water and steeped covered for 10 minutes. If you plan to drink a lot of medicinal teas like this, it's probably worth investing in a teacup with a cover - otherwise, covering the cup with a flat coaster, plate or saucer works just fine. Once uncovered, it will probably take between 5 and 20 minutes before it's cool enough to drink.<br /><br />I think the tea is really delicious, with the caveat, that in order to enjoy it, you must like the flavor of black licorice due to the aniseed. If you don't *like* licorice, you need to at least be able to tolerate it, or you'll never get this tea down! I drink it with nothing added, but it could also be lightly sweetened with some honey or agave nectar if it's too bitter for you.<br /><br />So the big question is...does it work? As with anything medicinal or herbal, in the western or eastern tradition, some things will work for some and not for others. I can tell you that I personally do see a direct effect from this tea. At the beginning, I would drink a cup and quickly notice the increase. As nursing has gone on, the effect is more subtle, but definitely noticeable. I drink one cup a night simply because I believe this is a healthy herbal preparation to support milk supply, and it supports my supply through night nursing. I usually increase that to two a day while menstruating, because my supply drops slightly during that time. When my baby is sick or going through some other increased nursing period, or if I cave in to an illness and take a decongestant, I will increase it to three or more.<br /><br />If you are having (or think you might be having) true milk supply issues, though, this tea alone will probably not have enough of an effect to correct the problem.<br /><br />Amazon's subscribe and save program offers as good a price as I have seen on it anywhere.

review/summary: An easy option to increase your milk supply
review/text: I've been using Mother's Milk Tea for a little over a month now & it seems to be working quite well.  Before I started drinking the tea, I would only be able to pump a couple ounces at a time, creating a problem of not having a decent supply of breastmilk built up in my freezer.  After drinking the tea, I can now pump about 4 ounces at a time.  I noticed a difference after just a couple cups of this tea.  They say that when you return to work that your milk supply is bound to go down but, I think this tea has counter-acted that theory because I haven't noticed much of a difference in my milk supply since I've been back to work.  There may have been a slight decrease but, not much in my case.  This seems to be an easy option to increase your milk supply.  I'm glad I tried this tea because I did not want to have to supplement my son with formula.  The taste isn't too bad either.  It has a anise or licorice taste.  I add a little honey to it & it tastes just fine.  I don't always drink 5 cups a day of this tea but even when I don't, I still notice a difference in my supply.  I sometimes brew a couple tea bags in a mug & let it sit and get really strong before drinking it.  Seems to do the trick for me. Amazon also seems to have the best price that I could fine for the tea.

review/summary: Tastes great, helped increase supply
review/text: After only a few cups in a couple days, I began noticing an increase in my supply when pumping. Rather than 1-2 oz or less at a session, I began getting 3-4 oz. I had started taking a fenugreek supplement a few weeks prior, which helped as well. I don't pump a lot--just enough to run errands or let dad help with overnight feedings, but this really improved the quality and speed with which I could pump. Maybe it's the placebo effect, but this along with staying hydrated and eating balanced meals is a winner in my book.<br /><br />As for the taste--it SMELLS stronger of anise than it tastes. I find it mild and pleasantly herbal with a splash of whole milk and a little sugar. I make it two tea bags at a time in a standard Copco travel cup. I can see though why some might find the taste bad--it depends on how strongly you oppose the licorice flavor. (I don't like licorice that much but this was fine.)<br /><br />I think the case deal here on Amazon is probably one of the best around--I haven't found it cheaper locally.

review/text: I just got this in today because I'm tired of paying 8 bucks for earth mama angel baby mothers milk. So I decided to try this. I started drinking mothers milk because exclusively breastfed babies during growth spurts you feel like your not producing enough.<br /><br />  My 2 month old daughter had 2 growth spurts already second one being the longest reaching a week! First growth spurt awful which was before the tea. Second was a breeze because I was producing more than enough . Now before the tea my supply was fine but I wanted to increase it so I can pump and store. This is a god send! Ladies don't give up!<br /><br />  Breastfeeding is tough but I promise it gets better with time! Remember its liquid gold that is so good for your bundle of joy! And your baby is learning how to become efficient so say it to yourself :) my daughter is a eater if she could she would be attached to me 24/7 sometimes I feel like 7 eleven! From 2 hr feeds to 40 minutes now. I swear it gets better! Stay strong!

After 4 days of this I called it quits with this tea and magically our feedings were fine again. This is one time I think correlation IS causation. Too bad too because I had finally found a way to get it down...drinking it with a werther's caramel in my mouth. Not healthy but it did the trick. I say give the tea a try to see if it works for you but if your feedings start going poorly this is probably the cause.

review/text: Wow!! I bought this tea not to sure what to expect, boy was I glad that I did.  It has a nice and sweet taste to it, but it's not overly sweet, it's just right, When you buy this, and put it in the water and mix it, don't be thrown if it looks pale. It looked pale to me, and thought it would taste weak, that's not the case.  If you like peach or mango tea, then you know what to expect. If you haven't tried this before, trust me, it's outstanding. :O)

Each container has five packets in it and it will make 10 quarts for the container.  It is a very tasty drink and best when served cold or over ice.<br /><br />This is really a good choice for a low calorie drink. Buy it and enjoy a glass!

review/summary: Love this Tea
review/text: I purchased this from Amazon because I was unable to find it in my local grocery store.  It happens to be my favorite, and since I do not drink alot of soda, I was having to settle for other flavors.  By purchasing this from Amazon I was actually able to pay less than what the grocery store prices are, and I don't have to run from store to store to find it.  I also like the fact you can set it up for future deliveries.  You get 4 in a pack, and if you figure your delivery out right never be without your favorite grocery item.  I did notice it back on the store shelves again, but since I already have it stocked in my pantry, I do not need to worry about being without my favorite drink.  Thanks so much for carrying this product, Amazon.

review/summary: Too many oranges!
review/text: I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a "candy dish" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.

review/summary: swear by this stuff!
review/text: I am into non-medicinal care as much as possible.  I don't do well with all sorts of prescribed medicines; last go around caused my immune system to crash and I was a long time in rebuilding it.  When you find something that works so well with simple herbs you are delighted.  Gypsy Cold Care isn't bad tasting.  Sort of a twiggy with a strong mint-type flavour.  Only who cares what it takes like!  This stuff works for me.  At the first hint of a cold or sore throat, I brew a pot and drink it.  Generally all the cold symptoms just fade away in just a few hours.  I have recommended it to dozens of friends and it works well for them, too.<br /><br />So if you are looking for all natural alternatives, you might consider this the next time you feel a cold coming on.  I keep it on hand all winter.

review/summary: Gypsy Cold Care - a miracle for seasonal allergies!
review/text: I would give this tea 10 stars if I could! I recently wrote the following to Traditional Medicinals corporate office and meant every word! "Folks, I wanted to share with you my outstanding experience with Gypsy Cold tea and a use which is not directly listed on the label.  I originally bought and absolutely loved your product to get over a cold and found it effective and really delicious even without a sweetener.  As a nearly 15 year chronic severe allergy sufferer (a nightmare in Northern VA) almost year round I decided to keep drinking it in the morning to see if the anti-inflammatory properties could address my issues. I never looked back and now six months later have so many colleagues doing the same that we stock it in the office.  Another colleague's very young children demand it daily after I sent a box to them as a gift to get over a cold and told them that if Totoro drank tea, that is what he would drink because it's so twiggy woodsy tasting. They now call it 'Totoro tea'.<br />Just one 16 oz cup in the morning does the trick. If I forget, my allregies return with a vengeance but easily corrected as soon as I down a cup and reminds me just how effective it is. The residual benefits are extensive since each OTC and prescription allergy med has some side effects - from dry skin/eyes, dry mouth, heart palpitations.  There were times when I couldn't even wear my contact lenses for weeks but no more. It's fantastic!<br /><br />I do wish you may bring it to others' attention - for expanded business and, more importantly, much needed relief to desperate people like I (used to be).  I've handed out tea bags to everyone who would listen and found that it is as effective for them as it's been for me.  Thank you so much!!!!<br /><br />A bit more about me - I am a health conscious non-smoker female.  I usually buy it on Amazon. A never skip a day and it is as routine as taking my supplements. By the way - Breathe Easy does not work the same way so it is definintely this particular tea. We love you guys!

review/summary: Delicious and I think it works!
review/text: Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I use the Gypsy Cold Care for whenever I feel like I am catching a cold.  Nip it in the bud so to speak and boy does this tea help.  I took it last year when I felt like I was catching a cold and the next day I felt like the cold had gone away.  Maybe it would have done that on it's own, I don't know.  But I believe this tea really helps.  I highly recommend both the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.

review/summary: Great as an alternative to cough drops
review/text: I used the Cold Care PM product from this company when I had something similar to the flu a year or so ago.  That one was just as good as this, but it knocked you out within 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This Gypsy Cold Care seems to be non-drowsy so far, but I find the best use of it is as an alternative to cough drops.  I recently found out that I was allergic to corn and corn derivatives, so I am unable to have most hard candies, cough drops, and cough syrups (High-Fructose corn syrup or corn-derived sugar alcohols are used in those).  This tea is excellent at coating your throat during the mild cold stages.  I don't have a severe sore throat yet, but I definitely recommend the PM version of this if your cold is that bad: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014TPBA">Traditional Medicinals - Cold Care Pm Herb Teas, 16 bag</a><br /><br />It's nice to be able to treat myself without subjecting myself to corn.  The tea is also caffeine free and easy to drink: It does not contain licorice root (black licorice flavor), which some people love and others hate.<br /><br />The suggested serving on the box says 1-2 cups initially and another cup about every 3 hours after that.

review/text: I don't go in for herbal remedies. When I'm sick, I grab some Robitussin or Sudafed, and that's that. If this has any legitimate medicinal value, it's just a nice bonus. From my standpoint, this is just a Damned Good Tea!<br /><br />It's got an unlikely minty licorice taste to it, which has really grown on me. I haven't found this taste in any other tea. The aroma is wonderful, and it cools the nose like a subtle eucalyptus, though that's not present in the taste. While it makes a great hot tea, it really shines for iced tea. I use one bag per 18oz or so, rather than the one bag per 12oz I'd normally use for iced tea brewing, and this works quite well. In addition to the refreshing taste, that coolness in the nose and the throat makes a great hot weather refreshment.

review/text: As far as I am concerned, this is the gold standard for tea.  I was born in upstate New York and now live near the Gulf Coast; thus I am forced to order this online.  It has a full, robust flavor that is wonderful with sugar added.  Try brewing it in the sun with fresh mint leaves and serve it iced...YUMMY.  I have found it is best to not get the water TOO hot.  For example, the hot water dispenser on the office coffee machine does not produce the same wonderful flavor as heating water on the stove to near-boiling.  I willingly order it online, and when I serve it for guests they rave.  You can order the Earl Grey version directly from Red Rose - also very nice.

review/summary: not a premium tea, but tasty if you know how to make it
review/text: Compared to a modern top-end black tea, Red Rose has a pretty strong bitter note that somewhat hides the round flavor on top.  This tea not only can stand up to milk or cream, I'd say it demands it, plus sugar.  Given all that, a milked and sugared cup of this, after a good 5 minute steep, has a very nice full tea flavor (afternoon style) that keeps getting more luscious as it cools.  Just over luke-warm, there is a really wide rich old-leaf taste as the milk hauls off the tannins.  The aftertaste is milky.  This is not a weak bag, like Tetley.  Excellent for cookie-dipping and iced-tea. Perfect for Southern sweet-tea (a diluted iced tea with massive sugaring).  Once you get the cellophane off, you will want to put this into foil, or a tea tin left over from a fancy brand, so the top flavor doesn't run away.  They do a good job delivering fresh tea to the store shelf, though.  For the price, and with buffering, this is very good tea. Not as clear as Lipton, but with a wider, fuller flavor.

This is real black tea.  I drink herb tea or plain water when Red Rose is not available.<br /><br />Collecting the "prizes" is just a sideline.

Maybe it's the maple?  I don't know...all I know is when I bring it to work and bust out the jar and crackers I'm the most popular girl around.  Thanks, Justin!

review/summary: "best canned herring I have tasted"
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2DQJQ">Bar Harbor All Natural Smoked Wild Kippers, 6.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />The Bar Harbor canned herring is very new to me but I have tried the smoked, those in tomato sauce and those in mustard and I can quite easily say this is the best canned herring I have ever eaten. Firm texture, moist,full flavored with no heavy "fishy" taste, high quality sauces and excellent value for the money. These cans contain enough for 2 full servings and the price drops well below "store bought" common varieties on this basis. I'll not pay $1.19-1.39 per 3.65 ounce can of sardines or fish steaks when I can have these instead. I cannot imagine anyone with a liking for canned fish finding these lacking in any attribute.

review/summary: The best remedy I've ever found for a sore throat!
review/text: I damaged my vocal cords when I was a kid, so I lose my voice often and I am also prone to getting a sore throat VERY often . A friend of mine recommended this tea to me about four years ago and it is incredible!<br /><br />It tastes delicious. I usually let the tea bag steep for 10 or 15 minutes to develop the full flavor. It is soothing and really does "coat" your throat so it doesn't burn or scratch or hurt. It is almost like a natural organic anesthetic. I highly recommend it to anyone with a sore throat. Try it once, and you will be a fan for life.

review/summary: Wonderful for your throat. A little weird if you don't like licorice!
review/text: This tea, plus ungodly amounts of honey, got me through a few really intensive months of rehearsing and performing -- I'm a classical singer, and sometimes my schedule is absolutely crazy! I was toting around a nalgene full of Throat Coat and honey at all times last spring, and it was a godsend.<br /><br />Throat Coat is soothing and slightly sweet, and does exactly what it's supposed to. As with a lot of herbal concoctions, though, the aroma can be kind of funky at first! It's definitely redolent of black licorice (true licorice haters ought to stay away), and the taste takes a little getting used to. By my third or fourth cup, I wasn't bothered by it anymore.<br /><br />If you're a classical singer, a singer of any sort, or just have a really sore throat, I'd say give it a try. With lots of honey. Mm.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing, best herbal sore throat remedy I've found
review/text: This stuff works really well. I'm not a big homeopathic remedy person, but Throat Coat relieves my sore through for a decent amount of time and tastes pretty good. I much prefer to drink in combination with saltwater gargling and using a neti pot, than to use menthol cough drops. Breathing in the steam also relieves pain and congestion in the throat, nose and sinuses. I found it about 7 yrs ago and have been using it ever since.<br /><br />Note: you need to follow the instructions on the box for steep time to get the full effect. It requires a long steep in boiling water (I think it's 10-15 minutes). I use a very large mug covered with a lid for this so that when it's done steeping, it's still hot and it lasts a while.

review/summary: Great for laryngitis
review/text: I can't talk right now because I have laryngitis. I always use this tea when I get a sore throat or laryngitis. I went to my cupboard to get some and make a pot of tea. To my horror, I realized that we did not have any Throat Coat left. I drank some other herbal tea for the warmth and ordered some Throat Coat using my Amazon Prime next day delivery. Hurry up and get here! I like the taste and it is the best for soothing my throat and relieving laryngitis.<br /><br />I send this tea to my daughter so that she can have it when she gets a cold or sore throat.<br /><br />I appreciate the warnings about various medical conditions. They should also add that persons with certain cardiac arrythmias should be careful about consuming large quantities of this tea because licorice can act like a cardiac glycoside.<br /><br />I am a physician and have sometimes recommended this tea to patients. The very minor risks associated with licorice are less than the side effects of some over the counter cold remedies. Don't get me started about Sudafed. Humidifiers and nasal irrigation can also help when you have a cold.

review/text: The first time I tried this with a sore throat that felt like I was swallowing razor blades and I could not believe the difference that it made and the relief that I felt!  I bought the case because when someone is sick, the last thing anyone wants to do is go shopping and for some reason, my regular stores stopped carrying Throat Coat Tea.  This, in conjunction with Breathe Easy by Traditional Medicinals Box of 16 Bags are a must-have in the medicine cabinet!  The Throat Coat tea tastes nice as well and will keep your patient drinking fluids (also a good thing)!

review/text: I was buying organic foods and I was in the tea section. I saw this organic throat coat and figured I would give it a try. I was having a tonsillectomy procedure coming up. This tea was a huge relief for my sore throat after my tonsillectomy. It coated and soothed my throat big time. It helped make my throat feel relieved. I drank this tea after eating and before bedtime and it made a big difference in my throat feeling better. I am healing quite quickly and everyone was surprised I am talking and doing so well. I believe this tea made a difference.

review/summary: Great tasting tea and also does the job....
review/text: So many suffer from sore throats - due to allergy, common cold, overuse and other conditions. When you step in the drugstore or natural food store, there are many lozenges, tinctures, syrups and pills to chose from. Yes, some of them will nip your symptoms in the bud, or temporarily suppress them. For me, when I am feeling under the weather, I want a tea that not only gives me sweet relief, but, helps me heal. That is why I drink Traditional Medicinals Throat Coat. It is made with great ingredients, like organic licorice root, slippery elm bark, marshmallow root, cherry bark, bitter fennel fruit, cinnamon bark and sweet orange peel. The tea tastes delicious and really coats my throat in gentle herbal goodness.

review/text: A number of years ago, sick, miserable, various throat lozenges doing next to nothing I was at the store and picked this up out of stupid dizzy desperation.<br /><br />Good thing I did!  While this is not a cure, it is head and shoulders above any lozenge or spray and much longer lasting, your throat feels coated, soothed and protected.  Excellent to get you to sleep when the pain is that bad....and excellent to have on hand to start taking when the sore throat starts to begin with.  Be prepared and save yourself from having to travel to the store when you are sick.

review/text: I do a lot of singing at school and during the 2010 Fall & Christmas choral season a friend who is a professional vocalist recommended this to me before a big performance.  It is the best thing to hit my tea collection to date.<br /><br />The tea has a faint sweetness but primarily tastes of licorice root and slippery elm, but the taste grows on you after a while.  It does miracles for the throat.  After a mug of this stuff I am usually capable of hitting nice high notes that I would struggle to reach otherwise.  Last week I had a day with 6 hours of performance - with a mug of tea between each of the 3 performances, I was able to sing my heart out right through the last song.<br /><br />Mix it with honey, and you'll be good to go!  It tastes great and gives the vocal chords the support you could ever need if you use your voice professionally (singing or speaking).

review/summary: Like Pouring Liquid Velvet onto Your Sore Throat
review/text: I was introduced to Throat Coat tea several years ago by a friend. I've never been without it since. I'm lucky enough that I don't get many colds or sore throats, but when I do, I crave this tea. I should work for these people because I've sold tons of it to friends by giving them a cup when they're not feeling well.<br /><br />When you have a cold or sore throat, nothing feels better than this fabulous tea. It's very aptly named. I think it feels like my throat has been covered in velvet. You can definitely feel the 'coating' after just a few sips. When I get sick, I'll ususally drink about 3 cups per day. The soothing effects last quite a while and it's heaven when you're trying to sleep with a nasty cold. I've had friends who sing that swear by this tea before a performance, but I don't sing outside the shower myself. :D<br /><br />Nothing else on the market works as well, especially when sweetened with a little honey.  I depend so much upon this tea that I even brought it back with me to Mexico, where I live now. It's sitting in a canister, ready. I've stored this tea for as much as a year with no problem.  Knock wood, I haven't needed it yet this year, but it's comforting to know it will be there when I need it. :D

review/summary: Best thing I've ever used for a sore throat
review/text: Wow. Throat Coat tea is surprisingly effective. I tried it for the first time today, heeding a friend's enthusiastic recommendation.<br /><br />I might have given it a shot anyway although sometimes, I'm skeptical of natural treatments and home remedies. With an awfully sore and swollen throat though, I'm thankful my skepticism is unfounded here.<br /><br />I love the taste. Sweet, herbally as you'd expect, maybe even delicate? Not sure about the delicate part because I may be too congested to tell at the moment. But be warned - like other reviewers have said, stay away if you hate black licorice. I'm honestly not a huge fan of licorice yet actually enjoy the taste enough to drink even when I'm not feeling awful.<br /><br />I think the licorice is vital as it seems to have a menthol-like effect that really allows the heat in the tea to penetrate all those agonizingly, swollen throat tissues. It increases comfort when breathing and swallowing, far better than any throat lozenge I've ever tried and amazing enough to prompt me to make a review.<br /><br />Give it a shot the next time your throat feels too sore, too swollen, too dry, too full of sandpaper and razorblades to do anything but try not to swallow. A huge comfort during sickie times.

review/summary: Great results, but slight allergic reaction
review/text: The throat coat tea worked wonders for my seasonal congestion! The taste was a little off-putting, but it wasn't horrible.<br /><br />I was hoping to add this to my morning breakfast menu, but I noticed that I developed a rash of fine raised bumps on my neck after drinking this tea for three days. After reading the ingredients of the tea, the only ingredient that I've never used before is the slippery elm bark. Web MD states that slippery elm bark can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation, so this ingredient is the cause. I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't take a genius to make the connection here. I've stopped using the tea, and my rash has magically disappeared.<br /><br />Judging by all the five star reviews on this product, it's obvious that it works for a lot of people, but first time users of this product should be cautious when buying it for the first time.

I first tried my many types of cough drops, (cough cough), the loquat syrup, the cough suppressant...(cough cough).  Then I saw this in my cabinet (always gave to my kids when they have sore throats but never tried it myself since I don't really get colds that much).  Drank half a cup, calms throat, didn't cough all night (maybe 2-4 coughs).  It's a must for a cold!  I am impressed with this product.  Works better than lemon & honey which everyone saids is great but it never helped me with my cough, & the lemon acid actually stings the throat tissue a bit.  :)

review/summary: Sick
review/text: My husband and I bought this tea, from Nob Hill, with the purpose of gaining a health benefit. We thought that this would be a great product but for us, it was the opposite.<br />Both my husband and I got sick after trying this product for a few days. We had to see the doctor whom told us to stop using this immediately. We seem to be allergic or  have an adverse reaction. My throat hurt for about 5 days to the point where I had to sip water every 10 minutes to feel relief. My husband described his symptoms as feeling as if he had strep throat and I would describe my symptoms as burning throat and muscle spasms in my throat. I have discarded this product and will never use again. I wish that the outcome would have been different but for us, this was not our  "cup of tea".

review/summary: Made me and my girlfriend sick
review/text: I sing in a band and wanted some comfort for my throat before a show. My girlfriend and I both became sick and couldn't finish this tea.<br />We have bought many other teas from the same company and have been happy with them. Just a warning on this one.

review/summary: No after taste but a POOR value - mostly fiber "filler" & little stevia
review/text: Soooo Sweet Stevia powder - about 63 cents per serving (the container is mostly soluble fiber and very little stevia)<br />NuNaturals Stevia liquid - about 8 cents per serving<br />Kal Stevia powder - about 1.5 cents per serving - THIS IS THE BETTER BUY PLUS it comes in a niftly dispenser bottle with multiple settings and it's own personal dose-size spoon.<br /><br />All had NO aftertaste when thoroughly blended in my tea.  When using in milk for cereal I blended the stevia thoroughly in a glass of milk before pouring on my cereal and all were excellent.<br /><br />Soooo Sweet is comparable with Kal or NuNaturals (regular or alcohol free) stevias as far as having NONE of the bitter aftertaste like the grocery store brand stevias do.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the Soooo Sweet because it cost $10, came in a 75 gram tub - per the label has about 16 servings (a WHOPPING average 63 cents per serving) and has soluble fiber (I guess for a filler).<br /><br />Kal 1.3 grams (no fillers) for about $14 at my local health store has 905 servings - 57 TIMES MORE STEVIA THAN Soooo Sweet - & averages 1.5 cents per serving.  Its jar top has several settings for optional serving methods all the way from a fine sprinkle, heavier sprinkle or a large opening to pour or use a handy scoop that comes with it.<br /><br />The NuNaturals liquid 2 oz bottle was around $14 at my local health food store & provides 169 servings (about 8 cent per serving) PLUS - when the bottle is empty - I have an amber glass bottle with a glass dropper to use for my home made tinctures, herbal remedies, essential oils and such.<br /><br />I saved $4 with Soooo Sweet but got 889 LESS servings.  I'm curious . . . if the soluble fiber hadn't been "thrown in" just how much stevia I paid for?  If I knew I'd probably REALLY be P.O.'d

review/summary: Great for breakfast
review/text: These are tasty on their own but i especially like them crushed, tossed into some yogurt with some blueberries or bananas. The only problem with this is that even in bulk Amazon is expensive. When they are on sale it's usually 2 dollars per box so the equivalent quantity to what they offer here is 12 boxes which would be 24 dollars. Amazon is selling it for 33 dollars.

review/summary: Perhaps my favorite Nature Valley product so far, tasty oat flavor
review/text: Making oat bars is apparently a pretty hard thing to get right. Over the years I have tried a lot of different brands and they are often too dry, tasteless, or just plain bad tasting. But this is one good tasting whole grain (very nice that they use whole grain) oats bar.<br /><br />While you probably want to have some liquid available when you eat these they are not too dry. The taste is wholesome and flavorable. And they are not too sweet at all, just perfect for me, more of a hint of sweetness. Pretty good value as well, recommended.

review/summary: These are the best!
review/text: These granola bars are sooooo good! I eat them regularly as a quick breakfast and snack on them pretty frequently. Very tasty and reasonably healthy. And buying them in bulk from Amazon is very convenient. I wish I could have a neverending supply of these. I don't think I'll ever get tired of them. Highly recommended!!

review/summary: My family's favorite granola bar!
review/text: These bars have an amazing, mildy sweet and nutty flavor!  The bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day!  They've been around forever and I haven't found anything new that beats them yet!  The Oats N Honey is our family's favorite flavor!  We've tried others and always gone back to the true classic!  I usually purchase ours at the local grocery store, but I am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal.  Try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Very good granola bars
review/text: These bars are very good and tasty, with the right texture, and with delicious oatmeal with honey touches. They came as a surprise for me, as i'm used to eat the generic energetic bars from the vending machine at work, that usually taste like cardboard and corn syrup.<br /><br />These aren't like that. They are sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with the taste of honey being very perceptible. The bars aren't "honey golden" in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays, but I see that as a good thing, because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar, not honey. Very good bars, in general.

review/summary: Grant Snack Bars - Highly Recommended
review/text: These Nature Valley "Crunchy Granola Bars, Oats 'n Honey" are a tasty mid-afternoon snack and are filling enough to hold me over until dinner. These are, as the name suggests, very crunchy and can be a little messy (crumbs) when eating. Since these are somewhat dry, they also travel well in the heat or in a pocket.<br /><br />My kids will eat these in place of candy, which is another plus, but these are too hard for my wife who has sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Awesome snack
review/text: These are a great product.  I like them for a mid-morning snack.  They are wonderful for hiking or camping.  My college age son loves them and hits them first in his home-food-raids.  I buy them by the case using the Amazon Subscribe and save so the price is good.
