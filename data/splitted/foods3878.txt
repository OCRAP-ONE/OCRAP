review/summary: Not for long term use!
review/text: I just got a Mr Coffee Keurig type coffee machine.  My first cup, the Green Mountain wild blueberry.  I would say it's not for those who like strong strong coffee.  Tried it black just to see... eh, not so great.  Put in a splash of 2% milk and it tastes like I'm having a blueberry muffin with my coffee.  Am I in love with it, no.  Caramel and Pumpkin are my fave flavors but I do like this a lot and good to have to mix things up.  That's the point of a single serve machine, right?  For those who are bigger blueberry fans you might give it five stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: After about half the box I got bored of it.  As I am trying different flavors I don't think I will reorder this one.

review/summary: Green Mountain's Wild Mountain Blueberry Coffee
review/text: I was first hooked on Timothy's German Chocolate Cake. I received the Blueberry as a sampler.  I absolutely LOVE, LOVE THIS COFFEE!  It taste so good. It's not sweet, overpowering, just a great blend that makes you think you've just ate a fresh muffin. I really don't care to eat blueberries, but this is truly one great coffee!  I love Bold coffee, I.e., French Roast, Sumatran, Kenya. This coffee has the perfect blend.  I usually drink mine with French Vanilla Creamer.  My husband takes his black and doesn't drink flavored coffee, he did try it and was pleasantly surprised. If you like flavored coffee, give this a try, you will not be disappointed!

review/text: I'm a huge fan of flavored coffees and this one does not disappoint. Light roast that smells heavenly as it brews - just like a blueberry muffin baking - and has a great blueberry flavor that pairs perfectly with sweetener and creamer. This one is definitely a light roast but my sister (who drinks only the dark roast flavors usually) swears by it too. I have this one on constant rotation on my carousel.

review/summary: Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry,for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry,for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is an excellent medium brewed coffee.  I enjoy the "Wild Mountain Blueberry" flavor that compliments a blueberry bagel or fruit with breakfast.  Unlike some flavored coffees that claim to have flavor...I have found that "Green Mountain" pulls of the balance of richness, aroma, good taste and flavor.

review/summary: Love the taste, love the smell
review/text: The first thing that hits you when you brew this is the smell that closely resembles a blueberry muffin, with a ton of blueberries in it.  I am a cream user, so that sort of the dilutes the flavor a bit, it still tastes (and smells) quite good.  You can definitely make out the blueberry flavor still.  It tastes great, and has become my go-to flavor over doughnut shop and Puck's Breakfast in Bed.  This is a light roast coffee, so if you like a strong coffee flavor, you should look elsewhere.

review/text: I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan, but for some reason this one piqued my interest and I had to try it.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it smells incredible while brewing - very fresh and strongly blueberry scented, which honestly is a tiny bit offputting at first.  But from the first sip it isn't nearly as strongly flavored, and the scent settles down quickly. I will say that the first cup carried a slight artificial flavor, but I don't notice it now that I'm used to the flavor.<br /><br />I'm left thinking perhaps coffee - with it's natural berry/fruit flavor - is the perfect foil to blueberry, something I never thought I'd say.  It just has this deep, complex fruitiness that "goes" much better than I'd have imagined.<br /><br />For the moment, anyway, this has replaced my normal breakfast blend as my go-to cup.  Another thing I *never* thought I'd say... I might have to see if this comes in decaf (ugh, decaf?) because I am drinking entirely too much!

review/text: I thought it would be strange to put a berry flavor in coffee, and it turns out they didn't.  Like most flavors, its all in the fragrance, no difference in taste.<br /><br />It's a bit weaker than most of the other flavors, but still good.

review/summary: Blueberry flavored coffee?  Weird sounding, but one of the best K-Cup flavors I've found...
review/text: I must admit, like many others, that this sounds a little weird.  However, after trying this coffee months ago, it is one of the few K-Cup coffees that I will pay the premium price for.  Of course it brews like any other K-Cup, but the added aroma from the blueberries that it adds to the room is incredible.  In fact, they should make an air freshener out of this, but that's another category.<br /><br />The coffee has a good balance to it, and the added blueberry flavor is not just right.  I use a vanilla creamer and sweetener with my coffee, which may enhance the flavor, so I can't attenst to what this would be like if you drink your coffee black.  I also tend to make two 8 ounce cups from one K-Cup, brewing both into a small pot, and then dividing the coffee into separate cups, which makes for a good strength from this coffee.  I like a medium roast normally, and this holds up to that.<br /><br />Although you're not going to get a full serving of fruit with this coffee, you will wake up a little faster when you smell this coffee in the mornings.  I like many flavored coffees, but find a few that I don't like, but this is one that seems to appeal to most when they smell the blueberries.  My recommendation, give it a try...

review/summary: Wild Blueberry Coffee
review/text: I have been wanting to try this flavor since I first got my Keurig coffee machine.<br />I wasn't disappointed.  It smells like blueberries and you can really taste the blueberries in the coffee.  It's a very natural good flavor, not sweet or artificial at all.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this brand of Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry coffee!<br />Angie

review/summary: Wow is this good!!
review/text: I have been wanting to try this for a while but have put it off thinking that it might have an artificial taste or that the blueberry is just a little weird with coffee.  But WOW was I wrong.<br /><br />This coffee is absolutely delicious!!  I love it with a splash of vanilla coffee-mate in it.  It has a sweetness to it, with a hint of blueberry with a really perfect blend of coffee that isn't too strong or too weak.  It's just right!  Kind of reminds me of a blueberry muffin or blueberry waffle or something - but without it having an over powerful blueberry taste.<br /><br />With the fall weather it has been an excellent morning choice, along with the perfectly pumpkin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHGP72">Timothy's World Coffee Perfectly Pumpkin, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> which also very tasty!  Love the fall/winter weather to experiment with these flavors!  Go ahead and try it, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was!

review/summary: Different, and GREAT, Coffee
review/text: I'm a big fan of Green Mountain coffee, and the blueberry flavor has been one of my favorites for a while. These K-cups have the same great taste that I know and love from the fresh ground version.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is in no way dominating. It gives on a great sweet aroma and has an excellent coffee flavor with a hint of blueberry aftertaste. If you're unsure about the flavor, I would suggest trying it at a coffee shop or cafe before buying the entire K-cup pack, but if you're up for trying something different (or you know you love the flavor), this is a great buy.

review/summary: Blueberry coffee?? Oh, yes ma'am!!
review/text: Echoing several other reviewers here - we were so skeptical about trying Wild Mountain Blueberry coffee and now that we've run out, both my husband and I miss it.  It was such a pleasant surprise, as we generally don't drink that much flavored coffee. As the coffee is brewing, it gives off a strong blueberry scent, and the taste of the coffee doesn't disappoint. My husband usually takes a bold roast in the morning for his first cup of coffee. He liked having a cup of blueberry as his second cup, kind of like "dessert." I had a couple cups a week. I agree with another reviewer who said its possible to have too much of a good thing. For that reason, I will wait a little while before getting our next box but not too long.

review/summary: Incrediblely Great food with great results.
review/text: I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.<br />  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning.

review/summary: Great Product, But Not In Stores Anymore.  Too Pricey Online.
review/text: I had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.) for many, many years, mostly as my secret ingredient for marinades.  Not anymore.<br /><br />About 2 and a half years ago, McCormick sold its Season-All line to Morton, the Pepper Season-All having a UPC of 024600017558, for the 5.75 oz. plastic jar.  As I was on my last jar, but hadn't seen the McCormick product in any stores for sometime, I contacted McCormick and they told me Season-All was now under the Morton label. I looked in every grocery I stopped at between Seattle and Spokane and could not find this product anywhere.  I asked manager after manager if they were going to get any in, but they checked and said no.  I had that UPC memorized, much to their surprise.  Go figure.<br /><br />Then, one day at a Wal-Mart, I found it in their spice section and bought the 3 jars they had left.  I believe I paid $2.38 per jar.  That was the first and ONLY time I have seen it in a store ANYWHERE.  When I asked a manager at the same Wal-Mart when they were getting another shipment in, he said he didn't know, as it was out of his control.  I asked if I could request they special order it, but he said no.  So much for that.<br /><br />It was available on the Morton website (and still is), and even though a 2-pack is reasonable at $7.58, shipping costs are ridiculous.  They want $10.44 for FedEx Home delivery (6-10 business days) and $23.12 for FedEx 2nd Day delivery, which shows as arriving in 3 -7 business days.  Crazy!<br /><br />Now on Amazon, there a re a few ordering options, but this one takes the cake.  $16.99 for 1 5.75.oz. jar, but free Prime Shipping, which I have.  Or, even worse, a 6-pack for $89.99 (Free Prime Shipping) or $79.99 ($19.99 Shipping).  The latter 2 are actually cheaper overall than the one for $16.99, but you get the picture.<br /><br />What the heck are these guys smoking?<br /><br />So, I contnue my search for anothe alternative.  Today, I found something that just might work.  McCormick's new Perfect Pinch.  It has Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Peppers, no MSG and looks like it could be pretty good.  I'll use it in a marinade this weekend.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If you find any Pepper Season-All in a store, buy it and try it, you won't be dissappointed!

review/text: Black Licorice Scottie Dogs are GREAT!  I grew up thinking that licorice was "awful" and "disgusting" until the day I tried the wonderful black licorice Scottie Dogs.  I could not believe that I liked licorice; I mean I REALLY LIKE IT.  I went to the candy store and bought a little of every kind of licorice available.  When I would travel, I would do the same thing.  I tried anise product to compare the difference in flavor.  I found that most licorice has molasses which is absolutely NOT for me.  I continue to judge some licorice as "awful" and "disgusting"; I always came back to these wonderful black dogs.  There is something really refreshing, like spearmint is to me, about these licorice dogs.  I say, "Don't give up on licorice until you have tried these black dogs."

review/summary: The Best and most safe
review/text: My husband has always loved black licorice, but so many brands have artificial flavors. I discovered the Scottie Dogs at TJ Maxx and would buy every bag I could find, but suddenly they stopped carrying them. I was glad to find them through Amazon as we had checked at every candy store. Not only is this a true licorice, it is also soft and not sticky. One time a piece of sticky licorice pulled off a cap. Additionally, the flavor lasts longer than others. My husband sings and depends on Scotties to soothe his throat before a performance.

review/summary: The best little scotty-dogs ever!
review/text: I purchased my Scottie Dog Licorice mainly because they sold it in a 5-lb bag and I could share them with friends for the holidays. I thought that since I got such a large quantity in one bag the flavor would be dulled down somewhat. Oh how wrong I was! These little dogs were so fresh I couldn't stop eating them! The flavor of the Anise in this licorice is so good, it's almost addicting! I will not buy from any company for my little scottie dogs but this one. They have QUALITY candy and fresh like it was just made! What a treat! I confess...I only gave 2 little sandwich bags away...and if one weren't my mother it would have been only one...and I endulged the rest...They were almost too good! I love them! If you are in doubt of who to make your purchase from...seek no more! Right here is where you need to buy from!

review/summary: My Cats LOVE These!
review/text: My 3 cats, including my youngest who doesn't like seafood (but loves to play in water!), LOVE these. I can't go to the cabinet without all 3 of them following me, meowing for these treats!<br /><br />And they're healthy because they're mostly air. So, my guys get this treat just about every evening. Buy them - Your cat(s) will love them, too. BTW, these were reviewed/tested by either Cat Fancy or Catnip magazine (where I first heard about them), and they got 5 stars because all of the test cats loved them.

review/text: This is the only type of treat my cat will eat!  I was so happy to find a large size because you can usually only buy the tiny containers in pet stores.  The 1 oz. is a better bargain.  My cat prefers this over Kitty Caviar, and it smells a lot fresher.  This is high quality healthy treat for any cat.

review/summary: Surprised that my cats don't like these
review/text: When I buy a 5 star item from Amazon, it is always a good product. In this case, the product may be just fine quality wise, but for some reason my cats hate these flakes. Of the two cats, when presented with the flakes - one gave me a "are you stupid" look and the other one gave me a "why did you do this to me" look. Both of the cats like all other cat treats and are not picky eaters. Don't know why they don't like these, both of them go nuts for seafood. Given that all the other reviews are very positive, perhaps I got a bad batch of flakes and it is just an aberration, but both cats are very much "Do Not Want!" on these flakes.

review/summary: A little messy, but well worth it.
review/text: The flakes are dry so don't worry about the messy part, it vacums up easily if your cat doesn't get it all up. This treat will get them to run to you when you open the container. It's amazing. I was skeptical, but my cat just loves it. It is fine to sprinkle on top of dry or wet food or just serve it up by itself (but I would use a bowl). My cat is 12 and being older and sort of set in her routine and diet I was a little concerned that this treat would be a waste of money but I was proven wrong. She just eats it up. I give it to her as a treat once a day, in a bowl, lol, and she is quite happy with that arrangement.

review/text: I bought this on a lark, not expecting a big response from my cats. They absolutely love it!<br />I thought they might not like the dry, tissue-thin texture, but they seem to enjoy licking it up. They beg for more, and I suspect it is spoiling them from wanting to eat their super-healthy crunchies that I serve after their super-fine meat course (yes, I know, I know..) I recommend this treat, and now think that the price is fair.

review/summary: A big hit with my kittens
review/text: I searched Amazon for a natural treat for my kittens, without the additives in most of the more common cat treats, and I came across Cat-Man-Doo.  I was pleased that they both love the bonito flakes.  I had them spayed recently, and this was a great treat for them while they recovered, encumbered by those pitiful cone collars.<br /><br />I don't like seafood myself, and I typically find the odor very unpleasant.  Many reviewers commented on the pungent odor of these flakes, but it was not bad at all for me.<br /><br />I noticed the product description does not include the nutritional information, so I'll add it here:<br /><br />76% min. crude protein<br />3% min. crude fat<br />1% max. crude fiber<br />12% max. moisture (I guess that's a fancy way of saying "water")<br />.35% min. taurine

review/text: The product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it. However, Cat-Man-Doo or "Bonito Flakes" as the Japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on Amazon, there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here. You can also find this at your local Korean/Japanese grocer in big bags that last months.

review/text: This is by far my cat's favorite treat.  He even know where they are in the cabinet and opens the door and pulls the container out.  I give him a few flakes a day, so the container lasts more than a month and at least I know it's fish and not anything processed and not high in calories.  Highly recommend this for any cat.  Only downside is there is a strong fish odor but it doesn't linger.

review/summary: 4 stars only because you can buy this MUCH cheaper from an asian grocer
review/text: These are great.<br /><br />My cat is totally in love with them.  She just waits patiently for them.  They are very healthy!  Also her fur has become so soft that she feels like velvet, like a soft bunny!  so much so that everyone that pets her is amazed.  This stuff is great, very healthy, very good for her.  I'd much rather give her this then some "wiskas" or something treat of questionable health benefits :x at least this is natural.  :)<br /><br />and as I said in the title, the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because its sort of a rip off... if you go to a asian grocer and get Bonito Flakes (or Katsuboshi) you will pay much less, and its probably fresher and better quality, as it is intended for human consumption then.  :x

review/text: All I have to do is say "Bonito" and both my 10 month old kittens are beside themselves with excitement - apparently this treat is to them like double fudge peanut butter ice cream is to me.  I heartily recommend this product.  It's a little pricey but goes a looooong way and is totally worth it watching the kits eagerly chomp it down.  One of my kittens will not have anything to do with any other kind of treat (she's pretty food fussy too) so it's nice to find something she likes so well.

review/text: This product is amazing for several reasons:<br />1) Our 5 indoor cats LOVE this stuff - cannot keep enough of it in the house.<br />2) Product stays in the large ribbons therefore, each cat can have a nice<br />crunchy piece for a nightly snack. There isn't a lot of shaving residue<br />left in the bottom when the cannister is empty. I feel like I get my<br />money's worth of quality product.<br />3) It's healthy - you know what's going into your cat's body.  Ever<br />read the ingredients on a bag of manufacturered cat treats? Garbage. Switch<br />to Bonito flakes and you'll keep unhealthy unnatural chemicals out of your cat's body.

review/text: Our cat can be finicky, even with treats.  The first time she tasted this, she didn't seem that excited and even left some on the plate. Ever since however, she meows as soon as she sees the container, and it's the only treat she will actually sit up for or try to grab from our hands. Her only complaint is that it can be diffiult for her to gobble down the shavings.  She wishes it came in chunk form. Definitely 4 paws up!

review/text: I have 2 cats.  One is of the garbage disposal variety. She will eat anything. Even inedible things that she later spits out. They other is finicky. Extremely so. In the years they have been getting treats, this is the only one that gets an equal reaction from both. They *love* the Bonito flakes. I don't feed them to them daily, but they are the occasional treat.<br /><br />I have them in a high cabinet, as I know they would get to them on their own if they could. This is exactly what I think a treat should be, heathy, light and something special.

review/text: No other cat treats have been more effective at turning my 3 sweet, fussy little adopted kitties into crazed, psycho banshees!  As soon as I open the top of the container of Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Flakes I can hear the stampede coming from every corner of the house.  These lightweight flakes are delicate and almost float in the air, but the fishy smell can rock your socks and with a cats sensitive nose, they waste no time trampling over each other to get to the goodies.  All I can say is it's every man for himself! But use caution and don't overload your kitty with too much protein - just a few flakes a day is all I allow, no matter how long they sit there glaring at me with their most threatening stink-eyes...I know they love me.

review/summary: Cat crack!
review/text: We've stopped calling this Bonito and now refer to it as 'cat crack'. Our cats are crazy about it! One of them will go to the cabinet and cry and paw for more. We don't ever let them out of the house as we live in a remote area where they run the risk of becoming part of the food chain so when they get past us at times we no longer have to chase them to bring them back. All we have to do is say "bonito" and they'll run right back inside for it. So easy it almost makes us feel guilty.
