review/summary: Brewed for donut shop coffee lovers--will you like it?
review/text: This coffee was blended, according to Starbucks, to be more mellow, brighter blend of coffee, and it seems to be generally high in South American coffees such as Columbian and Brazilian. These coffees are very aromatic and rather acid. This blend, however, seeks to achieve the smoothness of a donut-shop or diner type coffee, a general American blend and at the same time, retain some of the darker qualities of Starbucks. So it's not a LIGHT roast, it's a medium roast and still somewhat robust, but very smooth.<br /><br />The coffee is said to have overtones of nuts and cocoa, and I can definitely taste that. The blend is more acidic than I prefer. It is not as dark as the Sumatra or my particular favorite, the French roast. It is definitely brighter.<br /><br />If you like a more acidic, more typical "diner" coffee, this blend will please you. For me, I prefer the European style dark roasts and more of the African or Indonesian flavors to Central or South American. So I don't particularly care for it. But it has been a success, bringing a more middle American flavor to the market.

review/summary: Great Full Bodied Taste
review/text: I am a coffee aficionado, and as time has gone on, I find I prefer a stronger taste in my coffee.<br />I have tasted every kind of coffee, but find I always go back to Starbucks. Pike Place Roast has<br />become my favorite. Sometimes I alternate between Sumatra and Pike Place, but Pike Place wins out<br />every time! It has a taste of cocoa, with roasted nuts in its flavor. It has a smooth finish with<br />soft acidity. This has become the roast I have, all the time. Satisfying with enough depth and<br />flavor to please.<br /><br />I have been tempted at times to buy a Keurig type coffee maker, but discovered that I would be paying<br />on average $50 a pound for the coffee found in those little Keurig cups. The price for a pound of<br />Pike Place Roast is $12.99.<br /><br />I found this recipe for making good coffee from Starbucks a few years ago, and this is the one I use<br />'til this day.<br /><br />Recipe for great coffee<br /> 1.Use cold, filtered water and a clean machine.<br /> 2.Grind beans just before brewing: *Course for coffee press<br />*Medium for automatic drip<br /><br />3.Measure 2 tbsp (10 g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.<br /><br />To help preserve that fresh flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in the bag.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-11-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605292885">Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071477845">The Starbucks Experience: 5 Principles for Turning Ordinary Into Extraordinary</a>

review/summary: BEWARE!  THIS IS NOT THE SAME COFFEE THAT IS PICTURED HERE
review/text: The coffee pictured here is the DARK ROAST that was sold in their first store in 1971, and is still being sold in the Starbuck stores today.  The coffee that I received is the MEDIUM ROAST.  There is a vast difference.  The packaging mine came in had a rendering of a Starbucks store in UT Burnt Orange on a white background on the front and the left side of the package was solid Burnt Orange with the three different roasts listed:  Blonde, Medium and Dark.  On the front was the Starbucks logo in green and white and beneath that in large Burnt Orange letters:  MEDIUM ROAST.  This obviously is not the dark roast that is sold in the stores and pictured here.  It is just flat, very bitter coffee.  I have a package of ground Pike Place coffee in my freezer right now that was purchased at a Starbucks store for $13 and change.  It looks exactly like the package pictured here and it tastes entirely different. I could only take a sip or two of the coffee I received - it is very bitter.  There is no hint of almonds or chocolate.  Amazon says this cannot be returned, but I received something that was different from what I ordered and what is pictured and I would like a refund or a replacement.  If Amazon corects this mistake, I will update this review.<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE 1.8.12<br /><br />I spoke with Amazon Customer Service and they graciously agreed to either refund my money or send a replacement.

review/summary: Cha Ching! The FIRST THING you want to have in the morning!
review/text: CONFESSION: I am a 100% Starbuck-A-Holic, I have no desires to see help from withdrawals or cravings of Starbucks nor do I desire to participate in SA (Starbucks Anonymous). Nevertheless, I have been having a horrendous time finding Starbucks Pike Place which is a Medium Roast - Ground Coffee. They have other Medium Roasts, but I don't want that; I want the Pike Place Medium Roast...<br /><br />I love it so much, that one does not need to use so much, and I must be crazy, for I keep my Specialties (Coffee) in the Freezer (they keep fresh and crisp); Pike Place is neither bitter, yet maintains Starbucks' known bold richness and taste. This is one reason why I am just so addicted to Pike Place and enjoy it in the mornings as a Hot Coffee or as an Iced Coffee during a hot summer day. I do admit I do get tired of Southern Iced Tea and Water because I drink so much of it; so it is refreshing! If you've never had Iced Coffee before ... you're in for a real treat, there are many recipes online available such as Food Network that will teach you how to make one with no alcohol (that I drink) and there there are those with alcohol (that I do not drink).<br /><br />It's nearly summertime - why not try out for a nice spin with Starbucks making it into an Iced Coffee for a change?

review/summary: Wrong coffee sent; order history later changed
review/text: As two other reveiwers have experienced (as of 19 April 2012), I received an Amazon order of the Medium Roast vice the Dark Roast that was pictured at the time of the order.  Shame on me; I read one of them prior to my purchase, but dismissed it as something unlikely to happen again, to me.  Since then the product description and picture have been changed reflecting what I received, both on the item page and in my order history.  I find the fact that my order history doesn't reflect what I ordered troublesome.<br /><br />I am currently overseas (FPO box), limited in coffee options, and wasn't perturbed enough to contact Amazon about this.  I am overall greatly pleased with my track record with Amazon, and especially the Free Super Saver to FPO boxes and typical 1-week delivery.<br /><br />On to the coffee.  My daily consumption is 3 mugs in the morning and maybe an afternoon pick-me-up.  My favorite standard is in-shop, perfectly brewed Dunkin Donuts.  Black.  I enjoy the complexity of most Starbucks, but find them on the verge of being too bold for a staple.  Or maybe it's the prices.  I do buy a bag every now and then, though.  I have mixed success brewing grounds or beans in hopes of recreating what you get in the shop.  Large (BJ's, COSTCO) bags are usually stale mud two thirds of the way down, so I won't buy those any more despite the bulk discount.<br /><br />I purchased this because PP Dark (what I thought I was getting) is my favorite in-shop Starbucks.  This PP Medium is pretty good, although I've had less than usual success in making the correct brew.  Huge improvement over Folgers or Maxwell House, a notch above Eight O'Clock (which is always very good compared to the price), but well shy of my best home recreations of shop coffee (to include successful Dark Pike's Place attempts).  I suppose I am comparing it to what I expect from Starbucks (BOLDness), and this has much less bite.  Definitely cheaper/better than what I can get locally, though.<br /><br />Bottom line:  3.49 stars for pretty good Starbucks coffee at a good price.  I'm trying to not figure the misrepresentation into the rating of the product.

review/summary: Probably my favorite
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee but I am very price conscious and hate paying $1.50+ on a single cup of coffee in the morning.  I also want coffee within about five minutes of waking up so it doesn't work to go to a Starbucks store every morning. My solution has been to brew a pot at home and then I am able to get a sip within minutes of heading into the kitchen and my husband fills a thermos to take to work.  It has been a perfect solution for us.  Because I brew 8 cups of Starbucks coffee every single morning (even take it with us when travelling to visit family) we have had a lot of opportunity to try a variety of blends.  We buy the 12 oz bag each time so we an opportunity to have it for about two weeks at a time -- really getting to know whether we like it or not.<br /><br />Over the years, I have discovered that my favorite is this Pike Place (medium roast).  We do trade off and the other ones we drink regularly are the French Roast, Espresso Roast, and the Christmas Blend when it is in season.  Any time I have been drinking one of those roasts (which I really like as well) and then come back to this one, I realize just how MUCH I like this one.  It's flavorful without being bitter and just seems perfectly balanced in every way.  I use one flat scoop of coffee per cup and that is just the right amount for us.  I also found that when in need of a decaffinated coffee for entertaining in the evening, the Pike Place is also my favorite decaf coffee.  What is really great is that if I have left over decaf I can blend it with the regular (75% regular and 25% decaf) and it doesn't go to waste.<br /><br />If you are trying to watch your budget and save some money without giving up flavor, brewing at home is definitely an option.  It works for us and this coffee is wonderful!

Great price.

review/summary: A Good Morning Brew
review/text: After having tried a couple of cups from a Starbucks franchise (each was luke warm and had grounds in it) I vowed I would never drink another cup of their coffee. Don't know which of their products I had been given, but they were lousy, so back to DD and MickeyD. While looking over the myriad of selections in the grocery store I picked up the Pike Place Roast and read the description. Sounded like what I like in a coffee and I knew at least it would be hot and not have grounds. Sprang for a bag and have not been disappointed. I don't like a coffee that knocks you off the chair in the morning . . . nice aroma, good flavor and just the right strength. If they keep making this, I will keep drinking it. Just for fun, I'm old enough to remember when you really could get a "pound" of coffee, not 12 ounces!

review/text: How you feel about Pike Place may be relative to how you feel about Starbuck's policy.<br /><br />Years ago you would walk into Starbucks, at least right outside New York City, where I am based, and each week there was another type of coffee being made. A lot of these, Sululasi, Africa, New Gunnua Peaberry, for example, you don't see anymore.<br /><br />Starbucks has made Pike their centerpiece. Usually they brew this and a bold, say Gold Coast, in the morning, and then only Pike at night. Pike Place was the first Starbucks Store that opened in Seattle in 1971.<br /><br />And it is a good workman's cup of coffee: far more bold and flavorful than Maxwell House or any non gourmet brew. It has a distinct coffee bean flavor without the loud nuances of a Verona or the French Roast.<br /><br />That is the problem I have with Pike Place. I am not sure if they are trying for more mass appeal--trying to get the truck driver who goes to the Quick Check into Starbucks by making a more mainstream blend---or if they are trying to save money after their stock price crashed in 2008.<br /><br />(I owned it, and I can't tell you that story because there are too many  words you can't say on Amazon. From 36 to seven--KERPLUNK. I won't go into how the tractor mower was involved)<br /><br />Either way, this is my least favorite of the Starbucks blends. And the best coffee any Starbucks Virgin will ever taste.

If you're into hot salsa, this one is just a little hotter that, say the one sold at Trader Joe's, but you can hardly tell the difference. Bottom line is it's a good enough salsa, my concern is that it's not fantastic, and specially not worth the $10 (with shipping) for 16oz.

review/summary: Good formula and a great deal
review/text: My two sons have both been brought up on Nestle Good Start with DHA & ARA.  After the first three types of formula made my first son throw up all the time (Similac, Enfamil, and Similac Lactose-free), our doctor suggested Good Start and we've had much better luck.  There must be something to that whole "Comfort Proteins" label on the can.<br /><br />As for people complaining about the price, I don't know how they do their math.  We've bought cans of this stuff from Wal-Mart and Target, and Amazon is cheaper by dollars, not cents.  Here are my tips:<br /><br />1: You love Amazon, so sign up for Amazon Prime.  You'll get the formula in two days without paying shipping.  This eliminates people's claims that shipping makes it more expensive than Wal Mart and people's complaints that it takes four months (which is a problem with Amazon Grocery early in its genesis, not a problem with the formula itself).<br /><br />2: Use the Grocery3 or other $10 off promo code while you can.  This, combined with Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping, makes the cost of each can of formula less than $22 with no sales tax.  Maybe if you live in Oregon and don't have sales tax and your local Target or Wal Mart for a goof drops the price to lower than $22 and you happen to live next door to Wal Mart and don't have to drive there, wait in line, and drive home, you can beat the price.<br /><br />In summary, this is good formula that lives up to its claim about being easier on babies' stomachs, and if you work the system, it's cheaper to have it delivered to your doorstep than to go fight the crowds at your local superstore.

review/summary: Great formula, good price
review/text: I tried this formula after switching from Similac.  My son was first started on Similac Advance at the hospital, and tolerated it well until week 2 when he became so constipated we had to give him a suppository per his pediatrician.  We tried Enfamil Gentlease, and he seemed to hate it right from the start, then after remembering my cousin rave about this formula with her daughter, we tried the Good start.  I wish I had started him off with this from the beginning.  He immediately drank it down, unlike the Gentlease which he wouldn't even take more then a few sucks of.  He tolerated it so well, and the constipation was gone.  He was still gassy a bit, as all babies seem to be, but nothing excessive like before.  For a few weeks he was still a bit fussy when having a bowel movement, but again, it was such a drastic improvement from where we had been prior.  As time went by his stools became easier to pass, and now there is no fussing at all.  The preparation is easy.  You simply add the powder to water and shake.  There had been different directions on some older cans with boiling water then adding the powder, but that has since been replaced with the simple, add powder to water and shke version.  THere are far fewer bubbles after shaking then the other formula's I have tried (Similac, Enfamil) and the clumping is minimal.  Simply take a spoon etc.. to break up clumps.  The smell is tolerable too, and is much better then the other formula's I have smelled.  The price is good as well.  Babies r us seems to have the cheapest price at around $20 a can, but other stores like Kmart, Target etc... seem to come in around $23 a can and drug stores (not recommended) come in highest at $25-26 a can.  I have actually found grocery stores to be cheaper then independent drug stores for the formula, but by the far babies r us has the cheapest price.

review/summary: Caused horrible constipation
review/text: I'm sure it just depends on your child and their needs. We originally were using Similac but had to go on WIC and were put on Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus. Immediately he started having horrible constipation and hard bowels. We had to put juice in the formula just to keep him regular and it was always a balancing act, especially once he started solids. Recently we were once again able to pay for formula and switched back to similac. Immediately he was regular again, irregardless of being on solids. So for some this may be great, but if your child has  constipation on it, you may just try a different brand formula, not necessarily switching to soy or a specialty kind.

She would suck on the bottle a little and then just cry and cry then take a little more bottle and scream and that's how her feedings went.  We tried different bottles, different positions in feeding her, burped her after every ounce, used gas drops, on and on.  Her pediatrition recommended we not change her again just yet because the Gentlease was specifically for gassy babies with tummy troubles.<br /><br />Finally I decided that we HAD to change formulas because this wasn't normal.  I got online and found Nestle GoodStart and read so many wonderful and positive reviews about it that we immediately went out and bought a can.  THANK YOU NESTLE FOR CREATING SUCH AN AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!  Immediately I could tell a difference and within a week she was a new baby.  It was night and day.  She stopped getting tummy aches all together and feedings were so much more enjoyable for the both of us.  She is 5 months old now and we still buy Nestle GoodStart.  When we have our next child I plan on breastfeeding for a little bit again and then starting her on formula.  I will tell the hospital to keep their free samples of Enfamil and will use Nestle Goodstart.

review/summary: Finally found what I was looking for!!!
review/text: I would like to start out by saying that I am a first time mom but I am also a mother baby nurse. I thought by having so much experience I will know exactly what my baby needed.The hospital that I work for has a contract with similac and by being used to similac I decided to try it first. We only use formula for supplementing breastmilk.After 1 week my baby became gassy and ucomfortable, I decided to try similac sensitive which was better but my baby was still fussy and gassy. We decided to ask our ped about soy, He was not for soy since our baby is a boy, he said that soy formula has estrogen and research has not been done yet if early introduction to estrogen hormones to little boys will have any side effects in the future. We decided against it and did not want to risk it. He did however recommend good start gentle plus due to the comfort proteins and we decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you how much of a difference the right formula makes. Within a day he slept better, had regular bms and was overall a much happier baby. He still has a little gas but passes it without any pain, which is normal. I know that every baby is different but you do have to keep on trying, and Good Start is worth a try. Just a FYI, my walmart sells the 25.7 oz cans for 19.57. which comes out 120.00 for 6 cans, a lot less than on amazon.

review/summary: AWESOME formula - thank you Good Start!
review/text: We started our daughter on Similac Advance and she did OK with that (and breast milk) for about a month.  After that, the Similac Advance would cause her to have a lot of gas and spit up problems.  By spit up, I mean throwing up her entire bottle.  We switched to Similac Allimentum which is terribly expensive and smelled like cheezits.  When I weaned off breastfeeding we decided to try a few other formulas that were more reasonably priced.  Similac Sensitive smelled terrible and Good Start smelled not bad for formula, so we tried that first.  And we LOVE IT!<br /><br />The Good Start Gentle Plus seems so much easier for her to digest than any of the other formulas that we tried.  (We did also try Enfamil Lipil and she threw that all up, too!)  My daughter is ten months old and has been eating this formula along with some solid foods exclusively for the past 4 months.  She is  she much happier than when she was on the Similac.  It smells much better, it's actually white and not brown... and it's much more affordable.<br /><br />Thank you Good Start for making such a great product!  You have saved us lots of money and most importantly have saved our daughter lots of tummy aches and sleepless nights!

review/summary: Love this formula and love the shipping!
review/text: This is the second child upon which I have used this formula, and it's great.  My first son had a real sensitive stomach when we went from nursing to formula, and the formula I used with my daughter did not work for him.  So we tried GoodStart and it instantly made a difference in his gas issue.  So with our second son we didn't even question using something else, we went straight for GoodStart.  As it turns out Amazon sells it for a dollar or two less than the store.<br />And I love the shipping, we live in a pretty rural area and to get to a big named store is an hour drive.  Which with the cost of gas that's a trip we don't often take, so we signed up for Amazon Prime strictly because we could have formula delivered in two days- free!  For me and my family this has been a win-win situation.

review/summary: What a difference!!!!
review/text: My 7 month old daughter would spit up (vomit) 45 minutes to an hour after a bottle.  The doctor changed her formula from Enfamil Lipil to Enfamil Gentlease.  It did help with her fusiness, but no help with the spit up.  Two days ago I was on Amazon reading the reviews of this formula and thought I had nothing to lose.  I started her on it and so far her spit up problem has been cured.  I am amazed at the change in her and wished I had known about this formula when my son was born because he too had the same problem. This has been a lifesaver.

review/text: Excellent product.  My daughter has triplets.  One of the boys had problems with spit up.  After trying all the Similac and Enfamil products, she switched to Good Start which she had used for her older daughter.  Within days there was improvement, within about 2 weeks, his problem was gone.  All three babies are thriving on Good Start.  Price is also excellent.  The only way we get it cheaper than Amazon (with Prime) is when it is occasionally on sale.

review/summary: Awesome Buy
review/text: This is a great way to save.  My husband and I have three children ages 6 yrs, 4 yrs, and 3 months.  I had started out breastfeeding but had complications with the baby latching on.  So we started buying her formula 2 months ago.  The Hospital had given us samples when we had her, so we tried the type before we bought any. What a great transition she had and this formula seems not to mess her system up.  We were buying 10 of the regular size cans a month, which are priced at $14 a piece in store.  Plus the gas to get to there and time it takes to get all three children in car and store is way more that what this item cost with two day shipping.  We shopped online, and this is the cheapest we found.  I loved Amazon before, but now I love it even more because I only have to do a limited amount of baby food shopping for her solid foods.

I gave the product 2 stars because it had 2 pluses: the formula did taste similar to milk and does not foam up very much. The product just didn't work for our baby. I am trying Mom to Mom generic brand instead to see if it helps with his constipation. The generic brands are much cheaper anyway.

review/summary: Finally a formula that worked
review/text: My LO was breastfed for the first two months, but then we switched to formula. Everything made him incredibly fussy, and our doctor suggested Nutramigen. It was a miracle worker, and he was happy. He was on this for months, but without a true protein allergy, it was hard to keep paying $63 a week for Nutramigen. We tried every formula on the planet, and this was the only one that worked great. I will say when weaning from one formula to another-- go very slow. I've heard so many different things and that you don't have to go slow, but it's the only way that worked for us. We mixed an ounce or two of the Good Start in with his Nutramigen the first week, the second week did half/half, the third week did mostly Good Start with 1 or 2 ounces of Nutramigen. He never had a problem. I will say, this price is not a very good deal-- I can get it at my local Target or Walmart for $20 a can, and sometimes I can find the 33% more free cans.

review/summary: Good Start = Great Formula
review/text: My son, started off in the NICU, so he was introduced to Similac Advanced at the hospital. Since that time, my son was primarily breast fed, but when I had a low supply, I would use Similac Advanced. He would push the nipple of the bottle out as soon as he realized he was drinking Similac. I then tried supplementing with Enfamil Gentlease, which was slightly better, but he would still push the nipple out after a couple of ounces of Enfamil. I tried Gerber Good Start Gentle+ and he drank the first bottle, with little to no objection. I started supplementing with this formula more often. His spit up is limited to following a big burp. I no longer pump and he is a healthy 6 months, 16lbs, and 26". I buy this in bulk at my local Tom Thumb grocery. If you purchase more than one the price is $19.99 instead of $24.99 and they often have $3 off coupons you can use in addition! This is the formula to buy!!

review/text: I switched from Similac to Good Start when my son was 2 momth old because of the recent recall and my son's worsening reflux. I tried other brands too, but my friend recommended it since her son with reflux benefitted from Good Start.  So far it's been good. It has very little foam unlike Costco's brand and it mixes well. The special gentle whey protein must be helpful;  my son burps fast and digests well. No foul smell.  Now's he grew out of reflux.  The only thing I don't is how i need to punch out the formula scoop out of this circular plastic shape and the lid doesn't have the scoop holder to keep it dry and away from touching the formula.  But, my husband and I are careful and it's only a mere inconvenience.

Fortunately it happens to be more affordable than most of the other formulas, as well.  Mixing the formula thoroughly can take a while, though.  I found that if I mix all the powder I need for a bottle with only half of the water at first, and then add the rest of the water, that it mixes faster and more completely.

review/summary: I think clearly that Good Start formula is the best on the market!
review/text: This is my story... Maybe a little long, but it was hard to me to spend time (away from screaming child) to looking for such information.<br /><br />My baby is almost 3 months. I BF him but supplement with formula. We started with Similac Advance because my sister brought to me one can before i gave a birth. . After about 3 weeks, my son started has a problems with digesting. It was terrible to watch him how he is pushing and crying almost 24 hours a day. Certainly, it was not because of BF, so I decided to change the formula and our doctor gave me Nutramegin Lipil and Good Start Protective and told me that it has easy-to-digest protein, so I gave it to try. My baby hated Nutramegin immediately! He kicked the bottle over the room by one hand ))) My mom told me: "Don't worry! The baby will use to it". I think that word "use to it" suppose to use when baby, for example, has a diagnose (real allergy or something else medical), so the way the baby like or dislike some kind of formula doesn't matter because he/she needs (must) to eat it. Today the Nutramegin Lipil is not exist because they improved the formula by adding new addition like Enflora, which my baby doesn't accept.<br /><br />I came back to Similac brand, trying to switch among types of one brand. Thinking, that maybe my babe allergic to lactose, I switched to Similac Alimentum. As the result, my baby liked it immediately, but he started eat more like he was hungry every time. For example, usual portion at one time was 4 oz and after introducing him new formula, it became 7-8 oz. And he was attract to this formula like a bee to honey.<br /><br />I couldn't experiment my baby anymore and I went for just information for all formulas and look what I found.<br /><br />There is 3 main formula on the market - Similac, Enfamil and Nestle Good Start. Of course, there more brands of infant formula, but these are often to use by all medical facilities.<br />All infant formulas are prepared according to FDA regulations which 'specify minimum and, in some cases, maximum nutrient level requirements for infant formulas.<br />There is no word that one brand better than another, just says that low iron formula should not be used.<br />Infant formulas mostly differ in the type of sugar and protein that they have.<br />Regular iron fortified infant formulas, such as Similac Advance, Enfamil Lipil, and Nestle Good Start Supreme are made with lactose and cow's milk based proteins. Most infants who are not breastfeeding exclusively should be given a cow's milk based iron fortified formula.<br />Soy formulas are made with soy protein and are lactose free. They are good for children who don't tolerate lactose or milk proteins.<br />Elemental formulas are also lactose free and are made with hydrolysate proteins, which are easy to digest for infants with protein allergies. Types of elemental formulas include Nutramigen, Pregestamil and Alimentum.<br />If you have a family history of food allergies or formula intolerances, you might choose to start your baby off with a soy or elemental formula if you do not want to breastfeed.<br />Lactose free formulas are made without lactose, but do have cow's milk proteins in them. Infants are not usually thought to be born with a lactose intolerance, so these formulas are usually not needed.<br />Other infant formulas include Enfamil AR (added rice), which is supposed to be helpful for infants with reflux and premature formulas, such as Similac Special Care and Enfamil Premature.<br /><br />So. My family and family of my husband don't have a history of any allergies. My baby suppose to be able to drink regular formula or easy to digest, but based on cow milk, not soy.<br />If Infants are not usually born with lactose intolerance, so my baby also should drink a formula with lactose not sugar.<br /><br />Most of Similac easy to digest formulas includes sugar not lactose, exclude regular "blue", which my son doesn't accept. Also, Similac and Enfamil brands have so many(!) different types of formula that it easily be lost there )))<br /><br />Good Start has only 3 types excluding 2nd stage: Protective (regular), Gentle Plus (gentle itself) and Soy. That is all! Very simple and smart! Protective and Gentle Plus so much similar that if you accidentally switched it...nothing will happen.<br />Good Start formula based on whey protein concentrate (from cow's milk) and with lactose, not sugar.<br />In the beginning, the formula made with easy-to-digest proteins, they called comfort proteins. I agree with some of the reviewer that these words suppose to be on the front of all cans and in big letters.<br />I found nothing compare to this formula among main formulas on the market.<br />I found one negative review about formula itself and few reviews about the price. If your child drinks Similac Alimentum, for example, or Nutramegin Lipil, then the price is very similar to Good Start, but what a difference - those two are for allergy and, with sugar and Good Start is just regular main formula. That's why I don't understand Why people gave only one star to a product if there is no explanation about the product itself?<br />One woman said that the color of poop ))) was green and because of that the formula is bad. It's not true. That woman wasn't patient with the time. She didn't gave her child to normalize baby's system due to introducing new formula (24 -36 hours).<br />Also, the Good Start by Nestle joined the Gerber and Gerber company is THE NAME. You can easily see their name on all infant and toddler food, clothes and accessories in most malls and stores around the country. Gerber is also produce the special water for mixing with formula. The Nestle company itself is also producing many products for kids.<br />If the store has sale or deals on baby's formula, the first formula which gone in seconds is Good Start.<br /><br />Now, my son is absolutely normal boy without any allergies. He sleeps well and eat with pleasure.

It has other benefits as well - it tastes better (I tasted all three formulas myself, yuck), it doesn't foam up much when you shake the bottle, and it is easier to digest.<br /><br />I agree it is much cheaper at Babies R Us/Toys R Us or Walmart though.

review/summary: Wonderful formula!
review/text: My 4 month old is thriving on this formula. The hospital started him on Enfamil Lipil, which made him constipated and very unhappy! We switched to Good Start Supreme when he was about 5 weeks old, and he turned into a very happy baby! Amazon is rather expensive; this is cheapest at Babies 'R Us.

review/summary: My breastfed baby approves!
review/text: When it came time to introduce formula to my exclusively breastfed baby, I was afraid that she would reject this stuff like the several other brands of formula she has rejected---after all, breast milk tastes the best.  Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus was recommended to me by a friend who gives it to her daughter.  I mixed the formula with half breast milk and half prepared formula just to make the transition a little easier.  Much to my surprise and happiness--my daughter downed it with no problem whatsoever!  She was happy and content after and had no tummy upset or reflux.  I highly recommend!

review/summary: This milk safe our baby, literally!!
review/text: This milk safe our baby, literally!!<br /><br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)

review/summary: Thank you Good Start
review/text: The hospital recommended Enfamil and baby seemed to do fine on the canned Enfamil.  We had samples of the powder Enfamil at home and used that for about 4 days when my baby was fussy, gassy and seemed in pain during and after drinking a bottle.  We switched to Similac gentlease which was very bubbly and hard to mix.  That didn't help at all...she was grunting in severe pain all day and night and we were miserable.  We switched then to the Soy version of Similac which worked great, however a week into it I read that some countries actually ban the sale of soy for infants and that one serving on soy to a baby is like giving her 5 birth control pills.  There really isn't any research on the long term effects of soy on babies so I didn't want to take any chances 'if' I could find something she could tolerate that wasn't soy.  Thankfully I found Good Star with comfort proteins.  Within the first feeding she was so much different and calm.  We've been using it for over a month now and extremely happy.  It really makes me mad to know that the hospitals are under contract with Similac and Enfamil and tell mothers they should stick to those 2 brands because they do all the research and all the other companies just copy (acting as if anything other is inferior).  Well if it wasn't for Nestle Good Start, we would have had to resort to Soy and we didn't want to do that.  By the way, I tried Sam's Clubs version of this with whey protein.  Not only did it smell terrible (like the soy), but my baby was very gassy on it and hated the taste.  I was really hoping she would like Sam's club's version of this because the price was about half the cost of Nestle Good Start.  I am now staying with Nestle despite the high price.

review/summary: Good and bad experiences.
review/text: My three year old son was put on this at birth. He did just fine and I never had any problems with him digesting, having gas, constipation, ect...<br /><br />My daughter, that's another story.  She got so constipated on this stuff she would go two days without going potty.  And she started screaming terribly when she did go.  She ended up being switched over to the GS soy, and then the natural cultures.<br /><br />All in all, it all depends on the baby. Try it on a small can, and then if it works well, go to WIC and have them pay for formula. You can get any type of Goodstart on wic. You just have to have a reason to get something other than the purple or orange can. That is the cheapest way to get it. And wic doesn't go by income. rich and poor both are welcome to wic.

review/summary: constipating formula
review/text: My 5 month old seems to like this formula. He eats a lot and spits up a lot. I tried this formula for that reason. He continued to spit up about the same on this formula as he did on the Bright Beginnings Gentle formula.It's not really a concern because he is gaining weight like a champ. However, since he has been on the Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus he has only had a BM every 3 days. He used to have one every 1-2 days. I thought maybe he just needed time to adjust, but after four 25oz. cans we are still not regular. I am switching back to his old formula.

review/summary: Terrible, terrible price.
review/text: We fed our baby this formula for several months - until we realized that we were spending nearly $150/month on formula alone.<br /><br />We consulted our pediatrician as well as a pediatric nutritionist, and both told us that there is very little difference in the formulas from major brands because they are heavily regulated.<br /><br />We then went to Costco where we were able to find the Kirkland brand of formula for $60.00 for six 25.7 oz cans.  Read the label - it has all the brain boosting stuff (dha, etc.) as well as nearly identical vitamins, minerals, iron, etc.  If you don't want the Kirkland brand, Costco also sells other major brands for similar prices.<br /><br />If for some reason you really want to pay more to get the Nestle brand, note as well that this 6-pack is at almost no financial advantage to buying a single can - the only benefit is that you get all 6 at once.<br /><br />By the way, we're big fans of Amazon.com in general - just not on this product.

review/summary: Lots of vitamins, but not filling
review/text: I fed this to my kittens by recommendation of my vet. They gave me several coupons that made it quite inexpensive.<br /><br />It's packed with a lot of vitamins. My childhood pets were always fed it, and they lived to 14 years or so, and so I thought it would be good for my kittens.<br /><br />Their fur was glossy and they appeared healthy, but they were always hungry after eating their assigned portion. I switched to an organic human-grade kibble and the kittens were contented after their portions. This told me that the food must have been filling the cats up, but not substantially enough to keep them full. Just as a human could fill up on rice and chicken nuggets and vitamins (the human equivalents of some of the ingredients) and be healthy, but not really feel contented in their bellies.<br /><br />This is less expensive than the organic food I buy them now, but they want to eat more so I don't know what the end cost really is. I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble. I wish I could rate it higher for the vitamins, but these corn meal and by-product ingredient listings really explain my kittens lack of feeling full.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lots of vitamins<br />* Left fur glossy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Always begging for more food<br />* Corn meal and chicken by-products near the top of ingredient list (poor quality, not human grade)

review/text: Fortunately, my kittens have had no ill behaviors while eating this food like the previous reviewers cat. I mixed this in with my Purina Kitten Chow that my kittens were eating and the kittens seemed to really love it. My other two, one year old cats were also fond of "stealing" the kittens dry food instead of their usual Iams (where real chicken is the main ingredient), so this must be tasty. Usually, I just feed my cats dry food on a free choice basis and supplement with canned cat food and boiled chicken meat. My only gripe is this isn't a dry food that someone on a strict budget could likely readily afford on a regular basis for a number of cats. Otherwise, this is a good quality kitten food.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Addictive, empty filler, but my cat went anorexic without it
review/text: My older cat, 4 years, got "hooked" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the "good stuff"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.

I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.

review/summary: My cats won't eat it
review/text: I was sent a bag of this with a litter of kittens I am fostering. At first I thought perhaps the kittens were just more interested in wet food, because they wouldn't eat this stuff. Then they discovered my own personal cats' food (a much, much less expensive brand), and they were grubbing on it! My own cats turned up their noses at the Science Diet, too.<br /><br />It may be fabulously nutritious, but that doesn't really matter if my cats refuse to touch it.<br /><br />My dog liked it, though.

I usually buy Vitalife chicken fillets, but they have been unavailable for a long time now.  I just clicked on this item and is is also currently unavailable.  What is going on?  I do like other Beefeater items however...My dogs are totally addicted to any fillet, but I know what is worth the money and I haven't been able to find it lately.

review/summary: Great Taste...and value
review/text: I love this chili sauce.  I've used the Huy Fong Sriracha sauce for years (aka Rooster Sauce)...and it's great.  But I actually like this chili sauce better.  To me, it doesn't have quite the level of garlic (although it's definitely there)....and I like the chili seeds being present - it gives it a really nice consistency.  The chili sauce is definitely hot - so if you only like mild or medium heat, steer clear of this!  :)<br /><br />In terms of value, this is the best deal I've found.  I first purchased an 8oz jar at a local grocery store for $2.25.  The deal here on Amazon breaks down to $3.00 for 18oz - that's 125% more product for only 33% more money.  How can you beat that??  It's great!

If so, you'll enjoy the HFCG spice.  (If you can eat a whole habanero, you are gonna put this in *everything*, so get 1-clicking.)

review/summary: Wonderful Drink
review/text: I really love this beverage. I have been drinking it for years. I started out on the "Java" flavor to have a coffee replacement. The thing is, when we are replacing something we can be dissappointed if the new item isn't exactly like like the original. And that's the problemn. There isn't anything that is going to be exactly like coffee except coffee. So between the similar to coffee tasting Java teeccino and changing my frame of mind about no longer trying to make coffee without coffee, I had very good success. Let the new beverage be what it is. In this case Teeccino. So as far as Teeccino goes, I find it delicious. The Java does taste more like coffee than the others. However the vanilla and the mocha both are wonderful tasting. If you get into the Maya blends, they taste a lot like coffee too, but I felt sleepy drinking them. Could have been the Tryptophan or just a sleepy couple of days in my life, haha. At either rate, Teeccino has been a godsend for me. I love them and appreciate having a hot beverage (that isn't tea) that is good for me. Just a reminder, if you are going into this trying to make coffee then buy the Java, and try to remember that it isn't coffee. Otherwise enjoy a good healthy beverage. To me they really do have a wonderful flavor. Remember, the only place you will find coffee is in coffee. Which by the way, I don't even like coffee anymore. I was a coffee junky, from the moment I woke until bed. Meaning there was a cup of coffee on my bedside table. So for me to enjoy another product more than coffee and to not even care to have coffee, is a big deal. Enjoy.

review/summary: Teeccino Herbal Coffee - Substitute
review/text: This herbal coffee isn't too bad. Of course, considering there are no actual coffee beans in it, it has a very weak taste. That's why instead of what it calls for, I double the amount of grounds and it helps. However, if you've just recently stopped drinking real coffee you may be a bit disappointed. I would wait a while until you're "off" the real coffee before trying it, if you can. Again, it's not made from real coffee beans so it's not going to taste exactly the same and I guess it's hard to duplicate the taste exactly. But the manufacturer's have come close. I plan on buying it again in the future. Also, as much as I drank it, I ran out quickly and I can't afford to keep it in my cupboards all of the time. It IS a bit on the expensive side for what you get. These reasons are why I only gave it 3 stars.  Even on the manufacturer's website it's expensive which I don't understand. They should lower the price and make it easier to buy it more often....seems they would get more customers that way.

review/summary: Not the best, but very good!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I never used coffee primarily as a CNS stimulant. I always favored caffeinated coffee because it tastes better. I also always liked my coffee creamed, sweetened, and preferably flavored as mocha, french vanilla, hazelnut, etc. The one exception for me was Guatemalan coffee, which I preferred unflavored with cream and sweetener.<br /><br />That being said, I have tried Ayurvedic, Teeccino (Maya and Mocha), and Roastaroma as coffee substitutes. I had no desire to try Pero or Cafix, since they are designed to mimic straight coffee, which I do not prefer anyway.<br /><br />For a straight coffee substitute, I think Ayurvedic is the best: smooth, dark, and healthful. But a little pricier than the others.<br /><br />Teeccino is very good, but tends to brew with a lot of sediment in the cup and makes for a messy cleanup after brewing.<br /><br />I have settled on Roastaroma because it is cheap, tastes better than any of the others in my opinion, and is mindlessly easy to make.<br /><br />Two bags in a 15 oz. mug and hot water. Steep, throw away the bags, and cream and sweeten to taste. Voil&aacute;! It has a very smooth, cinnamon nutty cocoa taste. Really fine!<br /><br />I don't miss coffee one tiny bit!<br /><br />Thanks, Celestial Seasonings!<br /><br />'Tis da bomb!

review/text: I am not interested in giving up my morning coffee yet, but I did want something to drink in the evening beside herbal tea.  This fits the bill perfectly.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of peppermint to the coffee maker for a change.  I like it both ways. I like flavored coffee so will try the different flavors with my autoship.  My husband does not like flavored coffee and was not to impressed with this.  That's ok because the price even with autoship is not cheap.  Eventually I may eliminate coffee.  Not because of the caffeine but because it is acidic.  This beverage is alkaline, that was the main reason my husband wanted to try it also.

review/summary: Buy the raw nibs instead...
review/text: When I purchased these organic cacao beans I was aware of the fact that I'd need to peel them. What I wasn't aware of is that they would be so difficult to peel. You need to use all the force you can muster to squeeze the bean until you hear a popping sound. Once the shell is cracked you can then attempt to peel it off the nibs. Usually the bean will then start to fall apart into nibs. You can then place the nibs on a dessert spoon and drizzle a teaspoon of honey over the nibs. I actually enjoy the taste of the raw chocolate more than processed chocolate with too much sugar. The nibs are not as bitter as I expected them to be. They are fairly mild with a crunchy texture somewhere between an almond and a soy nut. While my first experience with cacao beans felt a little adventurous I will buy the peeled beans in the future. Here is the link: Organic Raw Chocolate Cacao Nibs 8-oz.. These are a good source of antioxidants so they are better for you than highly processed beans.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Well... this is considered one of those health foods that are a bit unpalatable to most I would bet.  The beans look like almonds and when you bite them they are a kind of semi-chewy rich dark chocolate the likes of which you have never tasked and will problably never taste again.  They seem to give me some pep and do eat them one at a time now and then and keep that at my office desk.  Shared them with the office though and many people went to spit them out...great gag.  Still they can say they tasted real raw chocolate!  Also... if you are a chocoholic like me this is the fix that lasts... you take a few and you won't want anyone to even say chocolate for at least a week.

review/summary: Great olive oil
review/text: I love this line of organic olive oils and vinegars.  I use the Meyer lemon olive oil, blood orange olive oil, cassis vinegar, zinfandel vinegar, white balsamic, and champagne vinegar.  I love to make my own dressings and vinaigrettes for inventive salads and these olive oils and vinegars are my staple ingredients for doing so.  I then whisk in all sorts of other components like a little flavored mustard, honey, chili pepper flakes, various chopped fresh herbs, maple syrup, or some macerated strawberries (with balsamic) or raspberries (with the champagne vinegar).<br /><br />I love all of these products but the Meyer lemon is my absolute favorite.  I love lemon, especially in salads, drizzled on seafood, or as a finishing touch to any cooked dish.  The flavor in this olive oil is bright, natural, and aromatic.  I don't often use it to cook, however, because I think the flavor is best enjoyed out of the bottle or drizzled on a finished dish, especially Italian soups like a ribollita.  I also sometimes pour a little of each flavored O olive oil onto small saucers for guests to sample with bread and a few cheeses and it's a huge hit.  They love to taste and compare the flavors.<br /><br />If you're looking to make more exciting salads or just love good, quality organic products, the entire O olive oil line is good but the Meyer lemon olive oil is delicious!

review/summary: The best brownie mix!
review/text: It's too warm to cook with our oven nine months out of the year, and so each winter we try and try to remember which is the best brownie mix. We have just finished the annual ritual of trying each and every brownie mix on the market, and this one (the Betty Crocker without the syrup package) wins hands down!<br /><br />This Betty Crocker (with no syrup pack) is the best tasting by far, according to the taste testers in my house, and can be baked to that chewy gooey chocolate richness we love so much. You can also make them cake style by varying the amounts of ingredients added.<br /><br />But we like 'em oooey gooey super chewy with added pecans around here. And a pan of brownies once a week until spring (around Valentine's Day usually) is a family tradition. Next year I'll remember writing this review and I will look myself up before the first brownie mix is purchased. Actually Amazon makes it even easier than that, I've just signed up for the automatic delivery so now all we have to remember is if it comes in the mail from Amazon, it must be THE GOOD STUFF!!!
