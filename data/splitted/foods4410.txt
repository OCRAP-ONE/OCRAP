review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I bought a Keurig brewer last Christmas and have been sampling all the different varieties. I enjoy being able to have a variety of good fresh coffee on hand. I like the darker roasts like French and the 'Jet Fuel' brand which is a good roast. This Italian Roast is my absolute favorite, strong and full of flavor. :) I am ordering another box of 50 today.

review/summary: Good Buy and Amazon really delivers
review/text: Bought this with Amazon's 2 day guaranteed shipping.  It was 9pm the second day, no show.  I was a little disappointed with Amazon until I received a text that the package was delivered.<br />Sure enough, it was on my front steps....delivered close to 10PM on the second day!  Amazon delivers and does not disappoint! Of course, it is such a great buy I got so many of them for a low price ...drawback, I'm tired of the taste and ready for a different flavor....but still,  I highly recommend this for the great taste and value.

review/text: Great choice for a K-Cup Coffee!  Great flavor is in these Kups! I've tried sampler packs and this one stands out as a great Kup any time of day!  I praised my Cuisinart for years with fresh ground beans but TIR is so easy in the Kurig and the taste is superior!

review/text: Love it...Very very nice...Great flavor......One of my favorites for sure, although I do have quite a few favs I really like....Which is cool...Something awesome and different every cup I make....<br /><br />I see some reviews talk about the kcups either arriving damaged or bursting open when used leaving grinds everywhere....I have yet to have 1 single kcup come apart during use....no grinds to clean..no grinds in cup...makes a great cup every brew...<br /><br />Oddly, I have had a few issues with opening a new box in this 'type of packaging' with 50 kcups all loose in the box and finding 1 or 2 damaged with grinds in the box...no biggie at all...a 3 minute call to amzn and they ship you another box right away while letting you keep the original box (they should since it cant be re-sold and it does take time cleaning the grinds off the rest of the kcups)....but oddly, i've not had a problem with tullys italian getting damaged in this type of packaging.....<br /><br />anyway, a really great coffee....wonderful flavor, perfect balance....drinking a cup right now.....

review/summary: Love Tully's Italian Roast
review/text: I am a very picky coffee drinker.  I don't know or follow what critics may view as the best coffee, only my own taste buds.  There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b/c I have more of another brand to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.

review/summary: Defective seal
review/text: The coffee had a nice bold, flavor, but the foil on the cups were not properly sealed, and I mean all of the cups. Every brewing left grounds in the cup and sometimes made a complete mess because the water wasn't going through the brew tip.  The flavor of the coffee was not enough to warrant a better rating because we get this product for convenience and easy clean up, as much as for the flavor.

review/summary: My favorite so far
review/text: The arrival of a K-cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't brew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors, and finally found this.  To be honest, I still don't think it's truly great -- not as good as what we were able to make before w/a conventional drip coffee maker or French Press -- but it's pretty darn good.  But measured against the rest of the field, it's the best we've tried, thus the high rating.

Tullys did send us a  box to replace the cups from our 1st order of 4 boxes from Amazon. 3 of those containers leaked. We tried 2 local food stores for 6 boxes at various times and the cups in those leaked also.We have stopped using Tullys, we are sad. :(<br /><br />(the foil lids become detached from the container causing coffee grinds and water to leak out and into the coffee cup)

review/summary: Hands Down, The BEST Cat Food... Saved my Cat's Life!
review/text: I absolutely love this food, and so does my baby, Aphrodite! I absolutely recommend this food with no equivocations!<br /><br />Aphrodite is 9 years old and for the past 2 years, he's been having digestion and kidney problems that grew progressively more severe. About 6 months ago, it got so severe that I was sobbing at the vet trying to decide if we should put him to sleep. At that point, he was vomiting several times a day, had lost 5 lbs, and looked awful. Everything we had tried up to that point had failed.<br /><br />The vet suggested we try one more thing - a series of injections and a bunch of pills - and a switch to high protein wet food. Of course, my baby deserved a last ditch effort and we went ahead with it. After a hefty vet bill and 2 weeks, he actually seemed to be perking up! After another 2 weeks, it seemed that he would pull through. But the prescription food was costing me almost $2 per DAY! I had to find a suitable alternative. So to the internet I went. That's where I first discovered the Wilderness Diet by Blue Buffalo! With it's high protein content and wholesome, holistic, grain free (specifically corn) ingredient list, it's actually superior to the dry version of the RX diet.<br /><br />I ran to the pet store and to my surprise, they carried it. So I grabbed a small bag and headed home with fingers crossed. Aphrodite is a finicky eater, so the first test was whether he'd eat it at all. To my relief, he ran for it and LOVED it! So, I watched and waited.<br /><br />6 months later, my cat is doing amazingly well! Esp. considering just months ago, he was on the verge of being put down! His coat is thick, shiny, and healthy. His eyes are clear and bright. And he rarely vomits - save for the occasional hairball! To maintain his health, I've switched to Bellyrubs Organic Bonito Flakes and Liv-a-Littles All-Natural Freeze Dried Chicken treats, as well!<br /><br />And today, Aphrodite is incredibly healthy, happy, and back to his old self.<br /><br />Now, if I can only do something about his wayward curiosity! =D

review/summary: Formula change. IT NOW HAS GRAINS
review/text: I loved the food for my cats as you can read below. However when it came time for me to buy another bag I read the ingrediants again, something I do to make sure there were no chnages.  I was concerned as my cat with the Yeast on her skin had started getting it again.  To my dismay I read that Oats has been added to the formulation.  WHat it it that Blue Buffalo Doesn't understand that Oats is a GRAIN and they can't now call the formulation GRAIN free.<br />I hve had to change to another brand of cat food.  Shame on you.<br />I have 2 Ragdolls. One is 3 years old. SHortly after I brought her home as a kitten she developed yeast growind on her skin. It was on her face, eyes and mouth. I took her to many vets even a dermatologyst who charged a fortune and none could figure out what she had. I had used a grain litter as it seemed like the healthy thing to do. I changed her bowl from plastic to ceramic to stainless steel and nothing made a difference. I would spend an hour a day cleaning and blow drying her.  It had spread down to the area where a mane would grow and she lost fur wherever it was.  My vet took in a new partner who reacted in horor when he saw her. He did a scraping, sent to the lab and found it was yeast. All the other expensive tests that were done never showed yeast.  I started her on a grain free diet that helped a lot but after a year all of a sudden it got worse again. The manufacturer changed the ingredient. I tried a few other products and after a short time the same thing happened. Grain free was no longer really grain free. For some reason the companies didn't know that wheat is not the only grain out there. Oats, was added and some other grains. I was at a loss and dthen I saw Blue Buffalo's Wilderness.  I tried it and as each day went by her yeast growth would get less.  It took around 2 weeks for the other foods to get out of her system.  SHe now has just a tiny amount of yeast around her mouth and her fur is growing back.  Her tail the was once goreous and then sparsly covered with fur is becoming beautiful again.  I only have to wash her mouth area every 3 days to remove the yeast, instead of the hour a day I used to spend.I think if the flax was taken out she would be yeast free as flax is a grain. I am thrilled with the difference as is my cat. My vet wanted to know what I did and he told me that most cat owners end up putting their cats to sleep as they can't deal with it. I also changed to a pine litter over a year ago which helped somewhat.<br /><br />My other act developed crystals in her urine which then became sludge.  THe vets flushed her bladded but it didn't help. She was getting cortisone shots to help with the swelling of her bladder and the bleeding. I told the vet to biopsy her bladder which is surgery and he cleaned out her bladder. The pathology report said she has cystities.  He didn't like giving her the Cortisone as it has bad side effects. I didn't like it either but she would stay in her litter box all day when she would start bleeding and did not feel good at all.  It would take the con around 3 days to work and then she would be o.k. for around a month, then 3 weeks and then after the surgery it started again after 2 weeks.  I told my vet he would have to put her down if this kept up.  She is only 2 and this started when she was 1 1/2 years old and was my favorite pet.<br />He gave her a shot of cortisone and I told hin we would see how long it lasted before she would start bleeding again. The food I had been giving her had Soy in it and she was getting a hypoallergenic treat that had SOy oil in it.  I noticed that she would get worse when I would give her the treat.  I ahd swithced to the Blue Buffalo for my other cat and it had not Soy in it and I stopped the treats.<br />It is nwo 7 weeks since she had any bleeding from her bladder. I stopped the soy when the vet told me she had cyctities as I know Soy gives cysts to women due to it have plant estrogen in it. The vet had given me<br />foods that were expensive to try that were made specificly for the crystals and she wouldn't touch them. SHe had become an obese cat that didn't want to do anythin when she got sick. SInce she had the food change she lost a lot of weight and is a playful happy cat again.<br />I hope Blue Buffalo doesn't change the ingredients ( except perhaps to take out the flaz)as it has saved the life of my 2 cats that I love dearly.<br />No more yeast, no more crystals, sludge or cystities.<br />I told my vet whta I had figured out and one has called me to ask me what I had done for the yeast as he had a cat that had it and he had to put down cats whose owners couldn't deal with it. I hope other cat owners who have these problems would try WIlderness and see if it helps their cat. Thank you Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />WHen I told him she was doing well he told me he should send his patients to me when he can't cure.<br />Update 5/12 .  THe cats have been on the food since December. Both are doing beautifuly. THe one with the yeast on her body and severe loss of fur, now has a beautiful coat. She is no longer hiding 24/7.  SHe is a happy cat.  The one with cycstitis and sludge is as happy and healthy as can be.  If I hadn't tried this food she would have been put to sleep months ago.  Please keep the formula you are using.  A very greatful cat owner.

review/summary: My 12 Yr Old Diabetic Cat acts like a Kitten Again!
review/text: My female cat who just was turning 12 this summer lost the fuction/strength of her back legs and she was hopping around (think bunny rabbit); I took her to the vet expecting to be told horrible news and have to put her down...nope. She had diabetes!  I had no idea that was a symptom of high blood sugar and high triglycerides in cats.  She was put on Insulin injections 2 x a day and I was told to stay away from dry cat food (the Vet also told me that diabetes in cats is a MAN CAUSED DISEASE! with all the by products, and grains and junk they put in those foods as fillers) and stick with a high protein low carb canned food twice a day.<br />We have another cat, a 5 yr old non diabetic male...so this meant his diet had to change as well. He was not happy when I took away all dry food.  And slowly over time, my 12 yr old started to sit at the dish more looking at me as to be saying..."sure i can walk but i'm starving lady!"<br /><br />After about a month of insulin injections and their new food routine, my 12 yr old started to regain strength in her back legs and was back up to walking on her toes most of the time, but still had a very hard time jumping on furniture or on the window sill.  I decided to add back the dry food just a small amt. a day and leave it out so they could graze when they were used to. My mom told me about this brand, she feeds it to her dogs, and said she thought they had a cat brand that didn't have any grains in it.<br /><br />I was hesitant b/c of the price and some of the feedback on other petfood sites suggested their cats hated it or it was "too strong" for them, whatever that means. Well, let me tell you...2 days later, my 12 yr old diabetic cat was RUNNING! I am not kidding.  She is 100% up on her toes all of the time, running, jumping back up on the couch and bed like she always used to as a younger cat, loves to play "fight" with her younger brother cat.  The difference is amazing.  My 5 yr old male cat enjoys the food very much, and while I did try the canned variety that Blue Buffalo has to offer, they were not diggin it at all, so we returned back to the cheaper canned food they like and they get a 1/2 cup of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dry in a bowl each morning and they just have a nibble here and there which keeps them both very  happy.  Their coats have never been fluffier and softer.  My female cat has never had soft or fun to pet fur; but suddenly I have noticed over the past week her hair seems fluffy and full and the softest it has ever been. My male cat has always been soft and fluffy, I didn't think his could get any softer, but it has!<br /><br />I'm not saying that Blue Buffalo was a miracle that suddenly made my 12 yr old diabetic cat walk again, I realize that a change in food and insulin was a big part of that, but this definatly made a difference in her quality of life and it happened fast!  It is pricey, but have you ever looked at the back of the ingredients list of other dry cat foods???  RIDICULOUS! THis brand is totally worth it.  ESp since they are getting such a little amt. each day, the large bag will last at least a month.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this brand of food and the fact they actually sell something without grain and gluten. Cats do not need that junk!!!!!!<br /><br />I should also add that both cats seem to have nice soft, thick coats and are maintaining their weight.  My diabetic has always been obese topping off at 14 lbs, she lost 2 lbs over the past few years the Vet says prob the first symptom of her diabetes; she has went up to 13 1/2 lbs and has stayed there; which was a little of a concern when adding in this food; it is high in calories, but with all that running she now is doing up our 17 steps daily, she must be burning it off :)  Shop around for the price, I buy it in a certain well known pet store for about half of this price.

review/summary: A miracle for our cat!
review/text: My Siamese-mix cat had to wear a cone because of her non-stop compulsive grooming. Her overgrooming started when I put my cats back on kibble and stopped making raw food for them; even though I didn't buy cheap food and fed them premium kibble, apparently something in the food didn't agree with her. After going through all kinds of theories (including 'fleas' which she did not have) my vet suggested a hypoallergenic food (Science Diet being one). I refuse to use that product but I did see the Blue Buffalo Wilderness at Petco and decided to try it.<br /><br />My cats, notoriously picky, all loved the Wilderness from the minute we put it on the bowl; they thought it was a treat! So periodically we would try to take the cone off our overgroomer, and she'd start in right away so we'd put it back on. Finally after about four months we took it off (this was just a week ago!) and she started in on herself again...but then she just stopped and looked around. A few more licks, then she'd stop and look around. It was as if she realized she didn't have to do it any more.<br />What made us decide it was time to take the cone off this time, and leave it off, was that her fur is in the most amazing condition. It's deeply luxuriant and thick, and so soft! She also has a healthy weight to her for the first time in years! She's looked a little on the thin side for the past few years, but in a typical lanky Siamese way so we didn't think it was bad. Now though it's clear she has an allergy of some kind, some grain or the gluten perhaps? And Blue Buffalo has basically made a new cat out of her!<br /><br />As a side note, my 14 year old elderly cat looks like a cat 1/4 her age, and acts like it as well. When we switched to Blue Buffalo we did it wholeheartedly and decided ALL the cats would eat it (and the dog too!). My 10 year old cat has always had a weight problem EXCEPT when he was on raw food, now he's down to 12 pounds from his previous 16 lb. kibble weight but he's not emaciated; he's sleek and glossy and looks like a much younger cat. He plays like he thinks he's a kitten again, and he just seems so bright eyed and alert. One thing I noticed was that he always seemed to have an eating disorder (even though healthy at the vet's) and would eat and eat until he vomited it up and just start over...he doesn't have that insatiable eating disorder any more! Another bonus to the Blue Buffalo, I have not stepped in a cold wet pile of cat hork in the middle of the night, in quite some time.<br />That right there is worth the price of the food!<br /><br />We are HUGE fans of Blue Buffalo and I try to get everyone to try it! Don't balk at the price, you actually will end up having to feed less of this than regular kibble! Once you see the results that are possible from this amazing food, you won't want to use anything else. If your cat/dog has dry skin, sheds too much, has a weight problem, etc, this food is for you! Try the Blue Buffalo Wilderness before you buy anything else, chances are good that you won't need to go buy 'prescription specialty food'. If you have a diabetic animal, the Blue Buffalo Wilderness is one of the best foods you can choose! Compare it side by side to the 'prescription diet' you'll no doubt be told is best. See if the Blue Buffalo Wilderness isn't lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein than that prescription stuff! (Check with your vet to make sure higher protein isn't a problem for your pet though)

review/summary: All four cats love it
review/text: First off, I want to share the nutrition information that ought to be listed in the product information. These numbers are from the bag.<br /><br />Crude protein: 40% min; Crude fat: 18% min; Crude fiber: 3.5% max; Moisture: 10% max; Calorie content: 391 kcal/cup.<br /><br />We're trying to help all four of our cats lose weight; two of them are significantly overweight and two of them just a little bit. I tried Wellness Core but the none of the cats loved it, and one of them wouldn't touch it. Core does have a better nutrition profile--it's 50% protein which I understand is ideal. The 40% that is in this product is barely better than the Purina One I had been feeding the cats. But the ingredients are much better and the carb/fat ratio is more desirable too.<br /><br />I'd like to have them on a wet/raw diet but one of the cats won't touch anything but dry food. This is the best food I've found for meeting everyone's needs.

review/summary: Improved my cat's health
review/text: One of my two cats prefers to eat dry cat food, and so many of the foods on the market have a ton of fillers. I'd grown increasingly worried that she wasn't getting enough of what she needed in her diet, especially now as a senior cat. I switched to this food several months ago. She loves it, and her health has noticeably improved! Her coat has thickened up, she doesn't have itchy skin like she used to. Her arthritis isn't bothering her as much either. I'm very glad I switched to this dry cat food.

review/summary: Amazing, but Pricey
review/text: Ok, it is double the price of my former brand, Purina One. I say "former" though for a reason. I have three cats, one of which is a Siamese who would not stop throwing up constantly. A friend of mine suggested Blue Buffalo and after going online and getting a coupon I decided to try it out. They are on their second bag and the Siamese has only thrown up once, which is an amazing difference. Also, all three cats have had a vast improvement in their fur. Their fur is so much softer now, it is hard to believe. I know it might be expensive, but try a 12 pound bag just ONCE, and you won't ever look back.

review/summary: This stuff saved me a lot of money in vet bills
review/text: We originally got 2 cats from our shelter, and one seemed to be healthy as a rock from day 1 (Zachy), but the other (Doc) had problems with soft bowel movements and really stinky odors.<br /><br />After a lot of vet visits and treatments, and many months of steroids, he got a bit better....at least well enough for us to not be worried about it.<br /><br />We added a 3rd cat (Sully) 4-5 months later, and he had worms at first....we treated the poor guy for worms, got those cleared up...but his bowel issues persisted. We ran hundreds of dollars of tests and half a dozen vet visits to 2 different vets with the poor guy.<br /><br />He was bloated with bad gas, farted all the time (and could clean out a room), and his poop was just absolute liquid..and would squirt fiercely all over the side of the litter box because he had so much gas.<br /><br />We were finally at a loss what to do, we had him on Prescription Diet (WD) and he got a little better, but not much.<br /><br />Finally one day, I saw a Blue Buffalo rep at Petco, and I was just chatting with him about my cats having issues throwing up food after eating. The guy really knew his stuff, and immediately asked if their food bowl was on the ground. It was, and he suggested I elevate it about 4-5 inches. Immediately, it stopped all problems they were having throwing up.<br /><br />Next time I was in the store we were talking about my cat's stomach problems and I was buying some Science Diet for sensitive stomachs (which did as much (or little) as the WD, so we were using it) and he asked if I had tried any of Blue Buffalo's products. He wasn't pushy at all, but said it might be worth a shot trying the wilderness line and getting rid of the grains.<br /><br />After doing some quick research online on my mobile phone, I was really skeptical...I saw some reviews where people said their cats didn't like it or threw up with it, and I was a little concerned.<br /><br />However, I finally decided to try it, and I bought a bag.<br /><br />Even mixed in with the old food, I saw almost an immediate difference the day after starting. Sully's gas started getting better and his poo got a little firmer.<br /><br />By the time I had them on 100% of the Wilderness Chicken, his poo stink was gone, his stomach swelling was gone, and he didn't have his gas anymore....and his poo was looking normal!<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and 4x 12 lb bags later, these guys are doing absolutely great. One of my first cats, Doc, no longer has his bowel stink or soft poop issues...and I don't have to feed him steroid pills. Zachy is still just Zachy, I swear he could eat anything and be fine lol...and Sully has gained weight (we gained no weight when we first got him because of the bowel issues) and Doc's coat looks VERY healthy...we always called him crunchers because his coat just looked like crap all the time.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is a life saver....I only wish I had discovered Grain Free cat foods about 500-600 dollars in vet bills before!

review/summary: Another believer
review/text: One more personal testimonial to add to the rest. My Siamese has been prone to bouts of vomiting all his life, but 7 months ago it became chronic. He wouldn't eat or even keep liquids down, and in addition to many vet visits (totaling over $1500), my having to give him sub-Q fluid therapy myself, and a prescription diet, he was not improving (they tentatively diagnosed pancreatitus).<br /><br />In desperation, I combed the internet and saw many references to vomiting cats having corn allergies. As corn was listed as a major ingredient in both my cat's regular diet (the expensive Royal Canin Siamese food)AND the vet given Rx food (Hills), I searched for an alternative to try. I read a review on this page for Blue Buffalo and tried it out. Long story short (perhaps too late), it is 6 months later and my cat is happy, healthy and has vomited only twice in that time (yes. hairballs).<br /><br />It makes perfect sense. Cats in the wild do not eat grains. End of story. And my cat, notoriously fickle, took to it immediately. I highly recommend it. It's a little pricey, but cheaper than vet bills and a miserable cat.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: I switched my 3 cats to Blue Buffalo last fall. Initially they were on indoor health.  When one of my cats was diagnosed with diabetes (which I believe started before the switch to BB), I switched them all to the Wilderness formula.  So far they have all done very well on it. They like the taste and have fewer hairballs. My diabetic cat seems to do well on it so far. The vet of course recommended prescription food that they sell, but after reading the ingredients I was not about to switch him. She knew very little about Blue Buffalo or really any cat foods other than what they sell. I am looking for a local vet who actually knows something about nutrition. In the meantime, I'll do my own research and feed my cats what I think is best for them.<br /><br />I love that I am able to get this from Amazon with free shipping, saving me a trip to my local Pet Smart which is several miles out of town in a very congested shopping area and I always hated having to go there.

review/summary: Cats dig it
review/text: My cats seem to love it, just as much as Core Wellness. Maybe they are just little fat arses that eat anything, though. All I know is that my one cat used to have constipation issues before Wellness and Wilderness. He'd get a little random butthole bleeding (yuck) and discomfort of which he relieved by leaving lovely skidmarks across my carpet. So far this has been gone since the food switch off of garbage ProPlan. They also seem to have more energy, coats seem shinier as well. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on either Wilderness or Core Wellness (grain free foods) for your little guys. I'm confident the money saved on crap junk foods like Purina, etc, will not make up for expensive vet visits further down the road.<br /><br />One issue I have had with this food is my cats still occasionally drop a vom-bomb on my floor. I don't think this is due to the food, though. I think they are just little pigs, and sometimes I take too long to feed them. It seems they eat too fast and then -- BLEH, out it goes. Also, I wish they'd package it in more environmentally friendly bags though, there has got to be a way to not make the bags out of thick plastic (or whatever it is). It just has that feeling... like it's an unnecessary amount of material for what it's needed for. It was most likely some art director (I am one) that created the packaging and decided customers would think it feels fancy so it's worth the price.<br /><br />Overall, I've done much reading about various foods, and this food seems great for them, aside from a raw diet. I'd also recommend Core Wellness.

review/text: My cats were too young to have serious health problems.  However, they did eat compulsively and throw up (on the carpet) at least once a week even though we fed them the best quality grocery store cat food (Iams).  We switched to Blue Buffalo after the cats flatly refused a transition to raw food.  No more vomiting, no more constant eating, decreased shedding.  They eat less and seem much more contented.  Blue Buffalo may be more expensive, but it is still much less than the vet.  One bag lasts our two smallish cats seven weeks.

review/summary: Cat's gotta eat paleo too
review/text: Cat's are of the order carnivora. They eat meat. Have you ever seen a pack of lions stalking a wounded corn field? Or a puma pounce on a loan soybean plant? No? Sounds ridiculous, right? Then don't feed that to your house cat! 95% of pet food on the market is full of grains and caloric fillers that are nothing like your cat's natural/ancestral diet. If you want your cat to behave without anxiety, shed less, and generally be as lean as a jungle cat, than you need to feed him like one.<br /><br />Short of a raw meat diet, this is the most practical approach to cat food. I have no complains. I give Mikhail two scoops every two days - he eats when he is hungry, is perfectly healthy and thriving at 10 jungle cat pounds.<br /><br />Are you afraid of switching your cat's diet,as they are fussy? Maybe you're just a push-over. Ha, but seriously they will love this!

Any kind of animal can be included: "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying before slaughter), goats, pigs,sheep, horses, rats, euthanized at animal shelters, restaurant and supermarket waste, road kill, etc.<br /><br />GROSS!<br /><br />While not all of these may be used in pet food the thought of it was discusting. Do your own research and be prepared to run your grocery store bought pet food to the trash and order Blue Buffalo or another quality brand.

review/text: My cat was recently put on a renal diet (Hills HD), and because he's allergic to corn, he threw up every time he ate.  The second ingredient is corn gluten meal, the third pork fat.  Yuck.  The Blue Buffalo Grain Free Dry Cat Food changed my life and his in one meal.  He has had breakfast, lunch and dinner today and not thrown up once.  And he loves it.  And he doesn't complain about being hungry every hour.  He is happy, content, and satisfied with small portions.  And so are my other two cats.  What a relief.  I also ordered the duck both canned and dry after calling Blue Buffalo to find out the levels of phosphorus and sodium.  They said that the Basic duck and potato, dry, and the Wilderness duck canned are the lowest. I called my vet and he was shocked (in a good way) that they were so low. He said some of the renal diets are higher than Blue Buffalo.  I love this brand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I actually use their Wilderness Indoor formula and it is indeed 100% grain free.<br /><br />I am therefore demoting my rating to 3 stars as, while this is still a good food, the claim that it is grain free is just plain false.<br /><br />"I'm not sure why this is listed as $60 on Amazon. The MSRP is around $35, a price you can fetch at Petsmart or Petco.<br /><br />Anyway, this food is great! My two cats love it. They have excellent coats and have maintained a healthy weight for years with this food.<br /><br />I switch back and forth between this and Blue Buffalo Freedom depending on sale prices as they are the same thing except that Wilderness has added salmon."

review/summary: My 4 Cats' Favored Food
review/text: I love this food. I was so happy to find a food that was 40% protein. The grain-free food I had been using was 50% protein. I was concerned that might be a little high for my less active cats. I am  totally comfortable with Wilderness. My next concern, though, was that one of my cats was sometimes constipated. No grains ~ no oats ... I was told it is better to deal with feline constipation using food over laxatives or petroleum-based products. I was at a loss, but now Blue Buffalo has come out with a Wilderness grain-free formula that has added dried cellulose, which is a natural fiber. It has 5% fiber content. It also has slightly lower caloric content than the regular Wilderness. I can't wait to try it!! My cats absolutely love Wilderness!

review/summary: Tasty but a little TOO tasty
review/text: I bought this because PetSmart were out of Innova at the time.  Normally I buy Innova for senior cats and for weight control and mix them together.  I have a 9 year old skinny kitty and a 6 year old chubby kitty.  I've noticed as soon as I switched to Buffalo Wilderness (mixing Chicken and Weight Control now) their bowls empty significantly faster.  That means they're packing away more calories, which is NOT good for the chubby kitty.  I definitely plan to go back to Innova.  My chubby cat was eating much less (getting fuller faster).<br /><br />Nevertheless, they both do love it.  Must be delicious to little cat taste buds!

review/text: I recently switched my cat Charlie (a little under a year) to this stuff from another type of Blue Buffalo dry food. He is not clawing his way to the food, but he took to it just fine. His coat is soft and shiny and he rarely gets gas. I can't say his business smells any more pleasant, but I doubt there is any food to take care of that bit. I feel better feeding him this stuff, knowing that it is much better for him. He has a ton of energy (sometimes a bit too much) and seems to be a happy and healthy little fellow.

review/text: I switched to no grain food several years ago when I realized my cat has a grain allergy. I have tried many brands and this one stands amongst the best. The added perks are it shipping for free for Amazon Prime members, this saves me a trip to the nearest pet food store that carries this type of food an hour and half away. I also use an automatic feeder and the kibble size is perfect. My cat is always excited for meal time!

review/summary: Yes, it's pricey, but WHAT a difference in my cats!
review/text: My 10-yr-old cats have had problems off and on all their lives with allergies.  My female has had it the worst: she gets a rash on her tummy or inside her legs, then proceeds to lick it, causing terrible irritation/scabs.  I was told by a vet that it was probably the cat litter I was using, so over the years, I've tried virtually EVERY unscented, natural, "organic" cat litter on the market with virtually no change.  Hers cleared up a bit, then my male started getting the same thing.  He also started losing weight and vomiting.  Not good for a little (7-lb) kitty.  Their food has always been a "premium" adult-formula cat food, which they seemed to like.<br /><br />Finally, a breeder suggested I get them off grain-based cat food.  I chose this Blue Buffalo variety because of the high protein content and what seemed to be a balance of the other ingredients.<br /><br />Oh. my.  The difference has been nothing short of miraculous.  After three weeks on the new food, both seem to be rid of their allergies.  Fred has gained some weight, and no longer upchucks every day.  Both are full of energy and chase each other all over the house (remember, these are 10-yr-old cats!).  Their coats are looking good, too.<br /><br />I'm totally sold on this stuff.  It costs a lot more than my previous food, but my kitties are so much healthier and happier that it's TOTALLY worth it.

My little one had very soft stools until he was put on a 100% grain-free diet. Both of their coats are incredibly soft, they aren't overweight and they are full of energy.  It is more expensive than other brands out there, but my cats' health is worth it to me, especially if it will help with possible health issues in the future. The vet is very happy with their health and my boys are very happy with their human.

review/summary: Turns older cats into healthy, vibrant kittens!
review/text: I've been feeding my 2 cats cheap (whatever what was on sale at the supermarket) food for years.  They were vomiting hairball-food mixtures all the time, and had dry, flaky skin.  I didn't really take notice until the older cat had to have teeth pulled because of stomatitis.  He was sluggish and had trouble chewing even after surgery.  After searching, I learned that poor diet could be a factor.  So, I decided to quit putting their health on the line and buy some quality food.<br /><br />I had tried a few other brands, but they didn't want to eat any of them.  This, however, they LOVED.  Now ages 13 and 8, they are friskier than ever! They're coats are soft and shiny, their gums healthy, and they stopped vomiting (there's still an occasional hairball once in a while but very rarely).<br /><br />The change in behavior and health is very noticeable, and I'm sure because of this food they will live a long healthy life.  This is the only brand (and flavor) of dry food they eat now!

review/summary: magic bullet for cat with digestive issues
review/text: After 8 years and many vet consultations, diets, and lifestyle changes I finally found a food that my cat can digest -- I wish I'd found this product years ago. My cat has had diarrhea/soft stool, blood in stool, and elimination behavior issues for all 8 years that have made me think she is in serious discomfort -- kitty colitis or the like. The stink this cat used to create was also the foulest odor ever to waft past my nostrils. Vets have largely dismissed my concerns about this (small animal vets have earned about as much of my respect as dentists or auto mechanics -- good luck finding a decent one among the lazy, greedy, or just plain incompetent). I've fed Royal Canin products at vet recommendation (cat hated it and no digestive benefit), as well as Taste of the Wild and Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul on friends' recommendations, all with zero improvement. Then I moved cross country and could not find these brands at the local store. Picked up the pricey Blue Buffalo wildernes food on a whim and voila -- cat is producing truly solid waste, seems to be able to use the litterbox without discomfort, and has reduced the poop odor by ~90%. She also simply seems to like the taste. The price is outrageous, but it's worth it to have her comfortable and to have a house that doesn't smell like the putrid waste of the devil himself whenever the cat takes a crap. Not being awakened in the middle of the night by eye-wateringly fetid odors wafting from the bathroom, demanding immediate litter scooping, is truly priceless.

review/summary: Our cats love it!
review/text: We first bought Blue Buffalo when trying to find an alternative to prescription cat food that has fillers in it. Our older cat has had a lot of problems with weight gain and UTI issues. After Science Diet, and Rx, we wanted to give a more natural cat food a chance. This worked wonders!<br /><br />Our 7 year old cat, Isabel, eats some of the Blue Buffalo chicken mixed in with her wet food every day. Her coat is starting to look healthy again with her dandruff going away, her chronic UTI has cleared up, she is beginning to lose a little weight, and she is more active than she has been in the last two years. For the last 12 months, she was becoming more and more lethargic, to the point that we were worried she had a serious illness. Now she chases our younger cat, plays with balls, and is generally in a much happier mood. She is even starting to jump on top of the washing machine to steal her 'sister's' food, whereas a few months ago she could only jump on the couch after a few starter jumps. She also eats less without begging for more food, I think the higher protein is doing a good job of keeping her feeling full.<br /><br />Our younger cat is much pickier than Isabel, and she LOVES this food! I love having a cat food that both of my cats can enjoy and that does not contain corn, wheat, or soy. I take away one star for price, Amazon is not always the cheapest place to buy it.<br /><br />I noticed the description on Amazon does not have the Nutrition information. From the side of my bag:<br /><br />- Crude protein 40.0% min.<br />- Crude fat 18.0% min.<br />- Crude fiber 3.5% max<br />- Moisture 10% max<br />- Magnesium 0.08% min<br />- Taurine 0.15% min<br />- Omega 3 fatty acids 0.9% min<br />- Omega 6 fatty acids 3.5% min<br /><br />Calorie Content (ME Calculated, as fed):<br />3,682 Kcals/kg, 391 Kcals/cup

review/summary: Best cat food on the market!
review/text: I have a 14 yr old, 2 yr old and a 7 yr old cats and we were feeding them Iams, Purina... one of those big name cat food brands. However, when we moved to a new location we came across this brand and I instantly fell in love. All you really need to do it read the ingredients in the back. Practically, everything that you would see a cat eat in the wild is in the food. There is real meat and fish in there, blueberries, cranberries and vegetables as well. I noticed a HUGE change in my cats. My oldest used to be real lethargic, always laying around sleeping, taking a few practice jumps before jumping up on the couch. Not to mention she had very bad dandruff. She's a tortoise shell and you could clearly see the dandruff without being right on top of her. Once I switched to Blue Buffalo, she got a little pep in her step. Now I find her running around the house like a bat out of hell and neither of my other two cats know what the heck is going on. Her coat is also nice, shiny and dandruff free. I never knew how much of a difference the change in food could be for her. Now she jumps up on the couch and bed (which is higher up) with ease and is even initiating play with my other two cats. She was the one cat that I'd noticed a dramatic change in. I highly recommend this brand to everyone. It gave me my childhood friend back.<br /><br />It may be more expensive than your average cat food but it is well worth it in the end. I have found no problem with my cats not liking this food. All three of them gobble up the food in their bowls as if they were rottweilers.<br /><br />*I recently had to switch to a low protein diet due to my eldest developing kidney disease. Within a month of switching foods she reverted back to having horrible dandruff. Aside from switching away from Blue Buffalo nothing in her diet/environment has changed. So this food really does help with dandruff.

review/summary: The cats eat less
review/text: It's true what they say about the super high protein food.  Without all the grain fillers, the cats don't need to eat as much to be satiated and to get the energy they need.  This food is more expensive, but it lasts a lot longer than the junk they sell in most stores.  And I've definitely noticed an increase in energy level in one of my cats.  I'm convinced this is a better quality nutrition and worth the extra money.  We've been feeding them this for the last year and I don't expect I'll ever switch to anything else.

review/summary: This stuff didn't work for our cat
review/text: I have no doubt this product contains quality ingredients, and for many cats it might be a key to good health and nutrition. We were looking for a high-quality grain-free food, and our cat wasn't able to digest this well at all. She seemed to like the taste of it just fine, certainly never ate less of it than other foods, but it gave her diarrhea which persisted even when we cut the food down to a 50/50 mix with her old food. As soon as we switched her to a different food, a more conventional healthy weight loss formula, the problem went away immediately. I don't mean to imply this will happen with every cat, and I can see there are many good reviews here (which is why we tried it, despite the price being quite a bit higher than our usual cat food), but I thought I should mention our cat's strong reaction. If your cat is sometime "iffy" with new foods, you might consider purchasing a smaller quantity of this first to make sure they can digest it OK.

review/text: Blue Buffalo has a long standing reputation for making top quality dog and cat food, and this product is no exception. While it is pricey, it is worth every penny. I noticed a much improved coat, among other things, on my cat after switching her to this food. One very important thing to note on this food, is that is grain free. Grain free is much higher quality food as grains for dogs and cats are not in their "normal" diet. The different flavors also make a big difference, so try different ones and see what your cat likes best!

review/text: My two cats just started their second bag of Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken dry food.  In the twenty years that I have owned cats, I have never seen cats so excited about dry food.  With other dry food they would eat a few bites and then walk away.  I would end up throwing away what they didn't eat after several hours.  With this food, they don't waste anything!  They usually eat their entire serving as soon as I feed them.  It must really taste good to them!  I'm very pleased with the ingredients and I've noticed how silky their coats are after starting this food.  This dry food and the Weruva canned food are definitely their favorites.  It's worth spending the extra money because nothing is going to waste.

review/summary: No more throwing up or hairballs!
review/text: What a relief! After almost a full bag between 2 cats, neither has thrown up since starting them on this food. I had started feeding them wet food around January because one of my cats had crystals in his UT. The vet recommended very expensive dry food (which was meant to make the cats very thirsty therefore would drink a lot of water which helps dissolve the crystals) Anyway, I "googled" the whole crystal thing and found that wet food can also help with crystals in the UT. For about 6 months they had nothing but wet food, and never drank a drop of water from their dish! I was amazed, and the crystals in the UT cleared up. Then, about 2 months ago they both started to throw up. I thought of a few different reasons, but could never come up with a conclusion. I had originally been feeding them Blue Buffalo dry food for many years, but not the Wilderness kind. I thought I'd check it out, read the reviews and found others had some success with this food and helped with not throwing up and hairballs. I AGREE!! The cats love this food, but they aren't that picky either. I'm ordering my 2nd bag today!

review/summary: Blue Buffalo Wilderness Cat Food
review/text: I felt that my 13 yr. old Siamese (Lester) with a sensitive stomach, sometimes overeating and throw-up problem would benefit from a  new "Grain Free" kibble.  After doing some research, I choose Blue Buffalo Wilderness over the Evo that I had been feeding for a few months (the Evo had major dust and I had to sift it before feeding..maybe 15-20% by volume).  Towards the end of the second BBW bag I noticed that Lester (and my other cat) were not eating their normal amount and their litter box wasn't as full.  Lester then was not cleaning up well after a #2, then in a couple of days stopped eating everything (even his daily wet food snack), we took him to a vet; blood work good, but x-rays show that he had large air bubbles in his stomach and upper GI.  He couldn't eat anything without throwing it up..nothing. The vet made no suggestions other than keep trying to feed him; and it was only after going to Petco and talking with their staff did we take action with a syringe, baby food (beef), electrolyte, and a high protein cat paste all slurred and injected every hour that we got him recovering after a few days.<br /><br />I can not be sure it was the BBW cat food that deteriorated Lester's health to very close to euthanizing, but I had not changed his wet food only his free choice kibble to Hill's Age Defying and he is back to normal now.  The Hills has grain, but the kibbles are smaller and easier to digest and I am suspisious of Blue Buffalo Wilderness and/or maybe that an older cat's system can not handle very high protein dry kibbles.  He was OK on Evo so makes me think that BBW was the problem.

review/text: I was told that you really want your tomato paste to be organic because of the concentration of potential pesticide/fungicide residue. In addition to this product not having these concentrated chemicals, it is a good quality and very flavorful product. The price point is excellent.

review/summary: Wonderful treat gone bad
review/text: My two dogs USED TO LOVE these treats. Just the right size - not giant (and therefore affordable) but they still took a while for them to chew through. These WERE their favorite treats. And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling. It's NOT a chicken wrap. It is a rawhide wrap that has been dipped in some kind of chemical/yeast/smoke flavor coating.

review/summary: Sorriest excuse for a dog treat I have ever purchased
review/text: Product says "duck wraps rawhide treats", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on.  Then the so-called rawhide is more like a 3 by 4 inch piece of cardboard, folded into thirds.  I know cardboard when I see it!  My dog likes to lick the brown stuff off, but then nothing.  And he even likes cardboard!! don't waste your money.

review/summary: Agree with "basted not wrapped"
review/text: Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being "basted" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product

review/summary: Will No Longer Buy These!
review/text: Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!

review/summary: These are NOT wrapped in chicken anymore!
review/text: This product has changed from the original that my dogs loved. These are NOT wrapped in chicken as the packaging and product description will have you believe. This is my 2nd attempt to get the old product without success. Evidently, these have replaced the quality product we used to receive. When I opened them I discovered these flimsy strips of rawhide that are now painted with this mystery substance. The rawhide is like very thin cardboard. There is absolutely NO chicken on these. I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product. My dogs would not touch these!! I will not be purchasing anything made by this company again. They raised the prices on these too, while replacing quality with crap. So disappointing!

review/summary: Great variety means no picky eaters!
review/text: We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the "regular" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.<br /><br />I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.<br /><br />Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it's a wash.<br /><br />If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:<br />*Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same<br /><br />*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount<br /><br />*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here!

review/summary: Very sweet, not terribly healthful.
review/text: I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth's Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the "Sweet Potato & Chicken" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.<br /><br />After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em - they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to "real" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too.

review/summary: Did a lot of research on this brand
review/text: According to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall, Earth's Best was always voted to be in the Top 5 of all the lists of reviews by Mom Links, Consumer Reports, Livestrong, Baby Health Sites.  Here is a excerpt from one of the sites (I think it was from eHow.com):<br /><br />The Center for Science in the Public Interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including Gerbers, Heinz, Earth's Best and Beech-Nut. According to the Center's report, Earth's Best did not use starchy fillers or "replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables." Earth's Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. Earth's Best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.<br /><br />Plus, my baby girl loves it.  Yes, it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods, but I just add a little rice with it and that fixes it.

review/summary: Baby's Best Pre-Packaged
review/text: We only use jarred baby food as emergency food.  I make all my little one's food and freeze it or give it fresh.  Yes, full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook, puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost $1.27 for 2 pounds?  I taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the Earth's Best line because they taste real.  It's not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go "what in the world was that?"  They use quinoa and kamut flours.  It is excellent all around.<br /><br />I believe that the apricot puree that other's talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food.  I make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown.  My baby doesn't care about the color of the food but I'm sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar - knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes are.<br /><br />Half of the jars in my case were popped up.  I wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars.  I called and they replaced the entire case free of charge.  This had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and didn't occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue.  I was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this.  Will continue to be a loyal customer because of this.  Customer service goes a long ways!

review/summary: Excellent variety, our 8 month old loves them all, but be informed water is the largest ingrident by weight on all 4
review/text: Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child's developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.<br /><br />Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.<br /><br />The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil<br /><br />There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the 'value' of this particular Earth's best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).<br /><br />Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Best's website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now.
