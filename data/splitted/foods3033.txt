review/summary: Great Coffee (from a non-coffee drinker)!
review/text: I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!

review/summary: Surprisingly good brew.
review/text: This coffee smells a bit like Starbuck's Breakfast Blend, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as strong which, in my opinion, is preferred.  There isn't, however, any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation.  Thus, when I made my first mug of Marley Coffee, I wasn't sure how much water I was supposed to use or how much time I was supposed to wait, so I chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes.  The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.  I measured out coffee as I usually would with a scoop and brewed it up.  My wife and I both enjoyed the result.  I would get this product again.

review/summary: Best Pod Coffee I've tasted
review/text: Wasn't expecting much but these pods make smooth lattes. I used the pods in my Krups psuedo esspresso machine. They worked fine. The coffee came out great. Add some milk and froth it, and you have one smooth latte. No mess, easy clean up. The pods smell pretty strong when you open the individual packet so that's a good sign. I also made some for friends just using the pods like tea bags. They were happy and said it was smooth coffee. So you have several options how to use them. I just might be buying more though I am usually a grind my own beans kind of guy.

review/text: These coffee pods smell very strong when you first open them. however; preparing them as instructed (8 oz. water per pod) it comes out so translucent and weak. Maybe the company just has not gotten the coffee grounds to water ratio right yet. For now I would not recommend this purchase.

review/summary: made my Saturday morning.
review/text: I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being "really good". I did the same on Sunday morning and diluted the amount to almost half strength and it still more than held its own as a great tasting brew. Don't know if I would use it as a replacement to the one I use consistently but would most definetly buy it as a replacement if I was unable to find my brand.

review/summary: Marley Coffee is tasty but needed a lot of trial and error to make it
review/text: I selected Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count based solely on a five sentence blurb in the amazon.com/VINE offering to me in its monthly newsletter to sample and to review. There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: "Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers."<br /><br />I don't own a "single server home coffee pod brewer," so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-

review/summary: Marley coffee
review/text: This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust. The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors.

review/summary: Nutty and Intense
review/text: First impressions of this coffee was not positive as the box contains no instructions what-so-ever as to what kind of coffee-maker is required for these pods. Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!!

review/summary: Good if you like Coffee
review/text: This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is "coffee flavored coffee", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning.

review/summary: Coffee good. Packaging not.
review/text: When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in "pods". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.

review/summary: Pretty good, if you have the right brewer
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.

review/summary: Good smooth coffee for the right machine
review/text: My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!

review/summary: Nice Flavor, Not Too Strong
review/text: Seeing a Jamaican coffee label, I assumed this would be a STRONG brew.  In actuality, it is a relatively weak brew.  It has a very nice aroma, and the flavor is well-suited to those who like cream and sugar in coffee (in other words, not bitter).  Aside from the flavor, the package is fantastic!  One pad into the coffee maker, dump the pad into the trash, and viola, cleanup almost complete.  So much easier than filter and grounds.  Less mess, more stars!

review/summary: I had to improvise but I LOVED it
review/text: By improvising I mean that I have no coffeemaker other than my humble gold mesh basket that fits into a cup. So I put the pod into the bottom of the basket, added a little water to pre-prime it -- and then added hot water. With a soup spoon I imitated the process that a coffeemaker that uses pods would do: I pressed the spoon into the pod several times, and VOILA!! A WONDERFUL brew emerged in the cup. I enjoyed a cuppa with NO residual stomach acid and no bitterness -- I didn't even need sugar. Later, I added some soy milk and the taste was just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I liked reading the dedication on the box. This coffee was grown with care, and lovingly dedicated to an incredible individual, Bob Marley.<br /><br />Even though I will continue to have to improvise when brewing this coffee, I look forward to enjoying every single pod.

review/summary: OK coffee, but there are better alternatives
review/text: I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find "burnt", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, NOT for a Keurig!
review/text: First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!

review/summary: "Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up For Your Coffee"
review/text: Bob Marley's son Rohan, besides being a noted athlete and musician, is also a successful entrepreneur, having started "Marley Coffee," the maker of "Marley Coffee, Stir It Up, Exotic Floral and Berry, One Love, Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffee," (fifteen single serve pods).<br /><br />Everyone in my family tried some of the coffee this morning and the results were generally very good; "smooth" x3, "nutty," x2, "nice taste," "I like mine a little stronger."  Pretty good comments from these life long coffee drinkers.  No one gushed that they were going to rush out and place another order, however.<br /><br />Bob Marley's name has been used to sell lots of things Bob probably wouldn't have endorsed while he was alive. To his credit, Rohan's signature actually appears on the outside of the box, so he is not technically appropriating his father's name.  He is asserting his own name and standing behind the product himself.<br /><br />Several of the drinker's this morning were hoping for a little THC mellow-out over their bacon and eggs.  Didn't happen.  However, everyone agreed that this coffee (which curiously doesn't smell that attractive before the pod is brewed) is worthy of the high-end packaging and its Ethiopian (and Jamacian) heritage.

review/summary: rich and smooth coffee
review/text: Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.

review/summary: Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.
review/text: I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.

review/text: Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say, "This side down." Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!

review/summary: Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.
review/text: The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!

review/summary: Jamaica Mon
review/text: Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.

review/summary: A Safe coffee that won't offend anyone
review/text: Comes in round, flat, pods so beware before purchasing. I just dropped one in the filter holder of my regular coffee maker used about 1 cup of water and it worked out OK. There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no "berry notes".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try. This coffee is fine for the average coffee drinker. It's not bold enough for the purist, but won't offend them either.

review/summary: Nice coffee but a little acid
review/text: It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the "tea-bagging" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a "coffee-flavored water" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds "single serve pods" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said "teabagging" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: "This side down"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.

review/summary: Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?
review/text: There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.

review/summary: Good Taste but Expensive
review/text: I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.  I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Coffee Singles</a>, which resemble tea bags. I place water in the coffee cup, heat it in the microwave, and then plop the Folgers in the hot water.  The result is acceptable, but not great,<br /><br />Although, the Marley coffee may not be designed for tea bag use, that is how I tried it.  I have found that the flavor is good and the taste is strong enough depending on how long the packet is left in the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Marley coffee can be used in a tea-bag manner, has good taste, and is fair trade coffee.  On the minus side, it costs around twice as much as the Folgers.  I will have to continue to experiment with it to see if it justifies the extra cost.

It came with a cooling pack, so that the chocolate would not melt. There are only 12 cookies in a box and they are about the size of a 50 cent piece. However, I was very surprised at how wonderful these cookies were. The mix of chocolate and cinnamon made it perfect. I would just recommend letting them sit in the frige for an hour before trying one.

Over the years I have tried various brands and by far IM Health Soy Nut Butter is the tastiest and most consistent.

review/text: I had been ordering another instant espresso coffee, but when I went to make and new order I found the price had almost tripled!  Wow! What a shock!  A little research and I found that there was a recent new owner of the company and, apparently, they were looking for a quick profit on their investment.  I also found out that this price increase was the cause of my local grocers no longer carrying that "gold" Italian labeled product.  My usual routine is to fresh grind my coffee beans and use a french press to brew my morning coffee.  I enjoy a full bodied strength more like a European than American weaker flavored coffee.  Ferrara was a good choice for my individual taste.  I own an espresso machine and make my own brew on occasions and, of course, that is the best.  But for an alternative, for me Ferrara has been an excellent price pleaser and a satisfying taste.

Originally I was in a gourmet store and this is where I found this coffee. Then after trying to locate this brand at a place with a better price tag I found it at World Market, but then they stopped carrying it, however, perhaps they have it back on their shelves again, I do not know. Soon later I began buying it from Sunset Foods in Highland Park, IL.  They, like World Market, had it in stock only now and then so I began to order it special from them.  After a few orders I decided to check Amazon since Amazon has become so much more of a store for me than books and movies!  Now I have an Amazon SUBSCRIPTION for this product to ship to me automatically.  To get the BEST PRICE I  put this item in my WISHLIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF WATCHING FOR THE PRICE TO LOWER, & WHEN IT DOES I ORDER FOR AN IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT AT THE BEST PRICE *STILL* THROUGH MY SUBSCRIPTION WHICH GIVES ME AN *ADDITIONAL* 15% OFF THE THEN SALE PRICE!!  The product itself: I have found this instant coffee consistent over the decade I have used it.  Normally you will find this in Italian stores or high-end stores.  I like the CONVENIENCE of getting a GREAT cup of SMOOTH coffee just heating water in my microwave and then adding the Ferrara Instant powder.  If the water is hot enough the drink will have a lovely thick crema on top.  Note: This coffee does not taste like actual coffee, but it doesn't taste anything like any other instant coffee on the shelves either, not like any other instant espresso from any company, and certainly nothing like those grocery store brand instant coffees which I find gross..., however, I admit find grocery store brand ground coffee like Folgers and Maxwell House, etc. to taste like garbage in my opinion!  For daily drip (real) coffee at my house we use Lavazza or the online subscription Gevalia brand.  So why do I also use an instant coffee like Ferrara?  Well, as I said, I love the SMOOTH taste, it gives a comforting hot drink that has a lovely flavor, and with hot enough water you will get a thick crema on top once you drop the powder into the hot water.  It is fast, and quite wonderful.  And may I add one more thing?  It takes away hunger for a couple of hours!  I just love it!!

review/text: My husband and I are coffee snobs and have always ground our beans fresh in the morning. We bought this to take along on camping trips because we wanted to try something better than instant coffee while backpacking. We were so surprised when this turned out to be so good! This is so much cheaper than buying coffee out and super convenient when all you have is a microwave and a cup, also the flavor is full and robust. I will definitely always have this on hand at my home and office. Try it, it is really quite delicious!

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: The other day, I spent an entire afternoon fantasizing over how delicious a cup of coffee might taste if it were made entirely with heavy whipping cream :D (very much out of character for me as I typically enjoy my coffee black).  Anyways... In order to make this happen, I figured I'd have to buy me some of that 'instant coffee' stuff.  Just as I was about to leave my grocer with a plastic container of Folgers in hand, I saw this pretty little glass jar and thought "Why not?".  I figured with all the cream I planned on drowning it in, an instant espresso might be the better way to go.<br /><br />My initial plan was to microwave a mug filled with pure heavy whipping cream, stir in two heaping teaspoons of instant espresso and bam! - instant heart attack.  A moment of sanity came over me as I was pouring the cream into my mug and I stopped half ways filling the rest up with water (it's still a whole lotta cream), no sugar.  The end result tasted exactly as I had imagined it would.  So much more satisfying then a warm cup of cocoa.  Rich and creamy, it reminded me of coffee icecream without the sweetness (isn't icecream mostly just cream and sugar?  I'm sure my concoction wasn't nearly as bad as a big bowl of icecream... or at least that's how I justify it ;).<br /><br />That said, I've also used this to make a cup of regular espresso in the morning and it really is by far the best instant coffee I've ever tasted.  I normally use my Keurig for a quick cup of Joe but this really feels like a special treat.  A 2 ounce jar runs $4.79 at my grocery store - so for a pack of 6 and free shipping, this is a bit of a deal.  For convenience, I'll probably continue to purchase locally but if they were to ever stop offering this brand, I now know where I can find it online.  I would highly recommend this brand/product to family and friends.

review/text: At a point when Medaglia d'Oro became unavailable on Amazon I decided to try this.  It had good reviews and I didn't know if Medaglia would ever be available again.<br /><br />I could not find a way to make this stuff palatable.  Not as espresso, not as a latte, not hot, not cold.  It is very bitter and, despite many reviews to the contrary, I could BARELY discern a flavor that was coffee-like.<br /><br />I made it through one jar and I didn't drink most of what I made with that. I threw the remaining five jars away -- quite a blow to my grocery budget but I just couldn't drink this stuff.<br /><br />Thank goodness Medaglia d'Oro is back.  Pricey, but back.

review/text: This has a terrible taste to it.... hard to describe how sour and bitter it seems to my tongue.  i would never buy this stuff again.  the best kind to use is Medaglia .... no question, its a hands down winner.  we did taste testing side by side with four people and there was 100% agreement on Medaglia as the best flavor.  Not one of us preferred Ferrara. We bought a 6-pak of this based on all the great reviews here.  what an unpleasant surprise it was when it hit our tastebuds....ouch!!<br />struggling to get thru the last 2 jars...next time, we will get Medaglia......a far superior product in our opinion.<br />btw... If you use lots of sugar, you may not notice the ultra sub standard taste as much :)

review/text: Based on the favorable reviews I decided to give this a try.  The name may be "instant espresso", but really it is just an odd tasting instant coffee.  Add enough hot milk and it is drinkable as a latte.  By itself it has a rather acidic, vegetal taste.  If you enjoy real espresso this will be a disappointment.<br /><br />I have no idea what the reviewers giving this 5 stars were thinking.  Other instant coffees sold by Amazon are much better.  Taster's Choice French Roast is the best I have found, both for drinking straight and with steamed milk <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IES">Taster's Choice French Roast Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce  Canisters (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/text: My 3 American Indian dogs are picky about what they will eat; especially the youngest who is just over a year old.  We leave their dry food out for them so they can eat when they want, but the youngest just won't eat enough.  When this food arrived I gave him a handful and he chowed down like it was a treat.  He is eating and loving it!  Highly recommend this food if your dogs are the picky kind.  The small size is great for my oldest dog who is just over 17 years old.  She often has trouble with other brands because they are too tough or too big for her to eat....she's lost a few teeth.  She too is picky and now loving this food.<br />I like the fact that it is primarily chicken.  We, as a family, eat mostly chicken and rice; nice that they get the same thing in a way that is better for them to eat.<br />Overall a great product!

I honestly don't think I will be buying these again, unless they are on a REALLY good sale. Otherwise, I'll stick to the normal Hunt's Diced tomatoes.

review/summary: The orange is my husband's favorite
review/text: My husband decided he did not want to start buying a bunch of artificially sweetened junk when he was diagnosed with diabetes.  Instead, he chooses options like Boylan Seltzer. It is much more mild than other seltzer waters  we've tried and the orange flavor in particular ALMOST tastes sweet.  He loves to drink his straight from the bottle- I like to kick up the orange flavor even more by putting it on the rocks with a squeeze of fresh orange- but either way, it is a refreshing alternative to tap water when you're thirsty and don't want something super-sugary.  It might be hard to get kids to drink this without mixing in a little juice, but as a healthy alternative to soda, I fully recommend trying it.

review/summary: nearly the most amazing noodle bowl i've had...
review/text: as i've written in a previous review, this is not your standard ramen noodle. it's a rice noodle, so it's clearish/translucent. it takes a bit more heat to cook to being nice and ramen bowl-soft (so be sure to nuke it if you're using a work place coffeemaker for hot water). but it's very nicely firm, and has a rather nice, large window during which it stays so.<br /><br />this, though, is probably the best ramen bowl i've ever had (which was kind of shocking to me since the packaging isn't covered in a foreign language). the only way it could get any better is if it were using udon noodles (usually $3.50/bowl at asian markets). it's a soy saucey/seasamey brothy soup. nice and light like the other Snapdragon bowls; not overpoweringly strong (and salty) like most other asian ramen bowls. i can actually drink all of the soup, unlike most other bowls where i dump the remaining liquid at the end.

review/summary: GREAT COOKING OIL
review/text: I am not convinced that Safflower Oil will help you loose weight.  Sorry Dr. OZ.  HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is the very best Cooking Oil that I have ever used. Even when frying hashbrowns, the oil stayed clean enough to reuse twice.  I forgot that I had the burner on high one day, and it took a very long time before I noticed the oil slightly smoking.  It adds NO unpleasant taste to foods you fry like some oils, and in fact I really like to thin my Ranch Salad Dressing down with a couple tablespoons of Safflower oil.  Yes it changes the taste slightly, BUT I LIKE THE NEW TASTE BETTER.  I can HIGHLY recommend this as your primary cooking oil, and I like it FAR BETTER than even Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The Price is reasonable too.

review/summary: Aweful
review/text: This is probably the most disgusting tea i've ever tasted, and after tasting it and looking at the leafs i can't justify calling it yerba mate. The leaves are yellow, and look like grass that has received too much sun. If you have had yerba mate before then you know that the leafs should be a forest green color and the smell should be very leafy. This tea has none of the characteristics that yerba mate does, as for the taste it's aweful, it tastes beyond burnt and very bitter, do ur self a favor and purchase a different brand.

review/summary: As good as Guayaki but a lot cheaper
review/text: I love mat&eacute; because of its relatively high caffeine content compared to other teas. It makes for a great caffeine delivery substitute for those of us who get sick (or are otherwise adversely affected) when drinking coffee. The caffeine buzz is a lot more mellow and clearheaded for me as opposed to the anxious and pulse pounding effects of normal coffee.<br /><br />This particular variety of mat&eacute; is smooth and refreshing and is pretty robust in terms of how much you can screw up the preparation while still having a decent cup of tea. It tastes great hot or cold or anywhere in between really. It's also priced well; it costs less than half the price of a pound of Guayaki.<br /><br />Tl;dr version:<br /><br />Good:<br />-tastes great<br />-high caffeine<br />-easy to prepare<br />-super cheap<br /><br />Bad:<br />-the small size of the individual tea particles makes it difficult to clean out of a french press

review/summary: Just add more onion and enjoy!
review/text: I use all of the New Orleans Gourmet products, especially the beans--love the seasonings--being a lazy senior citizen, after washing the beans I simply spray the crockpot with Pam, add the water, the beans (don't even soak them), the seasonings and turn the crockpot on high for four hours and then reduce the heat to low and cook until desired tenderness. If you are adding chicken or sausage, don't add it until the end of the cooking period.  Then just make some Southern Style Cornbread and enjoy.

review/text: I was hyped to get this childhood favorite on my doorstep until one by one as I started to open them I found that they had mostly melted. The sour powdery coat on these candies isn't as good when its mixed in with the deformed candy :( doesn't seem they are being stored at the correct temperature. I just expect more when I am paying so much for a pound of candy....

review/summary: Poor Packaging and Very low Grade
review/text: The quality of Marshalls Creeks Rosemary is less than ideal.  There is more stem than rosemary in the container which makes for a very rough measurement and stem pieces throughout food.  If you don't mind a little rough stem then Marshalls Creeks is just for you.  Also the "sealed" container is not really "sealed at all"  I had spider webs and mold (somehow) in some other herbs I purchased from them.

review/summary: Absolutely Scrumptious!
review/text: This product is delightful--you would never know that it is a "raw" food because it has the taste and consistency of a ginger brownie. Obviously, it's not vegan because of the honey, but the honey imparts a texture rarely found in raw food--that of softness and sponginess. The only problem is that 2 oz is very little for $4.65 per bag, which once again demonstrates how expensive raw food can get! Oh well! C'est la vie... If you're into raw food, don't mind honey and don't mind the price, try these out--they taste great!
