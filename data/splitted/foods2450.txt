review/text: Eat Natural Almond and Apricot Bar with Yogurt Coating- - - These taste soooo good it is hard to stop with just one!  I love them and have signed up for subscribe and save.<br />I have not had any foods with yogurt in a long time because this is the first one I found that does not contain Corn, as in corn syrup etc.  This bar is easy to eat, soft enough, and moist enough to take a bite.  Yet a bit crunchy similar to rice krispies (in texture).  This is the first flavor of the Eat Natural brand I have tried.  I am so pleased I will sample other flavors too.

review/summary: Yummy, Sweet, & Crunchy -- What's not to like?
review/text: I am very happy with this bar. It happens to be made entirely of things I'm not allergic to, which is the main reason I bought it in the first place. Once my box arrived and I actually tried one, though, I went back and ordered two more boxes. My husband and I both love these (and he doesn't have dietary restrictions like I do). They're dessert-sweet, but not sickly-sweet. The nuts provide hunger-busting staying power. They hold up well in my purse. I like the other flavors, too, but this one's my favorite so far.

review/text: The product quality is great, but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D'Oro brand due to the ongoing strike. The retail price clearly marked on each package is $2.79, so a case of 12 packages should retail for $33.48 plus shipping. Since the cost of this product is $47.95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages, make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D'Oro before ordering.

review/summary: Good start on quality, Great price!
review/text: I have 3 terriers and one is an allergy dog. She's got both seasonal allergies and is sensitive to food ingredients. After years of treating the symptoms with drugs I started reading about how a "species appropriate" diet would help with her allergies. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098253311X">Dr. Becker's Real Food for Healthy Dogs and Cats: Simple Homemade Food</a> I never knew by reading the label on dog food what was good or bad, now after learning about how dog food is made, what ingredients are most important and what I should avoid, I've started feeding "grain free" and as low a carbohydrate feed as I can find commercially. We must be careful that dog food isn't overrun by ingredients that have too many carbs like potatoes (sweet or otherwise) peas and grains. Dogs wouldn't get those in their natural diet unless in the stomach of prey. Be careful, when a food ingredient is listed on the label multiple times, the food is mostly that ingredient. So it could be all potato and not meat. Anyway... In an ideal world I would be cooking for my dogs, but I just don't have the time or the freezer space for that. After much research, trial and error, I've found Merrick's Whole Earth Farms Adult Chunky Loaf Dog Food, to have quality ingredients for a really decent price. While there's a slightly higher proportion of carbs from carrots, sweet potato and peas and a little less in protein, its a good place to start. My dogs love it, it smells good and I rotate this every other day with a higher quality feed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFR4S">Instinct Grain-Free Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 13.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> to keep my costs down. This line of feed from Merrick is made with high quality ingredients and even though I leave kibble out all day, my pups dance around the bowl at dinner time to get this canned food.  What's nice is that since they don't use grain or too many carbs, my dogs get good nutrition and their stool (yeah it gross but that's a factor in buying dog food) is more firm, small and less odoriferous. sometimes when changing food, you must introduce the new brand slowly so that their system can adjust. My allergy girl is doing well and I only have to treat seasonally when its really bad outside.  If you'd like some help to determine if the food you buy is really good for your dog, I've found www(dot)DogFoodAdvisor(dot)com to be the best place for reviews of both wet and dry dog food. I may not agree with everything they say, but its a wonderful place to start. I know that your 4-legged friend will do well with this brand. The only reason it got 4 stars was that it needs a wee bit less in the carbs.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: I buy the Merrick Whole Farms dry food and my dog loves it, so I thought I'd try their canned food. Seems to have quality ingredients at a great price. Unfortunately the first time I gave it to her she vomited right away. I then mixed it with brown rice and she was fine for a few days. Then I gave it too her alone again and it gave her diarrhea. Hate to be gross but she can handle only a little at a time of this canned food, don't know why. I was giving her Eagle Pack canned and never had a problem at all so I'm going back to it. I will keep feeding her the Whole Earth Farms dry food because she likes it but now the price has doubled - used to be $8.69, which I thought was a bit cheap anyway, but the doubling for the same size was a bit of a surprise.

review/text: One of my dogs has certain food allergies and therefore we have to be careful in what he eats. One dog is a Saluki and the other is a Westie. The ingredients look very wholesome and both dogs like it. I am impressed that Merrick came up with another line of dog food. Our dogs have been fans of their other products; we have tried their other wet and dry foods, as well as their treats. This one is more affordable for their everyday diet. My husband has given it thumbs up: doggy pate, but with not too much tartar. I am very pleased that we can get this through, Amazon along with free shipping.

Honestly, I can't really say I would notice the difference, but there is still the annoying "bait and switch" at work here, so buyer beware.

review/text: First of all, this brand of sparkling sugar is supreme.  It really is the best.  The sugar truly sparkles and stays nice & crunchy after baking.  I use it for so many different things: muffins, on top of royal icing on decorated cookies, on spritz cookies, cupcakes, shortbread.  I'm sure there are many other uses. But the best thing is, this amount of sugar for this price is such a steal!!  I recently bought a small 7.5 oz jar of this same sugar and went through it with a double batch of spritz cookies.  And that 7.5 oz jar cost me $7.00!!  Ridiculous!  But I needed the sugar in a hurry so I paid the price.  And the fact that Amazon will send you TWO of these containers for around $30.00 is just plain incredible!!  I wish I could afford to purchase every single color of sparkling sugar that India Tree makes in these huge containers but that would add up to a lot of money.  One color a payday maybe???

It is a high protein food so its not great for 7+ year old dogs but wonderful for normal adult dogs.  Perfect for dogs with grain allergies.  Whenever looking for food stay away from dog foods with ANY corn or by-products.  Eukanuba and Iams are CONSTANTLY recalling their food.  I work at a local pet shop and in the past year they have had recalls 5+ times, no other food has been recalled.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: Innova made the first grain free dog food. I was feeding my Great Pyrenees Innova because at the time it was the best avaialable and any food  containing white rice, corn, or wheat caused her too chew on herself, lick her feet and gave her ear infections and a terrible odor. When the Evo line was created by Innova I switched her to that. I have have never had any issues with my dog she is 11 years old without any ailments prone in this breed or any senior dogs. For the reviewer that fed it to her large breed puppy...Evo has always maintained that this food be for adult dogs it was never meant for large breed pups. It has a very high calcium content not good for large pups that need to grow slowly. I also find it hard to believe an ingredient change caused myriad health problems and that Eukanuba was the answer for an ailing dog. Eukanuba stopped being a quality food in the late 1990s. Evo has always had the exact formulation with the exception of the added taurine in the ingredient list and the peas now in the cat food. There has been a huge back lash towards Innova lately do to their being bought by Iams. So far the food is still made at their own plant, and ingredients are the same. My Pyr is hypersensitive to changes in diet I have yet to see any difference in the quality of this food. Now it seems every manufacturer has gone "grain free" they split ingredients so 3 types of potato products etc. they use more veggies and fruits. Check these dog foods and read the meat content the kcal etc.. Evo still contains the most meat at 80% and still the only one I feed.

review/summary: Doggie Diarrhea!  Back to Blue Buffalo Wilderness...
review/text: Our three dogs have been grain free for over a year, and we were feeding them Taste of the Wild almost that whole time.  However, they had TERRIBLE, persistent gas everyday, so we decided to try a different brand of food.  We transitioned our boys to Blue Buffalo's Wilderness line (grain-free), and they did wonderfully for about four months - very little gas, healthy coats, and minimal dog-doo, too (which is a big deal considering we have a Mastiff, a Boxer, and an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog).  Amazon didn't offer Blue Wilderness for Prime (free shipping), so I was going to the store and lugging heavy food bags at least twice a month.  First we decided to try Nature's Variety Instinct (grain-free line), which gave them slightly more gas and couldn't be purchased locally.  We like to buy on Amazon, but sometimes, with three big dogs, we run out faster than I anticipate - having a local store for emergencies is pretty important for us.  We went back to Blue Buffalo for a couple months, and then next we decided to try EVO - all of my research said this was the absolute BEST.  Well, as the title of this review indicated, all three of our boys got miserable diarrhea.  We transitioned our boys slowly, but once we went over one-half EVO, all three of the boys filled the yard with 100% liquid stool.  Poor guys!  We transitioned them back and once they were below fifty percent EVO, their movements went back to normal - but only after two days of constipation.  Our boys are back to feeling good, and we're back to buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness.  You don't know unless you try, I guess, but I feel terrible for putting the boys through that.  Good luck to everyone searching for a new favorite food.

review/summary: Great selection
review/text: I have Evo and Orijen with my dog her whole life. She is healthy, with a shiny coat. The vet says her bloodwork is pristine. This is great food. Some people have complained that their dogs develop stool issues. Dog food - like all foods -- can cause problems for some animals but not others. Don't blame the food! Just switch to another one. Any food can potentially cause a dog problems. I also think it is interesting that the low-raters who complained about a new ingredient failed to list the ingredient. Post hoc ergo propter hoc?

review/summary: My puppy looks amazingly HEALTHY!
review/text: My puppy is a four-month-old mutt that weighs just over 40 pounds. I've been feeding him EVO since we brought him home at 9 weeks, and he looks like it. Literally the first thing any vet says upon seeing my puppy is, "He looks so healthy. [check ears, eyes, belly] What are you feeding him?" His coat is so glossy that it looks like it's just been slicked with oil, but it's surprisingly soft to the touch. His eyes are bright, he has plenty of energy, and he just looks and acts super-healthy. Although he has occasionally had loose stools (this food does seem to be low in fiber), we've fixed that by adding a spoonful of pumpkin every now and then. He considers this is a treat, and it's a super-cheap fix.<br /><br />Innova offers a feeding calculator on their website, and I've found this very helpful in determining how much to feed puppy. He gets three walks a day (total of about an hour), and I feed him according to this calculator plus I use extra EVO as treats. This approach is spot-on for him - he's never been in the least bit over- or underweight. [...]<br /><br />I'm docking a star for cost and availability. Because puppy is so big at this stage of his life, he's eating about a pound of this food each day. I can't get this food locally, so with shipping we end up spending around $65/month to feed the dog. I've *very* reluctantly had to switch to another food because of this. However, I'm hoping to switch back later on when he is older and doesn't need the extra caloric intake of a puppy.

review/summary: Fantastic food!  Don't listen to the haters...
review/text: We love this dog food and so does our dog.  Reading all of these bad reviews, they sound like advertisements for whatever other food they recommend (Blue Buffalo whatever...).  The bottom line is, read the ingredients label and find out for yourself what is in the food.  There's nothing but great stuff for your dog in here...I don't know how all dogs would suddenly get diarrhea from eating food that consiste of chicken/turkey/vegetables/etc.?  Obviously there are other great foods out there as well, but this one is terrific, my dog loves it, and it's reasonably priced for what it is.  Our dog has always been very healthy with this food, has a great coat and plenty of energy.  We couldn't be happier with this.  Again, don't take anyone else's word for it...just read the label and pick out a food that works for you.

review/summary: Be careful
review/text: I know that today many manufacturers push this "grain-free" diet for dogs...reminds me of the Atkins diet for humans. Good for some not for everyone. Long story short, I tried to give my 65 pound border collie lab mix this food by slowly adding it to his diet. Within two weeks he developed awful diarrhea and started throwing up every now and again. Sure enough, once I stopped and replaced it with Fromm's duck and sweet potato (not completely grain free but still very good in my opinion)<br />and Fromm's Surf and Turf, he turned into a healthy dog he's always been. I am not trying to advertise Fromm foods here but just wanted to warn other about this particular Evo formula. It's not good for every dog.

review/text: I usually feed my dog Dr. Harvey's, which he thrives on, but sometimes like to give him crunchy dog food just for variety. Received a sample packet of this dog food at a fund-raising festival for a local animal shelter. Fed my Bichon just a small handful of this food the next day, and while he loved the taste, he was UP ALL NIGHT WITH DIARRHEA that lasted into the next day. He's still recovering. I absolutely will not take a chance with this food again, especially after reading that some other reviewers had similar experiences.

review/summary: Perhaps they should warn people when they change their ingredients...?
review/text: In Nov/Dec of '09, Innova decided to change the ingredients in this particular line of food. No need to let your paying customers know. $400 worth of vet bills later, and a bout with pancreatitis (my dog of course), I realize it's this food that is causing the problems. They later confirmed in email that they did in fact change the ingredients; however, they did not confirm whether they would pay my vet bills.<br />Not to mention, they also changed their guidelines recommending this food NOT be fed to large breed puppies, whereas it was previously fine.<br /><br />They tout themselves as some Natural, good for your dog, food, doubtful.<br /><br />AVOID

review/text: I too researched the best dog food for my dog.  I wanted her to have the best and EVO was listed as one, based on the composition of the food.  Hundreds of dollars later, and a dog who can't keep solid food in and has to take Gall Bladder and Liver medicine, I was forced to go back to research the food.  Finding that the composition has indeed changed, I've throw it all out.  Three hundred dollars in dog food and at least that much in Vet bills and medicine, I've switched to Eukanuba.<br /><br />I was forced to give this product one star, but if I had my way the product would be removed from Amazon's site completely.

review/summary: IMPORTANT INFO FOR BUYERS U NEED TO KNOW
review/text: Procter & Gamble - A Probing Look at Corporate Ethics<br /><br />Iams and Eukanuba Dog Foods<br /> In 1999, P&G purchased the Iams Company, which included the Eukanuba dog food brand, for $2.3 billion.<br /><br />Prior to the buyout, Iams was a respectable family owned and operated dog and cat food company. Iams and, Eukanuba in particular, were a cut above other mass market dog food brands, and were only available through specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. (Note, one can't compare their original foods with the quality of our present products, as premium all natural dog food, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1990s).<br /><br />Shortly after the acquisition, P&G expanded both Iams and Eukanuba to the mass market, making it widely available in supermarkets and retail stores such as Costco, K-Mart and Walmart, across the globe.<br /><br />Within months of the takeover, it became very apparent that changes had been made to the formulation of the foods. There were numerous accounts of dogs and cats suddenly developing various health issues and dog food allergies -- from diarrhea to intense itching, brittle and poor quality coats, skin rashes, hot spots, and even blown coats.<br /><br />The packaging remained unchanged, and no notification was given to retailers, pet owners or vets. (Note: Pet food companies are not required to list ingredient changes on dog food labels for 6 months -- a legal loophole for P&G).<br /><br />After much publicity and a huge public backlash, P&G admitted to switching ingredients from rice to barley, but denied making any other formula changes. They went as far as adding a PR page to their website in an attempt to dispel what they referred to as "rumors", and insisted they were continuing to use the same quality ingredients as before!<br /><br />In April 2000, P&G implemented another strategy in an attempt to further reassure the public of their "emphatic commitment to maintaining the premium quality of Iams and Eukanuba dog and cat foods" - and that - "any product changes that occured were designed to enhance the product". They convened an independent seven-member panel, known as the Iams Quality Review Board, consisting of veterinarians, breeders, research nutritionists and pet specialty store owners. The members met at the Company's Ohio plant to observe and review the manufacturing process and analyze and compare ingredients lists against product samples obtained over the past twelve months

Mayacamas foods promptly replaced it and it is just great!  If I could change the star rating here I would give them a 5- 4 for the product and an extra star for being a super nice company to deal with!!!<br /><br />I used this product a few years ago and was delighted with it, then I bought 12 packages of it from Amazon and have tried making it 4 times, and each time is a disaster. It separates and is grainy.  I am very disappointed. I am not sure if I got a 'bad batch' or if Mayacamas did something to this product, but whatever the issue is- don't waste your money!

review/summary: Perfectly fine for a trip, expensive for home use
review/text: Our doctor prescribed this formula for our twin boys at the hospital. I realized the day before we left the hospital that we didn't have any of this formula at home. I quickly ordered this 1-qt jug in the hope that with the first few days home being very frenetic and this jug would work well trying to keep the kids fed.<br /><br />To use this jug, you must keep it refrigerated after you open it and you must use it all within 3 days.<br /><br />It was discovered after the first few days, it was just as convenient to use warmed tap water and mix the powder formula than to have to warm the bottle with the premade formula.<br /><br />We ultimately decided to just keep using the powdered formula for home use and for short car rides (in a insulated cooler bag with a cold pack). For longer road trips, I could see this staying in the ice chest. Overall I just didn't find the jug all that useful at this point.<br /><br />As for the formula itself, the boys have taken it just fine but with all the iron, they get a little constipated. I recommend purchasing this formula in the 6-pack carton of powder canisters.

review/text: With regard to another reviewer's not getting 2 pounds of nuts, I'd guess the problem was carelessness or lack of training, rather than dishonesty. The only reference to "2 pounds" is that the shipping weight of the product is 2 pounds. It is normal for Amazon product descriptions to list a shipping weight, which comprises the product weight (the weight of the nuts in this case) and the shipping-material weight. Unfortunately, neither this Classic basket nor the Explore basket listed elsewhere specifies the product weight, and the price per pound was calculated incorrectly using the shipping weight, not the product weight.<br />Incidentally, most of these Sahale varieties are delicious to the point of being addictive - they use premium ingredients, which is why they cost as much as they do. I like the Sing Buri. Beware, however - it's easy to eat most of a 2-ounce package in a session.

review/summary: Great nuts and good for you too!
review/text: Awsome. I first started eating these snacks when I found the LAST bag of the Valdosta Pecan variety. I thought they were awsome, but I could never find them at Costco again. I have been trying out a few of Amazons subscriptions and it hit me that maybe I should search them up. Of course they were available and I got a subscription to the Valdosta Pecan. Then I found these gift packs on sale for LESS THAN MY SUBSCRIPTION! YES! And it's a variety pack, which makes it even MORE AWSOME! Each flavor is unique and is AWSOME in it's own way...@ 60% off, I plan to buy a ton and keep them in stock and give a few away as gifts. These are REALLY GREAT snacks! I am certainly hooked! I didn't like the Tuscan Variety as much as the others because they don't saisfy a sweet tooth. I plan to ust them in some veggies or a soup!

review/summary: A mixed bag of good and bad (get the pun??)
review/text: As with any selection of differing flavors, this Sahale snack basket has some good and some bad. The good? The Sing Buri blend is the best (cashews, pineapple, peanuts and chili) but the parmesan herb tuscan almonds is just plain awful. Of course, this is based off my personal taste, so your own opinion may differ.<br /><br />That said, the price is steep - you are paying about $3.50 per bag, which is in line with the retail price at your local grocery store. I recommend keeping an eye on the Warehouse Deals version and buying these when they have a month or two left on their Best Before date - that is when the price is about 30% of the usual retail price.<br /><br />Start with the assortment, then only order the flavors you liked best, because chances are you won't enjoy each of the six ones in this assortment.

review/summary: Squares remind me of San Francisco days at Ghirardelli Square
review/text: My two favorite flavors of Ghirardelli chocolate squares are these Dark Chocolate with Caramel and the Dark Chocolate with Raspberry, but these are the best in my opinion.  I find the chocolate to be very firm and the caramel to be very creamy, less sweet than others I've had.  They are as pleasant as many creme caramels I have had, the burnt sugar flavor coming through.  Some of the squares actually were broken with the filling oozing out, but I rather enjoyed these as long as they didn't stick to the wrappers.  I'm not fond of licking the candy off the wrapper and discard those.  For this reason, I cannot give these a 5 star review.  I find that the wrappers are very easy to remove by simply tearing down the center seam and the confection can easily be popped into the mouth or nibbled while holding onto the chocolate inside the half wrapper.  These are especially good with a cup of strong coffee.  I have found that young children who like milk chocolate and/or candy bars were not fond of these.  They didn't mind the raspberry filled dark chocolate, but these were more of an "adult" taste that they didn't favor.

review/summary: Poor chocolate, great filling!
review/text: I love dark chocolates, the darker the better. However unlike the many other Ghirardelli dark chocolates this one isn't good.<br /><br />The chocolate itself doesn't melt smooth, has bad mouth feel, and is absolutely flavorless. The chocolate actually reminds me of the poor tasting choco-bits in some ice creams, just waxy and lacking of flavor. And it doesn't even taste the same as their regular 60% chocolate. If Ghirardelli would have used the same chocolate as their other filled delights then it would actually taste really good.<br /><br />The caramel filling is the only redeeming quality of the chocolate. Smooth, full flavored, and not overly sticky (like some chocolate makers tend to use).<br /><br />Overall this is a poor quality chocolate that is waxy and flavorless with the only good thing being the caramel filling. Ghirardelli really dropped the ball on this one and am a bit surprised that they allowed it out on the market.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy a different flavor or brand, this is definitely not Ghirardelli at their best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Caramel filling tastes great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waxy, doesn't melt well.<br />The chocolate itself is flavorless.

review/summary: Taste Great!! But Bad For You!!!!
review/text: Most ghirardelli chocolates are good, especially the dark chocolate. But read the nutrition facts on the side of the bag. The dark caramel has trans fat in it. For those who don't know what trans fat is, guess what? Neither does your body. The stuff is man made as a cheap replacement for certain ingredients. It was originally created as a replacement for candle wax. So think about melting candle wax down, eating it, and having it harden in your body. Your body doesn't know what trans fat is so it sends it straight to your arteries, which clogs your arteries. That is what is called Heart Disease (clogged arteries). So having 1 or 2 of these candies probably won't kill you, but they are kinda addicting. Also think about other food you eat and whether or not they had a little bit trans fat in them. Quickly a little will turn into a lot, and not even a little bit of this stuff is ok. Think about your heart and the potential health risk. Ghirardelli needs to stop using cheap ingredients and go back to the drawing board on this one. FYI: Another term for trans fat is hydrogenated oil.

review/summary: Quite good for a canned product, with a little spiffing up
review/text: I like Campbell's Chicken and Dumpling Soup (the thin condensed stuff), and know that Campbell's is the parent company of Swanson (or the other way around- they're related regardless).  I decided to give the canned chicken and dumplings a try.  I'm pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />First off, this stuff is THICK.  It's not some runny sauce; I had to add about 1/4 cup of water to make it easier to stir while heating (I did it on the stove).  I also added a can of white meat chicken to boost the protein content.  I threw in some dehydrated celery, green onions, parsley, and some fresh ground black pepper, then let 'er rip on the stove (medium-low heat).<br /><br />The dumplings are about 5/8 inch cubes (just like the soup), and quite tender.  The chicken is obviously canned, but I needed to add more for the protein content.  The flavor is mild, but with above add-ins, good enough to put it on my shopping list to get more.  They are about $1.25 per can in the grocery store I go to (not a big-box place, but great prices).<br /><br />Per label information (not including add-ins):  Serving size:  1 cup (whole can is 14.75 ounces, so the 'about 2' servings per can is off).  Calories: 230  Fat- 10 gms, carbohydrates- 24 grams, fiber- 2 grams, and protein- 11 grams.  Since I was only eating that, I ate the whole can, which comes to 1.7 times the 1 cup values.  The whole can has 391 calories (before add-ins).<br /><br />Add a can (drained- or just use the can juices instead of water) of chicken, and it ended up with about 40 grams of protein total, and no measurable change in fat or carb count.<br /><br />I'll buy it again.  :)

Cake-like and sweet, they're absolutely delicious with lemon, orange or lime curd or simply some jelly. We like to have breakfast for dinner with these scones, some fresh fruit and turkey sausage or bacon.

I definetly recommend this candy, but I would go into a store and get it. Amazon's price is like $6 more than going into Target and buying it. Although Amazon has a great deal on Ghiradelli's Dark Caramel. Maybe the Truffle will come on sale. Enjoy!!

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I got a few bottles of this for christmas, and like it a lot. It's a very simple, minimalistic sauce, with nothing but pepper, and a little bit of salt and vinegar. I can barely taste the vinegar, which is great as I'm not a fan of the very vinegary, Louisiana-style sauces. Just pure habanero flavor; bright citrusy tones, and long-lasting but not overwhelming heat. It's not a use-on-everything sauce, but for dishes that go well with that distinctive fruity habanero taste... yum.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's a very thick sauce, more of a puree, really, and the bottles have narrow mouths. It doesn't pour well at all. I end up holding the bottle upside down over what I'm cooking and hitting the bottom like it was ketchup to get any out.

review/summary: Great tasting sauce + some kick
review/text: In my opinion, this is the most "complete" hot sauce that I've found so far.  Many sauces have a great flavor but don't pack enough punch in the heat department..  Other sauces are VERY hot (which I like) but don't taste particularly good in my opinion.<br /><br />This particular product satisfies both departments:  It won't kill you with heat, but is certainly hot enough to satisfy most anyone, and is likely too hot for lightweights (those not used to spicy food).  Don't drown your food in this sauce, because it WILL light you up if you overdo it, and it is more than capable of coming back to haunt you several hours later, hehe.  Anybody experienced with HOT food knows what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Oh, and this is a great tasting sauce.  I love using it on homemade tacos, enchiladas, etc. to add an extra dose of rich flavor.  Yum!  Out of any sauce that I would classify as more than just "moderately hot", Pure Habanero has easily the best flavor of anything I've tried (so far).<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce if you want a great tasting sauce that is sure to get your attention, yet still bearable.  Only the most hardcore hot sauce junkies would be likely to find this sauce too wimpy.  5 stars!

review/summary: Delicious and Satisfying Jelly Beans...
review/text: I received my pouch as part of a birthday gift basket from my parents. Problem is my birthday isn't until November 29th. I just so happen to be home when the Amazon delivery arrived and opened the box expecting it to be my own order ... only to find delicious Jelly Beans! Early Birthday present win! Anyhow, onto the review!!<br /><br />Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are easily my favorite snack food on the planet. These little beans come in a wide variety of flavors, 49 for this 2-pound pouch. Flavors such as: Green Apple, Mango, Raspberry, Red Apple, Plum, Kiwi, Peach, Coconut ... and Wild Flavors like: Buttered Popcorn, Bubble Gum, Dr. Pepper, French Vanilla, Toasted Marshmallow. The pouch has a guide telling you what each jelly bean flavor is, and looks like. Often included with gift box / sampler varieties of Jelly Belly is a small card that tells you how to make flavor combos to enhance your Jelly Bean experience. A prime example wouldbe Very Cherry. By itself it is a very rich - cherry flavor. However take 1 cherry + 1 Dr. Pepper and you now have Cherry Dr. Pepper flavor.<br /><br />* POUCH DESIGN *<br />The pouch itself is quite durable and does a decent job when put into a "standing" position, however I wouldn't trust it. Once you start to devour the beans inside the package becomes less and less stable. The great thing about this package design is that Jelly Belly saw this happening and included a resealable zipper inside the pouch. This zipper seal is quite durable and passed my spill test; I sealed the pouch then turned it upside-down with all 2-lbs of beans in it over a bowl, then began to shake and try to break the seal. No failure.<br /><br />* JELLY BEAN QUALITY *<br />Now for the main event, the Jelly Belly's themselves. The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand. There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket. Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it. This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat. Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure.<br /><br />I will admit that not all the Jelly Bean flavors are my favorite. I am not a fan of Cappuccino, crushed pineapple, or Strawberry Daiquiri plus I'm mixed on others... But that is what will happen when you have 49 unique flavors. I will list all the flavors at the end of the review as well as nutritional information in the "Comment" section associated with this review.<br /><br />** OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars. While the jelly beans are outstanding and still continue to be my favorite snack food of all time, it is an expensive product. This was purchased on sale for about $11 or $5.50/lb (11/14/2011). In a way that's a pretty decent price for Jelly Belly beans per pound, even when compared to some of the warehouse stores out there, but still very expensive if you compare it to a simple 24oz tin of generic jelly beans at the local supermarket for $2.99. Despite Jelly Belly beans having a high "per pound" cost, they are worth the asking price in my opinion(I wouldn't pay more than around $7.99/lb though). The quality is exceptional and the variety of flavors make Jelly Belly beans truly a Gourmet Treat.

review/summary: nothing beats the real thing!
review/text: i ordered jelly belly jelly beans for two of my sons that no longer live at home, as well as a bag for home.  they are absolutely the best jelly beans--and they last longer because everyone enjoys eating them one by one, guessing the flavor.  no need to waste your money on the big jelly beans or the wannabe jelly bellies, just get the real thing, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: One big, wet clump
review/text: The jelly beans arrived today and when I opened the pack it was just disgusting! The jelly beans were all wet and stuck together! Either they got too hot while being shipped, or the warehouse where they are stored itsn't climate controlled, either way it was totally disgusting.

review/summary: Great beans, bad price
review/text: Ordered these last month - they're great!<br />But I was at Bed Bath and Beyond yesterday, and bought the same identical bag for $17.99 (regular price - not on sale or using coupon). If you're near a Bed Bath and Beyond, save yourself $10 and buy your Jelly Bellys there.

review/summary: big ol' bag of puffed quinoa!
review/text: This bag is HUGE! I bought it to use in a simple recipe (mix with peanut butter, refrigerate and then roll into balls and dip in dark chocolate...SO GOOD;) After making the recipe a few times, I STILL have a ton of puffed quinoa left to add to cereals, sandwiches, ...just about anything that could use an extra boost of protien.<br /><br />Great product!

review/summary: Delicious!!!
review/text: I have a big family and appreciate a tasty snack that is wholesome and organic.This item fits the bill!! My sons really liked this treat. When toasted they are very fragrant and crisp, almost a cinnamon graham cracker like pastry with a rich fruit center, BUT lower in sugar than most snacks!! You will be suprised at how good they are!

review/summary: Organic Toaster Pastries decent healthy snack/breakfast food
review/text: I like these because the are fast, easy, healthy, and reasonably tasty quick breakfast or snack food. Definitely taste better warmed in the toaster. I especially like these because they don't have the sugary frosting on the top, but they are still a little sweeet with the fruit filling.

review/summary: Yummy Blueberry beats out Strawberry in my humble opinion
review/text: I bought both the Blueberry and Strawberry versions of these through Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program. I shop at Costco a lot and have been disappointed that they only carry the Frosted variety of toaster pastries. I refuse to pay the grocery store prices for a treat like this so, for years, I've done without. Both Strawberry and Blueberry are good but I find the Blueberry to have more fruit flavor than the Strawberry. Either way, if you're like me you'll enjoy this product and, the Amazon Subscribe & Save price is quite reasonable too!

review/summary: not too sweet
review/text: I was surprised and happy to find that these blueberry toaster pastries are available on Amazon.  I got turned on to them originally when I bought a box from my local co-op, but the co-op later dropped the UNsweetened varieties, keeping all the flavor options but only the ones with frosting.  I've always liked the impact these not-too-sweet toaster pastries have on the taste of coffee; I eat half of one every morning.

review/summary: Really taste like blueberry
review/text: These toast up very nicely.  The dough is crisped, the the filling is nicely warmed.  They do not leak in the toaster, either.  Really like that they are not frosted.  These are so hard to find in a grocery store.  Check the expiration date, though.  All ours will expire in December,2012.  We have had to eat these quicker than I planned.
