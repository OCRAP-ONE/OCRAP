review/summary: Don't Put It on Thick and You'll Be Fine
review/text: This stuff definitely serves the purpose it was made for, and it doesn't taste as bad as some of these reviews would lead you to believe. Bear in mind, fondant is not icing and so you shouldn't expect it to be all that sweet. That said, I would make sure you don't put this stuff on too thick because it definitely wasn't meant for that. Also, I wouldn't recommend this brand for covering cakes completely. Just use it for creating little shapes to put on a pre-iced cakes like it shows in the picture on the box.<br /><br />In the box you'll get four fairly-nice sized packets of fondant in four colors: green, red, yellow, blue. Upon opening each package of fondant, you will find that the fondant has the consistency of Play-Doh. I would make sure you do whatever you need right away as it does dry in maybe an hour or two. Refrigerate and wrapped up any remaining amount, as it'll help keep in the moisture. Then you'll need to bring it back to room temperature to work with it again.<br /><br />Given the price, size, and convenience of the item, I'd say that the current price of about $11/unit is a pretty good deal, especially if you're able to use Supper Saver Shipping. Hope this helps!

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: I am a very novice cake decorator but have some artistic skills so fondant has been fun for me and I had plenty of practice with this stuff before I tried this package, but I have no means an expert opinion. The colors were vibrant and the quantity in the package was ample. This stuff was not as plyable and did not taste quite as good as the other celebrity cake decorator brand one I had used in the past. Where it was stronger was in longevity, it stayed pliable longer and when I went to reuse it, it had stored better. No store bought fondant is super tasty and this stuff is edible but not very desirable.

review/summary: Make Your Own
review/text: I ordered this to make a Lego Ninja cake for my sons birthday. I wanted the bright read and yellow colors to really pop. First off it taste awful not at all what I expected. Secondly it is hard to roll and drys out very quickly. Third when trying to use a paint brush with a little water to smooth the edges on my lego blocks the color in the dye ran all over. Last but not least This kit is designed to make shapes and such to put on a cake not nearly enough of any one color to cover and entire cake. This week I am off to my my older son an xbox cake and I will certainly just be using  the marshmallow fondant recipe I found on the internet it's what I ended up using on the Lego cake and it easy to make, taste amazing and the color doesn't run.

The pasta cooks to perfection with a taste that is out of this world.

Giftees heap praises on me AND Rossi Pasta. An extra bonus comes when you reach the end of the pasta. There is a super wooden crate that is perfect around the house use.

review/summary: Raw Organics going back to Paradise
review/text: Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.

review/summary: Nice Idea but...
review/text: It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay.

It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/summary: Excellent Low Carb Bread
review/text: This bread is excellent. I love the taste and texture of this bread. It is a very dense bread but I like that. I went from 100% whole wheat to double fiber whole wheat and finally to this bread. And I found that I liked each one better than the last. If your preference is white bread you probably won't like this bread. But if you like real, hearty whole grain breads you will love this bread. I would eat this bread even if it weren't for the low-carb factor. I prefer it to regular bread and it's a lot healthier, even if you don't need a low-carb bread.

review/summary: High Carbohydrate Nightmare
review/text: This bread tastes great because it isn't low carbohydrate it's a very high carbohydrate product that should be in the candy isle.  One slice of this bread made my blood sugar go up 50 points.  I ate two slices the second time and it went up 105 points. It took a while for me to figure out what was causing this dramatic increase. I looked at the label only after I ate it because I still believe in the honesty of our business culture. How can a company sell bread like this when the label is an outright lie? This bread probably has 40 carbs in each slice. I shouldn't have to do my own test on everything I eat. I should be able to trust that what it says on the label is fairly close to the truth. This company should be investigated.

I thought that ordering 44 K-Cups for this price was a great deal after shopping around. Upon receiving my order, there was a single box that in no way could hold 44 K-Cups. I contacted amazon and they immediately refunding half the cost of my order, which is EXACTLY how customer service should respond. It might have been a simple error, or it could be something bigger.<br /><br />Bottom line: Check your order and ensure you get what you paid for.<br /><br />Product: 4.5 Stars, Great Tasting Coffee and a Great Alternative to Starbucks at less than half the cost.<br /><br />Vendor: 1 Star. Product Image shows a 22 Cup box and this is what I received, even though I paid for a 44 cup box. Vendor should update image to reflect two boxes.

review/summary: Puroast Provides Strength and Taste of the Coffee Bean, Without the Coffee Burn
review/text: A popular t-shirt reads, "Coffee isn't a drug, it's a vitamin!"  And like all vitamins, it's had benefits and side effects for the thousands of years it's been morning's drink of choice. A recent article in Canada's Globe and Mail suggests drinking enough coffee fends off type 2 diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gallstones, Parkinson's disease, and liver cancer. The article continues, saying coffee may even protect some women from breast cancer.<br /><br />But a later article in the same publication warns, "If you have heartburn or reflux disease (GERD) you should limit or avoid (coffee)....both regular and decaffeinated -  (It) relaxes the muscle that keeps stomach acid from rising into the esophagus and throat. Coffee also stimulates acid secretion in the stomach."<br /><br />Puroast Low Acid Coffee is no bitter pill to swallow for anyone wanting coffee's benefits without its burn. It's Dark French Roast blend, brewed on a Sunday morning, was rounded and flavorful with a slightly nutty aftertaste, not at all harsh.  It's obvious audience is those suffering from acid reflux or other upset stomach ailments. Yet anyone wanting a good cup of coffee will appreciate its taste.<br /><br />Satirist Alexander Pope praised coffee "which makes the politician wise/And see through all things with his half-shut eyes." Goodness knows that profession provides heartburn enough without daily coffee worsening it! Puroast provides a dark, rounded cup of coffee with savory taste and the caffeine buzz many need, without the acrid aftertaste some coffees leave behind. Recommended.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste As Bad As It Smells
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with severe acid reflux, so I thought I'd give this product a try. I purchased a bag of the French Roast from a local retail store. While I didn't find the flavor as bad as some other reviewers, it certainly doesn't have a typical coffee flavor. The closest thing I can compare it to is chicory coffee and even that's not completely accurate. Another review here describes a vinegar smell, but I don't get that at all. I opened the bag expecting that wonderful fresh coffee aroma, but the smell is something else completely. The good news is the taste isn't as bad as I would have anticipated, although I was hoping for more. If you aren't picky about coffee flavor and just want something to replace your morning cup, give this a try. Just don't expect a true french roast boldness. Also, my understanding is it's not just the acid in coffee that causes problems, but also the caffeine, so this isn't a complete solution. I think I'll just limit myself to one cup of real coffee and hope for the best.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I just tried Puroast French Roast to try and avoid heartburn.  I found that I needed to be generous with the amount of grounds I put in the coffee scoop to get a rich cup, but the taste was surprisingly good and it will definitely wake you up.  The acid content is definitely lower -- haven't suffered any heartburn after drinking it.

review/summary: Easy on the stomach, rough on the taste buds.
review/text: Bought this because I have chronic acid reflux, but I love and need coffee. This coffee never smells good no matter if it's still in bean form, being ground, being brewed, being drank, whatever. Very poor taste. I've always been a Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, or Papa Nicholas drinker and this brand doesn't come close as far as flavor. It is light on the damaged stomach/esophagus though. That and the fact that the money was already spent on this is the only reason I'm still drinking. It's never taken me this long to get through 2.5 lbs of coffee beans.

review/text: I'm just about finished with my first pot of Hamakua Coffee from Fire Mountain Farm and must say the Farm delivers what it advertizes.<br /><br />Pleasant aroma in bean, grind, and brewed phases. Good flavor, not over powering. As a test, I cut back on my usual amount of beans for grinding and was delighted that the flavor did not wash out.<br /><br />So nice to know where to find pesticide free products!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying Fire Mountain Farm Macadamia nuts!

It is important to me that it is totally organic, while the flavor comes through without knocking you over.  I recommend it highly, along with the farm's macadamia nuts.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, but expensive
review/text: NOTE before you buy: this is an 8oz bag, not the 1-pound bag I'm used to buying.  I'll admit that I overlooked this detail, even though it's very prominently in the name of the item on Amazon.<br /><br />The coffee arrived promptly, and had great aroma and taste - strong and smooth (I grind it myself and use a French press).<br /><br />I respect the Fire Mountain Farm's approach to farming in Hawaii, and the coffee really is great, but this is too expensive for me to drink daily.  My tastes may just be too crude, and I am not a person who strictly buys organic.  If organic and sustainable farming are important to you, then you might find the price more reasonable.<br /><br />As a gift, it's not a bad way to introduce someone to excellent Hawaiian coffee, and it's less expensive than many other gift ideas.

review/text: Great HOT stuffed olives! I love spicy, but these are just about over the top! But in a good way. I use them in martinis. But usually grab one and eat it before I even shake one up. I have also given them as gifts. My friends & family love them as well. If you find they may be too hot, you can always drain the liquid out and replace it with dry vermouth. Then they become a little more mild and ready for your cocktail. Either way these are delicious.

Don't expect Jelly Belly bean texture and, unlike other Jelly Belly products, they do not taste like actual peas and carrots, but rather apple and orange.

review/summary: Low Quality. High Calorie and Fat.
review/text: I wanted to love this. I was even prepared for it to be somewhat like a cheap Circle K Cappuccino. Unfortunately, the product itself is really greasy. You actually see grease in the cup. It is 80 calories per serving and the taste it really really powder tasting, like powdered milk.  I wasn't expecting a Starbucks Cap out of the K-Cup, but I was expecting a little more than this.<br /><br />I read the reviews and they were sort of mixed, so I chose to try it, but I won't buy these again. They will sit on the top cupboard shelf till i am desperate I guess or throw them away. Three boxes of them... EESSSH<br /><br />I also now realize these aren't eligible for return... so that sucks. Oh well, buyer beware, right!

I did not want some fancy cappuccino, but something comparable to the stuff I pay $1.50 for in the mornings.  Well, this stuff was very good.  VERY comparable to the machine cappuccino, sweet, smooth, good flavor.  For under $10 a box it comes to around .40 a cup which is great compared to the $1.30+ at the store.  I definitely would recommend it.

review/text: I first tried this at my mom and dad's house (in the Vanilla flavor) and was hooked.  Then, after checking out the stats, I was even more hooked and ordered the Caramel right away.  I do a low sugar or sugar free diet and this fits perfectly into my diet as a treat.  With only 80 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 5 sugars, it's a win/win situation for me.  I do brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8, otherwise it's just a little too sweet for me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product and will order more when I run out.

review/text: I loved this Caramel Cappuccino. It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this.

review/text: I do enjoy Hazelnut flavored creamers as well as french vanilla creamers in my coffee, I know the flavors aren't exact but  since I enjoyed them in coffee I might like them in cappuccino as well.  I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.  Unfortunately the hazelnut isn't so great, and not b/c it's 'convenient store' cappuccino either.  I prefer that over 'real' stuff.  It smells wonderful, but just something in the flavor that's lacking and it leaves a weird after taste.  Just wish I didn't buy the 36 count.  Definately buy the French Vanilla variety if you are trying to choose between the two.

review/summary: SPIKE this with some Irish cream liqueur
review/text: yes, this is flavored coffee already...but, it's a great base for some spiked refreshment.  i like Carolans or Baileys, but Saint Brendans works well too.  be sure you use a tall cup so you have room for the extra spirits. what could possibly go wrong with that! i'm signing up for a subscription with free shipping.

review/text: Like others said, if you like the ones that come out of the dispensers at the mini marts & gas stations then you should like this. I use the 10oz setting on my brewer so it doesn't water it down too much (it's a powdered mix like the hot chocolates). Also my wife is not a coffee drinker but liked this.<br /><br />Placed order when it was out of stock, but only took about week to arrive via prime.

review/text: For a former coffee shop owner, I'd like to think I have some discriminating taste when it comes to "fast food" coffee. I was quite happy with the quick version of a vanilla cappuccino, although I'd consider it more of a latte. I do like it even better if you brew the smaller cup of espresso through the machine.

review/text: I am really surprised that this products gets such a bad rap some times.  It is not coffee, it is a coffee DRINK, and it is darn good.  If you ever go to the grocery store and purchase a cappuccino drink that is ready to go and you just have to add hot water, this is<br />similar, and it is good!!!  You could add a little whipped milk on the top if you want, but you don't have to!!  I am very happy with this product!!!

review/summary: Bootleg Product?
review/text: First of all, tasted pretty good.  BUT, contacted a few Keurig K-Cup authorized on-line  sellers and was told by all that Grove Square are NOT approved by Keurig and using them will void the warranty on your brewer. Was told they are a "pirated" product.  Upon inspection, I discovered that the content are powdered milk, sugar, artificial flavors and INSTANT COFFEE!  Not even real coffee. Not sure if I'll buy again but does taste like Cafe Vienna instant coffee products with the convenience of Keurig. All authorized on-line sellers cannot carry them due to contracts with Keurig. Guess, buy at your own risk.

review/text: This is the first coffee I tried when I got my Keurig.  I was so disappointed in the flavor; tasted like plastic (like drinking bottled water that was left in a hot car).  I thought maybe I hadn't cleaned the Keurig enough so I put through more water and brewed another cup...same horrible taste.  I would not recommend this brand to anyone.

review/summary: Grove Square K-cups - DO NOT BUY!
review/text: I ordered Grove Square K-cups - the cappuccino variety, for my Keurig BREWER.  As with all of the other K-cup coffees I've purchased, I expected it to be filled with coffee for my Keurig to BREW.  Unfortunately, it is filled with instant coffee and flavored with creamer and sweetners.  It tastes HORRIBLE.  I'm pitching the rest -it's not even worth donating to our church.  If I'd wanted Sanka, I would not have purchased an expensive coffee brewer - the microwave would have been good enough!  What I WANT is a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

review/text: I just tried this product for the first time this morning and was eager to do so. Boy, was I disappointed and disgusted! I tried with all my might to get through a fourth of the cup but I simply could not do it. This so-called cappuccino tasted greasy and overly sweet at the same time. I did not even know that was possible for a caffeine product. I would have rather had gas station cappuccino than this garbage. I wish there were a way for me to return the 22 K-Cups that are left but, sadly, they will just end up in the trash. What a waste of my hard-earned money.

review/summary: If you like coffee.. buy something else
review/text: Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)

review/text: I was really excited to get this product, as an alternative to straight coffee, for my keurig. Sadly, not only am I disappointed that it is not frothy, as the picture on the box shows, but 1/4 of the box are defective k-cups. The edges of the foil on top are not sealed, so the cups contents have leaked and the machine does not function properly if you still try to use them. I feel that I definitely wasted my money.
