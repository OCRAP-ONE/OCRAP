review/summary: The Best Tea - Period
review/text: Being a life long tea drinker, 3-5 cups a day, (why I drink decaf) and a Lipton Man for 50+ years, I tried PG-Tips Decaf about 6 months ago.  I had tried every other black tea through the years but always went back to Lipton.  This is actually a tea I can follow the instructions and steep for minutes instead of a few seconds and it doesn't taste bitter at all.  Simply the Best black tea and I'm not switching back.

review/summary: Fabulous cup of decaf black
review/text: I love a hearty cup of black tea, but have been trying to cut down on my caffeine. Herbal teas just aren't my thing. My previous experience with decaf black tea has been that they end up weak and wimpy in flavor. I assumed it was a side effect of the decaffeination process. Apparently it doesn't have to be, because PG Tips has created a wonderful, strong, smooth cuppa in decaf here.

review/text: I'm still on the fence with this tea. I've been drinking Lipton decaf iced tea blend & thought I'd change things up with a different decaf iced tea. This tea is really strong & so full of tannins, if I oversteep it, it's awful. It's almost a reddish color when it brews. It brews much faster than Lipton does, and using 2 bags for iced is almost too strong. It goes from good to too-strong in no time at all. I do like the bags they use, maybe that's why I'm getting it too strong, it def. brews faster with the style bags PG uses. I'm hoping this tea grows on me.

review/text: I was looking to try an imported "everyday" decaf English black tea and came upon PG Tips. I had heard of this brand but never tried it. I was expecting it to at least be better or as good as Lipton but I found it disappointing. I thought it tasted and smelled a bit musty and have to sweeten it quite a bit to make it more pleasant tasting. I will not be purchasing more of this and will stick with Twinings for now for my English black tea.

It's also available in Decaf and so much tastier than our US brands. It's made by Brooke Bond, Canada, who also make Red Rose which has been my usual tea for years but PG Tips is the best!

review/text: S&B brand Extra Hot Golden Curry sauce compliments many foods with a delicious Curry taste!  I think they make it in Mild, Medium Hot, Hot, and Extra Hot heat levels. I prefer Extra Hot but that is my particular taste.  I highly recommend it to spice up dietetic bland foods such as Tofu or Tofu noodles.  It will not raise your sugar or add significant calories.  After eating two large bowls of Tofu Curry with this sauce for dinner my blood sugar tested only 70, and I've lost 45 pounds in 90 days!  Look for recipes on the Web.<br /><br />This is a delicious taste treat to add to your diet or regular meals!

review/text: I have not purchased this product on Amazon but I always keep it on hand. I love the extra hot, but it is also good in the milder varieties if you can't take the heat. I agree that this is one of the best curry mixes on the market. Very easy to prepare, very tasty, and you can pretty much add whatever vegetables you happen to like, along with your choice of protein.<br /><br />I buy it in Asian groceries locally and can definitely recommend this product. Buying it in bulk this way can save you quite a bit on shipping as opposed to buying just a single pack from another vendor. Either way, it's a great product if you like curry sauce.<br /><br />If you're not sure about the spicy heat level, try one of the milder versions first.<br /><br />Five stars for the product.

review/text: Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

review/summary: BEWARE OF THIS MISLEADING PRODUCT!!
review/text: The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted! I've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers (PLUS, I read the excellent reviews!)  and this is hands-down the worst!<br /><br />When I finally read the actual ingredients (I had assumed it was stevia) and discovered that the very 1st ingredient wasn't stevia..but RICE MALTODENTRIN, I was shocked AND angry!  I have a liver disorder and cannot pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver!  Hence, the use of stevia, an all natural product.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia. You must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels."<br /><br />Read more:[...]

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

review/text: I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/summary: Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...
review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered, to stop the waste of excess plastic that may end up in landfills if not recycled.  I wrote to the company three years ago and asked if they would consider package modification, but never was acknowledged.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

review/text: I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.  The packaging is very wasteful--most of it is empty.  Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me, better than Trader Joe's.  I've never had Kal's to know what I am missing.  I mainly use the stevia in tea and Kool Aid lemonade.  DH even liked my tea w/ stevia and he is a big sweet tea drinker.  I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.  That would have been nice to have.

review/summary: The Only Place To Buy This....
review/text: Now does a beautiful job on this Stevia Extract. Wonderful flavor for cold drinks, and oatmeal, and nearly anything. And Amazon is the only place to buy it. The absolute best price and superb delivery. This is our second 1,000 count bag of Stevia via Amazon. By the way, the Stevia is actually packaged in white envelopes, not the blue envelopes shown in the advertisement. And the 1,000 envelopes come in a clear plastic bag with the best (open and close) nylon strap closure we have ever seen. You will get your moneys worth.

review/text: I ordered this at 3pm one afternoon and it was at my home by 3pm the next day even though I only selected two day shipping. Rapid shipment=happy me!! Also, I like this Stevia as it is organic. With stevia, it is a bit of a different taste from your standard sweetener - but way more natural than anything else one can buy other than dates! Dates wouldn't sweetened my coffee very well either. We use this mostly in our morning coffee but for other uses as well (iced tea, etc).

He used 4 pouches to feed our family of 7 and there was enough left over for he and I to bring to work for lunch the next day.<br />With a special promotion the cost was just over $1 per pouch which is a resonable price. Without the promo price it would cost more that I'm willing to pay.

review/text: My husband thought this blend was okay, though not as good as the Breakfast Blend (he gives 3 stars).  I did not like it at all (1 star).  It left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth long after the coffee was gone.  I tried it both hot and iced, and experienced the same bitterness.  We tried making it weaker and stronger than suggested, brewed from different bags, alternated with the Breakfast Blend, and used fresh water - every pot tasted bitter to me and just okay to my husband.  Can't recommend.

review/text: At 9.1% ABV, this is one of the heaviest Oktoberfest beers available.  It has a nice copper hue, a noticable hoppiness, and a lingering head.  It's a decent beer.  However, in my humble opinion, it's a little bit heavy for an autumnal lager.  Not bad though...<br /><br />This lager is listed as an Avery "Dictator Series" beer -- I've taken the marketing bait; I'm going to be on the lookout for the other gimmick beers in this series.

review/text: These oats are fabulous. True natural flavor and don't degnerate to a pot full of gelatinous slim. There is nothing better than traditional Scottish style oats. However, the Amazon packages was non-existent. The oats were shipped in the original manufacturers carton and suffered at the hands of the shipping company with several of the 12 packs bursting open. Manufacturers cartons are designed for palletized shipping not individual shipping subjected to the likes of Fedex or UPS. Nonetheless, you can't beat these oats - Oat's just aint oats unless they're Scottish style oats.

It does not have the gummy consistency of other oatmeal and I prefer its flavor to others.  I've been eating oatmeal for 60 years now and I think I can speak as "one who knows good oats." These are good oats. Also, buying it as a club member makes my favorite oatmeal even more affordable.  I used to drive 80 miles to stock up.  Amazon sure has made my shopping a lot easier.

review/text: I eat oatmeal for breakfast every day.  Nutritionally the Old Wessex brand is identical to Walmart's Great Value Old Fashioned Rolled Oats.  The price of the Old Wessex oats is $2.42 a pound and the Walmart oats cost $1.14 a pound.  So my yearly cost for Wessex is $106.50 and for Great Value it is $50.16.  Thus the Old Wessex oats cost $56.34 more per year.  The Old Wessex oats definitely taste better, no question about that.  But do I want to spend $56.34 more per year for the identical nutrition?  I don't choose to spend that extra money.

review/text: Lego theme Party Candy....kids loved it!<br /><br />The kids at my son's 7th Birthday loved these sweet-tart flavored, stackable, Lego-like candies, perfect for kids parties.<br /><br />My Son had a Lego themed B-day party and as the kids stragled in I sat them at the table and gave them a bag(labeled with names) of these block candies. They busied themselves with building and eating. When everyone arrived I set a timer and had them build the talest stack of candy they could by the time the buzzer went off. The party started off with the apparent Lego theme, an activity, a game, and leftovers for the goodie bag! I would buy them again....I did not buy from this particular company.
