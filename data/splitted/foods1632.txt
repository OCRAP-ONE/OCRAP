review/summary: Best tea EVER!
review/text: This tea is, by far, the best tea I have ever had. I've tried many different teas (green and white mostly, not a big fan of black tea). I originally tried the white christmas tea at my neighborhood farmer's market during the holidays, but haven't been able to find it since (except for on Stash's website, where the shipping is pretty pricey). So, I got this brilliant idea to try to find it on amazon, and lo and behold, here it is! Shipping was reasonable, and I received it within a week. One thing I noticed that I think they could have done better with was the packing of the tea. The individual tea bags are sealed of course, but they were all scattered about inside the box. One thing I did like also is the fact that the expiration/use by date was clearly stamped on the outside of the box. It's always good to know you're getting a fresh product. All in all, I would say this is a good, reasonable way to purchase hard to find teas.

Their products are nice quality for an American tea company(their leaves are still broken up and stuffed in a bag,but it's hard to find a YUMMY loose leaf chai.  This company may still sell loose teas but the chai is not as flavorful as in the bag. If you like your chai tea to have a little more flavor this is the chai to buy. I serve it with milk, cream or egg nog. Sometimes I double the bag to get more flavor.

We find little or no differences between the caffeinated and decaffeinated varities and as a result tend to migrate our tastes to the decaffeinated variety.  This is not a weak version but a full strength tea to console your sole.  Great going, Stash!

review/summary: Green grass clippings, ginger peel & peach pit
review/text: Having just now finished 3/4 of a cup of this vapid brew, and dumping the rest down the drain, I felt compelled to write a review that will hopefully be heeded by all.  I usually make my ginger/peach tea by brewing a cup with one bag of ginger tea, and one bag of celestial peach tea, which brings out the very best of both.  So I thought I'd save myself a little money and buy one bag that would, in theory, do the same thing.  I was sadly mistaken.  This being my very first experience with the Stash brand I honestly have to say that I will not be a return customer.  There is virtually NO ginger flavor, and the peach is more noticeable before brewing than after.  In all the reviews I have ever written over the years I would implore you to heed my advice on this one.

I don't know if I got a bad batch but the tea don't seem as good as it use to be. It tastes only a tiny bit better than say Tetley or Lipton. I remember it to be far superior. I just don't know. It's not stale because the expiration date is the end of 2014. I wish I picked another brand.

review/summary: Decaf. White Tea w/ Raspberry: Simple, Unsophisticated
review/text: I ordered this because I enjoy white teas, and decaffeinated white teas are hard to find, which is what I prefer iin the evening.  The taste is simple and clean, which is the goal of a white tea, but is not very exciting.  I would have preferred a slightly more complex, developed taste, but will play with the brewing and see if it improves.  The raspberry is almost non-existent, which is a positive in my mind.  Whenever trying a new tea with fruit flavors, I am nervous that the fruit will be overwhelming, which isn't the case here.<br /><br />While not necessarily a function of the tea itself, I was disappointing that it arrived in a plain cardboard box, with the tea bags just dumped in it.  This is clearly a wholesale lot, divided up for smaller orders on Amazon.  A shoebox full of tea bags everywhere is not very conducive to storage, and I suspect that I am not the only tea drinker that would have appreciated a slight bit of order in the packaging.

And I love vanilla anyway. I brewed the first teacup and after almost 10 minutes the tea tasted like flavored hot water. Mind you it was not a cinnamon or vanilla flavor. More like a watery Chamomile and a vague Sarsaparilla. I put another tea bag in to strengthen it but it just tasted like some sort of cleaner at that point with no cinnamon or vanilla to be found. I gave the other 99 tea bags away. I just found Good Earth Sweet and Spicy caffeine free Organic tea with no artificial anything, so hopefully it will do the trick when it arrives!

review/summary: Best Herbal Equivalent I found to Earl Grey Tea!
review/text: Please keep in mind that Earl Grey (my all time favorite), has a strong Bergamot (citrus) flavor and that's the reason this Lemon Ginger is pretty much the only herbal tea I like.<br /><br />I drink A LOT of tea during the day, mostly black (not so good, I know).  Over the years I have tried different varieties (black 'straight up' or 'decaffeinated', green, red, white and herbal teas) and ALWAYS come back to 'straight' black Earl Grey.<br />As healthy as the red or herbal teas might be, I simply do not really care for the taste of most of them.<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger is the only one that I keep a boxful of on hand and brew it often in the evening (when drinking caffeine before the bed would not be such a bright idea).<br />Taste-wise, it is the closest to the Earl Grey without caffeine, that I found.

review/text: I love chai... hot, cold, in recipes (chai granola, chai muffins). However, after 2 in the afternoon, I don't tolerate caffeine very well. I got this tea to make Chai Latte concentrate for a nice evening treat. I brew 4 tea bags in a quart of water and add Stevia to equal about 1/2 cup sugar. I keep the quart jar of concentrate in the fridge and mix about 6 ounces of concentrate with about 6 ounces of cold milk, then add a tablespoon or two of French Vanilla creamer. If it's really hot out, I can serve it over ice. If it's a cool evening, I can warm it up on stovetop or microwave.<br /><br />This is a no-frills purchase. The 100 tea bags come loosely packed in a box. That doesn't matter one bit when you're enjoying your chai latte, though! ;-)

Also, it's caffeine free which is nice. There is a bit of an after taste which is the sweetness I love about it... but some people don't like that about it.  Definitely worth a try!

review/summary: The same great flavor, just packaged in bulk
review/text: Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime. Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

It also reduces one's health risks for major illnesses.<br /><br />I love tea.  I really do.  This brand comes in a variety of excellent flavors.  If you like your tea sweet, then you might want to add milk and/or sugar to your drink.  I like my tea plain and this tea has a very strong and rich flavor.  This is strong tea and it is a good, hearty drink that will go well with any meal or as a stand alone.  If you are convalescing, then you will want this tea.

review/summary: An economical way to purchase favourite Tea!
review/text: We drink a lot of tea in my house and Stash Premium Lemon Blossom Herbal Tea is a favourite for afternoon tea. The problem is we could no longer find it in the local supermarkets. We turned to Amazon.com hoping to find it and we did! Not only did we find the tea, it came in an economical and convenient 100-count box and was reasonably priced. Each teabag comes in it's familiar wrapper, so you don't have to worry about how to store loose tea bags. This was important to us, because our pantry is in the garage; so once the shipping box was opened, the individual tea bags were protected from the elements. We will be buying our Stash tea from Amazon.com from now on!

review/summary: Not the flavor I expected..
review/text: The only reason for my low rating of this item is the flavor. I was expecting a light berry flavor, but I would compare the flavor of this tea to the taste of FIG-- and it is a very strong fig flavor & scent. I have always loved Stash brand teas, and the quality and value of their products are exceptional. However, if you are not a big fan of fig, or are looking for a tea that has a berry/acai flavor, I would not recommend this one. Instead, I suggest you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IX36">Stash Premium Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> It has much more of the flavor I was expecting when I ordered this. Overall, I always recommend Stash brand teas, but be sure you know what each flavor tastes like before you order the 100-count box, as it cannot be returned.

review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used. The Peach Black Tea has a slight flavor to it.  Even if I use two tea bags when I normally would use one it brews a pretty poor cup of tea. I purchased a 100 - count box.  Once again I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch. Although I prefer the Peach to any of the other flavors I purchased, I certainly would not recommend this tea.

review/summary: Which is more important?  That it be decaf or taste like chocolate?
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

review/text: This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.<br /><br />The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!<br /><br />The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!

review/text: Not terrible, but not anywhere near as good as the Tazo Organic Chai tea bags. Now, you can't beat this price (on the 100-count bulk box), so it still may be worth the compromise in quality. I will say right now that I will likely not buy again and I will try to find the Tazo Organic Chai at the best price I can--which I will still pay even if it is double or triple what this is. Or perhaps by the time I go through 100 bags (50 mugs worth--the Tazo only needs 1 bag, the Stash needs 2) this will grow on me. I recommend honey as the sweetener for any unsweetened chai.<br /><br />The packaging is fine, by the way--except now owing to the complaints they use too much. It's still the same plain box with individually-wrapped teabags stuffed inside, but then that's placed in an oversized box with too much of that air-pack cushion that Amazon uses. This is the bulk size box, so don't expect a box that looks fashionable on your kitchen counter.<br /><br />Lowered rating from 3 to 2 after I found the Tazo at a decent price. See the comments.

review/summary: Great product, but caffeine free????
review/text: For the price you can't go wrong. It's a great product and excellent quality. My quam is that it claims to be caffeine free, but it sure kept me up all night long after taking it. I'm not quite sure if it really is caffeine free. I bought it to relax before going to bed. I certainly can't do that with this product.

review/summary: The Best Chai; and a Great Price
review/text: I've pretty much tried all the bagged Chai tea commonly available and this is without a doubt my favorite.  I'm diabetic so I sweeten it with "Splenda", then add a small amount of Vanilla Soy Milk and the flavor and smells take one to a different world.  I'm buying this in "bulk" so I certainly don't expect high-quality packaging as some seem to think there should be. This is a huge savings over buying it retail at my grocery store and as I use at least three bags a day I am absolutely pleased to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: THE BEST PEPPERMINT TEA EVER...!
review/text: I had to quit coffee cold turkey due to PCOS, and this tea is getting me through it.  It is recommended for females who have PCOS to drink approximately 6 cups a day for full benefits.  I was able to do just that with the Stash-Amazon subscription program.  I love it with a little non dairy creamer and sweet-n-low.  It has a wonderful aroma.  when you open the individual tea package, you can swell the wonderful peppermint aroma.  The other great thing is that Stash actually recommends that you double steep their bags (3-5 minutes).  I did at first, but I no longer do, I want a fresh bag every time. This is some great tea, and everyone who is around me when I drink it; always asks me what is that, it smells so good. I have went to other stores and tried to buy variations of peppermint / mint teas, and none of them even come close in comparrison to this tea.  it is a must buy!

review/text: Love Stash teas and love the value found here on Amazon.  I had been purchasing from the Stash website before finding the same products here at a much better price minus the fussy packaging.  If you like Stash teas, I recommend signing up for the auto delivery option which can be set for up to 6 months apart and reduces the price of the item.<br /><br />I tend to like white tea and the peach flavor is mild so I don't get that fake peach taste you find in some tea.  It's a good balance with the white tea.  I have a small 4 cup drip coffee maker and put 2 bags in the filter basket and about 2 T sugar in the carafe and end up with a few great cups of tea.

review/summary: Excellent Mint Green Tea
review/text: Once you've tried high quality tea, it's hard to go back to the free tea at your office. Stash is worth the extra money in my opinion. The tea is very "fresh" and not powder-y, like cheaper teas. I drink some variation of mint tea every day and this is one of my favorites. (Steven Smith teamakers is my very favorite, but it's much more expensive.) The 100 count box is generally not much cheaper than the 6-box pack, but I appreciate the convenience of less packaging.

review/summary: This was my favorite tea!
review/text: This was my favorite tea.  If you like Moroccan mint, you'll LOVE this.  The flavors are strong and perfect without a hint of bitterness, and it's organic to boot.  I especially love the spearmint.  Yum!<br /><br />The bags came squashed together and wrinkled badly, which is something to consider if you plan on serving these professionally or making gifts, but not a single bag out of the hundred was ripped.<br /><br />I say it "was" my favorite tea because it has lemongrass in it, and I have a food allergy to all grasses.  If you're allergic to wheat or have an environmental grass allergy, you may want to check with your allergist before buying a hundred of these.  The flavor can't be beat, but I'll be going back to brewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> side-by-side with herbal mint tea whenever my allergies are flaring up.

review/summary: Very Tasty for a Decaf!
review/text: You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing.  It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well.  The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming.  Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well.  I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.<br /><br />Be advised this box came with the tea bags smashed in pretty densely.  The quality wasn't compromised, but they would make for poor gifts and their resell appeal would take a hit.<br /><br />As with any 100-count box, I recommend picking up a single box of this at a local grocery store if you can before committing to so many.  It's available at most of my local grocery stores, and might be available at yours as well.

review/summary: Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers and Some Flavorings
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

I love it black with just a touch of agave nectar, though really it's quite a sweet tea and doesn't need any at all--but I have a bit of a sweet tooth.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  While it did not affect my overall rating, don't expect to be sent one of the large rectangular tea boxes in the picture.  My order came loose in a small cardboard outer box.  I'll have to take them on their word that it's 100 tea bags, because I'm not going to bother sorting and counting them!  Some of them are, as a result of being packed into a very tiny box, flattened and dog-eared.  If presentation for guests is important to you, you may want to rethink purchasing this bulk amount, and buy the individual boxes instead.

I will be returning to paying much more for Twinings.  This Stash product is considerably more like standard black tea than like English Breakfast tea, and if you want decaf black tea that is stronger than Lipton decaf, this is a good choice.  But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.

I use 1 bag per 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />This sounds like an unusual mix of flavors but it is quite tasty--kind of like a minty fruit.  This would also likely make an excellent ice tea.<br /><br />If you want to add a sweetener, I prefer a natural sweetener, such as agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (sugar isle) or honey.

review/text: I checked my past orders of the Stash brand Earl Grey Double-Bergamot tea. It seems I order about once every 8 months. This is now my 3rd order but the first time I bought it in bulk like this. The savings were minimal but worth it. I made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received. It was.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of Earl Grey as a vile and disgusting tea. I love this tea. However, I have met people that I have offered a cup of this tea, and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them. Bergamot, the predominant spice in this tea, is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea. When I smell the tea, I smell a sweet aroma. If, when you smell this tea, it smells like pepper to you, you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it. I typically put cream & sugar in my this.
