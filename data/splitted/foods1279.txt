review/summary: Great Tea Infuser!
review/text: I love brewing loose leaf tea, except for the bits of tea leaves that inevitably end up in the bottom of my tea cup!  I have bought so many tea infusers hoping to find one that keeps the sediment to a minimum.  I might have found that with the TeaSpot Tuffy Steeper.  This is such a great idea!  I love the fact that you can collapse it to make it easier to carry with you.  It comes with a lid to cover the infuser while the tea is steeping, keeping the tea nice and hot.  The holes in the infuser are so small!  If you use a good quality loose leaf tea, I don't think you will have any problem with bits of tea leaves getting through.  The little handle on top is kind of odd.  I am not sure why it doesn't go the other way but you can use it to pick the infuser up out of the tea when you are done brewing.  It does displace a lot of water, so fill your cup up as much as you can while the infuser is in the cup.  The shape does allow the tea leaves to open up during the steeping process which gives you a great cup of tea.  Love it! Will use it all the time!

review/text: Love it...keep it with me when I'm out.  also keep a small vile of tea.  always ready for a cup if you can get the hot water.  Great product.  great value if you love tea and don't like the standard bag you get.  In case not obvious, teh holder also serves as a top, which allows the brewing to occur without heat loss.

review/text: These "crackers" are great with soup.  My whole family loves them and they are a great deal on Amazon compared to buying them in the store.  My only complaint is that there were at least 4 or 5 broken pieces in each package.  The packaging is not designed to protect the product from shipping damage.

review/summary: Watch out for deceptive packaging - the new crackers are HoRRIBLE!!
review/text: I emailed Nabisco regarding their new Saltine crackers that the package says "original" which are horrible and have no taste and are hard as bricks. I received a reply from Nabisco verifying that they indeed did change the recipe in December 2011 and removed original salt and are now adding sea salt. The new package is deceptive as it says "original" but once you taste the new ones, you will know that they are as far from original as you can get. I have found that Keebler Zesta saltines are really good and I have switched to them after eating Nabisco saltines for 46 years. It is ashamed that American manufacturers just can't leave a classic product alone and have ruined it.

review/text: They have changed the box of the world's greatest cracker to a piece of flimsy cardboard that cannot stand the rigors of shipping, shelving, and carrying it home with other groceries in a plastic bag.  I cry everytime I open a new box and find damaged crackers in each of the 4 pkgs inside.  Sometimes even tears in them.  I just may have to switch brands.

review/summary: Premium Saltines are no longer premium in taste.
review/text: I agree with most of the reviewers in this review.  I too have bought Premium Saltines all my life (I'm now 63) and they are now:  1. flimsy - will break in half or in pieces when spreading with peanut butter, 2.  poorly packaged - have many broken crackers in each tube which as another reviewer pointed out is due to flimsier cardboard packaging, and most importantly 3. have virtually no taste any more.  It is indeed a sad day that one of our old standbys has fallen victim to cost-cutting to enhance company profits.  Thanks to the reviewer about Keebler crackers....I'm switching.

review/text: Round and hard is not the same as square and flakey.  I can see changing over to sea salt, no big deal... but the new texture of the round crackers is not even close to the Original.  I'll be looking for a new brand to purchase for my next 50 years.

review/text: I am what's known as a "brand loyal" customer.  I've eaten Premium Saltines almost exclusively for 60+ years and had no reason to stop until now.  The new formula tastes like a discount super marker's generic knock off.  My 89 year old aunt (also brand loyal) will be crushed with this change.  Thanks for the tip on the Keebler Zesta crackers - I'm about to give them a try.

review/text: These are not the "original" Nabisco saltine crackers I grew up on.  No taste cardboard imitations.  On every side of the box Nabisco touts "No Cholesterol, No Saturated Fat" -- items all but unknown when these crackers really were "original".  I don't know what I hate more, them destroying a great product or insulting my intelligence by saying they hadn't changed anything.  Oh well, I guess I'll go drown myself in "New Coke"....

review/text: The 8 oz nabisco original saltine cracker is much tastier, crisper and saltier.  The salt on these crackers is more coarse than that which is on the 16 oz box.<br /><br />The larger box has a much finer salt coating and the coating is not thorough.  They<br />are quite dull in comparison to the much smaller box, even though the price of larger box is better.

review/summary: Cats LOVE this Dry Food.  Best Commercial Product List I've Found that in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food. RECOMMENDED.
review/text: I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old.  We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store.  About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so).<br /><br />I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Amazon & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try.  We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out).  We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags).<br /><br />Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br /><br />My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams.  We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks.  The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever.  We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part).  All cats love the food.  We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite.  Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case.<br /><br />I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites:<br /><br />Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal.<br /><br />Meat sources in "meal" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. "Meal" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, "wet" form still contain up to 75% water.<br /><br />Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. "chicken byproducts" or "beef byproducts" but not "meat byproducts" or "poultry byproducts"). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities.  Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice.  My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy.  We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them.<br /><br />Best of all, Amazon ships it to my doorstep.  RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well.  I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a "hit") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble.

review/summary: Fantastic pet food!
review/text: I bought this food on sale on a whim since a while ago, Amazon was selling this kind of cat food for ~$15 for 5 3-lb bags (I wish it still cost that much!). Long story short, I wasn't expected much from this pet food. I have two young cats (both ~7.6 months) who typically never ate their dry food unless I mixed wet food in with it or soaked it in Cat Milk. However, my cats LOVE the Castor & Pollux Ultramix. They happily eat it (including the little fruity bits),even in meals where I don't mix in wet food, and they've have so much fewer digestive issues. They've never had any hairballs and the size of the little bits is perfect for young animals making the transition to adult foods.

review/text: I've been feeding my 3 cats this food for about a year now, started with the indoor formula.  The cats do enjoy the food and coats seem softer to the touch.  I subscribe to the auto deliveries and noticed that the food delivered in Sept is different, not just the bag but the kibble is smaller and the veggies are no longer present in the bag.  My cats no longer devour the food like they have been doing, so I'm not sure if I'll continue purchasing...  Guess I'll need to wait and see, give it a bit more time.  I'm giving the food 4 stars because of the change without any notice.

review/summary: Great Cat Food !!
review/text: My cats just Love this Cat Food and I have 3 of them to test it out.  I've bought this several times now in this size and also the smaller size.  This 15# is just a tad more reasonable.  My cats have no problem eating this all up and I know it's good for them too.  Their coats are much more shinier and they seem to have less hair loss.  All around I think it's a Great Product and I will be back for more whenever I see that it's on Sale.

review/summary: amazing cat food
review/text: I decided to try this cat food when I ran out of my old stuff.  My cats, prior to eating this cat food, seemed to always be throwing up on the other stuff so a food change was a must.  Since they have been on this cat food, they no longer throw up like they used to.  I like the fact that its natural too so I know my kitties aren't eating things they shouldn't be.

I switched to this from the goodlife recipe and when I first started purchasing this food I noticed that my cats coats looked a lot better and shinier too. They are always happy to eat this one and it smells a lot better than the old food. Price is worth it if you're buying it in bulk!

I have had great results and it has not been any worse (might even be better) for my allergic cat. I love the ingredients and the fact that there pieces of real veggies and fruit mixed in. My cats also like this food more than their previous ones. The price can't be beat and I don't have to make an extra trip to the store.

review/text: i've been feeding my cats wellness for over six tears. i tried for a change. they weren't at all fond of this food. and as i read in other reviews they tended to leave the chunks of fruit and veggies behind in the bowl. i only fed them about a fourth of the bag, bought wellness again and gave the rest of the bag to my neighbor. i wanted this food to be well liked by my kitties, but it wasn't. they weren't into the soft food, either. but, they do LOVE the organix cheddar treats. sorry i couldn't say better things. i wouldn't recommend this food and will never purchase it again.

The quality is consistent, and our cats (all ten of them) love it. Their coats are shinny, their energy levels high, and their health is great based on the results of their annual checkups. Highly recommend the product to any cat lovers looking for high quality, nutritious nourishment for their fur babies!

review/text: Was thrilled to find this food on Amazon after local "big box" pet store stopped carrying it. Kitty loves it and doesn't seem to get bored with it; he eats all day (when not napping) and still keeps his weight within reasonable range; doesn't smell (the food, i mean, has no offensive or strong odor); it stays fresh in the bag ... Maks and I are perfectly content.

review/summary: The ONLY dry cat food my cat will eat!!
review/text: When Petco and Petsmart quit carrying this product in their stores almost a year ago, I went to another brand that was recommended to me as a good replacement.  I tried it, and my cat usually eats pretty much any cat food I give him--and at first he did the new one.  About 3 months into the new diet, he stopped eating completely for a week. I was frantic, and was trying to figure out anything to make him eat!  After many approaches, I looked online through Amazon for his original Ultramix and found it!! I ordered his dry food and along with that ordered the wet food too.  As soon as it came, I threw out everything else, and he chowed down like he hadn't in a long, long time!  I now order his food online and give him about half dry and half wet, depending upon his mood.  But as long as I can find this online, he's good.  His mood, skin, hair, and appetite have greatly improved and have stayed that way.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!

review/summary: The Gang Loves It!
review/text: I have three large indoor Maine Coons--so I will leave it to you to imagine the issues I have with hairballs and cat yak in general.  This was recommended at my small local pet food store so I tried it even though it was very expensive, I'm embarrassed to say how expensive.  First I mixed it with Blue Buffalo Indoor Health (which they also like) but my cats will not eat the Blue Buffalo "life source bits" for any reason.  The hairball and cat yak problem did get substantially better, strangely they also seemed to have fewer issues with matting.  One day I was too lazy to do the mix and just fed the Castor and Pollux Ultramix till the bag was finished.  They really enjoyed it, and while they do tend to pick around the bits in this one too, they don't do it nearly as much.  They seemed slightly "happier" meaning slightly more energetic, interested, playful and silly. However, if I'm honest I think I might have seen an increase in hairballs and general yak, but this was still much improved. Now I am feeding just the Blue Buffalo Indoor health till that bag is finished, and we'll see if there is a difference.  I will update if there are any bombshells to report.<br /><br />All in all, my inclination is to stay with Ultramix--they love it, they seem "happier", and the hairball/cat yak problem is still much better than with any other food I've tried alone--and I have tried many many foods of every price point including those that advertise hairball control.  Don't get me wrong, Blue Buffalo is better than most I have tried too, but Ultramix claims the edge so far.<br /><br />As for price; while I always prefer to support local small businesses this is one of those cases where the price point is so different that I have to go with an online purveyor.  I am fine with a 10% even 15% difference to support the locals, but in this case it's well over 33%.  I suspect this is because Castor and Pollux is not a household name so stocking it is expensive--still...

review/summary: A Good Dry Food that they LIKE!
review/text: My four cats really like the Castor & Pollux Adult.  I'd tried several more "natural" foods trying to find something they like and will eat.  They free feed the dry food and since we started using the Castor and Pollux, I haven't seen quite as much cat gak as I have with some other brands of dry food.  A 15 lb bag lasts just a month...I'm on Subscribe & Save with this, and usually am just at the bottom of the previous bag when the new one arrives.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that they really like it?

review/summary: My Cats are Happy and Healthy
review/text: My cats really like this food.  Their coats are shiny and glossy and soft.  They are healthy and have no complaints.  I've been feeding them this food for over a year now and they continue to thrive.<br /><br />Amazon makes ordering and the delivery of this food a snap.  The price is very reasonable for this high quality food.  I have turned friends onto the Amazon pet food ordering experience.<br /><br />Come to think of it, my only complaint about ordering this brand of food from Amazon is that there is a demand for it and many times Amazon will note that my order won't be shipped for an entire month and then it ships the next day. So I caution you to not take their shipping dates too seriously.  Once the food is shipped I typically receive it on my front porch the following day.

review/summary: He likes it!
review/text: It took him a few days, but Roofus the Cat came around to having this new type of food in his dish. He still has a problem with eating too fast from time to time, which leads to cat vomit on the floor, but that has little to nothing to do with the food itself. For help cleaning up cat puke, check my other reviews for paper towel recommendations.<br /><br />I think I'm likely to keep buying this brand. The details on the package (what's inside, how much to use, how to transition a cat to this food, etc.) are very understandable and informative. A lower cost would be nice, but oh well.

review/summary: Excellent cat food.
review/text: My large dude-cat Larry loves to eat. When he gained a bit of weight I put him on Natural Balance low cal food and his fur began to fall out. It was dry and patchy. Well, one 15 pound bag of this stuff later he has slimmed down nicely, and he has the best coat he has ever had. He looks and feels great. He also loves this food. It's a win-win all round, and well worth the price -- much cheaper than visits to the vet for any weight / skin related illnesses. We are very happy customers, and with Amazon prime, its delivered to your door with free shipping. (To the mailman's amusement.)

review/summary: Works for my cats!
review/text: Part of the reason I tried this is the availability via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.<br />Being able to combine serious quality feline food with the convenience of having it show up on my doorstep is something of a no-brainer for me. The fact that having it delivered means I'm visiting those pet emporiums less and therefore getting all wanty over the cats up for adoption probably is a good thing for me.<br />As for the food itself, my crew has responded rather favorably to it. We had a little extra vomiting initially as they adjusted, but I've had that happen with almost anything drastically new I tried.<br />I think this food has helped my oldest two the most. One had been getting increasingly sedentary and I suspected she was having joint pain. Now she's back to jumping up on furniture and being much more interactive with us. Her coat looks good too. She's actually at her best ever.<br />My other old girl had been having the occasional seizure this past year. These have decreased in frequency. She already had a good coat but damned if it doesn't look even more luscious. You'd never believe she's a mature cat.<br />My other two don't have issues that this food addresses, but I want my healthy ones living long and healthy lives. I wish I could say my big boy cat was a little less big, but I know that's not the purpose of this food. And I know in his case, no matter what his diet is, he's gonna stench up that litter box.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried this food for them. Very worthwhile.

review/summary: Drastically reduces vomiting
review/text: My cats like this food, but they don't seem to love it they way they do the cheaper stuff that I occasionally have to buy from the grocery store when I run out. The older one clearly prefers the C&P Organix chicken flavor when she has a choice, but I'm sticking with this one as the younger cat prefers it and she's the one with the sensitive stomach. FWIW, the younger one is also a VERY finicky eater; she'll eat canned tuna, but she won't touch human food (not even milk!) or canned cat food, and she's very particular about which dry foods she'll eat. She adores Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula, but she vomits 2 out of 3 times that she eats it.<br /><br />Neither one of them eats all the little bits of fruits & veggies; most of those get left at the bottom of the bowl. I used to feed them Pet Promise, but they seemed to get tired of it. Ditto for Nutro Natural Choice. I suppose when they get bored with this I'll just rotate back to one of the others. If anyone knows of any other good foods for cats with sensitive stomachs, please feel free to comment and let me know.

review/text: I'm sure this is a good quality food, but the kibble is too large and dense for a 14-yr-old Tortie who has lost most of her teeth.  It's too dense and didn't soften well when I added water, so when she tried to eat it, she would have to swallow it whole, resulting in more episodes of vomiting.<br /><br />After only a few tries, I gave the whole bag to a friend, and she said it made her male cat vomit.  I think the kibble is too hard and too large for older cats.<br /><br />I've switched my kitty to "Life's Abundance" and she's thriving.

I've since bought a fresh bar at the store and the difference is huge.  I wouldn't recommend buying these online.

review/text: Do not be scared off by the Habanero label - the heat on this sauce is about a medium, maybe a bit above. If you really ladle it on, the heat (of course) grows, but in normal usage this is a very, very tasty medium salsa. The flavor of the chiles really shines through, enhancing the flavor of the foood and not just burning you up! I would have to say this is one of the absolute best tasting salsas I have ever eaten. This is not one of those artificial salsas where the extract of the peppers is used to concentrate the heat. You get a nice, natural heat from the Habaneros and the other peppers used in this. Really fantastic stuff!

review/text: Good sturdy tortillas with a distinct corn taste.  This is a lot of tortillas but they freeze well - I usually do four to a small freezer bag, which makes for a perfect enchilada dinner.  Don't keep them out unfrozen or unfridged for long.  They will go funky bad after a while if you do!

review/text: I usually just don't have the time to write reviews, but wanted to write something because these excellent tortillas have gotten some bad reviews. I don't know what they are talking about. They taste great. They smell great. They have no added preservatives. They are perfect. They do have a strong tortilla smell, but that is the way they are supposed to smell. They are fresh. That is what fresh tortillas smell like when they aren't loaded down with added ingredients. We fry them lightly to soften them up for use as tacos and they are great.

review/summary: Great tortillas from a tortilla aficionado....
review/text: If you've never had corn tortillas from Porkyland before, you owe it to yourself to try them.  They are a staple in San Diego, where I believe they got their start.  Years ago, Price Club would only carry these, and I'm glad they did.  Excellent quality, very "corny" taste, hold together very well.  My absolute favorite corn tortilla, and believe me, I've tried plenty....I freeze them in packages of 12, and they are easy to pry apart frozen if you just need 2 or 3 at a time with a sharp knife.  Enjoy!!

review/text: Dear Miss/Sir, with great regret I have to write this and complain that the above item I purchased had absolutely no flavour, in-spite of cooking into Regular Oven, Microwave Oven and as well as Toaster Oven per the given Instructions etc. it gave horrible odour and the odour was so intense that I had to turn on Exhaust Fan on and Open the doors and windows as well. Even neighbours wondered and asked what was this smell. There was No Customer Service or Help for me to contact. I left few pieces outside and even the Squirrel and Skunk did not like it. I end-up throwing away the whole box in the garbage. It was 100% loss of my purchase. What a dis-appointment ?

review/text: This product is wonderful!  Contains no fillers or common allergens.  I've been buying this off and on for the past 7 years.<br /><br />What I really want to review, though, is the seller.  Wag.com has exceptional customer service!  After having purchased dog food from Amazon when the item was in stock, but finding 1.5 weeks later that it hadn't even shipped yet, I contacted Amazon.  They informed me that the product was now out of stock and they would ship it as soon as it became available.  Meanwhile, I had run out of dog food that morning.  After cancelling my order, I purchased this item from Wag.com around 3:30pm on a Tuesday.  I received notification just a few hours later that the item had shipped, and received it the next day around 10am (despite the fact that we live the next state over - - shipped from PA to NY).  Less than 24 hours turnaround time for only $4.99 shipping!  Totally worth it.  Product was packaged well and arrived in great condition.  And did I mention, in less than 24 hours?!?!  I'll be buying from Wag.com again.  :]

Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.

review/summary: These used to be so much better
review/text: Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.

review/summary: Worst meat snack I ever tried
review/text: They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.  The dogs liked them though.

review/text: Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 32-Ounce Bag (Purchased on 02/19/2009)<br /><br />This was the worst product I have ever tasted. I have had many Oberto products, and this was nothing like what I've eaten before. Even my dog wouldn't eat them, they were so nasty tasting.

review/summary: Yuk!
review/text: A word of caution to anyone considering buying these: Read the ingredients first! I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.

review/summary: I like Lipton Citrus Green Tea
review/text: I like drinking Lipton Citrus green tea. Does it taste like green tea? Not at all.<br /><br />Pros:  It is not sickly sweet<br /> Hint of honey flavor<br /> Hint of citrus flavor<br /> Has Green tea in it(most likely Green tea extract)<br /> Vitamin C<br /> Flavonoids(though not much)<br /><br />Cons: High fructose<br /> Color Dyes(Makes me wonder how much green tea is in it. Most teas I have made are naturally colored by the leaves or flowers.)<br /> Caffeine<br /> Does not taste like green tea<br /><br />My recommendation: If you are allergic to food dyes or honey stay away from this drink. If you are looking for the health benefits of green tea, bottled tea is not where to look. Go for fresh brewed tea.  For an on-the-go-day this is a nice drink to have. It is better then pop in my opinion.

review/summary: Suites my taste perfectly
review/text: I'm only a little bit of a coffee nut, but I really like this coffee. My fiance's father brought some back from Costa Rica while he was there on business. I have just finished my bag and already miss it. This was one of the best coffees I have tasted. Well balanced, not too acidic, not too bitter, just right in my opinion. It's really good served traditionally hot, but it's also great iced. And as with all coffees... it's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself.<br /><br />My opinion... a must try!
