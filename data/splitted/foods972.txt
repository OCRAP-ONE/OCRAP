review/summary: painful at first, beware contains Senna
review/text: After taking this 3 different times I noticed that the following day I am extremely bloated to the point that it hurts to walk! Stomach would hurt, frequent bowel movements. Through friends also heard that this product bloated them and they stopped taking it. Only good thing I can say is that it suppressed my appetite for a few days. Don't know if it's something i want to experience for a whole 24 hrs (bloating) just to suppress appetite. Read the label about this product containing Senna as one of the ingredients.

review/summary: Nopalina Awesomeness!
review/text: Nopalina is a must have for anyone trying to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight. I think it is especially great for women. We always complain about menstrual bloating or always having a full feeling throughout the month. With regular use of Nopalina, there is no bloating feeling. It doesn't have much of a taste. I prefer to mix it with vanilla yogurt, a protein smoothie, or in cereal. Nopalina is great! I wish it were available in local grocery stores!

review/summary: "Laxative Effect" Was Understated
review/text: In fairness, Pillsbury does warn that the product may have a "laxative effect" due to the malitol, isomalt and sorbitol.<br /><br />However, I have eaten all of these before and didn't expect this much of an "effect". Oh my goodness. I will spare you graphic details but will say I am just now un-cramping AT ALL and it's 20 hours after I ate the product. I had about 2 tbsp.<br /><br />It could be the sheer amount (of malitol, I'm assuming - sorbitol doesn't usually do this to me) that's required to make the frosting taste really sweet that is the problem. I can't say for sure.<br /><br />I gave it a star because it does taste very frosting-like. The "feel" is frosting-ish too. Tastes very close to the real thing, at least to me. But this sickness afterward is not worth it, I was actually getting scared at one point. Buyer beware, and if you try this, taste a VERY SMALL amount -- maybe 1/4 teaspoon - at first to see if you are going to have effects. Then work your way up.

It's not tangy like some of the other flavors such as orange or lime, and it's not somewhat bland like pineapple, it's just rightly sweet without any after-taste.  Each box can make three cups of Jello without losing too much of the taste or too solid of a Jello.  Yum Yum.

review/summary: The best toasted sesame oil out there!
review/text: If you've read my other recommendations, I really love this company, Eden Foods.  They really care about selling pure, and clean foods, and are a trustworthy company.  Anyhow, I'm also really into organics, and tried out every single Toasted sesame oil out there.  I was disappointed in all of them, because none of them had the same Asian flavor that I was used to for toasted sesame oil. Then I tried the Eden Foods brand, and fell in love.  It tastes exactly how it should taste, and has so much flavor, instead of the bland ones (like the one from Spectrum or Napa Valley).  If you read up on the company, they do business with Japanese companies that have been producing these food items the traditional way, and hence, the great flavor.  I know it seems expensive for that tiny bottle, but once you try this sesame oil, you won't go back.  Try mixing it with some soy sauce, and rice, and throwing in a mix of vegetables.....tastes wonderful.

It's not super hot, I can eat a bit of it right out of the jar (at Thai restaurants I order mild-plus or medium) but it's just so tastey and complex.  It ads a lot to a stir fry, and I love it in coconut soup. I just wish it came in bigger jars, cause I want to add 1/4 cup rather than just a tablespoon but I don't want to use it up that fast.  I've gotten a jar of the pantosingh kind, I'm going to see how it compares when I open it, since that kind is cheaper (in my local asian stores) and in a bigger jar, but judging by the ingredients I think this Thai Kitchen one might be more to my taste.

review/summary: Wow--these are muy yummy!
review/text: I ordered these with a bit of doubt because I often buy Eden's regular canned beans at Whole Foods and find them very bland. I mean, totally unsalty. I am not a saltoholic, but I also don't want to eat something so bland that I can hardly tell what I'm eating. I buy them anyway because they are packaged in BPA-free cans and  because I can add some sea salt or chili seasonings and make them taste pretty darned good. Still, the thought of getting twelve cans of bland rice and beans put me off a wee bit.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I opened the first can and this wonderful aroma wafted up to my prepared-for-disappointment nose. Yummy smell, and, as I found to my delight, wonderful taste. The beans (black) are paired with short grain brown rice that has been cooked to perfection. Both are in a sauce that tastes pretty authentic (I'm Mexican-American and, thanks to Mama,  have a good sense for what spices should be used here) but isn't fiery or tummy-troubling.  There's just enough salt to bring out the flavors without sending your blood pressure soaring or your kidneys into an apoplectic fit.<br /><br />I like to put this in my whole wheat tortillas, topped with a little shredded cheese or with shredded green lettuce (not iceberg--yuk!), chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, and minced jalapeno peppers. Wonderful. Also works well with either ground beef or ground beef-sub in crispy taco shells. Oh--another fave combo of mine is this one (which might make you wonder about my sanity):  these beans and rice, heated up, with cold cottage cheese. Get a little of each in each forkful and enjoy the contrast between hot and cold and spicy mixture and cool dairy. Majorly yummy.<br /><br />Try these--I think you'll  like them, and Amazon prices are pretty darned good.

review/summary: Warning - LOTS of cumin....
review/text: WOW this stuff is much spicier than I anticipated (predominantly from what tastes like an abundance of cumin).  It will clear your sinuses!<br /><br />I dislike overly spicy foods, so I won't order this again.  However - it is tasty; just too spicy for me personally.  You might like that.  Cumin just happens to affect me intensely; but on the other hand, I'm one of those people who can eat Wasabi and horseradish all day long without the slightest problem.  So this might not even seem spicy to you if you like cumin.  I will note that, to me, there is so much cumin that it lends a hint of curry/Indian food flavor to the concoction.<br /><br />Besides the spiciness issue, I think it's a pretty good product especially for being canned.  It has a good balance of beans to rice (it's not mostly rice), and it has a sort of light sauciness with seasonings.  It's very short-grained rice, which while surprising is probably a good idea in a canned product, since it will hold together better.  The mixture is overall very soft, but there is distinction between the beans and the rice parts - not all mush - and the individual beans and rice grains have a bit of chewiness/texture, without being underdone.<br /><br />The product also seems healthful.  The labels lists a little over 3 servings per can (which I think is unlikely for most people; maybe two servings is more normal).  It doesn't have junk and has nutritional value, and the cans are "BPA-A" free.

review/summary: I  Loved This Stuff -  Ended Subscription 10/7/12  Due to Arsenic Report
review/text: ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE ARSENIC REPORT:<br /><br />In my opinion, Eden canned goods are the very best.<br /><br />Eden Organic Mexican Rice and Beans tastes fabulous.  Just the right amount of herbs and garlic.  And it's super convenient.  I don't heat it but you can if desired.<br /><br />Eden is the only company I know of which uses bisphenol free linings in their cans.  Rice or Beans alone provide incomplete forms of protein lacking a few different amino acids in each case.  But put rice and beans together and you get complete, high quality protein.  To its credit, Eden uses brown rice instead of white.  And, also to the good, this product has a relatively small amount of sea salt. Lastly, no bisphenol in the can linings.<br /><br />I save some money by getting a case automatically delivered each month (suscribe and save).<br /><br />UPDATE 10/7/2012 : I just cancelled my subscription because of Consumer Report's recent article about excessive arsenic in rice.

review/summary: Best of Eden Rice and Bean Offerings
review/text: Mexican Rice and Beans are the best of Edens Rice and Bean offerings. BPA free can a BIG plus if you eat/store canned foods. Rice has good texture, beans firm. Not too spicy, not too salty, just right. Free shipping brings the price about in line with what I would pay locally. Good product.

review/summary: The only formula my son will drink
review/text: I exclusively breast fed my son for the first four months and then had to start supplementing with formula due to weight gain issues.  We originally started with Enfamil but he wouldn't drink it. Then we moved on to the ready made and he loved it, but it made him sick. Long story short, he had a milk protein allergy.  We then moved on to the Enfamil brand soy powder. He took it for a week and then refused it all together.  Finally, we found this ready to eat Similac w soy. It has saved us!  These 8 oz bottles are perfect.  Just open the formula and make a bottle. The measurement is always right and the formula is always room temp so there is no need to warm it. We originally tried the soy powder but he wouldn't take that either.  The 8 oz size is great for older babies.  The 2 oz size is great for newborns. Unfortunately, they do not have a measurement for in between. If your child drinks 4 oz you either need to use 2, 2 oz bottles or half of an 8 oz bottle.  I am giving it 1 star because they boast just adding a nipple to the bottle and feeding, but it doesn't come with said nipples. You have to buy them separately.  Overall, we cannot live without this formula and highly recommend it!

review/summary: Tried almost every major brand of Zaatar and this is the best!
review/text: I love Zaatar bread and Zaatar crackers and have tried perhaps as many as 15 different brands and this blows them all away. Not even close, this is by far the best. Perhaps because I was introduced to Zaatar in Lebanese cooking so this brand is Lebanese and probably what was used on my favorites. Just get some pizza dough, roll it out thin or how you like it, mix zaatar and oil and spread over the dough. Bake it in 450 deggree oven till done. Make sure you put some oil on the pan under the dough too. This is the easiest and perhaps the best way to get your Zaatar. This bag of 10 lbs will last me at least a year. You can freeze it in double heavy duty freezer bags and it will keep for years.

review/text: These used to be pretty good.  Some stores used to keep them in a refrigerated case - I suppose to keep them fresh.  I had the impression they were shipped here (Florida) from some place up north like New York City.  Now they are apparently made by a franchise bakery somewhere nearby.<br /><br />Now they are kept on the bread shelves near hamburger buns where we shop.  I don't know if they absorb flavors from the other buns.  Probably not, but they taste somewhere half way between a hamburger bun and what an English muffin used to taste like.<br /><br />I wish I could find some good tasting English muffins, but these aren't them.

review/summary: Splinters anyone?
review/text: I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

review/text: My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.

We bought the first one at Petco, Petco brand, and she loved it and eventually broke it in two (prob a month or so after having it), and she was needing a new one.  I decided to go with this one on Amazon and she LOVED it!! She spent an entire hour chewing on this just during the first sitting.  She carries it around the house with her and it is FANTASTIC because she doesn't try to chew the wall anymore (or carpet! augh!!).  Highly recommend. :)  Thanks, Amazon.

review/text: Gave my Dachshund this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" on Sunday afternoon.  By dinner Monday she was not eating or drinking.  By Tuesday morning (this day) she was throwing up bright red pools of blood!  I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz "Premium" bones for "aggressive chewers" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.

review/summary: Sharp Splintering
review/text: I purchased this bone at a local supermarket and gave it to my boxer. I walked in the house to literally make a cup of coffee and my dog devoured the bone. What a surprise, when the packaging clearly says: "...this long last chew satisfies your dog's instintive urge to chew." I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, "This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering." Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE.

The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his "full" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!

Unfortunately, the cardboard type bag didn't keep the moisture out and the food I received was spoiled. The 11 lbs is made of material that keeps the food dry. However, buying the small bag is not money wise for me. FORTUNATELY, I purchased the 3o lbs bag thru Amazon and they refund the shipping and the spoiled dog food. Thank you Amazon, no wonder I prefer purchasing from Amazon directly. Since my dog won't eat Royal Canin after the spoiled bag, we switched to Blue Buffalo Wilderness Blend, which is holistic, packaged in a moisture safe bag and contains zero controversial ingredients to this date.

review/text: As winter approaches, I feel moved to share one of my secrets<br />for satisfying winter stews that are not excessively fatty.<br />You can use the bitter tang and the concentrated flavor and<br />fattiness of unsweetened chocolate to add a dimension to almost<br />any stew that will delight ( and mystify ) your guests. For a<br />two quart stew pot or brasier, add about two ounces of<br />Bittersweet Scharffen Berger Chocolate and a tiny amount of hot<br />pepper.<br />Of course, this is not really a secret-Mole Poblano has used these<br />ingredients for years. But some prejudiced connection of chocolate<br />with dessert prevents us from using chocolate as a spice.<br />Why Scharffen Berger? Here's a story:<br /><br />My European friends are mildly snooty about some of their<br />local products-all of which, in their eyes-are infinitely<br />superior to their American equivalents. A few years ago, I<br />started carrying Scharffen Berger chocolate bars with me to<br />Europe-mostly the blue and yellow wrappers.<br />At one friend's house, I was always asked to make a mousse<br />au chocolate and so I, naturally, used the Scharffen Berger<br />even though my host had put out a local (Austrian) brand.<br />The rave reviews that the mousse got-and continues to get-<br />are not based on the recipe, which is basic basic, but on<br />the remarkable complexity of these lovely chocolates and<br />particularly on their fruity overtones and beguiling winey<br />finish.<br />I hear that the company has been sold to Hershey, and so there<br />is no guarantee that the quality will remain as it is.

review/summary: Superb Chocolate Bar
review/text: I certainly appreciate Scharffen Berger chocolate brand, due to its old-fashioned and small-batched production methods. I also appreciate the packaging, I think it is one of the most appealing package in the market. Like most gourmet Californian brands, the quality is overall very satisfying.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger Bittersweet 70% Cacao Chocolate Bar is my favorite one in the series. They certainly got the recipe right; it is dark, rich, fulfilling with incredible after taste. The bitter-sweet combination brings about the sophisticated taste notes, which brings about the exciting and playful character.<br /><br />I highly recommend this chocolate with Turkish Coffee or Port Wine. You can easily surprise your guests that way. Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: The only reason why I have not given this chocolate bar 5 stars is that they have not used organic ingredients in it.

review/summary: Yummy, but dont  break your tooth
review/text: I recently bought scharffen berger chocolate from the store near my house.  It tasted yummy.  However when I was sampling it, I almost broke my tooth.  There was a metal button in with the chocolate.  It was hard to get hold of them to tell them of my problem.  If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money.  I didnt like how they handled it.  Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother.  JUST BE CAREFUL

review/text: ****<br />This is a fine chai spice tea from Stash, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. It is a stronger version of Stash's Spice Chai---times two. I did enjoy it, but you really have to be ready for the extra-strength spices and flavors---this is one strong tea! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier!<br />****

review/text: being raised in germany, i always had the great marzipan. when i got this box it actually did taste pretty good but it was somewhat dry, though i think the toasting is the cause of that. it didnt have an intense flavor and was more sweet than almondy, another reason it wasnt my favorite. i love marzipan but i cant afford the real expensive stuff so i buy this stuff and its delicious either way, since i rarely get to try it.<br />shipping was on time and it was fresh. so all in all i rate this four, for the good service, and the good tasting candy.<br />warning- it was smaller than i expected.

review/text: Having brought back toasted marzipans from a recent visit to Spain which were simply delicious, I ordered these thinking what a convenient way to get more. Unfortunately, while the package arrived thoughtfully packed complete with a cooling pad and insulated thermal wrap, the marzipans were a disappointment. They were very dry, too sugary sweet and had an overly intense almond flavor, almost pungent.

review/text: bought this on a whim because I love Sumatran coffee. This makes a very good smooth cup of coffee but, of course, taste is very subjective. I was surprised at how fine the grind was. I use it in my ekobrew for Keurig and it does take much longer for the water to flow through(probably too fine). I also am able to run two large cycles through to get a large flavorful cup of coffee. Since this is reasonably priced and if you like coffee from Sumatra, this coffee would be worth a try.

review/text: I love hot sauces and have at least 20 open bottles in my fridge at any one time.  Finding a sauce with burn is not difficult.  Finding one with a both a pleasant burn and a tropical flavor is tough.  This orange flavored sauce from Belize accomplishes this with style.<br /><br />Made from yellow habaneros, orange pulp, onions, key lime juice, vinegar, garlic and salt Marie Sharp's Orange hot sauce is a perfect marinade for white meats such as chicken breasts, pork tenderloin, and turkey breasts as well as for seafood such as shrimp and talipia.  I have also used it as a basting sauce but I prefer it as a marinade.  I sometime add some simple syrup which gives it a sweetness and provides a nice caramelization when the meat is grilled.  I wish that it had a little less vinegar but I imagine that it is needed as a preservative.  Other than that I like it very much.

review/summary: formerly a frequent Amazon shopper
review/text: I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it, so I left it out for her. She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package. I felt so guilty for making Sugar eat something that made her sick, and threw away the entire package. Now I'm afraid to buy the brand again.

review/text: This Villa Manodori Artigianale Olive oil was given to me by a dinner guest. I had no idea how special it would be! It has a clean but very nutty flavor. So delicious I could be tempted to just have a taste with nothing else. It made both plain pasta and simple bread taste like  gourmet food. I highly recommend it for uses where you will be able to taste the oil - not so much for generic cooking due to the cost.

review/summary: Just as I remembered
review/text: When I bought bubble gum cigarettes I wish someone had left a review. I ordered a lot of candy cigarettes which those are just sticks of sugar. These are the ones I remembered buying from the ice cream truck when I was child. I bought these for my nephews birthday as party favors and they were a great success. The kids couldn't believe if you blow in them they blow smoke out the other end. The gum really does taste good too. If you remember these cigarettes I highly recommend them, if you don't remember them you should try them to.
