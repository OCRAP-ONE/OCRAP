review/summary: Oats, wonderful oats
review/text: I purchase many gluten free products from Bob's Red Mill.  I was very happy to see that they added oats to the product mix -- I love my oatmeal for breakfast in the morning.  Regular commercial oats are grown in fields alternating with wheat and therefore, there is a lot of cross contamination.  These oats are grown in dedicated fields, no alternating with wheat, barley or rye.  It is a very good product and Bob's Red Mill service is outstanding, truly what customer service should be about. Also the price here on Amazon is very good especially on automatic ordering and I do not have to worry about trying to find a store that carries this item or pay what can be high prices.

review/summary: The BEST oats - just like my grandma from Ireland made
review/text: Hearty and filling.  Didn't think I'd ever find oats to make oatmeal like my grandma made (I'm over 50, so we're talking "old school" here).  This is as close as it gets.  Nice to know it's made in a gluten-free plant for those with celiac disease.

review/summary: Our dog's favorite toy and a great, fun tool for rescue adoptees
review/text: The Booda Soft Bite Medium Carrot Dog Toy is our dog's favorite toy!  She adores it! More durable than most of the toys we have tried, this carrot is one of the few toys that she has not destroyed within 24 hours.  The squeaker has a great sound, better than those in other squeaker toys we have tried.  The squealer is easy for her to work and loud and interesting enough to keep her interested but not so loud or irritating to be obnoxious --- which is a real plus since she loves to play with it over and over and over again.  Our puppy loves the sound so much that she enjoys experimenting with the different sounds she can make even more than chewing it!  The shape makes it easy for her to carry it in her mouth for such games as fetch. She also likes to cuddle with her head on this soft toy.<br /><br />We adopted a rescue puppy who was terrified of just about everything, including toys.  Her initial reaction to this toy was wonderful!  This toy helped her come out of her shell and be less afraid of noise in general.  I was not sure if the toy would be scary or not but once she found the squeaker noises, she just loved being able to play and make noise herself, making all sorts of variations and rhythms.  Although there are many additional things we are doing to help her, this toy was an important step in breaking through her fears.  Playing with this toy seemed to embolden her, bringing out this sense of delight and play in her.  In addition to an overall very high recommendation of this product for puppies in general, I would add a special recommendation for special needs or rescue puppies as a possible tool to help initial bonding to the owner and to help him/her break through their fears.  We now order this product in multiple quantities so we can have one in every room!

I don't know if it is the color or shape but they are all crazy about it.  Each will pick it up and just carry it around in their mouth forever.  I am sitting here right now watching my black lab trying to get it to squeek over and over.

If you're going to make a dog toy (and ours is not a huge chewer, they simply fell off while she was carrying the carrot around in her mouth by the leaves) you should make it sturdy!  I would not suggest this dog toy.

review/text: I have received two cartons of this macaroni so far.  The first had broken open in shipping and arrived with one flap hanging open.  Fortunately, all 20 boxes of macaroni were still in it, and only 3 or 4 of them somewhat damaged.  The second arrived taped together with clear plastic tape and only a little over half full, with eight boxes of macaroni missing and a couple of the remainder damaged.<br /><br />This macaroni is packaged too poorly to be shipped - in cartons just glued together, not particularly well.  It may be a good buy, and very welcome in the food pantry for which I order it, but I won't be buying it again.

But, to put this into perspective, I really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that.  This sauce is not really that hot, but the taste is awesome.  It definately has heat, but doesn't really have much burn.  In short; if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice.  In fact I'm browsing the internet to see about ordering a case.  (for those days when I don't want my food to have the last highly pronounced word if you follow my meaning.)

review/summary: Delicious & So Healthy!
review/text: In an effort to save during hard times, we decided to turn our once-a-week outing with our daughter and her family into a cereal supper at her house. During home school lessons, her elementary age children have learned to read labels, and they are set free at the grocery store to choose their own cereals and other products. I found this particular cereal one day while shopping and called to make sure it fit into all the required guidelines. My two grandsons and I eat almost a box of this by ourselves on Cereal Supper Night! My daughter enjoys the Pumpkin Seed flavor best, and I routinely contribute other organic cereals. As soon as we drive up on Wednesdays, I am greeted with enthusiastic greetings and cries of inquiry, "What did you bring this week, Gran?" Three days ago, my eight year old granddaughter told her neighbor that Wednesdays were her favorite day of the week. I highly recommend this cereal no matter what your age may be!

review/summary: Panama green beans
review/text: These beans have produced some enjoyable cups of coffee with a medium roast (dark brown beans with no oil on their surfaces) at 455F for 17 minutes. We have experimented, using the same roasted beans with different water sources. We have learned that the beans alone do not make the coffee. The WATER that is used also plays an important part of how your coffee tastes. Try your tap water one morning and spring water the next morning, using the same beans! SURPRISE !

review/summary: A bit acidic
review/text: The coffee is tasty but little more acidic than other kinds i tried.  May be my roasting is suboptimal and leads to the heartburn i get every time i drink this coffee.  Overall, the smell and taste is better in other kinds of unroasted coffee.  I wish the package is smaller so i get to try different kinds.

review/summary: First Time Coffee Roaster
review/text: I purchased these Beans via Amazon, and have made 3 batches using the gas grill method of roasting Beans. They roast very evenly, and I seem to getting them to the 2nd crack stage in that the beans are very dark brown, split, and oily. The beans made a good cup of coffee, and we tend to like very robust, strong coffee. Since this is the first bag we have tried I do not have others to compare them to, but it makes good coffee. The price with free shipping is a winner!

review/summary: Great price for beans!
review/text: As a home coffee roaster finding good quality beans at a good price can be a task and gamble. If you find a good source chances are you will stick with them. In this case the outcome was excellent. Using an air popper the panama beans cooked cracked and cracked again just fine. Taste is fantastic and I am very happy. I found these beans as good as any out there at a decent price.

review/summary: Most dog foods are not human-grade. There simply is no better dog food. You'll see it in your dog's coat.
review/text: I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and sadly, learned that vets don't ever get this chance. Veterinary colleges are funded by dog food companies and unfortunately, as one famous vet who wants to change all that, Dr. Pitcairn, realized, taught to treat the problem rather than discovering what's causing it and that usually relates to the diet. In fact, a tremendous increase in dog health issues can be traced back to the time that dog food companies started...when they stopped eating table scraps and began an all-processed high grain and high allergen and unnatural diet. Even though table scraps were full of dog toxins like onions, they STILL had less health issues than their process food preservative and poor balance counterparts of today.<br /><br />Funny how we wouldn't feed our kids crackers every day but feel it's okay to only feed our dogs that--high grain, poor protein, cooked out vitamins, highly processed, low nutrients...dogs who, in nature, seek out more protein.<br /><br />In fact, that is how new dog food nutrition studies began. Because vets realized that wolves and coyotes in the wild brought in for treatment if hit by a car, etc do not have the health issues our INDOOR dogs have. A wolf might be old and without fleas or tartar or itching and with a glossy coat.<br /><br />So vets like Dr. Pitcairn began studying the cause of pets with chronic issues or developing common issues too young and finding what things were toxic and unnatural and what helped prevent poor things in their diet.<br /><br />I live in the woods and have 3 dogs and have yet to have one flea because I follow this advice. In fact, I have strangers tell me (often) that my dog's fur looks like a cat's because it's so shiny. No itching. Never grew up begging for my food because theirs is complete. (It may be hard to break this habit once begun but easy if it never starts.)<br /><br />I will only feed them 3 things: a diet I make from Dr. Pitcairn's recommendations, ( I have no ties to any of these but am an activist about sharing anything good or bad for pets)  Newman's Own canned dog food, or Flint River Ranch.<br />Why? First of all, as part of my own studies I visited dog food plants. Actually this was like the biggest wakeup call on the planet for me.  I watched as I was told the "brilliant" model of putting the factories near cattle processing. When a cow is dead or dying of anything...they never determine the cause...they pick it up in a bulldozer and go take it to the dogfood plant. I WATCHED this.<br /><br />How can they do this? Do you see how you rarely see the term "human grade meat" on dog food? They don't have to be inspected if it's dog food. There are two different levels of acceptance...people cannot eat food riddled with tumors from lesions or cancer, it's okay if dog's do. According to the government regulations.  Humans are required to eat inspected meat of certain cleanliness standards and from cows processed for this reason (I don't eat meat anyway but still....)Dog food companies are not required to have such standards.<br /><br />For reals.<br /><br />So if you will recall the huge outbreak of botulism a few years back with sick dogs going to vets, dying, etc that they linked to dog foods then it happened a few months later...do you remember there were only about 5 companies that were labeled as unaffected? This was one, Newman's Own was one....why? They only use HUMAN GRADE meat. Their meat is inspected. They do not buy meat from downed cattle plants so they were released from any recall or report of possible affected products. The others bought meat from across the country at these places and it was found the cows were diseased but because they never have to check to find out what they cows died from when making them into food, it was passed along. Then it happened again a few months later. Then it happened again a year later. Yes, we hear about these things when dogs die en masse. We never, however, hear about dogs that just fall ill....<br /><br />But it gets worse.  You may see a list of vitamins and nutrients across the back of a bag of dog food. But due to the way meat is processed, they bake it at astronomically high temps to try to kill off any lesions, puss, etc. I"m not making this up. But they ARE required to have these in there...so what happens? They all bake off. You are left with some grains, high allergens like corn, and you are basically feeding your dog crackers and by-products of downed cattle.<br /><br />So, does your dog beg and salivate when you eat meat or any dinner for that matter? Does your dog dive into the grass to try to get greens and nutrients by eating grass when you go for a walk?<br /><br />There is a reason.  In nature, if you gave a human baby a banana and a bunny they would pet the bunny and eat the banana. If you gave a hungry dog the same for dinner, they'd eat the bunny first. What part of the bunny do they eat first? the stomach.  Why? This is where they get their greens and nutrients...then the meat protein. The raw bones clean their teeth without splintering.<br /><br />Yet, although we are against eating an all-processed diet, dogs in spite of begging and pleading, are now living shorter lives, with the highest health issues ever due to our thinking that it's better for them because a dog food company told us so...or vets who don't have classes in nutrition tell us so. But this isn't taught in veterinary schools and dog food companies fund and provide text books etc. I didn't say this...vets say this.<br /><br />That is changing. There is a huge off-shoot of vets now learning to find the issue and the cause (usually food related) rather than treating the issue alone.  And it turns out most issues are cured by a proper diet.<br /><br />In fact, look at your dog treats. If you see sugar in them you will realize how many dog food companies are motivated by money. And there are lots of dog treats even TARTAR CLEANING (they say) dog treats with sugar. Why? Your dog will crave them just like people do. You may also see loads of unnnatural ingredients and even toxins such as onion powder. Milo's dog treats have these. Your dog can't tell you what is slowly hurting their kidneys. It's up to you to read the labels. Dog food is not regulated. It's up to us to do that.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice about this dog food is that it looks like cookies broken a part rather than machine-made little round circles. Why? Because it it. They use inspected human-grade meat and a balance of carbs, protein, etc. that is closer to the natural diet and what a dog needs. Then they can bake it at a regular temperature that doesn't bake these out, just like you would at home. The nutrients aren't baked out. They bake it in sheets, naturally, then just break them apart.<br /><br />You may be skeptical...so give it a month or two. Take a picture of your dog's fur before (dead serious) then compare it to when it has time to grow after eating this....you will be SHOCKED. We show poor health in our hair and so do they.<br /><br />I can actually walk up to people at a dog event and tell them what they feed their dog. I have yet to be wrong and I do it often. I don't mean what brand but even people who think they are feeding their dog premium food like Iams have no idea it's just processed crackers marked up and grains and downed cattle.<br /><br />I actually point out to people the difference. I kid you not, a family barbecue, a neighborhood "house crawl", a restaurant that allows dogs outside....I can walk up and tell who gives their dog table scraps (without toxins like onions or avocados) or real food, or human grade food....I just say "what do you feed your dog?" and I've never been wrong. Their coats are SHOCKINGLY different and shinier, the dogs aren't itching, and they usually have better teeth and gums.  I have yet to be wrong.<br /><br />One lady told me how she took her dog to vets for years and it had to have steroid shots, then she finally found a vet who knew about nutrition rather than saying "feed him expensive dog food" and assumed that was good...and the dog was cured.<br /><br />Do I work for this company? No. I am a very active Amazon reviewer who speaks up heavily, especially when it comes to pets, in all my reviews of things I love or things I don't.  My dogs thrive on this but I will say, they are not fans of their dog treats. So I just look at labels and find all natural dog treats (charlee bear brand has good ones) I have no ties to this company whatsoever except for the fact that I used to only feed my dogs food I made until a vet who was an expert in nutrition told me about this (In fact this vet ALWAYS treats from the cause rather than the symptoms first...a rarity as to how vets are taught to heal.)<br /><br />this was at a time I was too busy to cook and I didn't want to give my dog just canned food even though Newman's Own is equally as good as this...<br /><br />the difference in coat was striking.  I have tried a couple other brands and one of my poms always starts scratching. This has amino acids and things that treat the coat and skin and it's perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Depending upon where you live it may be cheaper to buy direct. I anxiously await the day they finally get this on Amazon with free shipping but it has not happened yet. I'd get it on subscription then.<br /><br />There is a difference. There is a huge difference. I've spent years studying in order to be informed and I recommend few dog foods. This, however, in my opinion, is simply one that no other dog food has ever come close to when I read ingredients and balance of ingredients and look at how it's made and what kind of meat.<br /><br />If you ate artificial and processed chicken mcnuggets every day you'd fall ill too. When our dogs do people rarely suspect the dog food...they live such short lives anyway....nothing should be off balance, artificial, preservative-laden, processed, etc in their diets either so that even if they live a long life it is a full and healthy one with less arthritis, less kidney issues, less scratching etc.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.

review/summary: The best dog food on the market.
review/text: *Note: This may seem like a shill review, but I am in no way affiliated with Flint River - I am just one happy customer (well three counting my wife and pup)!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the best dog food on the market. Forget all of these pet store-sold brands that use words like "plus", "pro-formula" and "healthy" - it's marketing hype and is not beneficial for your dog. After talking with Chandler (see first reviewer) my wife and I decided to give Flint River Ranch a go. We had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264TMWU">Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Small Breed Dogs</a> and we were generally quite pleased. They at least used natural ingredients in beneficial amounts (meat always main ingredient) - but after reading up on the difference in meat quality used, as well as several recalls over the past 3 years, we decided it was time for a change. Chandler's helpful post has already outlined why using human-grade meat is important so I won't go over that, but to highlight one important thing every dog owner should realize: your dog is not a wild wolf! It has been domesticated over generations, changing its genetic makeup; he or she can't handle poor quality meat.<br /><br />Our pup had recently been suffering from allergies - Blue Buffalo helped a little but they were still present. As cute as it is to have our little pup bound up to us with a runny nose every now and then, we knew that she must be uncomfortable! We were going to go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Dog Food</a> but our dog is a 24lb. whippet mix and an examination of the kibble at a friend's place showed it to be a little too big for her. So, we jumped on Flint River's website and put an order in. We were a little nervous about our picky eater - she has a hard time with  Eukanuba when visiting the in-laws, and even when we tried a different Blue Buffalo food to mix things up she was hardly enthusiastic. Luckily for us, she jumped right on her bowl of Flint River the first time around! The kibble itself is more like broken up dog biscuits:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Human-grade meat is used<br />- No artificial preservatives or fillers<br />- NO ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS<br />- Food is twice-baked to preserve healthful properties<br />- Nicely sized, even for smaller dogs<br />- Food has never been recalled<br />- Customer Service is excellent<br />- Our dog seemed to love it<br /><br />"CONS"<br />- Price<br /><br />I put "cons" in parentheses because while you are paying more for your food, you are (a) looking out for your buddy which in my mind is worth it, and (b) you may be saving money of vet visits down the road. Dogs are genetically quite similar to humans. If a person takes care of themselves by eating well and exercising often, doctor's visits are only necessary for injuries and check-ups (at least in my experience). The same goes with dogs and vet visits!<br /><br />Listen, no dog food is going to magically make your dog run like a greyhound and pull people out of burning buildings like Lassie, but smart choices lead to a better life for your pup. Heck, we don't even know how old our dog is (looks like a puppy but has some grey on the muzzle), but we want to invest in her life by making good choices! Nothing irks me more than reviews on pet food that say "My dog didn't like this food, ONE STAR!" - your dog can't smell what food is best for them. Give it time, allow them to get used to this food and for their body to reap some of the benefits, and I hope you will find it as worth it as we did! We have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I will updated this review in a couple of months when we really start to see the positive effects!<br /><br />Still not convinced? Flint River offers four sample meals of their food for less than five bucks shipped. Give it a try before you drop the premium price!<br /><br />This food is recommended by my wife and I (and our little girl, Poppy) without reservation - if you can't afford to cook fresh chicken and rice for your dog each day, this is the next best thing! Absolutely worth the price!

review/text: This is the only dog food that my picky eater yorkie likes. The dog next door (dash) is also picky but when he tasted this food - he devoured it. According to the dog reviewer they consider this under the "average" category and that we should supplement with protein. I have been giving my dog ground beef once in awhile. Finally, something that my dog will eat!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food!
review/text: I have been looking for a high quality dog food for quite some time now, and I was especially motivated to find a company that has never had any recalls on its food. I also really wanted to look for a company that makes its product in the USA, after what we went through with the poisoned Chinese dog food scare. (My thoughts are with you if you are one of the families that lost a pet to this tragic situation).<br /><br />I found Flint River and ordered their free samples (just paid for the shipping) and my dog loved the food instantly. We just invested in the 20 pound bag after my little pup's product testing went so well last month. I can have the food delivered straight to our door and the shipping is LIGHTNING FAST!<br /><br />This food is expensive compared to what you can get at a pet food store. HOWEVER, it is definitely worth it. My little pup is very picky with dry food and this one has been a success with him. It's got top quality, human grade ingredients. Pup's coat is so shiny and soft, and he's all muscle and incredibly healthy. He's stopped scratching all the time because we've eliminated all the old, cheap food that had corn and wheat in it. He's much healthier and we have less visits to the veterinarian, too! If people eat good food to stay healthy, then our furry family members should be able to also. It turns out that many of the big brands have corn, wheat, soy and animal by-products in their dog food. Plus, the big brands bake the dog food at such high temperatures to burn off the undesirable tumors and other undigestible matter that are an inevitable part of animal by-product meal. This removes much of the nutrients from the food which have to be added back after processing, and then sprayed with special flavoring and oils to make the food palatable to your pet. The truth is that dogs got along just fine before the big dog food industry took over, eating homemade meals from their owners. Flint River Ranch will deliver this home made, wholesome meal to your dog or cat without the hassel of having to cook for Fido or Kitty every night.<br /><br /> I will never have to darken the doorways of another big box Pet Supply store ever again. Thanks again Flint River!

review/summary: Raspberry Tea with Hibiscus--What a Combo!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me--you should know this in case you are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Rotten and covered in mold
review/text: I decided that i should first research how to germinate acorns, they said you should soak them in hot water for 24 hours. I did. None of the seeds sunk, I know that it is not a completely reliable method to prove the viability of the seeds, but still! out of the 10 acorns that I bought, none sunk! They floated like dead fish. So I decided to open with a hammer 3 acorns to check their appearance. 2 out of the 3 were completely rotten with mold covering their entire surface. I would definitively not buy these seeds again! However, I have bought several species in excellent condition from this seller, that germinated.

review/summary: An exquisite cookie!
review/text: Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.  Amazon has friendly customer service and will correct the problem if you complain.

review/text: I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Mother's Sack-of-Fat Cookies [Caveat Emptor]
review/text: The English Tea and Peanut Butter Gaucho cookies, by Mother's, are probably the best tasting sandwich cookies I've ever eaten. However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]

review/summary: small & delicious
review/text: My Mom & I were itchin for a late-nite snack while on vacation out west with the rest of the family; we wandered accross the street from our motel & entered a grocery store. We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy.

review/summary: Shipment packing needs to be improved
review/text: My husband loves these cookies. We receive a shipment monthly and each shipment has been packed differently. Today we received pack of 4 which were shrink wrapped together and left in box to rattle around during shipment. We opened one package and many of the cookies are crumbled and I suspect the same to be said of those in other 3 packages. I hope someone from Amazon reads these comments and takes corrective action. I can't find these in any stores in Georgia.

review/summary: Pretty Near the Classic Version, and Better
review/text: These arrived in good condition.  They are extremely close to the old original version, and I think actually better.  They are very slightly larger and flatter, and the chocolate chips have a smoother, less chalky texture and better flavor.  The cookies are also slightly less brittle than they used to be, giving them a better bite and leading to less loose crumbs.

I have missed this so much and around where I live I can't find them in stores so I am thrilled that amazon sells these. They arrived in great condition and were well packaged. And I love getting four packs at once because then I don't have to order as often. Although our first order went pretty fast since we haven't had them in so many years. My mom doesn't order groceries from amazon so I did it for her and she was so happy I did. We love taking this on our boat and hitting the lake. Thank you amazon!

review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had.
review/text: I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite. After I finished it, I was offered another and I immediately said "YES PLEASE" and I was told I had to buy them on amazon or select states. I ordered the 4 pack. I shared some of them. Everyone that tried them liked them and many of the people are begging me to order more and want to buy them from me. Yes, the Mothers English Tea Sandwitch Cookies are THAT GOOD. If you ever wondered "Why would I ever buy cookies on the internet when there is a large selection at my local stores?" Try these and you will have you answer. If for some reason you don't like them, it won't be hard to find someone to BEG you for more. I know that if they sold these at local stores around here, they would sell a TON. I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores. Maybe they want to keep them "rare" and "special" and not just some "mainstream cookie" and have it be sort of like an "underground special treat", I'm not sure. They are worth every cent of their price. I can't say enough about these cookies. I highly recommend these to everyone. If you have to, have a few friends/family chip in and split it, if you buy the 4 pack and don't like them, you can give the other packs away as gifts/presents. A+ 5 star, my #1 favorite cookies without question.

review/text: I used these as favors for my daughter's circus birthday party.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews, the cookies do seem smaller than what I remember.  Then again, I was a kid the last time I had these, and if you look at the nutritional value, you'll be happy that you get a few more small cookies versus 2 large cookies.<br /><br />They arrived in good condition, a reasonable amount were broken which is expected, even in the store.  The seals on the back of the bags were taped to help prevent them from coming open (much appreciated).<br /><br />They tasted great and everyone from kids to adults were happy to see them as a treat.  I will order these again since I can't find big bags on store shelves.

review/summary: Mother's Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: My review is for Mother's Chocolate Chip cookies. I purchased them based on all the positive reviews of this brand. I had never previously tasted them, although I'd seen them many times at WalMart. I thought they would be a less expensive alternative to Famous Amos Chocolate Chip cookies since Amazon has recently increased the price on those considerably. I was very disappointed in the Mother's brand. It did not live up to the compliments expressed in other reviews. They seem to have a strong "baking soda" taste and the chocolate chips have no flavor. I will not purchase these again!

review/summary: So happy that Circus Animals are back!!!
review/text: I was so distraught to see my favorite cookie company go under and remember buying a bag a couple months after from a second hand seller and thinking "This is probably the last bag I will ever eat!"  Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.  Of all their cookies, the Circus Animal cookies are by far the best in my opinion (which says a lot because their entire selection is absolutely delicious!)

review/summary: Pretty Beat Up  AND EXPIRES IN LESS THEN 2 MONTHS :(
review/text: Original 1 STAR Rating Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />...12/16/2010 Splendid bubble wrapping AND a pristine box condition deceivingly held 4 packages of crumbles. I surmise these were in pretty bad shape before the bubble wrap was applied and boxed for shipment. To add insult to injury packages have BEST BY DATE of FEB0311 ...less than two months away :( The seller would have done better hosting an ice cream social using these crumbles for toppings. I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ... Smaller Version of the Old Time Favorite<br /><br />OMG Still yummy! It was like a stroll down Memory Lane. The coconut flavor carries me back to my childhood in New Jersey sitting on the front steps munching away figuring which adventure us neighborhood kids would be getting into. It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)

review/summary: Wow, Why is it so hard?
review/text: Now having a daughter going to preschool, I've been excited to buy snacks my parents weren't able to buy for me. These little snacks were for "tea time". Why packing her lunch I took a bite and ouch! They're super hard, almost has if someone put it in the freezer. I don't remember them being this hard. This will be the last bag I'll purchase.

review/summary: 150 calories for 6 cookies, -- way too much frosting
review/text: When I got these, I was looking for frosted animal crackers. However what I didn't realize is these have an abundance of frosting -- they're not just frosted on top, but covered in frosting.<br /><br />Maybe that's what customers buying this are looking for, but I am not interested in that much sugar.<br /><br />I usually eat about 20-25 or so of these in one night, but to work them off I'd have to run a quarter marathon (6.5 miles).  When I just get back from the gym, that is not what I want to see on the package.

review/summary: Taffy cookies are NOT the same!
review/text: How dissappointing. I have fond memories of the Taffy cookies from my late grandmother and her always full cookie jars.  Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these "New" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as "TAFFY" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :(

review/summary: Not the Same Cookie and they Suck
review/text: I saw a bag in the grocery aisle and had to have it.  Boy, was I sorely disappointed.  The cookies aren't half as big as I remember them being.  They were all clumped together from all the nauseating pink and white frosting.  Yeah, you actually get more pink and white frosting than you do an actual cookie.  Blecch.  These cookies are a suga-holic hyperactive kid's dream and nothing more.  I won't be buying them again.  So sad to see a good, good thing go away.

review/summary: Love those chunks!
review/text: My kitties love their food in chunks, jawing wholeheartedly while tilting their heads from side to side as they really get into the chewiness of the chunks.  So, good exercise for a start off!!  There is plenty of gravy to lubricate the morsels, and they lap that up straight away before digging into the big bits. To see them enjoy not only the taste but also the process makes it well worth the money.  Highly recommend this but only if your kitty really loves chunky food!

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: My kitten loves this food.  She is a 6 month old siamese mix.  I like that it has a lot of liquid in it as she doesn't drink as much water as I would like.  She eats it all up, I give it to her twice a day and dry food during the day.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: My cat is diabetic and I wanted a high protein grainfree food. He loves it and his coat has become more healthy looking as well. He can't even wait for me to get it out of the can before tries to gooble it. I hightly recommend and the price is very good compared to in a pet supply store.

review/summary: I cannot believe I just paid $17.95 for a bag of chips (crushed chips!)
review/text: Clearly I need to brush up on my math skills. I ordered the Riceworks brown rice crisps assuming the $17.95 price was reflective of a bulk purchase - because who in their right mind would pay $17.95 for ONE BAG OF CHIPS. But - sadly - no, the $17.95 was reflective of one 16oz bag of chips. No, really - it is/was. To add to this purchasing disaster, the chips were completely crushed resulting in a price average of .10/chip crumb. It's *almost* funny.

review/summary: They don't like it, but they eat it
review/text: My cats aren't very fond of the taste. It took forever to get them to switch to this food. When I give them this, they leave it in the bowl and pick at it all day. If I give them their old food, they'll eat all of it within half an hour. Perhaps that's better, and will help keep their weight down. I did not notice a difference in their coat or the smell of their litter box. There was two or three weeks of vomiting before fully switching over though. Which was gross to say the least. I have found that my cats eat much much less than the recommended amount on the bag.<br /><br />Took one star off because they only tolerate it.

review/summary: Stinky poo
review/text: The ingredients are great but my cat's litter box smelled HORRENDOUS all the time that she was on this food.  I know diet changes sometimes cause a temporary issue, so I kept on giving it to her hoping it would resolve itself after her digestive system had time to get used to the new food, but it was equally stinky all the way to the end of the bag.<br /><br />She was on another high quality grain free food (Wellness Core) before this, I just wanted to try something different so she'd have some variety, but unfortunately this won't work.  Maybe it's just my kitty and maybe it'll work for some other cat.  The ingredients seem really good.  Good luck!

review/summary: Its healthy and my cat loves it!!!
review/text: My cat is very meticulous and finicky in what he wants.  He likes this Nature's Variety Instinct Chicken more than any others that I have bought.  As for myself, I want him to eat as healthy as I do.  Reading the label of what is in there reflects that it is healthy so you feel good for what you feed your pet.  I will definitely start buying the large bag for the better price value.  As for the different tastes, I always hear that most cats like the chicken the most so I simply change the canned foods daily.

review/summary: It'd be great if kitty liked it...
review/text: This cat food has a great ingredient list*; one of the best I've ever seen in my life. And it may seem more expensive than say Friskies or Whiskas, but do you really want to, later on, pay thousands of dollars every year, treating your cat's diabetes/cancer/hyperthyroidism/heart problems/etc. caused by years of being fed rotting by-products, "meats", and fats from EXTREMELY questionable sources**; allergen causing, molding grains; and cancer-causing preservatives?<br /><br />**What I'm say is that if your cat's food has a "no named/unspecified-animal in the form of 'by-products', 'meats', and/or 'fat'" in it, you can be certain that Kitty/Fluffy/Princess is eating euthanized pets/zoo animals, roadkill, pieces of meat where antibiotics were injected into, and the like.<br /><br />Loosen up your wallets: You don't need to upgrade your iPhone every time Apple releases a new one with a better camera and a 3D screen; or by a new flat screen T.V. for the game. And you probably don't need to eat out every week/every other week with friends, or spend $100+ on one pair designer jeans or a cute 1 oz jar of "age-defying" petroleum by-products sold on counters in a ritzy boutique. Your pets deserve better, especially since they live such short lives compared to ours.<br /><br />I'd changed my cat to this food, and she had gotten a very shiny and glossy coat from the few weeks she ate the food, but unfortunately she just didn't really like it, and finally gave up on it.  Also, I wouldn't advise you to do this but (because the kibble has a raw meat coating to entice a cat to eat it), the kibble tastes good, for a human set of taste buds. It isn't minerally (like Blue Buffalo's Weight Control Adult) or salty, either.<br /><br />I'd also like to remind folks reading this review to rotate your cats/pets meals once in a while. You don't eat the same Chicken and Rice/Tapioca with fruits and vegetables everyday for 15 years, do you? Neither should your pet.<br /><br />*Ingredient List: Chicken Meal, Chicken Fat, Tapioca, Salmon Meal, Natural Chicken Flavor, Pumpkinseeds, Sun-Cured Alfalfa Meal, Montmorillonite Clay, Vitamins (Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, Ascorbic Acid, Biotin, Niacin Supplement, Vitamin A Acetate, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Carotene, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid), Minerals (Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Sodium Selenite, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide), Sea Salt, Dried Kelp, DL-Methionine, Taurine, Direct-Fed Microorganisms (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Yeast Culture, Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longibrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract), Inulin, Flaxseed Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary Extract, Apples, Chicken Eggs, Cottage Cheese, Cranberries, Freeze Dried Chicken, Freeze Dried Turkey, Freeze Dried Turkey Liver, Freeze Dried Turkey Heart, Ground Chicken Bone, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Salmon Oil, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Olive Oil, Duck Eggs, Pheasant Eggs, Quail Eggs, Rosemary, Sage, Clove
