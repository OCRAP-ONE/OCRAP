review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: CBD Orange Pekoe was a pleasant surprise.  I've been a drinker of Lipton Yellow Label, which Amazon was out of stock on the size I normally bought, so I figured this would hold me over until the Yellow Label came in.  They are both pure Orange Pekoe teas, and I like them both. However, after drinking this tea, the Coffee Bean Direct is better.  They are different cuts or grade, the CBD is a whole leaf grade, while the Lipton Yellow Label is cut or broken but not ground or dust like tea bags.  They are both good teas, but the CBD clearly stands out as the winner.  Its nice to see quality teas like these available on Amazon.<br />For the record Orange Pekoe is a grade of tea leaf, its not orange flavor, or made with oranges or oranges, orange oils etc.  Its generally considered to be a higher than average quality tea leaf.  There are many different kinds of Orange Pekoe (OP), ranging from mid level teas, to the very best or most expensive teas.<br /><br />The bottom line for this product, if you like a good cup of hot tea, or glass of iced tea, it's hard to go wrong with this tea.  At $12.43 for 2 lbs its a great price for a very good tea, the only thing that could go wrong would be if Amazon or CBD increased their price.<br /><br />Their Earl Grey is also an Excellent product.  I frequently blend some with this OP for a milder Earl Grey, or richer OP.

review/text: This is probably one of the best cups of Orange Pekoe tea I have tried. The flavor is very good, not too weak and not strong or bitter. Sure beats the Lipton tea bags. Price was excellent and the fast service from Amazon was great. This will last a while, but I will sure be re-ordering when this gets low. Even tried making it in my Keurig with the single cup filter and it turned out great.

review/summary: Great tea, awsome price
review/text: As with all of my food reviews, I like to begin by acknowledging that tastes and processing differ from person to person and from batch to batch, respectively. Water is just . . .  so water, if you know what I mean; most of my fluid intake is in the form of tea and coffee both of which I consume throughout the day and night. (And no, there is no such thing as too much coffee or tea. Furthermore, mindful of one of healthcare's biggest myths perpetuated by the uninformed, one does not need to drink n-number of glasses of pure water every day: the body will extract all of the water it needs from any source of liquid)<br /><br />I drink two kinds of tea: orange pekoe, primarily with meals, hot or iced, and Earl Grey. The Coffee Bean Direct orange pekoe tea produces a pleasing cup of tea which, for me, is not too acidic (tannin) and whose taste persists from the first cup to the last when produce in gallon lots. At $12.43 for the two-pound bag, the CBD orange pekoe compares most favorably with other premium brands, both in taste and cost.

review/summary: Not for me...
review/text: I bought this tea because I love Lipton tea that is made with orange pekoe as well. After trying this tea for two weeks in several different ways and playing around with quantity and brewing time, I had to give the rest away to a colleague to try. There is an extra flavor in this tea that I can't place and I just don't like. I don't know if my colleague liked it. But I have since found another tea company through which I have found many much better teas. Before you buy this large package, contact Coffee Bean Direct directly and request a sample size of their teas for $2 each and free shipping. I will say that I tried three other teas from this company and also disliked them.

review/summary: Disappointed in this tea!
review/text: I have been using Direct Coffee Bean Earl Grey tea and I think it is superb! My granddaughter won't drink any other kind of tea. I decided to try the Orange Pekoe and it hardly had any flavor. Like others, I used double the amount of tea I was using for other loose teas. It is better but certainly not what I am used to. I will not be ordering anymore. I will go back to my favorite, which is the Dilmah loose Ceylon tea.

review/summary: Iced Tea  No Way!
review/text: Coffee Bean Direct brand Orange Pekoe Loose Leaf Tea, 2 Pound Bag arrived on time, however, after the first use I am not pleased.  When the bag was opened I noticed the product was speckled with small stems.  In my opinion far too many stems were included with the leaves.  I used approximately 3/4 cup of the tea per gallon of water.  I first steeped the tea in freshly boiled water for about 15 minutes in a quart pan then into the gallon pitcher with cold water.  Very little flavor.  It seemed like the tea was quite old, perhaps not, I am not a tea critic but this tea will more than likely end up being added to the mulch pile in the back yard.  Again, I found the tea to be near flavorless, as in drinking amber colored water.  Perhaps it was a bad batch but I most likely will not gamble with this brand again.

review/summary: Flavor is okay
review/text: We generally order our tea from a store in Alaska, but saved more than 75% (loose tea is expensive) on this bag.  I'd like to try other kinds in this brand, and it's certainly worth a try, but I think it's weaker.  Though, that still makes it worth it -- use twice as much, and you're still paying less.  I wouldn't recommend if you're a "tea specialist" or as a gift for a known tea-lover, because it's visually and tastes cheap, but it's not awful if you order it for yourself and know that it's a little less exciting than other ones.  The bag is nice and keeps it fresh, or at the very least, it doesn't make it lose its flavor.

review/text: I have been looking for some nice, salty jerky for quite some time now.  It seems like most the stuff in the stores is filled with either sugar or corn syrup or both.  The only corn syrup in this is a component of the soy sauce used.  Therefore, there isn't that nasty sweet taste that is in so much jerky.<br /><br />The texture of this jerky is also dry.  This was a plus for me as I don't like the moist and chewy stuff.<br /><br />Each of the pieces is about three to four inches long and about as big around as a Twizzler.  They are also full muscle (not chopped and formed).<br /><br />Yes, it's pricey, but it's good jerky!

review/summary: Not like anything I've ever had before
review/text: I truly expected these to be thin & crispy cookies, I suppose this was due to the use of cocoa in the product & description.  I could not have been more wrong!<br /><br />The texture reminds me of a club cracker or puffed cereal of some sort, light and airy but crunchy at the same time.  They are not at all flat & thin like Wheat Thins.  They are also not very big - I'm adding a photo to the product photos above so you can see them in perspective with my hand.<br /><br />I did NOT find the taste to be chocolate-y, at least not at first.  Rather it begins tasting like a rice & sesame blend.  The finishing flavor is that of chocolate for sure, but it is not a sweet chocolate taste - definitely more subtle - all about the cocoa itself instead of sugary.  I'm not sure where the sea salt comes in, I don't really pick up on any saltiness.<br /><br />There are 130 calories in 46 pieces - that's a lot of pieces without breaking my snack calorie count (I try to keep it at 150 calories for a between-meals snack).  Plus with the levels of calcium (10%DV), Vit.E (4%DV), Iron (4%DV), and Fiber (2g, 8%DV), I find this to be a better option than crackers.<br /><br />This is not a super-sweet snack, but it does satisfy my love of chocolate in a surprising way.  I definitely enjoyed these after getting used to the subtle flavors.

review/summary: Subtle cocoa goodness - but not to everyone's taste
review/text: I'm guessing that the "Eat.Think.Smile" name is a tie in to the trend toward "slow foods" in cooking and "mindful eating" in dieting.  As in, do not grab the bag of cheetos and just start gobbling.<br /><br />These crackers do fit that bill, but taste is subjective.  I had to hold back from the gobbling, being a fan of subtle cocoa-y flavors (such as in chili or mole) and mildly salty snacks. My picky middle kid also liked these:  "Weird, but good!"  But the rest of the family ranged from "Huh?" to "Please never give me this again!"  Forever the optimist, I may yet try to introduce these as toppings for a fruity salad or ice cream or something.<br /><br />Health digression:  much is made on the packaging here of the benefits of whole grains (brown rice, oats, sesame seed) and the antioxidant power of cocoa.  I'm with food author Michael Pollen here - "superfood" claims are marketing, pure and simple, and processed "super" snacks can't begin to compare - healthwise - to fresh, unprocessed foods.  Still, these crisps beat the heck out of most packaged snacks, and I'd gladly recommend them for toddlers over the usual cheerios, except for one timely caution:  at this writing, recent news reports have raised alarms over the (trace) arsenic levels in brown rice products - flour, syrup, etc. - with an emphasis on the concern over brown rice syrup in infant formulas.  This, as the rice plant has a natural affinity for arsenic and takes up that dangerous metal along with the chemically similar silica that rice requires for growth.  (White rice, which is simply hulled brown, retains less - but some - of this trace metal.)  Arsenic based pesticides - used for decades - can persist in the soil even where long discontinued, so experts addressing the arsenic-in-rice issue have recommended looking for organic brown rices.<br /><br />It doesn't look to me like Apure Foods (maker of Eat.Think.Smile) sources organic rice, or other organic ingredients, for that matter.  I'm pretty sure they'd tout it on their packaging and website, were that so. But really, if ordinary rice is a normal part of your diet, there's no point in getting worked up over a more occasional snack source.<br /><br />But why, oh why are these crackers called "thins"?  They are small and "puffed out", much like the kitty treats in our household.  (Note to self: Do not mix up.)  They are also MINE.  I guess if you like these, you really do.

review/summary: Surprisingly different, surprisingly good
review/text: I am not a nutritionist so I can not evaluate or judge beyond very general knowledge the claims made on the pouch about the natural antioxidant power of cocoa. Therefore, my review is purely about the product itself.<br /><br />I find this to be a surprisingly interesting and different snack. The pieces are roughly triangular and the longest side is about 1" long, so these are fairly small. According to the package, the serving size is 46 pieces which come in at 130 calories. Of these, 45 are fat calories. The pieces are crispy-crunchy but "airy", almost like toasted cereal but again - surprisingly satisfying (and quite filling!).<br /><br />I do not taste much of the cocoa, and the snack is also not overly sweet, which is probably why the manufacturer suggests such varied use such as in salads, with wine, or as a treat all by itself. I find the balance between sweet and salty quite well done. The ingredient I can taste the most is the sesame seed but it is not overbearing, just adds a nice hearty something to the snack experience.<br /><br />For those of you who are interested in the nutritional information, here goes:<br /><br />Total Fat 5 g<br />Saturated Fat 1 g<br />Trans Fat 0 g<br />Cholesterol 0 mg<br />Sodium 135 mg<br />Total Carbs 19 g<br />Dietary Fiber 2 g<br />Sugars 6 g<br />Protein 3 g<br /><br />Vitamins: No A and C, Vitamin E 4 %; Calcium 10 %, Iron 4 %, Magnesium 8 %<br /><br />Ingredients (listed already in the product description but...):<br />Brown rice flour; sun flower seed butter (sunflower seeds, sugar, salt, mono and diglycerides, natural mixed tocopherols, to preserve freshness); dried cane syrup; rice flour, cocoa, sesame seeds; whole oat flour; whole grain yellow corn flower; wheat flour; sea salt; calcium carbonate; monoglycerides; natural flavor (milk).<br /><br />I actually did not expect this to be very good and stand corrected.

review/summary: Not for Me
review/text: These snacks are basically a triangular puffed grain mixed with cocoa, then covered with sesame seeds and sea salt.  The chocolate sea salt mix sounded intriguing, so I decided to give these a try.  The taste is definitely unusual.  I ate the first few and thought they were unusual and tasty.  After the first few, however, I got sick of these really quickly.  There's just too much chocolate in these snacks for my taste.  They're sweet, but not in a good way.  I could eat a few of these (about three), but beyond that I just couldn't handle any more.  Interesting idea, for sure, but they weren't very good in the execution.

review/summary: I really like the IDEA of these, I just didn't really enjoy them
review/text: I like the idea of making more foods with chocolate - I like chocolate and cocoa has some healthy properties. I also like salty foods. I'm always looking for healthy snack choices and these have whole grain oats and whole brown rice, as well as sesame seeds.<br /><br />As a result, I was excited to try these "crispy thins." They have a chocolate taste, and are crunchy, but aren't very salty though that is probably a good thing as a lot of people are trying to limit their sodium.  I couldn't distinguish the taste of the sesame seeds in them and found that when I poured them out of the bag the crisps had a lot less sesame seeds on the surface than the ones in the photograph on the bag.<br /><br />Because I received several bags I shared some with a guest visiting me and asked her impression. She thought they had a bit of a burnt taste to them.<br /><br />As the title of my review indicates, these aren't something that I would be interested in buying for myself or to serve to guests. However, I encourage people to give them a try and see for themselves - there wasn't anything that I found objectionable about the flavor.<br /><br />One interesting thing about them is that both I and my guest initially mis-read the package as "FAT. THINK. Smile." When it actually reads "EAT. THINK. Smile."  To me that's an indication that the seller should change the font on the package - or maybe just an odd coincidence.

review/summary: Misnomer
review/text: From the name of this product: "Crispy Thins, Savory Sea Salt", I thought these would be thin crackers, with a savory (not sweet) taste. Not. At. All.  They are not thin, they are puffy little nuggets.  They are not crackers (i.e. that one could put cheese on), they are more like a bite-sized cereal.  AND they are sweet like a cereal... not savory at all.  I taste no sea salt- which is too bad because I like a salty-sweet.  They're like... triangular Cocoa Krispies with a few sesame seeds.  WAY too sweet, like a kids' cereal.<br /><br />They are tasty, I'll give you that.  In moderation because they are sickeningly sweet after more than a few.  But a handful can be a nice chocolate fix.  Sometimes.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Tasty, but badly mis-named.  Not a savory cracker; more of sweet cereal-like snack.  Oh, and if you read the label you can see that while they do have some good healthy ingredients (brown rice flour, sesame seeds), they are still a processed snack, NOT a health food.

review/summary: Relatively healthy, satisfies chocolate cravings
review/text: These are quite different than what I expected. I've kept a bag at home in the pantry, and a bag at work in my desk drawer. Whether I like them at any given moment "depends".<br /><br />Each piece is a triangle, roughly the size of a dime. They're a bit puffed, and contain chocolate. Some of the pieces contain enough chocolate to provide a creamy consistency. Surprisingly, a serving is 46 pieces, which ends up being a really good fulfilling snack. From a nutritional perspective, it's better than what I thought, but not stellar. A serving is only 130 calories, with a 45 of those from fat -- 5g of fat, 1g of saturated fat. While it provides 2g of fiber, sugar is 6g. Sodium comes in at 135g -- but these don't necessarily taste salty; in fact, the "sea salt" is quite subtle and works well with the chocolate.<br /><br />They are made with cocoa, whole grain oats, sesame seeds (as a topping), and brown rice. The only way to describe them is "cereal-like". I tend to grab these, while at work, as a mid-morning snack. They are easy to count-out and track calorie-wise.<br /><br />At home, though, I never reach for them, even on days when I'm home. Maybe it's because I have other options available, but they don't "call to me" -- they aren't something I crave. Therefore, given all the choices out there, this isn't something I'm likely to pick-up again<br /><br />Something great to try, but not compelling enough to buy again.

review/summary: Like dog food, but not in a bad way
review/text: On first bite, I thought these tasted like Rice Chex. But everyone else who's tried them has said, "Hm, they taste like dog food. But not in a bad way."<br /><br />They're light, cocoa-y but not sweet, with just a hint of salt. They feel like they keep me going until my next regularly scheduled meal without causing sugar or sodium shock, and they feel relatively wholesome -- not, like, kale or sprouted almond wholesome, but wholesome for an easy snack.<br /><br />Overall, they're not blow-your-mind delicious or anything, but they're pleasant, and way more appealing than doritos or oreos. If you like (or don't mind) rice and sesame, and don't need or want something with a plethora of artificial flavors, then these are a nice choice.

review/summary: Mmmm not sure
review/text: I was excited about these, I like "salty" style snacks, and I thought the combination of cocoa and sea salt would be interesting.<br />Out of the packet, first impression is breakfast cereal, in size and shape, not unlike one of the many chocolate square styles around. These are small, don't expect nice big chip size pieces.<br />Taste was eclectic, first crunchy, nutty, and sesame come through strongly, similar to a Japanese rice cracker. Slowly, and with subsequent bites, you get a chocolate cocoa secondary taste. It may sound weird but there's a sort of chocolate "oil" taste, that's not unpleasant, but gives a cocoa taste linger.<br />Overall I wasn't impressed, yes they're pretty low on the calorie counter, but that's the point isn't it? - if we are eating this stuff as it's better for us than potato chips or chocolate, the least it can do is taste really good.<br />Too many flavors going on for my choice, and too much with the sesame seed coating, without that these might have tasted more like a chocolate snack, and less like muddled mix of flavors.

review/summary: An interesting combination of flavors unlike anything I've ever tried
review/text: I tried the Eat, Think, Smile crispy thins, and it was an interesting journey for my taste buds. I was expecting a primarily cocoa/chocolate taste from these thins, but the cocoa flavor was subtle and mixed with rice and sunflower seeds (cocoa is only the fifth ingredient behind brown rice flour, sunflower seed butter, cane syrup and rice flour).  I even tasted sesame seeds and yellow corn in these chips, and that is alot of different flavors for one snack crisp.  The product is all natural and relatively low in sugar (only 6 grams per serving).  I don't mind some combination of tastes (chocolate and peanut butter are great combinations) but cocoa, sesame, sunflower seeds, yellow corn and brown rice?  This product uses quality ingredients, but the wide variety of tastes mixed into one crispy thin was too odd for me. Then again, taste is subjective, so someone else may appreciate the wide variety of flavors in one crispy thin. Just know what you are getting yourself into before you buy.

review/summary: Very tasty morsels but they are not a health snack in my opinion
review/text: I really like the flavor of these Savory Sea Salt Crispy Thins.  They definitely have a strong cocoa taste to them. These thins are more like morsels and look like large-size triangular-shaped hard cat food.<br /><br />Each bag is 6 ounces. There are 6 one-ounce servings per bag at 130 calories (45 from fat) per serving.  The first three ingredients are brown rice flour, sunflower seed butter, and sugar which in my opinion makes them closer to dessert than healthy eating. Despite this I really enjoy the instense cocoa flavor with a hint of salt.  I find it very hard to stop eating them.

review/summary: Tastes Like Cereal
review/text: These reasonably healthy snacks got a thumbs up from my husband and four-year-old. I found them, well, different, in terms of snack food. Slightly sweet, but not overly so, with a hint of salt and sesame. These reminded me most of snacking on dry breakfast cereal. The chips/thins themselves are also about the same size as Frosted Flakes-size cereal bites. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting, based on the product photos and advertising. I was thinking they would be thinner, based on description, and more chip-like. (Maybe something in the rice cracker family? These are much denser than that.<br /><br />I can see how they'd be tasty on salads as a crouton replacement, though I haven't tried them that way yet, but can't see myself eating them out of hand all that often; though my son asked for more. These are just a little too dry and bland for my tastes and the sweetness, which lingers long after you eat them, kind of threw me off ... And this is from someone who regularly eats organic blue corn flax seed chips, not Lays or Doritos. (Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, taste-wise.)<br /><br />Though you're kidding yourself if you think these are health food, they are definitely a better option than regular chips at 130 calories for a good-sized serving, with only 45 of those calories coming from fat, though the sodium content is pretty high (135 mg/serving).<br /><br />Honestly, I was done after less than half a full serving (which the bag defines as about 46 chips), so these could be a fairly low-cal snack option, IF they fit your flavor profile. Though the marketing boast buzz is all about cocoa and its antioxidant properties, cocoa is at least halfway down the ingredient list, well behind two kinds of rice flour, which is mainly what you're eating here. (Brown rice flour is ingredient number one, followed by sunflower seed butter and I think regular rice flour is No. 3 or 4 on the list.)<br /><br />All in all, just so-so for me, and I don't think I'd go out and buy them again for myself, though they are far from terrible, and I will use the remainder on salads. But, given the flavor profile, if you're someone who likes to snack on dry cereal, you'll probably enjoy them BUT just buying the cereal will likely be a more cost effective, and likely calorie equivalent, option.

review/text: Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Savory Sea Salt<br /><br />Never one to shy away from trying something new, if a snack product boasts of being all natural and antioxidant -- on the front of the package --, it usually ends up in my shopping cart, especially of late, 'cuz that's the way I roll. :)<br /><br />Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Savory Sea Salt was an especially nice surprise, as I found it to be crispy, crunchy, not messy, with an extraordinarily satisfying cocoa/light sea salt taste -- that did not leave me feeling bloated/over stuffed, if ya know what I mean.  The extra thick zip-lock like re sealable bag really came in handy, as I was tempted to eat more than one of the 6 portions contained in the bag.  It is that good!  :)<br /><br />You might also like to try, as I did, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVB9S">Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Sweet Cinnamon</a>.

review/summary: Is it illegal to taste this good?
review/text: Eat. Think. Smile. has me wrapped around their finger. After trying the dark cherry chocolate bars and the berry nut ones, I tried out their take on what are essentially chips. I have to say, these are the best thing by the company that I've had so far. If you like chocolate at all, then you'd be doing yourself a huge favor by ordering some of these. Each bite is better than the last, and I actually got disappointed each time I was finished with a bag, knowing that I'd reached the end.<br /><br />Not only are these Crispy Thins not very bad for you, they're the perfect snack time food. Each bag is a decent size, and if you happen to go through a whole bag in one sitting, it isn't going to make you feel horrible. Low in calories and fat, it's absurd how low in calories and fat these are. The sea salt flavor is very faint, which is a 50/50 thing for me. On one hand, I love salt, but on the other, it's a health-thing and it's good that they didn't go overboard in this category. These snacks would be perfect packed in paper bag lunches or thrown into a bowl on the counter for all to enjoy. Even better? Throwing a bag of these into a bowl and adding milk, making for a cereal that'll blow your mind. Trust me.<br /><br />I'm not this enthusiastic about many foods, but these babies came out of nowhere and caught me by surprise. The only problem? The price is a bit high for how much you're getting. If you get as hooked as I did, one bag isn't going to last very long, unless you're a calorie counter. I don't eat much at all, but this is the kind of thing I can go nuts with and not feel guilty. Get a bag and see how it fares with you.

review/summary: Try them first before you commit to buying six bags!
review/text: These lightly salted, dark cocoa tidbits are the kind of snack that you're likely to eat by the handful -- IF you like them.  I like the flavor combination (I've eaten sea salt dark chocolate bars, and the flavor is similar); these have just enough salt to bring out the not-too-sweet chocolate flavor and a hint of sesame.  My husband, though, sampled a handful and wasn't impressed.  He didn't like the size (he would have preferred a chip or cracker size), and he found the flavor bland.  If you, like me, enjoy dark chocolate -- that is, cocoa flavor without a lot of sweetness -- you have a decent chance of liking these.<br /><br />The description suggested eating these with wine, and, since I know dark chocolate goes with red wine, I sampled some of them that way.  While the cocoa brought out the taste of the wine a bit, I'd rather have cheese or fruit with my wine.  Yeah, it was interesting to sample, but it wasn't good enough for me to plan on bringing the crisps out the next time I open a bottle.<br /><br />I don't know why the manufacturer calls these "thins" because they are basically little puffed, crunchy triangles -- about the size of Wheat Chex. I found the mouth-feel odd as well:  they turn kinda gummy and fudgy when you start to chew them.  I found it disconcerting that something crunchy would end up stuck to my teeth.  At least I like the flavor!<br /><br />The package says that these crisps contain a lot of antioxidants.  If I want a boost of antioxidants, I'll eat a square of dark chocolate or a no-calorie mug of green tea.  But these are good for more filling snacking.  The bag uses a serving size of 46 pieces for 130 Calories -- that's a little less than 1/2 cup.  The only notable nutrients in a serving are 3g of protein and 10% of the RDA for calcium.  A serving also contains 6g of sugar.<br /><br />These come in resealable bags, six servings per bag.  While the thins are probably more healthy than potato chips, don't confuse them with health food.  They are sweet snacks that, if you like the flavor, can become addictive.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/text: A great crunch!  It took me a moment to identify the predominant taste as sunflower seeds. The cocoa gives a rich undertone, but without the sweetness, the taste is not what I would usually describe as chocolatey.  I need to pour a half-cup or so out of the bag and put it away; otherwise, I eat too many of these!  They really are nice with red wine.  I haven't tried them on a salad yet, but that sounds like a good idea!

review/summary: Wow, Surprisingly Tasty, Rich and Satisfying
review/text: When I tried Eat Think Smile I had that very reaction. I ate it and thought, "wow, that's very different tasting, what is that?" I quickly realized that it is different in a good way. Tthe dominant flavor was unusual to me because it seemed nutty (but there are no nuts listed) but what I was really tasting was the sunflower seed butter and sesame seeds, which in my opinion are "nutty" tasting even though not nuts. Combined with the light taste of cocoa and a little salt, its a very unique combination that did make me smile! The suggested serving size is the right size and satisfying in my opinion; its very rich tasting to me and does have 5 grams of fat per serving (although there is no cholesterol) so its best not to exceed the serving size or exceed it by much. Its crunchy and a couple handfuls is a nice snack that satsfies a sweet tooth (6 grams of sugar) for only 130 calories. And it does seem reasonably nutritious, consisting of a lightly sweetened mix of whole grains and seeds with some cocoa. The texture is kind of like cereal, but what seems different to me is the sunflower seed butter and the whole sesame seeds give it a different taste and texture than cereal I have tried. This may sound strange (because there are no nuts and the grains appear to have been ground together and shaped into airy little pillows) but it reminds me tastewise of snacking on pieces of a Nature Valley peanut butter granola bar and probably falls into the same category of snack food for me.

review/summary: A HUGE hit at our house!
review/text: As a working mom healthy snacks are important in my house. I don't always have time for cooking full on healthy meals - which often translates to my daughter eating less-than-ideal foods in a pinch. I am the low fat, low sodium, healthy food option person -- and my teen is the whatever-I-can-find-to-sate-my-hunger option. Sometimes that is an issue.<br /><br />These are like a cross between a cereal (that you can eat as a snack) and a cracker. They have a good flavor and are pretty robust for being so little. They are kind of rich (probably the cocoa) so, for us, it was hard to eat more than a small toddler type bowl full which is great as that's the serving size. The crackers stayed crisp in the bag and really just have a very nice flavor. They are very good with coffee and tea as well.<br /><br />They are easy to take with you as the bag is not heavy and fits in (well in my anyway) purse. These will be a purchase for us when our supply runs out!

review/summary: Chocolaty Crunchy Triangle Puffs. Not Too Salty, Not Too Sweet. A Decent Alternative to Satisfy the Afternoon Snack Cravings.
review/text: Like others, I was expecting a crisp, flat salty cocoa cracker covered with sesame seeds.  What is in the bag looks more like Chex Mix Puppy Chow without the powder sugar coating.  But, while Puppy Chow is very sweet & not chock full of "healthy" ingredients, Eat Think Smile Savory Sea Salt bites are chocolaty (some bites seem to have a soft chocolate middle), not overly sweet and contain healthier ingredients.<br /><br />The Savory Sea Salt flavor is a confusing flavor description.  The bites are predominately chocolate flavored.  There is a bit of sweet flavor & a touch of salt flavor and a bit of sesame seed on top of some of the bites, the overall flavor is not what I would define as "savory".<br /><br />So, what to do with these bites?  I would use them as a snack alternative to chocolate.  I think they work best as snack to satisfy a sweet tooth, but they could also be used as part of an h'orderve tray, or to slightly crush & put on ice cream.  I would not use them as croutons, but I am not enough of a chocolate fan to want chocolate on my salad.<br /><br />If you are in a "healthier" mode, but realistic enough to know that you aren't going to completely give up on crunchy snacks, these bites are worth trying.  They have a not so ordinary taste that it is difficult to describe, but it is a taste that will likely grow on you with each bite.  They are worth a shot.

review/text: How to describe it - it is like cocoa puffs with more oat and in square shapes. And of course the ingredient list seems to suggest better nurition and healthier dosage of fiber. My 4-year old likes it very much. He could eat a handful at each sitting.<br />The rest of us used it as a great substitude of cereal.

review/text: Eat, Think, Smile Crispy Thins are small little crisps with a taste that would best be enjoyed by adults. It's a combination of sesame and chocolate taste, and it's not really sweet at all. It's the kind of thing to savor while eating slowly. It's not a chip. It's not a cookie. But it is somewhat like both.<br /><br />If you are in for a new kind of snack that is more subtle than anything else, give these a try.

review/summary: Good - Low Calorie - BBQ Alternative
review/text: I saw the Just Add Juice advertised and wanted to give it a try.  BBQ sauce is so loaded with sugar that our family can no longer eat it due to dietary restrictions.  This is a wonderful alternative.  We found a lower sugar apple juice and used that in conjunction with the packet, following the instructions.  Our first attempt we marinaded for only about 30 minutes.  It had a very light flavor.  The second attempt we marinaded for around 5-6 hours and it was just right.  We have also tried the tequilla-lime flavor which is outstanding.  I'd give this one 4 stars and the tequilla-lime 5 stars.  I'd definately buy this product again.

review/text: I have been buying Emerald Deluxe Mixed Nuts for quite a while now and have never encountered a bad or a stale nut. I buy the 10 oz size because it's just right to pour into a bowl when company comes. If they aren't all eaten, just pour back into the container and they'll stay fresh for quite a while. I love Emerald's mixture of walnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans--AND NO PEANUTS! Peanuts are legumes, not true nuts, and don't belong in a cocktail nut mixture. To me, they overwhelm the taste of "real" nuts. Sure, these cost a little more, but aren't you worth it? I know I am!

review/summary: My New Favorite Nut Mix - Mystery Nut is the Marcona Almond
review/text: I LOVE this Deluxe Nut Mix!  I happened to make the purchase because I had a $1.00 coupon.  Better than Planters and - yaaay!  No peanuts! As others have mentioned, I did notice the "mystery" nut - yummy and not hard like the roasted almonds in other mixes.  Since there was a review which expressed concern that it was an apricot kernal, I called Diamond Foods today. The mystery nut is a Marcona Almond. (If you google Marcona almond, you'll see pics as well). Donna in Consumer Relations told me they used to just have the marconas, but they are a more expensive gourmet nut so now they have two types of almonds. She also noted that they receive lots of calls regarding the "mystery" nut.<br /><br />I did suggest that given that so many consumers have noticed it and it seems to really make this type of impression, perhaps they should specifically list it in the ingredients or just note it in the description on the label somewhere.<br /><br />So no apricot kernals. :)

(Shipping will drastically change that equation, so ymmv if you aren't a prime member or subscribe and save buyer.)<br /><br />The product. Great mixed nuts without peanuts. They include walnuts, which are the best nut source of Omega-3 fatty acids, and brazil nuts, which are a top source of selenium. The 4-pack split up into plastic snack bags makes a heart healthy snack for every day of the month. My problem? They're too good, so I open the containers and finish all 4 in about a week and a half.<br /><br />This is one of the deals that makes Amazon worth visiting.

review/summary: Nuts For Me
review/text: Anyone who'd order quadruplet cannisters of Emerald Mixed Nuts must really like them. I just received my first order of the four cannister set from Amazon, and in cashew you were wondering, I love these things. An almost empty container of Emerald Mixed nuts sits before me for inspiration. Inside is a delightful mix of cashews, almonds,walnuts,  pecans and brazil nuts. I especially like that cashews and almonds dominate the mix and that there is nary a peanut to be found. Yes, they're salted, but not overly so, and oily fingers don't go hand in hand with the Emerald mix as they do with other brands.<br /><br />Nuts are healthy in moderation so I eat a handful or so a day. This mix is so good, that self control isn't always easy. As for price, I'm certainly satisfied. Around these parts the Emerald selections go for $6.50 a container in most stores, and I'm getting them for half that from Amazon with free shipping and a scheduled shipment every four months.<br /><br />The Emerald Mixed Nuts are great tasting treats with a long shelf life.

I think the nuts are also priced just right too although Amazon raised the price lately.

review/text: As I work nights, I've tried almost EVERY energy drink out there. They usually taste like vitamin-y candy.<br />This is the best (besides Juiced Guava... Less calories. When you drink 2 a night, that adds up).<br />As I sit here, sipping the lovely purple liquid, I contemplate how to describe the flavor. Sweet, hint of fruity? I dunno, but it's VERY enjoyable. I visit 7-11 nightly, was all bummed out because they were out. Got Monster instead and whined at my 7-11 guy. He told me to put the Moster back and went and grabbed me some from his stash in the back. What a winner!! :-)<br />I like RockStar Zero Carb (blue can) WAY more than Redbull or Bawls. Though I do enjoy Monster's HitMan energy shots, though too much caffiene too fast. Prefer to slowly consume throughout my shift....<br />Hope this helps someone.

review/summary: The king of energy drinks!
review/text: I started drinking Monsters in high school, usually one or more a day. I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured "wild berry" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more "energy" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version.

review/text: These are awesome and I love buying in bulk. MY boyfriend has one before work everyday because he works third shift but has classes during the day. I found it cheaper to do this so I bought a couple 24 packs. These did not last long between the two of us. They taste wonderful but are a lot of caffeine. If you don't drink it normally Id NOT suggest these! My friend tried one and could not finish it. She felt sick the entire rest of the day because she never drinks caffeine. I routinely drink it and have since I was young. These cans are wonderful for me to take in my lunch to college classes and help me keep up between class, clinical, working and homework! Plus 20 calories for a whole can? Who can beat that?

review/summary: Like Battery Acid
review/text: (This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.

review/summary: For those of us that don't like coffee
review/text: I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.<br /><br />When energy drinks entered the market, I tried them out but couldn't stand the taste of all the sugar. Once Rockstar released a sugar free energy drink, I was hooked from the start. It doesn't have a flat taste like all other sugar free drinks do, this one will give you a pop when you take your first swig.<br /><br />Price is pretty completive, though you can find them cheaper if you hunt around. Some convenience stores will sell them  2 for $3, making them a better deal. But you have to drive around and find a place that has them on sale, so I think paying the extra 20 cents or so on here is worth it.

review/summary: Diet version had awful taste.......
review/text: I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today. I was dying of thirst so when I opened it, I took a big chug of it. About halfway through swallowing it, the taste hit me, and I wanted to spit it all back out right away!<br /><br />WHAT! THE! What *is* that disgusting taste? It was like chewing a big wad of Hubba Bubba, then drinking some nasty strawberry soda mixed with Code Red Mountain Dew and a baby aspirin all at once. After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there. It made me GAG trying to choke this hideous concoction down! What a waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of energy drinks to begin with, but I've never !!IN MY LIFE!! tasted one this gross. It even smelled like CAT PEE.

review/summary: If youre looking for taste this is not it
review/text: If you want an energy drink that tastes good this is not it. This stuff tastes like detergent with bleach flavor, and has the unpleasant aftertaste of artificial sweeteners. However it has the highest caffeine content per can of any other energy drink ive seen, and it surely gets the job done if you need to stay awake after a night of no sleep. Also, it is cheaper per volume then other energy drinks.

review/text: 240 MG of caffeine, no sugar crash, no calories to fill you up.<br /><br />Not sure why people say it tastes bad or perhaps it's my brain telling my taste buds that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />As for the price, two cups of gas station coffee (well, maybe truck stop coffee...) or one small cup of Starbucks coffee will give you the same jolt for about the same price.  Take your pick.<br /><br />Besides, do we really drink these things for the taste?

review/summary: By far the best energy drink!
review/text: I have tried a number of energy drinks in my day, and Rockstar's Low Carb is the best. Low calories, tasty, no "fake sugar" aftertaste, and a nice boost. $44 for 24 cans with free shipping is pretty good here on Amazon (approximately $1.83 a can), but I prefer to get it on sale at Target in 4 packs for $6 ($1.50 per can). The only downside is that it's hard to find sometimes!

I can no longer find in stores, it seems maybe discontinued which is a shame but thankfully still sold here... for now at least.<br /><br />The picture of the can above is not of this flavor, the guava one is the purple color, but have no worries when you order you get the guava drink.<br /><br />I don't know if the energy is as strong in the guava as other energy drinks, I feel it is weaker, but this one in my opinion is the best tasting.

review/text: I ADORE this drink! It's the next best thing to coffee in the morning (though a lot of people's stomachs probaby handle that . . .But I'm a college student and coffee here is EXPENSIVE!).Heck! It's good for anytime of the day (well . .you may want to avoid drinking it after 6 or so if you want a decent sleep (unless you have to cram for a test or whatever) . .I've only had the original (citrus) kind though . ..I'm kind of curious about the others . . .<br /><br />Anyway, what dissapoints me is the shipping cost . .What the heck!? $20!!??!! That's almost the same amount as the drinks themselves! . . .and here I thought I was getting an uber great deal (it's still cheaper here by a little bit though so I guess I can't complain too much . . .)

review/summary: Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.
review/text: By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.
