review/summary: It's taco seasoning + mayo
review/text: I've had a couple really good sandwiches at local restaurants lately with chipotle mayo so I was excited to try Kraft's product.  Very disappointing, it is not a pure spicy mayo, it tastes like just a mix of Ortego taco seasoning mixed in mayo.  I don't want my sandwiches to taste like tacos from a kit, I want a sandwich with a nice flavorful kick.  I tried it once and threw it out.  Hoping there is another brand that will get it right...

review/summary: My husband... He -- He, uh, likes it fine
review/text: "You expect me to eat this slog?" Jerry slammed down his sandwich, which, in his meaty claws, had been pressed into a mound of bread shards and ham chunks. He picked a leaf of lettuce from the shrapnel that was once, only a few moments ago, a well-made sandwich, one created out of love. "And what'd I tell you about lettuce? I don't want to see this on any more of my sandwiches!" He took off his glasses and wiped his brow, falling back onto the stool at the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I don't know for how long I stood there, my mouth agape, my fingers clenched around the Tupperware bowl of sliced ham, my knees shaking. I'd never seen my son so angry.<br /><br />He opened his coloring book and searched his crayon box for the right color. "Just once" he said, feverishly putting a green crayon to work on a page, "I'd like a sandwich that isn't so... so stinking plain." He glared at me a moment before searching for a new color.<br /><br />I was frozen. I had failed, again, to find a satisfactory sandwich for my son. As I returned the tub of ham to its place in the refrigerator, I saw the bottle of Kraft Chipotle Mayo behind a box of Capri Sun juice squeezes. Why hadn't I remembered this? And it hit me: I had not purchased the Kraft Chipotle Mayo, my husband had. He mentioned purchasing it the previous night, after we had made love. He said he picked up the mayonnaise for lunch that day. "It was the highlight of my day -- easily," he said, before rolling over to set his alarm clock.<br /><br />Inspired, I grabbed the Kraft Chipotle Mayo from the refrigerator. I snatched my son's plate. "Hey!" he said. But I didn't hear, my hands, my mind, raced, turning a mound of crinkly bread and shredded ham into a manageable sandwich. "I told you, I'm not eating--"<br /><br />"Shut your mouth, my son!" I commanded him, feeling a twang of guilt as he retreated to the comfort of his coloring book and crayons.<br /><br />New bread, new ham, mixed with the old. And then, the finishing touch, a glob of Kraft Chipotle Mayo. Peeling off the last remnants of lettuce, I slid the plate under my son's face. Unsure of what had just happened, he stared at the new sandwich a moment before putting his chubby little fingers around its edges and heaving it into his eager mouth. The smile that came over him assured me of one thing: Kraft Chipotle Mayo is pretty tasty. You should buy some!

review/text: We have tried many coffees and a number of home coffee makers but have  been unable to brew anything to match the quality of the coffees we enjoy in our favorite restaurants. But this morning we tried the Carte Noire given us as a Christmas gift. What a delightful surprise. It has that "blackness" that we associate with good coffee but none of the bitterness. It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present), it was simply quite wonderful.

review/summary: Best commercial coffee, ever
review/text: I found Carte Noire in France in 1993 and started bringing packages back with me three or four times each year.  What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica; (2) It is 100% Colombian.  (3) It is roasted by the French.  There is only one other coffee with this particular rare pedigree, and it is good, but not quite as good as Carte Noire.  Amazon's ad terminology calls this an after dinner coffee.  I disagree with them.  We have always used it exclusively in the morning, as do the Europeans who value its rich taste.<br /><br />This coffee is bold but not overpowering.  It avoids giving you a thin or a bitter coffee taste.  One package of 250 grams (very finely ground) will last for exactly five days when brewed in a 12-cup pot.  My coffee philosophy is this:  If you're going to drink coffee, buy and drink the best one you can find anywhere.  This is it.  I wouldn't lie about something this important.

review/summary: Great French Coffee
review/text: My wife and I found this coffee in France during a "coffee buying spree".  We bought a little of everything and enjoyed them through out the year.  One of the more inexpensive brands (in France) is Carte Noire.  It might be common coffee in France, but to us it was the absolute best.  We order several each year.  I'm the hit with my fellow adults when I bring it to a Boy Scout camp out. My fellow adults even pout when I run out.<br /><br />This is some great stuff and the seller does a nice job in shipping it.  Be aware that sometimes it is out of stock, so you might join us and order a few and stock it up in the freezer.

review/text: My aunt sends me a canister of Toffee-ettes every year for Christmas and I really look forward to it.  I loved Almond Roca before I tried these, and then afterwards couldn't get myself to go back to Almond Roca.<br /><br />Where you really have to crunch down on Almond Roca, the inside square hard center of the Toffee-ettes breaks a lot more easily when you crunch down and has a silkier feel.  The chocolate coating is wonderful and there are very big chunks of almonds on the outside (and so generously applied that you're always left with almond pieces at the bottom of the canister that fell off).  There is also a significant difference that these have a little bit of salty to go with the sweet, which elevates them to a heavenly level.

Personally, I like eating the covering first and the toffee last.  These little jewels were delicious!  I ate the entire pound of them in about 3 days.  If it didn't cost so much to ship them I'd probably order them again...and again...and again.  :)<br /><br />If you love almonds and toffee you HAVE to try these.

review/summary: How Am I to Review a Dog Treat?
review/text: If I tasted them and loved them, what would that say about these treats? (It would say considerably more about me, I'm afraid.) If I tasted and hated them, ditto. So, what about describing my dogs' reactions? Should not their behavior be an indicator? I can answer that in two words: Labrador Retrievers. I had a Lab who enthusiastically wolfed down auto-repair putty when my back was momentarily turned. Poor guy--he only lived 13 years after that incident. (Do not try this at home. It was a stupid error on my part, but I feel the need to confess it. I do not, however, plan on running for president. Of anything.) So the fact that the dogs inhale these cookies means only that they don't taste like Brussels sprouts. That's right, folks. My Labs hate Brussels sprouts. Was there ever animosity between Labrador and Belgium?<br /><br />Actually, that brings to mind the reviews that go: "I got my wife/husband one of these and she/he went totally nuts over it. It utterly transformed our marriage. In fact, we finally became pregnant the first night we tried it (this for a universal remote, if memory serves, which it does not.) OK, in that spirit:<br /><br />I bought these for my Labrador Retrievers. After a single cookie, the yellow Lab can do advanced Calculus. The black Lab is playing the moderato from Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto (although having all those fingers and toes does confer a definite advantage over your typical human pianist.) My only complaint is the crumbs are getting between the keys of the piano. In future, I shall probably use the Cinna-Bones as rewards, away from the Steinway, rather than stimulants.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />PS Would these reviews be more plausible if I were to insert a gratuitous apostrophe in the middle of the possessive pronoun, its? OK. My dog really likes it's Cinna-Bones. Its as if he has been waiting all his life for them. Better?

review/summary: Lovely, Yummy, Unique Black Decaffeinated Tea
review/text: *****<br />This is a yummy and unique tea. It's sort of creamy (the real vanilla is a luscious taste), but not spicy like chai. It is absolutely perfect and I'm drinking it all the time because the taste is beyond belief, plus it's decaffeinated!<br /><br />Indian Night is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Fatrikcherra Estate black tea, and organic vanilla beans---that's all---and oh, what an incredible combination! There are no oils or natural flavorings used at all, unlike many flavored teas, and thus no funny aftertaste. It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Inspired by an ancient Aztec culinary secret, Numi has chosen aromatic whole vanilla beans to blend with premium organic black tea. The tea grows in northern India on a bio-dynamic and Fair Trade garden surrounded by beautiful tropical forests. It is decaffeinated by a revolutionary organic CO2 process, called 'Effervescence', the only chemical-free method that does not extract flavor or health properties. As Indian Night steeps a vibrant bronzy hue, its seductive fragrance, flowery yet familiar, flirts with your senses. Magnificently smooth, exotic vanilla harmonizes with black tea for a creamy, rich and satisfying cup." This is a new (as of 2007) tea for Numi, and this description romantically describes the tea experience, and doesn't oversell it at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

I am so glad to find it on Amazon.  Love the vanilla flavor and smell.  I smell the bag before I brew it.  Very satisfying to the senses.

review/summary: Favorite full bodied Decaf tea
review/text: I LOVE tea... Unfortunately my body will no longer tolerate my favorite kick-you-in-your-kidney's strong black teas. So I am in desperate search of strong full bodied DECAF teas that will actually make me want to get up in the morning!<br /><br />This tea is one of the best I found around! If you love tea but can't take the caffine, and don't have the dinero to shell out $30 bucks for 2 ounces of the good stuff at tevanna then give this a try. The taste of vanilla is front and center but followed by a somewhat strong note of black tea that I terribly miss in your standard watered down tasting decaf fair. I have purchased from this seller 3-4 times without a hitch and am even considering doing auto ship on this particular product. Hope this helps if you were on the fence about trying it. I'm off to enjoy a cuppa!

review/summary: Tasty Tea
review/text: Not much of a tea drinker, or hot beverage drinker for that matter, but I first discovered this brand/flavor at a Red Carpet Club in the LAX airport and have been trying to find it ever since.  It's a unique, smooth and pleasant flavor that requires no sweetening or sprucing up. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious tea! A must for any tea lover!
review/text: It's so hard to find this tea in stores and I am so glad that Amazon has it at a great price. This is probably the only tea out there that is decaffinated and actually has a flavor. As another reviewer mentioned before, the decaffination process robs the tea of any flavor but not this one! The wonderful vanilla bean that's added to this tea makes it seem like you're having desert with your tea. Wonderful with milk and some sugar or just plain. Another great thing about this tea is that it's organic and comes from such a "green" and responsible company as Numi. Keep up the good work!

review/summary: Good results but contains soy
review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with "filler" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.

review/summary: Sagan loved it.
review/text: I tried this food for free through BzzAgent. My dog is about a year old but VERY active, so have him on puppy food still because he's smallish and has trouble keeping weight on. He is allergic to something, I'm not sure if it's environmental or food, but he didn't have a reaction to this food. This is corn-free so I'm wondering if that's what he's allergic to.<br />He did very well on it, and had nice solid stools and wasn't excessively flaky or itchy. He tends to bolt his food so the very small pieces weren't that great. He wouldn't chew it and then ended up vomiting afterward; I had to give him small amounts at a time. I'd rather they had kibble size options, but I'm being picky now.<br />I'm not thrilled that the second ingredient is wheat, but at least it's not corn. Sagan seemed to do well on it. If it was less expensive than the food I have him on now (that he also does very well on), I'd have no problem using or recommending this food.

review/summary: Doesn't Have Unpleasant Odor
review/text: If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think, "base of a fire hydrant").  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two "mature" labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for "Subscribe and Save".

review/text: I received a sample bag as a BzzAgent. I should first say that both of my dogs LOVED this food. They gobbled it up and didn't have any problems with digestion or itching, etc. I was happy to see that the first ingredient was real chicken. You can also compare your current dog food with Ideal Balance on this handy chart located here: [..] I am excited that the first ingredient is real chicken but I wish this product did not also contain chicken meal.

review/summary: Food You Can Feel Great About Feeding Your Dog
review/text: I have a 8.5 year old Jack Russell who I view as one of my 'children' and not just a dog. She is very food motivated and we're yet to find a dog food she won't eat, however, she's struggled with acid reflux issues and all night 'hiccups' for most of her life. So I was excited for the opportunity to try HIlls Science Diet Ideal Dog Food to see if it would help her with this issue. I am also very pleased to be feeding her food with NATURAL and REAL MEAT ingredients as it makes me feel better about what she's taking in and the quality of the food. Not surprisingly she took to the food right away. I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey. BUT, it's worth it for the quality and if it helps. Definitely would recommend! I am a buzzagent and did receive a free 4 lb bag and coupons to try the product.

review/summary: May be great for your dog...
review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.<br />My small Pomeranian has allergies to a lot of things including wheat so he was itchy on this food, however, the lab I have did GREAT on this food.<br />She loved the taste, ate it very well, and I noted an improvement in her skin and coat. She also has itchy problems for a lot of the year but improved with the use of this food.<br />I also noted that my girl seemed to need less of this than most other brands of dog food out there. This means I'm buying less food in the long run which makes the food comparable in price to less healthy alternatives.<br />The only complaints I have is the use of the wheat ingredient plus the soy. I really would like to see this product use another protein source that is more within the natural diet of a canine.

What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

review/text: At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

review/text: There wasn't even one of the 36 invididual packages that didn't have a great number of broken crackers. Also, each cracker is much thinner than, for example, the reduced fat Cheeze-Its.<br /><br />The alternative IS the reduced fat Cheeze-It. Twenty-nine of these (seldom a broken one in a box) equal 130 calories and, also, taste better.

review/text: This bread reminds me of the taste of British bread - I am British and miss the bread in the UK. Now gluten free it has been difficult to find good savory tasting bread as most gluten free bread is very sweet. This is not and I even add less sugar/honey than the recipe calls for to make extra sure of that. Pretty good job done with the taste of this mix...best I have tried so far.

That easy!Also has good whole grain flours in the mix.<br /><br />  poetick

Each piece is flat on the bottom with the colored frut details only decorating the top visible half of the "fruit".<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm going to eat every piece, but I've had better.

review/summary: Sweet Wedding Cake Decoration
review/text: I actually ordered from this company's website because of time constraints and I had a special order request.  We tasted marzipan fruits from five different sources including a real Danish bakery and although this marzipan was on the sweeter side we liked it the best.  Not only was it tasty but this company gets 5 stars for customer service.  They went above and beyond for me.<br /><br />My daughter wanted to have marzipan on her wedding cake, but she didn't want the bright red strawberries or the green limes so I called the company and they were happy to make substitutions in the large assorted order I placed.  Unfortunately my order was shipped before the substitutions got made so Bergen Marzipan shipped me a corrected order at their expense during the busy time right before Christmas.  At a time of high stress this company went above and beyond what you would expect (but secretly hope for) in terms of customer service.<br /><br />The wedding guests and bride loved the marzipan on the cake. We even put just the marzipan out on the dessert table and there was little left at the end of the reception.<br /><br />Be aware that marzipan gets harder with age and paper sticking to the bottom of the fruit pieces can be due to a variety of factors the manufacturer can't control such as during the shipping process

review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to the coffee I drink. While I do very much enjoy gourmet bags of coffee I find that for the amount of money you pay, you aren't getting very much coffee. Therefore, I look for the larger cans of coffee that are around the same price. Of all the brands that I have tried, Yuban in my opinion is the best. You can get it in a medium blend original roast which I find has a very rich taste but isn't too strong. Depending on how you brew your coffee, Yuban will not disappoint.

review/text: This stuff is great! I first started to use it on just vegetables, but now I use it on mostly everything and my table salt has become used less and less.  This seasoning is especially good on vegetables, chicken, soups, salads and everything you'd use salt for.  The only time I use regular table salt now is for beef.  The flavor of this Knorr is more chickeny and veggie, though I understand Knorr has another seasoning geared towards beef. The texture of this seasoning is very nice in that it melts very quickly like a bollion cube

I love to use it on salads, fish, chicken, plain buttered pasta, and one of my more strange (and favorite) uses for it is to sprinkle a little bit on my buttered toast. Who would have thought that it'd be so yummy! Now, everyone may not like the toast approach, but never fear, this seasoning is extremely versatile and has a unique flavor that I haven't found in anything else.

review/summary: Overdo welcome return to the USA!
review/text: What a welcome return after 15 years of banishment in the U.S.. Way back in the mid 1960's, when I was not quite a teenager, I discovered Fray Bento's Steak and Kidney pies in the grocery section of Import Plaza, in Portland Oregon. I bought one, took it home, and baked it up. It was love at first bite. I bought many of them, through the early '80's, until Import Plaza sadly closed their doors. I went with out for years until I discovered them again at a local Scottish import shop. I bought them there for several years until the "Mad Cow" disease scare of the mid 1990's caused the U.S. government to ban their sale here. I can safely say that 17 years later I never felt any ill effects from dining on one of my favorite meals. I salute Amazon and British vendor, Cooking Marvelous, for returning this much missed treat to my table. And yes, my first taste in 17 years was every bit as magical on my 58 year old pallet as it had been when I was 12.

It tastes as good as fruit juice when I sweeten it with a little stevia, but is a much more healthy alternative to fruit juices which naturally contain lots of sugar. My husband even loves it and he is not much of a tea drinker like me, and recently my 3 year old started drinking it instead of juice. This tea is a staple in our house. I have purchased from culinary teas twice now and been very satisfied both times.

review/summary: One of the Worst Dog Foods Available
review/text: I have been feeding my daughter's dog Beneful for a while and since it was time to restock I decided to check online if there were better alternatives at a reasonable price. I was shocked to find the huge number of websites that listed Beneful as one of the very WORST dog foods available with detailed explanations as to why. Even Purina One which is made by the same company is considered a better alternative.<br /><br />In a nutshell Beneful is primarily comprised of cheap ingredients that have been supplemented by additives to make the nutritional analysis look good and the food appetizing to your dog. If you look carefully at the ingredient list, they actually add SUGAR and SALT amongst other nasty things (that is why Beneful is appetizing to dogs despite the junk it is made from - one website even compared Beneful to crack for dogs). The main ingredient is Corn which is not easily digestible by dogs. There is no real meat (only meat byproducts) which appear way down the list.<br /><br />This probably explains why the dog is constantly hungry (despite the fact I feed more than prescribed) and is always itching.<br /><br />The problem is how to replace this with a better brand without breaking the budget. To my pleasant surprise, with some research I was able to locate a few brands that are comparable in price pound for pound and not only have a much better ingredient list but are rated much higher by the various independent dog food review sites out there. It is amazing that Beneful with its cheap junk ingredients can dupe people into paying as much as dog foods which are made of real meat as the primary ingredients.<br /><br />Anyway I found at least two on Amazon that looked really good (there were others but these are the ones I saved):<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040BET8E">Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Fog Food, 35-Pound Bag</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X63VS">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Senior Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a><br /><br />Both of these at the time of this review were about $40 for a 35lb bag (which is actually cheaper than Beneful per pound!) and eligible for Super Saver/Prime shipping. I ordered the latter and will update once I see how the dog likes it.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Not Mt. Dew...but still tasty
review/text: Not sure if this was supposed to mimic Mt. Dew or not. In any case, it does have a nice flavor and is really quite good. As long as you are not expecting Dew...this stuff is gonna satisfy. Really tasty.

review/summary: Close enough to Mountain Dew
review/text: My husband and I got a SodaStream system for Christmas and we love it!  We did the calculations for the cost of the CO2 and the syrups and it doesn't save us much money (if any) on canned drinks, but it saves us a TON of space and drastically reduces our waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my husband is an avid Mountain Dew (MD) drinker and he really likes the Fountain Mist (FM).  He says it doesn't taste exactly like Mountain Dew, but it's close enough.  So instead of drinking a few cans while he's playing games, he just whips up a liter of this and he's set, and our tiny apartment doesn't fill up with empty cans.  We also like FM because it's reduced calorie.  It's sweetened with sugar and Splenda, so an 8oz serving of FM is only 35 calories, while 8oz of MD is 110 calories.  So a whole liter of FM has about 150 calories, whereas a liter of MD has about 460 calories.<br /><br />I agree with reviewers here and elsewhere that say the SodaStream syrups can taste a little too much like artificial sweetener, especially the diet drinks, but I've found that it's just because SodaStream recommends using more syrup than you need.  I usually use about half the amount recommended and it's a lot better.

review/text: I Think this product tastes a lot like Mt. Dew.  I use the diet and my husband uses the regular.  These products have saved us GOBS of money.  I suppose it depends upon the person as to whether they taste good.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I'm a self proclaimed Mt. Dew addict so I didn't have any expectations from this "fountain mist" but I was incredibly surprised.<br /><br />I even went and bought a can of Dew to compare the taste and it is similar.  In my opinion Fountain mist tastes better than "mello yello" or any other Dew knock off.<br /><br />To each their own....<br /><br />Don't listen to others so much...try it for yourself.  I stupidly delayed my purchase of the SodaStream b/c reviewers  said that the flavors are horrible.<br /><br />I regret not purchasing this sooner and saving more money.

review/summary: Very close to Mountain Dew!
review/text: We love the Fountain Mist flavor and it is our regular "caffiene" soda we keep on hand.  Every person we've offered it to has said it tastes very close to name brand Mountain Dew (some say more like diet) and better than most store brands.  We have Faygo brand here in Michigan and most say it's very close to their Mountain Dew knock off.

review/summary: Tastes like bad cough medicine
review/text: I have the soda stream and love it. So far haven't had any issue with any other flavors. The root beer and pete's choice are really good. The flavored waters are really good as well.<br />The Fountain Mist is vile. Thought the first time I was imagining how much it tasted like bad cough medicine but that's exactly how it tastes.  Has a strong chemical flavor that makes it undrinkable to me.<br />Try your samples that come with the unit before purchasing flavors.

review/summary: You might like it if you like Mountain Dew or Red Bull
review/text: I just bought the mix off the shelf without reading what it was a "substitute" for. It tastes sort of like Mountain Dew crossed with the tartness of Red Bull. Two of my least favorite soft drinks. If you like those two, you might like this.

review/summary: Tastes nothing like Mountain Dew
review/text: Don't get me wrong, I love the SodaStream and am especially happy with the Cola flavors as they are very similar to Coca-Cola products (which was a deal breaker if they weren't)  But I was very disappointed by the Fountain Mist and Diet Fountain Mist mixes as they taste nothing like Mountain Dew as SodaStream advertises. Aside from not tasting like Mountain Dew, it just doesn't taste very good overall. They dropped the ball on this one.  But so far I am happy with all the other flavors.  Just skip this one.

review/summary: BEST pb alternative for PKU patients!!!
review/text: I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son, who has PKU.  I've been looking for a peanut butter alternative for him so that he can have an actual sandwich, and we LOVE this product!!!  It's so low in PHE (25 mg PHE/15 g serving!) that it's perfect on low protein bread, or to use as a dip with fruits and veggies.  Plus, the whole family loves it!  I highly recommend to, not just anyone with a low protein restricted diet, but to everyone in general!

review/summary: A delicious and different treat!
review/text: I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a "European alternative to peanut butter."  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I've used this product for about 15 years.  There is a recipe that comes on the side of the box that is simply delicious.  You just stir fry a chopped onion, add in cubed chicken coated in this product, stir, add in chicken broth and simmer to cook the chicken, then add in a can of coconut milk.  Delicious.  We usually add in a few raisins along with the chicken broth.  Even better!  this is a mild curry, but the blend is just perfect.  This recipe tastes like you've really worked hard to make a great gourmet dish - which it may be, but they did all the work.  I have to eat this at least once a month.
