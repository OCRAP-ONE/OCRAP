review/summary: Just what I expected!
review/text: I was very happy to see that this sampler pack was just what I expected. I received 20 different flavors that all arrived in great condition in a nice box. There were even four little recipes included in the packaging. I'm very excited to try all the flavors because I've heard about some of them from family and friends but I didn't want to commit to buying the whole box of one flavor before tasting it. I was thrilled to see that I even got a couple limited edition flavors that I'd heard about. I would order this as a gift for someone who just got a Keurig or who wanted to try a bunch of different flavors.

The only aspect I was not happy with was they gave me a french vanilla k cup for iced coffee.  my keurig does not do iced coffee.  I think it should have said that it may contain unusable k cups depending on your keurig machine

review/text: Awesome sampler. I was nervous when researching other samplers on Amazon, but this one is a great variety of yummy coffee. I'm ordering another one right now!<br /><br />Update on this review. My comment was for the 20 count order which comes in a nice box and has exactly 20 different coffees. It's a great variety. I ordered the 22 count and it is awful. It came in a brown bag and was all Green Mountain coffee with only 4 or 5 different coffees. The 5 stars is for the 20 count. I give the 22 count 2 stars!

The items included are very similar as those pictured; there may be one or two differences but nothing drastic. The packaging is very nice, too, and would make a great gift.

review/text: I bought this at Whole Foods when my daughter was sick and was requesting nothing more than mac and cheese. I figured at least this would give her 6 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein per serving (box serves 3). Sometimes I use 1/2 the cheese sauce so it's not too overwhelming and salty, she never knows the difference. She woofs this down and asks for more. I have been hoping Annie's would introduce a ready-made mac and cheese in whole wheat for a while now, and finally it's here. Thank you!

review/text: I'm a life long Mac N Cheese lover and Annie's is simply the best. I'm tried Kraft and the other usual suspects but this just tastes better. I think it's because Annie's uses honest to goodness, actual cheese and not a cheese substitute or artificial cheese. However they make it, it's awesome. Try it with hamburger and you won't go back to whatever other brand you're using. My kids both love it as well and they tend to be picky at their age (both under 3 yrs)

review/summary: If you like the taste of slimy cardboard...
review/text: Seriously. I thought I'd try to go all 'whole grain', 'organic', 'healthy', etc. And yes, I get that it's a relative thing when I'm looking for healthy from a mac and cheese. But seriously? This is awful. SO not worth it. There isn't enough sauce to cover the pasta, it's bland and vaguely tasteless. And, simultaneously, somehow, slimy. I'm not sure how they manged to make it both dry and slimy, but seeming-paradox accomplished! It's all well and good to try to do pre-packaged mac and cheese as healthy as you can, but this just isn't worth it at all. I'll keep shopping, but I would have rather eaten a box of Velveeta (even on my organic, health food kick (again, health food as applies to mac and cheese)) than a bite of this stuff. Ugh. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Great deal as compared to local pharmacy
review/text: Unfortunately our insurance doesn't cover this formula and the cost per can (approximately 14 oz) is about $52 from our local pharmacy.  I just bought the 6 pack from BABYWUVINC through Amazon for a much lower price and so far, we're happy.  The item showed up the next day and it was packed in an original elecare box for all 6 cans.  This box was within another cardboard box.  While none of the cans was dented, I would have appreciated bubble wrap or paper between the two boxes.  I will most likely order again from the same company once we run out.

review/summary: Fast delivery, dented can
review/text: Our insurance doesn't cover this formula, and I've found only pharmacies can special order it but they'll charge almost $60 a can. We would not be using this formula if it were not for our baby's protein intolerance, food allergies, gi disorder, and reflux. Shipping was speedy and I was pleased with that. However one of the cans was quite dented twice on the bottom. The cans came in a shipping box with packing peanuts, so I'm not sure how the can got dented in the box unless it was placed inside already dented. The cans were placed in the box individually and not within an original EleCare carton box, as another reviewer experienced. I do not purchase dented cans at grocery stores, I certainly didn't want a dented can when it's so pricey to begin with.

review/text: I love this tea. The bergamot infusion is always perfectly aromatic; it's never cloying or chemical tasting. I prepare tea in a samovar where the loose tea is brewed/steamed as a concentrate in the small pot on top of the samovar. To serve, the concentrate is poured into a glass and diluted with the hot water from the main container.  The strength is adjusted to individual taste so everyone gets tea exactly as they like it. It always tastes wonderful and for me, it's a perfect drink to enjoy throughout the day. I've used the Sadaf brand for many years and always find it to be a quality product.

Since you can't buy the original syrup, I searched until deciding that this looked like a good option.  I ordered two bottles (mistake) and then it arrived so on this cold March morning I fired up the Capresso and then... WHAM !!!  Had to dump the cup.  That bad!<br /><br />In all fairness, some people may find this flavoring to be good, but I'd bet anything that none of those people are ones who "discovered" PSLs from Starbucks.  Now I have two more bottles to go out for recycling, and learned a $22 lesson - I could have had 5 PSLs at Starbucks!  Ouch!!!

review/text: I bought one of these at a local grocery store and was very impressed with it's lightness, flakiness and how well it "held together" when mixing and rolling out. I tried finding more but was told it was a "seasonal item" (meaning they only carried it at Thanksgiving and Christmas I guess). I couldn't find it anywhere else but the store suggested I check Amazon and sure enough, they had it! Now I had to buy a box of 12 but that's okay as it keeps well plus my mom wanted 6 of them. MUCH superior to Pillsbury box mixes or any ready-made I've found in the US. It's very similar to the British "short crust pastry" I used to buy when we lived in London. HIGHLY recommended!

review/summary: For those who find making pie crust hard
review/text: I love to bake everything that I can from scratch.  I am sad to admit that pie crust often defeats me.  After years of refusing, I finally picked up a box of Krusteaz mix.  Wow.  It tastes fantastic!  It came out just the way I wanted it to, was easy to use, and didn't have that bitter aftertaste that refrigerated pie crusts have.<br /><br />The pie dough stays together very well and, provided you don't add too much water, is not sticky at all.  It rolls out very easily.  It was sturdy enough to be picked up and placed in the pan after being rolled out on my counter.  I was able to cut a second rolled out crust into strips and interweave them in top of the pie.  Nothing fell apart!<br /><br />I'm tempted to eat the whole pie myself now....

review/summary: Best Pie Crust Ever!
review/text: Krusteaz is great! Using this mix for a long time, I turned friends and my 'pie lady of the neighborhood' friend unto it. Suddenly it wasn't available locally. Searching the web, I found it isn't available for over 150 miles radius. It is easy to use and makes wonderfully tasty, flaky crusts. It is easy to roll out, fold and place in pan. It does not shrink. The box makes 4 generous crusts. Thank you Amazon.com for carrying this product and making it available to us in 'nowhere' land!

review/summary: You Cant Make Better Pie Crust! Seriously!!
review/text: This makes the best pie crust ever. Maybe only better results if you use Lard. Every one raves about my pies! And most serious pie eaters know its the crust that makes the pie! Each box makes FOUR crusts, I think that is a bit of a stretch for a 9 inch pie, if you want a fancy fluted crust anyway.  I think it is much easier to work with if you<br />chill the dough 30-40 min, before rolling out, although directions do not suggest this. Anyway try it and see for yourself! no more pie crust intimidation , only beautiful and delicious pies!

review/summary: Great product - huge volume
review/text: I think Krusteaz products are the best add almost nothing but water products you can buy - this pie crust is no exception. Leave it in a ski house or vacation cottage - keeps a long time and does just what it says it does.  Do be careful in appreciating how many individual boxes you get in a case - that's a lot of crusts - but a great product at an outstanding price. Wish there were a 'middle size' volume available.

review/summary: Bowl full of joy!
review/text: In movie theaters in Hawaii, they don't only offer regular popcorn at the concession stand, but you will also find Hurricane Popcorn as an option.<br /><br />Hurricane Popcorn is essentially made up of popcorn, rice crackers, furikake/nori mix and of course lot's of butter! Born in Hawaii, I have grown up on Hurricane Popcorn and to the unique tastes of food and snacks.<br /><br />What you get in each individual Hurricane Popcorn package: microwavable popcorn, packet of furikake/nori mix, plastic bag to mix all the ingredients and a packet of butter.<br /><br />I introduced Hurricane Popcorn to my friends and half of them loved it and half of them thought it was gross. Again, it's best to judge for yourself.

It's delicious and definitely a great snack to munch during movies, homework and studying, or just when you have a craving for something different. The delivery was fast, faster than I had expected, seeing that I live all the way in Mississippi! My only qualms is the fact that it is expensive and trying to buy a huge pack of these is well over 50 bucks. Nevertheless, these are delicious, and I can't wait when I have enough to buy my own twelve pack of this Hawaiian treat. A +

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

review/text: This product is amazing. It works great, smells great, is all organic and is about 4x cheaper than any other enzyme peel on the market (because it is half the price and twice the size). You can also get it almost anywhere. It made a huge difference on my skin and I would recommend it to anyone who has acne or a dull, bumpy complexion. The one down side is that it stings quite a bit, but it's supposed to do that. And afterward it feels great.

review/text: I'm really happy I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing. At first I didn't think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way. My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer. It even helped diminish my pimples.

review/text: This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.

review/summary: Mild but effective!
review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/text: When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing. This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin. Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema's foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean & Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief). I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil. Great product!

review/summary: Fantastic exfoliator
review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Love the smell, how it feels, skin looks refreshed after!
review/text: I am usually critical of skin care product that doesn't come from a dermatologist's office.  Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/text: This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.

review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!

review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

review/text: This mask smells amazing and does clean my face well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it did dry out some parts of my already dry skin!  I don't think I would purchase this particular one again but definitely would try another Alba mask.  I LOVE ALBA!!

review/text: This is the best line of products. It has helped clear up my acne and I've noticed the scars are slowly fading. I use the Aloe & Green Tea during the day and after washing my face before bed I use the Jasmine & Vitamin E cream. Our skin is very important and fragile, take care of it right!

review/summary: Effective skin tightening face mask
review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

I like that its not a mask that you have to scrub off. This one just rinses right off. After I rinsed it off I instantly saw my skin look a little more brighter and glowy after the first use.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I have dry skin and wanted a good thick cream to use at night. This cream feels good without being too thick or greasy. I also enjoy the scent. It's very nice without being overpowering.

review/summary: the best lip balm on the market hands down
review/text: I love this lip balm and have been using it for around 10 years. It is the only lip balm that thoroughly quenches my dry lips and doesnt taste like soap! Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!
