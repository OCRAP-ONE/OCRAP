review/summary: Dangerous PLEASE READ!
review/text: My husband was driving 17 hours from Arkansas to SW Florida and decided this stuff would give him the boost needed to drive the distance. He took naps and ate food along the way. When he started to get tired he drank one 5 hour energy drink and arrived shortly after irritable and OUT OF CONTROL. He through a metal bar stool at my glass sliding doors of our new home. I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old. We ALMOST died to a chemical imbalance that was caused by 5 HOUR ENERGY! Its IMPOSSIBLE to tell how a chemical will effect you, but with possible side effects as these, they are not worth the risk! I have currently filed a lawsuit against the company!

review/text: My husband loves this stuff. We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied.

review/summary: True to the commercial, but caffeine amount is questionable.
review/text: As a person who has never consumed a cup of coffee or other energy drink before in his life, I can't say for certain just how effective 5-hour energy is in comparison.<br /><br />I can say that it worked, though -- my God, did it work. Having drunk merely half the bottle, I felt energized and ready to roll in three or four minutes. The product was true to its label in that I was able to study with concentration from 12 o'clock to 5 with no "afternoon slump" or "jitters"(though for a time I did experience a subtle tingling in my fingers). When my five hours were up, I came back to normal and didn't feel any side effects or "caffeine crash". The product is not addictive: I bought a pack of twelve bottles a month ago and still haven't used them all.<br /><br />5-hour energy should be used with wisdom, however -- the manufacturers say that it contains "no more caffeine than a cup of coffee" but doesn't specify the size of the cup. It took me an hour longer than normal to get to sleep when I drank a whole bottle.<br /><br />That said, I have no other complaints to offer of this excellent energy drink. I suggest taking half of a bottle whenever you need a boost of concentration or motivation, as that is usually sufficient. Also, drink these only when you need to -- it's potent stuff, and I wager those little bottles can disappear quickly.<br /><br />5-hour energy is a great resource for workouts, daily business, and the hurly-burly of modern life. I give it 4 stars.

review/summary: I Love the Stuff - Your Mileage May Vary
review/text: TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from "tired" to "not tired" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body.

review/summary: More Like 3 Hour Energy For Me, But Still Better Than All The Other Energy Drinks
review/text: Makes you feel alert without making your heart pound out of your chest.  Doesn't make you feel hyper-alert, it just makes you feel normally awake.  I've taken this on the brink of exhaustion late at night it definitely makes me feel 10 AM awake, without feeling obnoxious.  I'm a regular coffee drinker but this stuff is alot more effective with no jitters.  Works for about 3 hours for me but the 'no crash' thing is a bunch of hooey.  It just means no sugar crash.  If you were tired when you took it, you obviously better be near a couch when it wears off.  Once your body remembers how tired you really are you'll pass right out when it wears off.  Definitely the best out of all the energy drinks out there when used sparingly.  Tastes horrible but it does what it claims to do.  I only use this stuff sparingly, as-needed but has yet to let me down.

review/summary: Best tasting 5 Hour Energy drink yet!
review/text: I consider myself a connoisseur of the energy drink world, and by far the 5-Hour products have been the best of the best.  For various medical reasons, I can't drink coffee or tea because of irritants/acids that naturally occur in them.  However, thanks to many years of moderate insomnia (I wake up a lot, no problems falling asleep, just can't STAY asleep), and not having good reactions to prescription sleep medications, I often still need some caffeine and/or extra b-vitamins to help get me through the day.  I've tried living without it, but sadly all it takes is one bad night without enough sleep (which is at least once a week) and I'm nodding off at my desk at work.<br /><br />I used to drink Sugar Free Red Bull, sometimes as many as 3 in a day to help me stay alert.  However, Red Bull makes me CRASH!!! I loved the taste (even though many people think it's gross), and I liked Red Bull a lot more than the other can drinks (ie. Monster, etc). However, it was almost as bad as drinking nothing at all!<br /><br />Then one day, I tried a 5 Hour Energy drink.  Back then, there was only lemon-lime and maybe berry flavors.  I preferred the Lemon Lime, and I was shocked to find that this product didn't make me jittery, and definitely didn't make me crash!<br /><br />I've been using them ever since!  Amazon.com has a great price for 12 bottles (these can be as much as 3 or 4 dollars each in NYC, if purchased at a small grocer or deli), and they offer all the varieties.  I used to use the extra strength ones, but I am downgrading myself back to the regular ones to try and limit my dependency on them (I only use them now when I absolutely need them, usually around 1 or 2pm).  I drink the whole bottle, and rarely have I ever felt the need for a second bottle during the afternoon if I had my first in the AM.<br /><br />I just tried this new-er flavor, Pomegranate, and I must say, it ACTUALLY TASTES GREAT!!  I will be buying a few boxes of these for sure!!<br /><br />As a side note, I noticed my hair and nails have been growing a lot faster since I started drinking these daily.  I can't say for sure it's a related effect, but it's an interesting coincidence!

review/summary: Works exactly like they say it does
review/text: Bear in mind, different people have different metabolisms and different tastes.  From past experience, I avoid anything lemon-lime flavored.  I went with orange, which tastes like watered down OJ.  Just two ounces, small bottle fits in a knapsack or desk drawer.  When I'm crashing, caffeine just gives me the jitters and I still feel tired, no matter how much coffee or tea I drink.  I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.  Also, if you have a high metabolism, take a small sip and wait 5 minutes.  Drink only what you need.

review/summary: Works within minutes
review/text: I usually drink about twelve 12 oz Coke Zeros a day, however the aspartame is bad for your diet.  Diet colas are worse for you than regular colas.  So I switched to 5 Hour Energy to replace the caffeine.  I also have Crohn's Disease.  This disease causes me to have a Vitamin B12 deficiency, which I normally have to buy and give myself an injection for.  Not anymore.  5 Hour Energy gives me 8333% (not a typo) of my daily allowance for B12, and also provides another crucial element that my body has a difficult time getting - Folic Acid.  Both of these are essential to the human body.  So, not only do I get jacked up from the 5 Hour Energy, it counters some of the effects of my Crohn's Disease by providing me with crucial elements and energy that otherwise are drained by this disease.  I am not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, and drank 5 Hour Energy while I was there.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: First, let me say that I until trying 5 Hour Energy, I'd never tried any of the energy drinks on the market.  My main reason for not trying any of them was simple - most provide their "energy" boost from high levels of sugar or high-frutose corn syrup and caffeine.  Not trying to make a sweeping generalization here, and like I said, I haven't tried them - but I am an avid label-reader.<br /><br />I was in a convenience store one day and happened to pick up a bottle of 5 Hour Energy and read the label.  I was surprised that the ingredients were high in vitamins and amino acids.  But, I'm not one to try every "miracle in a bottle" product on the market and tend to be rather cynical when it comes to most of them, so I didn't buy any, but I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />But here's the other thing.  I have MS and Fibromyalgia.  So as a result I deal with extreme levels of fatigue every day, and I'm talking about mind-numbing, like you can't even lift your head off the pillow, debilitating fatigue.  So quite honestly, I seriously doubted that ANY energy drink was going to have much of an affect on me.<br /><br />But one day, at another convenience store, I thought what the heck I'll give it a try, and bought 2 bottles.  When I got home, I drank half a bottle.  Within minutes, I felt better, like the 5 hour had taken the edge off my typical "my batteries are completely drained" feeling.  My initial reaction was that the sensation was purely a psychological placebo-effect sort of thing.  A little while later, I drank the rest of the bottle.  I still wasn't exactly convinced, but at the same time was thinking "wow, what if this stuff really works!".<br /><br />That evening I could feel myself starting to fade again. Not at all unusual for me after about 6 or 7, and when it happens, I'm usually worthless for the rest of the night.  Then I remembered that I had another bottle.  I know that they recommend no more than 2 bottles a day, but I had to know if what I had experienced earlier was the real deal or not.  So, I drank the second bottle.  Again, within a couple minutes I could feel my energy level rebound.<br /><br />Have to admit, that while this stuff isn't a magic potion, for me at least, it does what it claims.

review/summary: Gives the kick you need
review/text: 5 hour energy drink definitely works I have not experienced any side effects. Also it doesn't taste that bad for anyone to gag on it. That's definitely exaggerating. Within minutes of taking 5 hr energy drink my thinking is increased, I'm totally awake and I just feel so aware.  It's definitely great when you have to get up for work everyday at 5am and get home about 7pm.  I'm definitely not a morning person, but this helps me.  It's great for working out because it gives you that increased energy to actually get up off the couch and workout.  But there are some things you should remember. Try not to take on an empty stomach, because this drink increases your energy and your body needs something to burn to fuel that energy.  Another thing is only drink half of the bottle.  Why? because a whole bottle will have your hands shaking and your heart beating really fast.  I learned this the hard way. Maybe it's just my body that couldn't take the whole bottle, but to be on the safe side drink only half and see how you feel and if it's not enough then drink the other half.  I find that a half a bottle gets me through the whole day until I get ready to go to sleep that night.

review/summary: Worked for me!
review/text: I had to drive 500 miles and the drive began late in the day when I was already tired and on a full stomach from lunch.  Needless to say I was feeling a bit drowsy.  A friend of mine suggested I try the 5 Hour Energy, and incredibly, I was wide eyed and alert for the entire drive.  The next day, I had to drive another 500 miles, and while it began earlier, I had a hard time sleeping.  Maybe it was the effects of the 5 Hour Energy still affecting me, or maybe it was because of the loud noises at my hotel.  Either way, I only had about 5 hours of rest, and I needed to cover 500 miles.  So I drank a bottle at the beginning of my drive and sure enough, I made it the entire way.  This is incredible for me as I have sleep apnea and although being treated with a CPAP machine, I still suffer from loss of energy throughout the day.  This has been the ONLY product that keeps me alert.  I do wonder what the health risks if any are though.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I am very leery of "energy drinks." I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--"Does that stuff really work?" Me--"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!" Them (two weeks later)--"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)

Coffee had stormed out, made a big scene at the cafe.  I met you at a gas station, looking alone and forlorn.  I asked you out to a club, and we danced all night long.  Later, I took you to rock climbing, swimming, kayaking.  My heart swelled with joy but you never made it hurt.  As our relationship prolonged, we sat with each other, working, sometimes writing tender missives.  My mind was alert, never spun thoughtlessly.<br /><br />Oh my love, I'd love to love you 5 hours more, my 5-Hour-Energy.<br /><br />Love,<br />Charlie<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- works!  you do get energy!<br />- minimal crashes (only occurs when i partake TOO excessively)<br />- berry flavor is tasty<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- there's a lot of vitamin B in this.  don't know if that is good or bad.<br />- can develop an immunity if you drink two or more every day, so don't do that<br /><br />As always, don't overdo any caffeine product.  If your body does not respond well to this product, cease immediately and maybe ask your doctor.  And then tell me if there are health risks.  Because I am not a doctor.  I am a warrior poet.  If by warrior, one thinks of programmers.

review/summary: 93 octane Gasoline for Humans
review/text: I am a serious runner and a cyclist. I am very skeptical most of too good to be true stuff but I do believe we landed on the moon and 9/11 caused by terrorists not by government. So I sacrificed  my body to test this product in the name of humanity. I run without 5 hour energy and then  I run with 5 hour energy. Difference is so obvious I really did get extra energy and power to shave off 2-3 minutes of my 5 mile morning run before annoying work day, as a matter of fact I still had gas in the tank to go another 4-5 miles if I had time. Same thing when I do road cycling specially 30-40milers, after 20 mile ride I take a shot of 5 hour energy and  double my distance. Having only 4 calories but giving you so much energy is a good thing. I recommended this for my fellow earthlings

review/summary: Works as the ads say it does...
review/text: This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake. Personally I have had great experience with it; though I have heard from people that they end up having to visit the bathroom due to some digestive issues.

review/summary: Other energy drinks don't work for you?  Try a bottle of 5-hour
review/text: First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />For this reason, I would encourage people try try a bottle at a local store (sold just about everywhere) before buying 12-pack's from amazon.<br /><br />Experiences with other products -<br />I drink coffee out of habit, but it doesn't help me to stay awake.<br />Instead, it makes me jittery and occasionally sick in the stomach.<br />Soda makes me bloated and deathly sleepy within minutes.<br />Energy drinks (monster, amp) makes me alert, but not at all focused.  The effect doesn't last more than a hour and the drink makes my stomach bloated and my body tense.<br /><br />5-hour energy -<br />The first thing that will hit you is the sourness, as if you're sucking on a lemon or warhead(though not as strong).  The sourness jolts me right up and then immediately after, it turns sweet and leaves no aftertaste.<br />It gets rid of the sleepy (the in-your-head, eyelids closing, can't stay awake kind of sleepy).. but doesn't really fix tiredness or exhaustion.<br />The thing I like best about this product is the -lack of- side effects.  Doesn't make my body tense or jittery, doesn't make me bloated or sick, doesn't make me more sleepy or crash.<br /><br />Does it really last 5 hours?  I've never tried chugging the whole thing.<br />I keep one in my bag and take a sip when needed.  It usually keeps me happy and productive for a day or two.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all imo.. call me crazy but i actually really like it.  Lemon-lime being my favorite, followed by pomegranate and berry.<br /><br />Price - yes, the drink isn't cheap.<br />BUT, the price is similar for any energy drink and i think that the price of this product is way overstated because you're getting a 2oz bottle instead of a 16oz can.<br /><br />However, for it's intended purpose (keeping you awake, not hydrated), (and if it works for you)i see it as a better deal for lasting longer, also I like the small pocket-able size.

review/summary: Great Up without the Down
review/text: 5-Hour Energy gives us the boost without the drop. Pomegranate is our favorite flavor, but we usually buy whatever has the best deal at the time. Orange is a close second. They're all fine. After all, it doesn't take much more than a shot or less to do the trick, so the taste isn't that big of a deal. What's important is the "clean energy" without the plunge, addiction, stains or breath of coffee.

review/summary: I thought 5-hour energy was a scam until I tried it. It's unreal.
review/text: I'll be honest, I was a total skeptic of 5-hour energy for a LONG time. The TV ads seemed like a scam, no one I knew had tried them, and I just didn't buy into their marketing. Sure enough, I was browsing Amazon late at night one evening and decided to just try a box out. Why not, right? All I can say, is that these are unreal. Straight up. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually still trying to figure out how these are legal and the boost is amazing. Everything they claim is fact. There are not jittery feelings, no crash. The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap.

Buying bulk like this makes it just under $2/bottle as long as you get free shipping which ALL STAR HEALTH offers and the order doesn't have to be $25 or more either! JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE THE DEFAULT SELLER FOR THIS ITEM.  EVERY TIME I FORGET TO ORDER THIS THROUGH ALL STAR HEALTH IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO RECEIVE.  ALL STAR HEALTH WILL PROCESS AND SHIP THE VERY NEXT DAY USING UPS AND THE DEFAULT (AMAZON) TAKES 3 DAYS TO PROCESS, THEN SHIPS VIA USPS (SNAIL MAIL).

review/summary: Works almost too good
review/text: I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time.

review/text: This drink delivers exactly what it promises. You get the energy boost you need without the side effects of a caffeine or sugar overload, which means you also don't get the crash when it wears off.  However, I would recommend taking it in small doses.  When I drink an entire bottle at once I get an immediate rush that eventually tapers off a bit and keeps me going for 5-6 hours.  However, it also makes me a little queasy.  I've gotten much better results by sipping on a bottle all day.  I sip about 1/4 quarter of the bottle every 2 hours.  This keeps me going all day without getting that upset stomach feeling. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Beats The Afternoon Crash! 8 )
review/text: I don't know about ya'll; but I work in an office and right between 2:00 -3:30, I experience an almost daily crash.  Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual "too much caffeine" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!

review/text: My brother (who's in the Air Force) loves this stuff, and eventually I got into it as well. I just sent him a 12 pack  as a gift to keep him going during his daily 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />If you have never tried regular 5 hour, I would try that first (especially half a bottle to see how it effects you). Then, if you feel like it's just so-so, try one of these extra strength ones and you might see a significant improvement. Energy products affect us all in different ways, and 5-Hour Extra is packed full with high amounts of B-complex and energy concentrated mixture (Gaurana, Taurine, Caffeine, Ginseng, etc.). I've read doctor's reviews of energy supplements like these, and as long as you aren't chugging down more than the recommended amount (2 bottles a day max), they are perfectly fine. Make sure you talk to a MD if you have high blood pressure, or have medications that might interact with a highly caffeinated shot such as these.<br /><br />I recommend putting these in the refrigerator and drinking them in the morning, or an hour before working out.

review/summary: As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...
review/text: First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either.

review/summary: Amazing Stuff
review/text: This will get you through your late afternoon slump. I love the stuff. Can't stand the taste, but you shoot it and it's done. The Pomegranate is, to me, the most palatable of the flavors. I drink just 1/3 of these and have just the right energy boost for the rest of the day. And since they last, once opened, for 72 hours ... It's perfect. 1 bottle covers three days for me.

review/summary: Best stuff to get you awake fast w/o the jitters!
review/text: Ok seriously, this is the best product I have found that really wakes you up, doesn't make you jittery, and doesn't make you crash.  Typically every morning I just have a pop in the morning and that's fine, but on mornings when I am dragging, this is what I drink and it wakes you up fast and makes you feel great!  I subscribe and save to this so I always have some at my desk at work.

review/summary: Lots of ENERGY
review/text: I Work 12 hour shifts that usually turn into 13-14 hours of work and then only get about 5-6 hours of sleep in between. So naturally, I have tried just about every energy drink and shot out there.  I have to say that 5 Hour def. gets the job done with an ok flavor.  Another brand I use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038NEOKS">AdvoCare Spark� Energy Drink (Fruit Punch)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TRN26G">Advocare Spark Energy Drink Canister (Mandarin Orange)</a>, that is if they have it in stock.  There are a ton of serving so it's def cost effective.  Either one are great.

review/text: I had tried this product on a few occations in the past for afternoon fatigue. The "boost" in my mood and energy level was prompt, lasted several several hours, and and had no negative side effects during or after the day. The effect was not accompanied by a false sense of pleasure or desire to use it for other than its occasional use as a  mild, acceptable stimulant.

review/summary: Swear by it
review/text: For years I just bypassed this stuff at the checkout counter because it seemed like a gimmick, but holy cow I tried it and it's great.  The advertising is right that you don't really crash when it runs out, and it doesn't make you as jittery as drinking a huge cup of coffee - for me, no jitters when I drink half, a little jittery if I drink the whole thing.  I also find that it has a mood enhancing effect. The taste is fine, like a concentrated energy drink, but you're not drinking it for the taste.  The price on Amazon is the best I've found online if you consider shipping - although watch out because they change around the prices for different flavors, I guess depending on their stock.

review/summary: Works wonders!
review/text: I tried the DynaPep version of an energy shot, and while I feel it did the job, I experienced low blood sugar often when I was on it, as well as a few other side effects. I bought a 2 pack of 5 hour energy just to see how it works, I wasn't expecting anything other then a gimmick; it was sitting in my closet for a week or two.<br /><br />Anyway I finally took the plunge and drank one- I only need to down a half a bottle- it does the job. I drink a half every day I work to get through the day, and let me tell you, I have missing cartilage in my hips and it was getting really uncomfortable to walk. I tried taking glucosamine, but due to my diabetes, the glucosamine was a no no. The only thing I found that works tolerably well is Aleve. But 5 hour energy puts Aleve to shame. If I have hip discomfort I don't feel it at all. I have all the energy I had when I was in my 20s, and for me a half bottle seems to last 8 hours or so!<br /><br />No problems whatsoever sleeping, in fact, due to all the activities it enables me to perform, I think it aids sleep! No swings in my blood sugar levels. All in all, perfect. So far...

review/summary: Two stars for organic ingredients and BPA-free packaging. No stars for taste...
review/text: My 9-month-old son is what you might call an enthusiastic eater. He's sampled a variety of foods, loves most everything (including unexpected favorites like broccoli and prunes), and almost always, to quote one of our favorite bedtime stories, "eats all before him with smiles and goodwill." But these Training Meals from Plum Organics are a notable exception. We tried three different varieties (Pasta with Chicken and Vegetables, Harvest Vegetable with Turkey, and Multigrain Super Greens), and so far, we're zero for three. My son's most favorable reaction was to the Multigrain Super Greens, which he ate, but begrudgingly so, with wrinkled nose and other negative facial expressions. The other two, well... He alternated between pulling faces, emphatically pushing away the spoon, spitting the food out and, on at least one occasion, actually gagging. I'm disappointed. We've loved this brand's fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;es since my son started eating solids, but he's old enough now that he needs to be eating more proteins and more textured foods, and I really thought these would fit the bill. I really wanted to like them, too, as I still haven't found many quick, delicious, organic/wholesome and BPA-free ways to incorporate chicken, turkey and nutrient-rich green vegetables into my son's diet. Unfortunately, it seems these pouches are not the way to go. Guess it's back to the drawing board for Plum Organics, and back to homemade baby food for us.

She will eat the entire pouch without a bit of prodding. I have have fed her dozens of these pouches and I have never seen a lump even as big as a Cheerio. Its a great quality food and she loves it.

review/summary: Try out one, before you buy a bunch.
review/text: Our baby had a REALLY hard time adjusting to solid foods due to an overactive gag reflex.  In my desperation to make sure she got some protein in there, I ordered the large quantity of these. What a mistake. She hated these, and after I tried them, could see why.  The flavor was awful and the texture was really not beneficial to what i would consider Stage 3 foods.  We also saw a food specialist about our daughters issues and they mentioned that the "Stage three" foods are really not good for development.  They mentioned focusing on non-processed foods, and more foods that we would eat.  (not cooking something special every meal)<br /><br />Unfortunately all of these went into the trash or were donated.<br /><br />Would not recommend, buy again or give as a gift.

review/text: I love this candy.  I want to put the bag in a tuxe, marry, then gobble it up.  If that sounds sick and insane well just lock me up in a padded cell.  Before Dilettante did the 2 pack, I bought 2-4 at a time.  Sometimes I'd give a bag away, but most times I hide them.  I don't know anyone who I have let try them to dislike them.  The chocolate is sublime and the dried bing cherry is sweetly tart.  The pairing is perfection.  This is not a cordial. It's a dragee which means there's no icky liquid.  There's just a nice basically tasteless candy outter shell, a chocolate inner shell, and dried fruit.  FRUIT! It's healthy!  But to be on the safe side, don't share it with the kids. ;p

I don't mind paying more for these, though, since they are such high quality. I just received my order today. It arrived quickly and the bags are big enough to last me a long time.

review/text: I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast.

Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.<br /><br />My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill.

What the heck, I figured, if it doesn't taste good I don't have to buy it again.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried GOLEAN and it tasted great!  I was also happy at how satisfied I felt after finishing a bowl; it was filling and nutritious and gave me plenty of energy to get through the morning.  It's gently sweet without tasting "sugary", and I like the crunchy texture.  Kashi GOLEAN Crunch is also available (and tasty!) if you like your breakfast EXTRA crunchy.

review/summary: My Favorite Breakfast
review/text: While trying to eat more healthy I have been on a hunt for a high fiber, and great tasting cereal.  I am also trying to eliminate high fruictose sugar and chemical additives.  Kashi GOLEAN has fufilled all those requirements.  GOLEAN stays crunchy in milk, but not TOO crunchy, and has a nutty satisfying flavor.  I eat this almost every morning with blueberries and lowfat milk.  It sustains my appitite all morning. Because this is a popular cereal, I have been having a hard time purchasing it at my local grocery store and was so happy that I could buy it at AMAZON.  Now don't everyone go crazy and buy this cereal, its hard enough for AMAZON to keep it in stock!!

review/summary: Great tasting but Amazon price too high
review/text: I can buy the same cereal at the local Walmart Supercenter for $2.48 a box which is a lot less than Amazon's price.  I like the idea that something that is good for you actually tastes good!

review/summary: Great product but overpriced at Amazon
review/text: Great product but with the ubiquitous 25% off coupons at Fresh & Easy on $20 purchases, comes out out to $2.55 per box everyday.  At closer to $4 a pop from Amazon why buy unless you're a masochist or there's no F&E near you?  Here's hoping Amazon gets real & lowers the price to F&E levels.

review/summary: Good nutritious cereal
review/text: Since the sister product GoLean Crunch feels like chewing on a cluster of pebbles, I prefer this one which is much nicer on the crunchiness scale.  If you are used to sugar loaded cereals, your taste buds will take some time to re-calibrate. But stick with it, and you will get there. To see why this is superior to other generic (and possibly cheaper) cereals, just look at the nutrition information.

review/summary: healthy and good
review/text: I rarely write a review on groceries. Books are my thing. But every once in a while a product is so great that you need to tell others. This is one of those times. It's not just great cereal. It's also a perfect snack when I'm hungry and want something a little sweet, but not crazy fattening. It fills me up and it's good for me, but it also tastes good. Great product. Natural.

review/text: This is a staple in my diet, high fiber and protein content (imo it's the best of the GoLean series health wise)  and tastes great! Probably not everyones cup of tea, but would you really eat this if you weren't trying to eat healthier?<br /><br />The people in the previous reviews are correct that the price isn't THAT competitive. Though with the subscription (free shipping, Prime not needed) it is pretty good, especially considering most of Kashi cereal is close to $5.<br /><br />For the people who buy this at walmart and target, how often to do go to those god awful places??? I mean seriously if you drove to walmart just for  cereal that's damn expensive box(es) of cereal right there. If you go to walmart every week knock yourself out on their more aggressively priced kashi and think yourself smart as you overpay for some of their other items.<br /><br />Sure you could buy 10 boxes and save some money, but if you're like me you wouldn't want to waste time, gas and deal with such places like walmart.

review/summary: Good stuff.  Just very expensive
review/text: It's a shame the entire U. S. food industry can't really come up with a few good and healthy breakfast cereal.  I guess this is a reflection why we love sugar and fat (irresistible taste when appearing in the forms of cheese and cream).<br /><br />Anyway this Kashi GOLEAN is one of a few (less than 3 I guess) that is<br /><br />(1) Low in calories<br />(2) High in protein and fiber<br /><br />It tastes pretty good.  The only problem is it is low in calcium.  Note that other flavors of GOLEAN such as Crunch are not as good.  They have far more calories.<br /><br />So this is a good choice.<br /><br />The other problem is that it has become quite expensive.  It started as a 14 oz box.  Then 13 oz.  Less than 6 months ago, Amazon sold it (the 6 pack) at $17, and you could subscribe to save.<br /><br />Then subscription was not allowed.  And price increased to $18, and now more than (more than) $19.<br /><br />ALDI has a generic brand of this.  It is also quite expensive (just a few dimes cheaper).  I have found it not to taste as good as Kashi.

review/summary: MAJOR price increase hidden by smaller box
review/text: I have been a Kashi customer for years since--literally since the 90s.  While I love the cereal, and our family has eaten at least a box or two a week for the last decade or more. Buta lot has changed since ceased being an independent company.  I finally had to throw in the towel and stop buying the product.  The last straw was the new MUCH SMALLER packaging.  I think it is disingenuous for them to quietly shrink the packaging by so much to make it look like they haven't raised prices.  I would rather them just raise prices (if they must), rather than have to waste money and resources on more packaging.  Plus, Kashi has fallen behind on getting genetically modified soy out of its products.  Sadly, I have bought my last box.

review/summary: Lowered # of boxes for 2nd time..higher price for fewer boxes
review/text: I had been ordering two types of Kashi Cereal.  A few months ago they informed me that the number of boxes I had been receiving (6) would be lowered to (4) for approximately the same price.  I discontined that order but continued to get the second cereal. After this month's shipment, I was notified that again this cereal would go from (6)boxes to a lower amount.  I am very disappointed.  Have cancelled both orders..............it was great while it lasted.

review/summary: Lean box for lean cereal
review/text: Kashi Go Lean is still the same delicious crunchy cereal. However there is a new smaller box with a reduced amount of cereal at a slightly reduced price. The good: box takes up less space!  The bad: don't expect the same amount of cereal in the box. BTW, has fewer calories and sugar than Go Lean Crunch.

review/summary: Fiber! Palatibility!
review/text: I'm now in my 60's, and I've discovered that fiber really makes a difference in the way I feel and "perform".  One bowl of GOLEAN, and I've gotten a third of my daily target, which is really hard to do with only one item.  GOLEAN stays firm in milk, is small enough to be chewed easily without pushing out the sides of your mouth, and goes well with added fruit.  Oh yes - it tastes just fine!

review/summary: Healthy, light cereal
review/text: A nutritionist recommended this cereal to me. She said look for cereal which has under 8 or 9g of sugar. This has 6g. One cup offers 10g--or 40%--of your fiber and a whopping 13g--20 %--of protein for only 140 calories. It's low sodium, too. There's no high fructose corn syrup in the mix and when you read the list of ingredients you feel as if you could be walking down the aisles of a natural foods store reading labels--the names are almost poetic: hard red wheat, buckwheat, brown rice, corn meal, soy protein, honey etc.<br /><br />To be honest, I prefer the taste of Kashi's granola and crunch cereals but they're also higher in calories. This is tasty and light. You feel satisfied but not heavy after eating it. Sometimes I put some in a bowl and eat it without milk as a snack while reading. I try to keep a box around when I'm in a hurry in the morning and don't have time for a smoothie or banana-yogurt mix. I'll even eat this for dinner if I've had a heavier lunch. It's a great third meal of the day.

review/summary: Great for you with a nice subtle taste!
review/text: Make no mistake, this cereal is not a strongly flavored or sweet cereal.  Look elsewhere if that is what you are looking for.  What it does happen to be is a healthy, lightly sweetened cereal chock full of protein that fills you up.  And that last point is my favorite part.  This cereal actually fills you up for the entire morning.  All I have for breakfast is a small bowl of Kashi GOLEAN and a Greek yogurt and I am rolling out of the door with over 20g of protein (milk included).  I will admit that after eating cereals like Honey Bunches of Oats and all of the other cereals this cereal will seem a little bland but after a couple of bowls (especially with fruit) it will catch on with you and you will start enjoying it.  I am a Marine that needs lots of protein for my workout schedule and I really enjoy the energy gained from this cereal, and the fiber will really fill you up as well.  I even have my 7 yr old turning down Trix to ask to eat my Kashi after he caught the bug!  The great thing is you will feel like a stud after eating this knowing you consumed a small amount of calories to gain a large amount of fiber and protein that will keep you full until lunchtime and avoid any guilt about eating a crappy breakfast.

review/summary: Excellent Source of Protein and Fiber - Very Cost Effective
review/text: This cereal is great for anyone on a high protein diet as it has a very high protein concentration (9.3 grams per 100 calories).  At the same time, it is very cost effective with protein as low as $0.03 per gram.  These metrics are superior to many other protein-fortified foods such as protein bars and virtually every cereal available in traditional retail channels.  In fact, it is so cost effective and tasty, Kashi GoLean can be a tasty snack straight or mixed with other high protein foods to improve their fiber content.<br /><br />Getting creative with Kashi, I found it mixes well with fat-free Fage Greek yogurt and Splenda.  If you fancy a high protein version of Coco Puffs try mixing Kashi with Cytosport chocolate protein mix.  The combination with give you 41 grams of protein with only 280 calories.<br /><br />Combining the attributes of high protein density, low cost per gram of protein and high fiber content, this product is ideal for any strength athlete or individual seeking to cost effectively increase their protein consumption. Highly recommended.

The taste is not bad. its not great but it is definitely more than edible. I am glad amazon has it in 6 packs so I can buy it in my monthly grocery package I buy on Amazon. I agree though the price should be less.

review/text: This is perhaps the best when it comes to controlling sugar intake and still wanting to have a bowl or even bowel filled with cereal.<br />Anyway it a great product,  Kelloggs (who own and developed 100% of Kashi) have done a great job with this product, just having a reasonable size serving each morning with a small bit of fruit can go a long way to extending the life of a diabetic.<br /><br />two thumbs up for Go-lean.  Two thumbs down for amazons pricing well above market average.<br /><br />Review edit,<br /><br />Amazon have changed to better price so bravo, Amazon  you listened , took action and I will begin ordering it here.
