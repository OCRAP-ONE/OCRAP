review/summary: Lacks Taste.
review/text: I suppose if you had a good imagination, you could convince yourself you're eating ice cream. However, my imagination is not that good. In a word, this product is tasteless.  I usually do not eat ice cream and I did not expect this to taste like ice cream. I was simply looking for a low calorie frozen dessert. But this is not a substitute for anything edible, low calorie or otherwise.

review/summary: Keep the British foods coming!
review/text: I found Heinz baked beans on Amazon by chance a year or so ago and since then, my British-born husband and I have been thrilled to see all the latest offerings that have turned up from over the pond.  My husband has been here for 15 years now and really misses his Branston Pickle, HP Sauce, Ambrosia custard, so it's absolutely marvelous to be able to buy these things at a reasonable cost from Amazon -- and certainly saves money versus searching the small imported foods stores around.  Item was very well-packed, arrived quickly, and was the original.  My husband broke into the jar within hours of its arrival.

review/summary: I can't live without Branston Pickle!
review/text: Branston Pickle is basically the UK's version of our sweet relish. It's chunkier and brown, due to ground raisins and spices being in it. It is also called "Ploughman's Pickle" and is an integral part of a traditional "ploughman's lunch." That consisted of a thick slice of bread with a slab of cheddar and a thick slice of onion that farmers would wrap up to take with them in the field. When it was time to eat, they'd pull out a jar of Branston Pickle to top it with. There is nothing better IMHO than an open faced sandwich with Branston Pickle, aged cheddar and fresh tomato slices, broiled until bubbly. Yum!

review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

They sent me an email personally telling me that they had just shipped it out, and that they had added a sticky note to my purchase to personalize it for the recipient. I find those personal touches from companies so rare and so amazingly sweet.<br /><br />I sent the Earl Grey to my boyfriend because he had a very bad sore throat, and he's British so I figured two birds with one stone. When he tried it he absolutely loved it and said it was the best Earl Grey he'd ever had-keep in mind he's British and extremely picky with teas. He said there was something in the flavor that made it unique and delicious. He also loved receiving the sticky note as well. We will DEFINITELY order this again. It also shipped a lot earlier than expected. Amazing! =)

Microwave for 1 min @ 70%, fill cup with milk, mix well and microwave for 2� min on high. After the first heating, the paste should be thick; watch the second heating toward the end, cooking time may vary and you don't want it to boil over. Adjust spices to taste.

review/text: Overall, I like this spiced cocoa. It's good plain in hot water, or mixed with my coffee, no need for sugar(though i do use a lot). However, I do not feel there is a specific this-spice taste to it. There isn't a there's-the-cinnamon (which is why i bought it) or that's-real-vanilla-in-there moment, but it definitely isn't just chocolate. Since I have never had REAL mexican hot chocolate, I can't say this is like the real deal. I am still looking for a good cinnamon hot chocolate mix, but I would buy this again.<br /><br />Shipping is the reason there are 5 stars. It may have just been luck to arrive so quickly but this product showed up exactly 14 days after I bought it. I am located on a Navy ship, in the middle of the ocean, opposite the USA. Anyway, I was really happy when it arrived.

review/text: If you have read any of my other product reviews you may think I only write negatively about the things I purchase at Amazon. With hundreds of purchases and limited time I figure the good products don't need my help but the mediocre or poor products waste unsuspecting folks hard earned money. That bothers me so I rate this brand of dog cookies only 2 stars.  I have purchase most of the major dog cookie brands as I am pretty particular about what I feed my dogs. This cookie is over priced for what is in it and how small they are. There is no steak or meat used for flavoring only beef broth and grains, which is fine but the price for a small bag compared to other brands that use ground meats for flavoring is out of line. The ingredient list was missing online so I took the chance they might live up to the Steak Frites name and price. They smell good and do have wholesome grains and no fillers but so do many other brands that give you more for your dollar. The cookies are quite hard and I would not recommend them for senior dogs who have dental problems or missing teeth.

I like the uplift I get from the drink and plan on ordering more in the future.  I was watching for an energy crash, but never got one.  I don't know all there is to know about green coffee bean extract, but this is a good drink.  They are expensive, but they have replaced my need to drink diet colas except I don't slug down a refresher as often.  4 out of 5 stars because of cost.

review/summary: Have to hide these from myself if I want them to last.
review/text: I tell myself that I buy these to have around for sore or scratchy throats, and although they are great for that, I really get them because they are so good!  Each "bar" contains 9 hard candies, each filled with liquid honey.  They contain only three ingredients; sugar, corn syrup and honey.  I love to use them at Christmas too; I send out lots of packages in the mail and like to include a bar or two in each.

I was finally able to find them online here and get a case. All the people I have introduced it to have loved it. Pretty much as other people have described, it is a hard honey candy with a liquid honey center. It may be too sweet for some people but I love them. I wish they were sold nearby :).

review/text: I originally bought this product in PA three hrs away.  While baking Christmas cookies with my family my mom had a dry throat so I gave her one of these.  She said it helped and would like more.  Rather than drive 3 hrs again I went on line and ordered a box of them thru Amazon.  I then shared them with my mom.  These honey drops soothe the throat and sometimes I drop one in my cup of hot tea for a sweet flavor.

review/summary: Honey Is Sweet and So Are Honees
review/text: If you like honey as much as I do, then you know that when you need a quick sweetness fix, you can just pop the top on the honey and have a taste. That's not so convenient when you're in the middle of Macy's, riding the subway, or suffering through a long, boring lecture. Honees to the rescue!<br /><br />What are Honees? I'm glad you asked. Honees are way at the top of my list of sweet rewards, the treats I have because I deserve them. They are little brick-shaped hard candies, golden in color, with a center of pure, liquid honey. The hard candy shell tastes like honey, but the payoff is when it melts, delivering that pleasing burst of sweetness. So delightful, they move me to poetry (I love Honees, yes I do; if you love honey, you'll love them, too. Okay, I get it, enough with the poetry).<br /><br />Honees are not available everywhere, but they are available to everyone in the forty-eight contiguous states through Amazon.com, my go-to source of hard-to-find groceries.  Manufactured in Italy by G. B. Ambrosoli, they are imported to the United States by Andre Prost, Inc.  Each luscious piece contains only twenty calories of unadulterated yumminess. There are nine individually wrapped pieces in each "bar," twenty-four bars per box. Besides the allure of their flavor, Honees are a lot more manageable than a pot of honey in your pocket.

They are a delicate honey flavored lozenge, with a liquid honey center, and they are just delicious. I can only imagine how great they are to soothe a sore throat, too. When I saw them on Amazon, I bought the entire pack of 24. They are great for the car, the purse, the symphony hall, school, and work. Those Italians make some great stuff!<br /><br />Great buy, and they last a very long time. Unless I go on another eating rampage.

review/text: So, maybe a tea can't bring happiness, but this one certainly seems to add a little "lift" to my day. The ginger flavor is definitely present, but not overpowering and the lemon is a just-right level, too. Because it's a green tea, it brews nicely at a lower temperature, so it's nice for all the office hot water dispensers. Even when I forget the tea bag, this one doesn't seem to go bitter with the tanins common in other over-brewed greeen teas. I've never made a bitter cup of the Numi. All around wonderful flavored green tea!

Very mild, very nice, and decaf so I can drink it all day. I really love the Numi teas. My favorite is Gunpowder Green Tea. Their teas never upset my stomach and no matter how long I leave the bag in I think the tea still tastes wonderful (I do like mine a little strong without sugar, though.) I just wish I could find the Ginger Sun in more places.

review/text: These things are great!  I don't like the granola-like crunchiness of most oatmeal bars, but these are soft.  No high fructose corn syrup or other unnatural, unhealthy stuff.  Can't say enough good things!

review/summary: Frustrated with Amazon!!!
review/text: I bought these all of the time from the manufacturer but was excited to see them from Amazon. Several have been infested by mold and unfortunately I took a bite before realizing this. They are not expired and I don't know why they are this way. I would send them back but there is no contact phone number that i can find for amazon and they do not return food products so i wasted $50 on these oat bars... has anyone else had this problem? Don't buy them they are not fresh!

review/summary: Best Brazil Nuts I've Found
review/text: I starting eating Brazil nuts daily about 3 years ago after reading the Mayo Clinic thought they might be helpful for middle aged women with arthritis in their knees.  Brazil nuts are loaded with selenium, magnesium, & copper, making them a very healthy food.  My knees have improved, but don't know if the Brazil nuts had anything to do with it.  I'd never eaten them before, but have come to really like them.  I've tried several brands from different websites, but have found these to be the best.  I also like the fact that Amazon offers free shipping on orders over $25.  Other websites can charge almost as much for postage as for the nuts.

review/text: When we received our first shipment of Bergin Brazil Nuts in January, we were thrilled with the taste and freshness.  Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the order received in April.  These are quite rancid and ugly tasting.  We decided to give this product a 2 star rating rather than 1 because the first batch was so very tasty and there is always the chance that we might be lucky again, if we were willing to take the chance, although that is unlikely at this point.

review/summary: Disappointed in my last order of Brazil Nuts 16 oz - 2 packs
review/text: I have ordered these Bergin Nut Company Brazil Nuts for many months and have been very pleased with my orders.  I even ordered them as gifts.  This past week, I ordered my usual 16 oz - double pack and was SO disappointed.  The nuts were soft.  They did not look the same.  Rather than the large, crisp nuts with tons of flavor, these nuts were smaller, had dark skins on all nuts, and tasted soft and almost moist.  I could not return them but if I could have, I would have.  I'm afraid I will not order any more.  I'm so disappointed as I ordered them regularly.

review/text: I had not had Brazil Nuts before i ordered these. I am a vegan and have read the many benefits of Brazil nuts so i thought i would get them a try. I have a home-made mix of different raw nuts and dried fruit that i add to my cream of wheat. These nuts have made a great addition to my breakfast. I find the price great, i order something else from amazon with it and it ships free. You really can not  beat that. I have also bought their cashews and almonds. I recommend this company to anyone.

review/summary: AVOID - Stale product!
review/text: I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price. I bought 2 packages of nuts from this company and 3 packages from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> (Pack of 3) to compare them. I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful!<br /><br />Then I opened this product. The nuts looked the same, actually were a bit more cleaned than the other company's. However, there was no flavor to them. I couldn't understand what was wrong. I kept tasking them trying to figure out the difference and then I started finding STALE NUTS in this product. Unfortunately, I opened the both packages (not at the same time) and emptied them into a special canister where I keep the nuts. So, I can't return them. What a waste! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. I thought maybe I have gotten one bad package. But the second package was just as bad. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled. It takes 3 teeth brushing to get rid of that awful taste!<br /><br />So, if you want good Brazil nuts, do not buy these! Buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> I've bought from them 5 times and each times nuts are fresh and tasty, just like they are supposed to be. Now, if only they didn't have so many calories... :)

review/summary: WAS The best nuts - updated review Dec 1, 2011
review/text: I gave a 5 star review a year ago. This is my new review as of Dec 1, 2011<br />I have been ordering these nuts for over a year now. The quality has deteriorated so much. The last batch had very small and chewy nuts (not like their usual size - large and crunchy) and somehow they tasted strange. I looked at the review and found there were others with the same comment. I am hesitant to re-order from this company again. For this price, I do expect to get the BEST Brazilian nuts.

review/summary: Yucky Nuts
review/text: My doctor prescribes 2 Brazil Nuts a day for medical treatment. One day I was out and so was the store, so I risked it and ordered these from Bergin Nut Company. The first two I ate were both mushy, and one was bitter. :(  I can tell by the yellowish color that these have all been through something. I'm guessing severe temperature changes, maybe frozen and then too hot. I eat them for the selenium, which I can only hope is still good after whatever these nuts went through. It is a crying shame for such large beautiful nuts to be neglected to the point of becoming yucky. Nuts really should be kept cool and are probably best bought from a place that is air-conditioned, or even better, a place that refrigerates them, a service that the Amazon warehouses are not yet offering. Hopefully not every bag will be like this. You may get lucky and have some tasty ones, but if I were me, I wouldn't order these.

review/text: I love Brazil nuts. If given the option, I would choose them over any other nut (Macadamia nuts are a very close second)<br />So, I was very excited to receive this shipment. But, I am disappointed. Although the nuts were shipped quickly, they vary from nut to nut in taste. Some sweet and fresh, some not. I doubt I will purchase from this seller again. They're too expensive not to have a consistent taste.

review/text: Dr. Oz suggested that there was a lot of health value in eating a few Brazil nuts every day. Following his advice, I purchased this product through Amazon.com. Most of the nuts are very tasty but every once in a while I came across one that tasted a bit moldy. Maybe that is the common nature of this nut and of course outside of the taste, I keep the extra supply in the freezer. I am enjoying having a good supply of these nuts for my good health. Shipping service was excellent.
