review/summary: Decent gift, not great
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a co-worker, and she told me her family enjoyed the cheese a lot.  That said, I was disappointed with this as a gift, as the box was much smaller than I expected and the unattractive, very loose ribbon made a weak presentation.  (I couldn't re-tie the ribbon or even remove it, since it was attached with a sticker to the box and would have ended up tearing the box.) Overall, I won't be buying this as a gift again - better to find a great local cheese shop and wrap everything properly.

review/summary: Excellent dog food!
review/text: I have a 10 yr old & a 7 yr old dog. The 10 yr old will eat anything, the 7 yr old is extremely picky & has a delicate stomach. We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/summary: Best in Quality and Price
review/text: I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!  It is a tad pricey but if you love your dog like I do then it's worth it.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry this for a very long time.

review/text: Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/text: My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/summary: Great for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs
review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/summary: amazing for skin conditions!
review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/summary: Maybe just not for my dog?
review/text: I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/text: I love the taste of this tea, but I wish it came with the extra valerian.  That would be absolutely perfect.  But for now, this is my favorite tea.  It doesn't need any sweetener, thanks to the vanilla, and I don't like to sweeten tea before bed, because I don't want to have to brush my teeth a second time, and I like to get into bed and read with the tea.  This is the best tasting, most calming tea I have found, and I have tried hundreds of teas and even made my own from dried herbs.  Love this stuff.  Only wish the valerian was in here.

review/summary: Weaker than Regular Sleepytime
review/text: I've been a fan of Sleepytime tea for over 25 years and have also enjoyed the Sleepytime with valerian. When I compare the flavor of the Sleepytime Vanilla to the regular Sleepytime I must say that the regular Sleepytime is much more complex. I think I may need to use four teabags per mug of tea since two teabags do not make a strong enough tea. I'd almost suggest that you just add some vanilla to regular Sleepytime tea for a fuller flavor. Celestial Seasonings should rethink this tea and make it stronger.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I tried four teabags and the flavor still wasn't that great. This just doesn't have the same taste as Sleepytime. I think they should go back to the original blend and then add extra vanilla. It seems they have taken out some of the main ingredients to make room for vanilla.<br /><br />P.S. II - I tried six teabags and that seemed to be the best so far. I needed to steep the tea for at least twenty minutes.

review/summary: No vanilla flavor
review/text: I've been searching far and wide for a good vanilla tea so I decided to try this one. I must say, I'm disappointed yet again. This tea turned out to be a green color, which is not what I was expecting, but no big deal. Anyway, it ended up smelling and tasting just like a mint tea, which is also not what I was expecting. I am not a fan of minty foods/drinks so that was immediately off-putting. On top of that, I could not taste even a hint of vanilla. I was able to drink my whole cup but I don't think I will enjoy the box so I may return it. And my journey to find a vanilla tea continues! The best I've found is getting some tea from Starbucks and adding a ton of their vanilla powder to it.

Most of them have a calming / soothing effect on me. But like I said I love the taste of this tea.

review/summary: Best Organic Baby Food by Far
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit & Whole Grain Combo, Peach - Oatmeal - Banana<br />This variety was a huge hit with my son and was given to him most every day until about a year and a half. My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go. That's why I'm giving it four stars as opposed to five. Although, I would say this flavor is definitely worth a try for any child who has moved passed the basic stage one foods.

After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food.  My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner).  Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far.  It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!

review/text: I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!

review/text: I am not a health nut but I have tried various brands of baby food and by far Earth's Best tastes and smells better.<br /><br />My son loves it and he is a very picky eater.<br /><br />I also feel good about the fact that there are not chemicals or preservatives that may harm him.

review/summary: Fruit & grains - great tasting and convenient
review/text: My little guy just loves this jar. I am not a believer in forcing grains on my son, but he loves the Earth's Best combinations.  I am happy with Amazon's "grocery" business. It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery.  I can't imagine going the store and having to get a whole case and go through check out. I try to make him some meals, but I trust Earth's Best and love the flavor combo's and they are so convenient.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Great tangerine with a hint of banana flavor!  Not for low carb diets, though.
review/text: Per reconstituted 8 oz serving (18 servings per jug):  140 calories, no fat, 1g protein, 33g Carbs.  Various vitamins and minerals including 130% of daily C.  No High Fructose Corn Syrup but sweetened with grape and apple juice concentrates (also mainly fructose, of course).  Stays thick even if made in a shaker rather than a blender (natural locust bean and guar gum).  Can actually be made by stirring with a spoon energetically, too.<br /><br />Nice tangerine tang with a hint of banana.  Highly addictive, which is bad considering the carbs and calories.  Buy at your own risk.  Good, though, to satisfy tangerine cravings for the 9-10 months of the year you can't get fresh tangerines.

review/summary: Finally, Plain Old Fizzy Water!
review/text: For some reason, plain old fizzy water is very hard to find, at least for me. Our local QFC had it, but they just closed. Safeway used to have it, but now they only carry the flavored varieties. I could get the snooty variety that comes in a green bottle, but I can't justify the price. It is only water for crying out loud! Everyone just told me to get club soda, but that has way too much carbonation to use as a drink. Club soda is meant to be mixed with other non-carbonated drinks. So I found this on Amazon and could not be happier. Talking rain is one of the better brands. The price is right and it tastes great. Thank you Amazon!

The item being reviewed here is okay compared to never eating eel, but it is tougher, probably overcooked, and far less succulent than the genuine article offered by sushi chefs.  Another alternative <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UY0JIY">Roland Smoked Eel Fillets, Boneless, Soybean Oil 3.66-Ounce Cans (Pack of 10)</a> gets highly variable reviews, and is packed in OIL (yuck!), clearly not the real Unagi that I seek.

Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 50 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition.

review/summary: Lush, ambrosial and gentle kiss of a tea
review/text: This delicate white tea with the smoothest hint of luscious dewy pear and a kiss of vanilla takes me back to my childhood days of running around in sun all day, eating fresh fruit that would drip all the way down to my elbows washed down by massive amounts of tea.<br /><br />I have to agree with the reviewer below that the taste is faint, and that's the best part of this tea. Sometimes you want something soft and soothing but not herbal, that almost tastes like juicy water and this really takes the punch.<br /><br />I love it with a bit of sugar, and it gets even better when cooled or made with ice. For those watching calories, sugar can be omitted and this tea can be drunk in gallons to refresh and tranquilize. I can forget all about store bought iced teas and all the soda in the world when presented with this, as it is truly a tea I can see myself buying for the rest of my life. It's gentler than black tea, healthier and 100% natural with less caffeine than coffee and that flowery aroma of summer bouquets caught in a tiny tea bag is a marvel to behold.<br /><br />-Kasia S.

Supposedly antioxidants reverse damage done by free-radicals to tissues of the body. Free radical damage can be caused by pollution, radiation, smoking and the aging process. Reversing this damage is supposed to reduce effects of aging and disease.

review/summary: The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making
review/text: First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good.

review/text: I have loved the taste of  Pike Place Roast coffee since its first offering. I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon. I look forward to my first cup of coffee each morning!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-22-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520269926">Everything but the Coffee: Learning about America from Starbucks</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4">Starbucks Pike Place Roast, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 54-Count</a>

review/summary: Good, but not Great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right

review/summary: Wonderful Coffee
review/text: This is the perfect medium roast K-cup. The coffee never tastes burnt or watered down. It tastes just like it would if you ordered it at Starbucks. This coffee is just as good as the French Roast, but not as strong. I will continue to buy these as they are the best K-cup I have tasted yet!

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and "Oh my God", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the "ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ.

review/text: My only surprise was that 54 cups arrived rolling around loose in a cardboard box.  I guess I expected the regular Starbucks packaging which would have been a little easier for storage.

review/summary: Not star struck with Starbucks!
review/text: I was very disappointed with this purchase! The k-cups came in a plain box with the cups dumped in.  Most looked smashed or old. There is no expiration date so there is no way to tell how old these things are. They look old!!  Also, beware of return policy for this is NO return available (and there is NO mention of that on the item!). $40+ down the drain and in the trash. I will NEVER buy coffee through Amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: This is a good price for starbucks K- cups.  Tired of paying lots more in the grocery store and at Staples.  Instead we stock up on these and have coffee for a while instead of for a week. I like the convenience.
