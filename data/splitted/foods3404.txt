review/summary: Don't listen to those bad reviews...these are yummy!
review/text: Well first I'll start by saying that those bad reviews are probably from people used to eating full-fat products like Cheese Puffs! If you're the type that's aware that you have to make small sacrafices for a healthy lifestyle, then you will love these. They satisfy my cravings when I need a cruchy, saltly snack. And when i'm craving something sweet...the honey mustard flavor does the trick. I say give em a try! Just got my second order in the mail yesterday.

review/summary: These saved me.
review/text: If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...

review/text: I've been looking for low calorie snacks to munch on and I'm glad I found these. I've only tried the honey BBQ so far but the flavor is really great. I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I"ll stick with these.

review/summary: Delicious low calorie snack!
review/text: I discovered these on a whim at a discount store and they were surprisingly delicious. They have an awesome crunch and great potato flavor. The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.

review/summary: These are great but the mix of flavors is not the best
review/text: I love Smart fries so they get 5 stars. However this pack is not the best mix of the flavors. It good if you don't know what you like and want to try 1-2 bags of each different flavor. However, if you know you like certain flavors and are looking for a bunch of them you should just buy the seperate flavor packs.<br /><br />The flavor of the smart fries themselves are amazing. I have been using these as a subsitute for eating other salty or sweet snacks. The whoel bag is only a little over 100 calories and if you swap them out for the right cravings they are going to save you a junk load of calories.<br /><br />The price here is alot better then local stores that I have seen. At my work cafe they have these for about 2 dollars a bag. So anything under 1.50 would have been great but under a dollar a bag that's just awesome. I am planning on stocking up on some of the 1 flavor packs for a long road trip since these are an excellent "snacking food" when your not starving but want to munch :).

review/summary: Great alternative snack!
review/text: Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.

I found that flavor to have one awful after-taste to it (and I absolutely LOVE cheese) so the next time I order these I'll choose the 3 flavor pack instead of the 6.  It's too bad that Amazon doesn't give an option to customers to mix and match varieties.

review/summary: Potato Styrofoam Tubes...
review/text: These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless "potato sticks" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the "sea salt" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual "fry"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better.

review/text: These came in the variety pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, and were among my favorite.  I must say that all the varieties are enjoyable.  However, the BBQ, honey mustard, and plain potato chips or fries stood out in front of the assortment.  This brand's packages are much fuller than others.  The chips or fries have a sweet and spicy, tangy BBQ flavor.  I say they have more of a Memphis than Carolina style BBQ taste.  I would say they will pair with almost any kind of hearty sandwich or make a filling snack.  Yummy!

review/text: I ordered the Variety pack of 24. The only flavor I didn't care for is the Salt and Vinegar but that's only because I don't like that flavor in anything. I gave them to my grandkids and they LOVED them!!<br />I was VERY surprised when I opened a bag and saw how many were in a 1 oz serving! WOW!!! Not like your typical lo-cal/lo-fat snack chip where you get about 10 chips and you're done. I love the texture and everything about these fries. I'm already trying to decide what flavor/flavors to reorder. This is definitely on the top of my snack list.<br />My only suggestion is if a little bit more salt could be added to the Classic Sea Salt flavor. They didn't have quite the flavor punch I was expecting but they were still very good. I think a bit more salt would make them PERFECT!!<br />I'm so glad I came across these fries and I'll definitely spread the word to friends and family.

review/summary: Guayaki Yerba Mate under consideration
review/text: This was the first time I have ever tried Yerba Mate, let alone, the Guayaki product sold in tea bag form.<br /><br />I was not entirely disappointed with the results from brewing.<br /><br />I have read about the supposed medicinal and health benefits from drinking Yerba Mate, but just wanted to comment briefly about this particular product.<br /><br />The packaging is clever and attractive.  The contents are carefully prepared and provided in "non-flow-thru" bags, which are contained in a resealable pouch.  How controlled and sanitary this is, I would not know.<br /><br />What I was not quite prepared for was the experience of tasting the product, being that it was my first time.  To ome, Yerba Mate tastes a bit like some green teas.  It is slightly astringent and after my first cup, I felt that it benefited from the addition of milk and/or honey to round off a bit of the "bite".  I personally did not think that it was in any way a substitute for any other caffeinated beverage, however.<br /><br />Let's just say that this is an "acquired" taste.<br /><br />Up in parts of Northern California, I have seen other versions and brands of Yerba Mate and among some friends living in Mendocino, or Fort Bragg, it is becoming a sort of "fad" to consume Yerba Mate rather than teas or even coffee in certain circles.<br /><br />Since I purchased four packages of 25 bags each, I am "set" for quite a while.  However, I would certainly entertain trying other brands of Yerba Mate, for comparison.<br /><br />As they say, "your mileage may vary!"<br /><br />Happy sippin'<br /><br />Richard Links<br /><br />Berkeley, CA

Regardless, the cooking process provides more than enough extra heat to accompany the jalapenos, which I regularly add all over my nachos and do not find to be very hot. This is a hot product, way to hot for a lot of people to even mess with, but I love it. I had to come here and order it as it doesn't even sell here in my local big buy store. If you're looking for a real kick in some cheese dip or salsa, this is the kind to get. I even eat this straight with chips as a salsa when I get lazy, its that good.

review/summary: I wouldn't buy any dog food made by Diamond (chicken soup is only one of many)
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the "voluntary" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through "other" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.

review/summary: Exquisite With Ice Cream
review/text: We had actually purchased an unopened bottle of Monin's Irish Cream Syrup about 10 years ago, from a small<br />coffee shop which was going out of business. The bottle sat in our kitchen cabinet, unused, for those 10 years. We finally<br />decided to open it, hoping it was still OK after so long. We tried it on Edy's Caramel Delight Ice Cream. It was<br />an absolutely exquisite taste experience. We use it mostly for that flavor of ice cream, but will occasionally<br />have it in coffee.<br /><br />  After we tried it, we quickly used up the 10-year old bottle. We've since purchased another bottle of the<br />Irish Cream syrup from a seller on the Amazon website, and we'll soon purchase yet another.<br /><br />We highly recommend Monin's Irish Cream Syrup. Enjoy !

review/summary: Great vitamin boost + a little caffeine!
review/text: I love, LOVE this product.  It's an easy way to get vitamins, and my husband really feels the boost- he had his colon removed and it's harder for him to absorb vitamins than it is for the rest of us.  E-boost also has vitamin D, which is rare in drink mixes and great for keeping healthy during the winter months when most of us don't get as much sun as we'd normally do.  I hear the other reviewer's complaint about the taste, but I mix 1 packet of powder in a half liter or .75 liter, as opposed to the 8 oz of water recommended (perfect for a sports bottle). I like the taste- it actually tastes more like real lemonade-- when it's diluted in at least 16 oz.

review/summary: Great product, but didn't like the taste
review/text: I have to say I got exactly what I was looking for -- a great energy boost, but no jitters and I was still able to sleep that night.  I'm really sensitive to caffiene and if I have it anytime after 2 in the afternoon, I won't be able to sleep.  I tried eboost b/c I had to work extra hours at night for a few weeks, and after I drank a cup of it, I had a great energy rush and was able to keep up with my work and stay productive, no problem.  My only complaint is about the taste.  There's no fake sugar listed on the ingredients, but it has that bitter aftertaste that I personally can't stand.  I'm trying some of the other flavors to see if they have a milder taste.  Would have given it 5 stars were it not for the chemical-y flavor.  Green tea is probably better for you, but I don't get the same pick-me-up I got from this, and this is such a convenient alternative.  I'll keep buying it.

review/text: With the consistency of Alka-Seltzer and that artificial sugar flavor in the back of your throat, this `Pink Lemonade' variation of the `eboost' product is really no better than what I experienced with the Acai Pomegranate flavor.  On top of that, there really is no boost to be had here (I'm still waiting to experience what others claim to experience).  It feels chalky going down and at times even makes my mouth pucker.  I think I preferred the `barely there' Pomegranate flavor to this one, actually.  I'm all for `all natural', but not if it tastes like this.  I'm sorry eboost, but I'm still not sold on your product.

review/summary: Pleased to find an organic corn bread mix!
review/text: I'd almost given up on locating an organic corn bread mix when I found Arrowhead Mills Corn Bread Mix. Even better, it's available via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.  I no longer purchase any corn product that isn't organic and non-GMO--for safety's sake. This mix makes good corn bread with pleasant texture. Thank you, Arrowhead Mills, for providing a safe alternative to "mutated" corn products! Thank you, Amazon, for selling it via Subscribe & Save.  The best of both worlds! I encourage anyone concerned about food safety to switch from traditional corn products (read:  GMO corn brought to you by Monsanto, makers of Agent Orange, and drenched in Roundup, one of the most toxic substances on earth today) to Arrowhead Mills organic corn meal mix (which cannot contain GMO corn and meet organic standards at the same time).<br /><br />I realize I used this review to get up on my soap box, but so many people are unaware of the dangers in our food supply.  Europeans have said NO to GMO seeds, but Monsanto has a headlock on the American government today (with a former Monsanto attorney running the FDA!) and that "evil empire" is determined to take over all the seeds IN THE WORLD by patenting their GMO seeds (which REQUIRE that Roundup be used with them).<br /><br />PLEASE search out information about the dangers of GMO seeds on the Internet and learn why all consumers should fight the GMO invasion and insist on GMO labeling. The first step toward ridding the world of this danger is the California ballot to force labeling of GMO seeds (tantamount to putting a skull and crossbones on the product label!). Once this passes--and I believe it will--governors in other U.S. states may stop being such cowards and follow suit!<br /><br />CITIZENS FOR SAFE FOOD SUPPLY--UNITE! We must help ourselves and secure a safe food supply for our families.

Great corn flavor, quick preparation, stays moist, and still tastes great if you don't have honey and substitute a little sugar instead. I lived in Texas for several decades, ate many different types of cornbread, and this is my favorite. My local Health Food store stopped carrying this mix several months ago so I tried making cornbread with Arrowhead Mills corn meal, but as excellent as that product is, the finished cornbread just wasn't as good! I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a good price, too.

review/summary: Ever had an unsatisfied craving for 35 years?
review/text: Do you remember what a clean, crisp taste your favorite soda had before the sugar in it was replaced with corn sweetener?  I do. You may be surprised that it costs less than one cent more per 12 oz. can to use sugar rather than corn sweetener.<br /><br />The last time I had a Dad's Root Beer I was about 13 years old.  35 years later, at 48, there are times when it seems I can still taste it.  Thanks to Amazon.com, I'll finally be able to satisfy my thirst for it.<br /><br />Dad's has a much crisper, less syrupy taste than A & W, which leaves a sometimes unpleasant aftertaste.  Barq's tastes slightly closer to Dad's, MUG closer yet.  Dad's Root Beer has a little more carbonation, just a hint of sarsaparilla, and they still uses cane sugar instead of the ubiquitous corn sweetener.  You can definitely taste the difference.

The label states they added "rose essence" to it, so compared to the Harrogate product, it smells sort of synthetic. Not to mention, you get more tea with the Harrogate version.

review/text: I have been looking for a well blended black tea with rose for sometime, and I thought I'd check out Amazon. Never did I image I'd find such a great mix! It has a crisp taste that you would expect with a black tea, but the rose gives it a soft honey/floral overtone. The type of rose petals are key in a black/rose blend, and they nail it on the head! You do get a lot of tea so be prepared (but for the price, it is amazing!). It is perfect hot, but you also brew a large batch and make a naturally sweetened iced-tea (it isn't sweet tea, but the rose gives it something extra).

review/summary: A good tea, but I've had better rose black teas
review/text: The coffee shop in my old neighborhood had a wonderful rose black tea I was getting addicted to. When I moved I really missed having my tea of choice so I checked Amazon for a similar tea and found this. It is a very good tea, but it still doesn't compare well to the tea I got at my old coffee shop. Of course I'm not paying $1.75 a cup for it either. I do enjoy this tea and will continue drinking it of course, but I think I will try some other brands when I run out. Maybe I'm just being too nit-picky. I am tempted to give it the full five stars because it really is quite good.

review/text: I think they are a great product in that they are definitely a healthy treat.  The only downfall is that my cat wouldn't eat them so I had to give them away and the cat that has them now is not crazy about them either.<br /><br />So I guess when giving a cat a treat it should taste like a treat and not like a healthy snack.

review/summary: Parents loved it, but not the best value.
review/text: I assume most people would buy this as a gift, which is what I did. In that respect - it's great. My parents (born in 1948) both loved it, and it was certainly a fun walk down memory lane for them.<br /><br />That said - for $29 and another 10 for shipping, you're looking at 40 dollars for what amounts to maybe five dollars in candy at most. The box looks full when it arrives, but it's about 3/4 full of black ribbon paper so that the candy inside doesn't jostle around. Looking at the box in the picture, it's not even 1/3 of the way full when you take the paper out of it and see just how much candy you're actually getting.<br /><br />Three stars for the idea of it - it definitely makes a great gift, but honestly you could assemble something like this on your own for about 1/4 the price. If the presentation is worth the money to you (and it is well done) then you should pick one of these up.

I was highly anticipating the licorice pipe and had told my kids about them so it was a bit of a let down when neither box contained one.  There were several other candies both listed and pictured that were not included.  There was a total of 27 different kinds of candy in one box and 28 in the other. Still fun to enjoy a memory with the family.

review/text: When I ordered this strawberry 'powder', I had no hope that I would enjoy it.  Being a strawberry fan in a choco-holic world, I decided to give it a try.  This was a good $20.00 decision.  I buy good quality vanilla ice cream, then I pinch out appox. 1heaping tsp. of this powder and mix it into my dish of ice cream.  The flavor is real good--it is not sharply flavored, but still very good.  It is a 4oz. cannister, and should last a long time.  If the flavor is going to be long lasting remains to be seen.  I will submit an update in a few months.  Happily, the ingredients are all natural and listed as '100% Pure Freeze Dried Strawberries'.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>.

review/summary: Holistic Select and Amazon Prime = A+
review/text: We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select.  Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food.  And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type.

review/summary: Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%
review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe.

review/summary: Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This
review/text: My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.

review/summary: Bichon Loves it
review/text: My bichon has been eating this product since day 1. He's 5 now and loves it. This keeps his skin healthy and he rarely get's into chewing or allergy fits. With other products, we had allergy problems. I like the fish oil content in this and buying it online is EXTREMELY convenient that trying to carry it out of the store.

review/summary: Holistic Select Dog Food
review/text: I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs.  He loves it and, in my view, it is a very healthy dog formula. I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein.  My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select. I rate this product 5 stars.

review/summary: What the Dogs Choose
review/text: We have been feeding our three dogs Eagle Pack Holistic for almost eight years.  I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.  You can sign up on their website to receive monthly coupons.  My dogs have amazing coats, amazing teeth, and amazing energy.  I don't think that there is a better food that could be recommended.

review/summary: It's a Keeper
review/text: We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16" thick and 3/8" or so in diameter. They vary some.

review/summary: Eagle Pack Holistic
review/text: I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good food for English bulldog
review/text: We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/summary: Super for my Shiba
review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.
