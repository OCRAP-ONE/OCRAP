review/summary: REAL raspberry flavor
review/text: I needed a pure, 100% natural raspberry flavor for making flavored beverages. Artificial flavoring just does not compare to the real thing. I bought this extract to see if it really was "berry enough" for my needs..and it was. It tastes very potent. There is no doubt you are working with real berry concentrate. The liquid is deep red. There is no pulp or solids visible in the juice. I keep my bottle in the refrigerator because I don't think there are any preservatives in the product. Over time it could begin to ferment so don't buy too much at once.

review/summary: Don't trust this company...
review/text: The ingredient list hardly looks "pure".  Potassium Sorbate is a preservative... one that is bad for humans.  It is not "anti-microbial" as if that is a good thing.  And citric acid.  They have this big discalimer on their website that they don't add chemicals from a factory, that they are naturally occuring food chemicals. Citric acid is produced by using yeast on a substrate, usually cheap corn.  (not citrus, btw, that would be too expensive.  I guess that's subjective whether or not you believe that is a natually occurring food chemical or not.  But when a company makes a statement like that, and then puts parentheses in the ingredients list to explain the ingredients, puh-lease.  I don't trust this is good stuff for a second.

review/summary: Beetle larvea...!
review/text: Bought 10-15 packages of Merrick patties in various flavors.  Unwrapped 1/2 and placed in airtight container... the other half, I kept wrapped and stored in another airtight container.  Both containers hatched small, segmented worms within 5-7 days, albeit many more in the container holding the unwrapped patties.  NOTE:  The shrink wrap does not provide a secure seal, i.e., often small tears & holes in some. This has occurred both times that I bought these (2 different purchases, 2 different retailers) in the last 2 months.  I have purchased before without issue, but I did not use to buy more than a couple at a time and likely my dog ate them before they had a chance to hatch.  I typically buy treats in minor bulk and keep in airtight containers... various rawhide and non-rawhide treats over many years of dog(s) ownership. This is the only dog treat I've encountered that hatches these worms.  I did send an email to Merrick customer service notifying of larvae. No response. Vet says probably not harmful in small doses.

review/summary: Zoey loves them, but they're kinda greasy
review/text: Merrick turkey patties, about 4" across.  For some reason, I imagined these to be a chewy texture, like jerky.  Instead, they're hard, and when Zoey crunches on them, I'm reminded of someone eating toffee.  So, I'd have to say these are kinda hard English toffee textured.  And they're greasy, I have to give them to Zoey on her "food blanket" so the grease doesn't get on the carpet, resulting in Zoey licking the carpet.  That doesn't bother me too much, as it's a precaution I take with all food, chews, and treats.<br /><br />But, Zoey loves them, takes her a minute or so to eat a pattie.  And as a natural treat, they can't be beat.  Far better than most doggie junk food that passes as treats these days, you know?

review/text: I made the mistake of purchasing this item. I actually ordered two. You can imagine my surprise when I only received two five-pack and not the 150 indiidual patties like I thought. Working at a local pet store, this particular item do sell individually and in packs of five. I see that Amazon or someone rather had inserted January 2007 next to the item on the main frame. That was not there when I made my purchase. I believe that the company that sent the product should have honored the promotion if they want repeat business o at least give a credit.

review/summary: Our favorite Hansen's Soda
review/text: We have tried them all, and this is hands down a family favorite.  We like to purchase Hansen's for our kids because we try to avoid high-fructose corn syrup (found in most soda's and linked to fatty liver, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) and this is sweetened with cane sugar.  The flavor is refreshing and very berry.  We like Pomegranate and Rootbeer, think the Mandarin Lime is so-so, and don't mind the Vanilla Cherry, but this is super yummy, especially for my kids, they love it.  I was really happy to see it on amazon, because it is one of the harder flavors to find.

review/summary: Not Good at All
review/text: The pop came very fast but I was extremely disappointed to find that this flavor was very odd and tasted nothing like raspberries. The pop was far too carbonated as well. This was far more carbonated than what we buy in the store. I would of asked for a full refund or exchange but decided against it as I do not believe it is covered under Amazon's policy. Not anything like the others we have tried (Almost all of them, and all at our local market). It makes me very skeptical about buying online when it is so different a product in store. Of course I purchased Raspberry online because it was unavailable in the store. It is also a shame to have 24 cans of an inferior product. Almost every can has been used up and it was really a chore as we normally drink 6 cans within 2 days and we've had these cans for about a month at least. Lastly, it wasn't just one can but every one in the package.

Also, there were three dented cans in the case when it arrived.  All in all, the sodas will probably sit a long time before they are consumed since I do not drink high carb drinks.  Considering the high cost in comparison to grocery store brands, I made a mistake on this one.

As with their caramel coffee, it's a very subtle taste......you don't get the bold taste that's typical of the Starbuck's bold roast coffee I nortmally like. You also don't get the strong "flavored coffee" taste that I like when I buy other flavored coffees (e.g., Maxwell House etc.).<br />That said, if you're looking for a decent coffee that isn't overpowered by the flavoring, this might be a good choice for you

It is "rank", a term my grandmother used to describe "too much" cinnamon (or "too much" molasses) that makes it offensive. Rank is the perfect word for this.<br /><br />2. It is bitter and to be palatable I had to double my normal amount of sugar.<br /><br />Yes, I did play around with the amount of grounds to use to make the coffee (in my French press).  As I used less coffee grounds it just went watery and did not turn into "not bitter" and "a non-overpowering cinnamon bad taste".<br /><br />I also tried this iced which actually was more palatable and interesting.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in this cinnamon flavor, to say the least and am going back to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O9GAPG">Starbucks French Roast Whole Bean Coffee - 2.5 Pounds (40 oz.)</a>.

Starbucks' taste is alright, the cinnamon isn't that strong. It's not a terrible coffee, but it's not that great either. The cinnamon is subtle to the point of non-existence.

review/summary: Starbucks rules, but their Cinnamon Coffee floats
review/text: My mate & I consume more fresh ground coffee by Starbucks, than I ever thought possible. We recently (last year) decided to expand our taste buds, and try some other flavors, other than our usual favorite Breakfast Blend. Everything turned into our newest favorite. We were ridiculous with our 5 different bags of Starbucks Beans Coffee in our freezer. We tried the Cinnamon........ It looked as though our coffee pot was bombed. None of the other coffees do this. Even the competition coffee doesn't do it. After several tries, we decided to discontinue using the Cinnamon. I want to stress, that the flavor wasn't the issue. However the flavor may have something to do with it as well. We noticed that all the other flavors had the same consistency and weight. For some reason the Cinnamon seemed lighter, fluffier. It's as if it was ground differently than the others, making it a different texture, thus allowing it to splatter and float, getting into the carafe, and inevitably into our mouths.......so, maybe Starbucks can remedy, and if they do, we will eagerly retry and enjoy! Thanks- GrayBeard<br /><br />PS- We have tried Starbucks other delicious "Natural" flavors,(i.e.Vanilla, and Caramel) and have NOT experienced the same tragedy. ONLY the Cinnamon has this issue.....interesting, huh?

review/text: I just threw away half a bag of this coffee.  I used one and a half bags because I really, really wanted to like this coffee.  It is without a doubt the worst coffee that I have ever consumed.  It was bitter and the cinnamon "fusion" evidently did not take.  Don't waste your money.  Buy an unflavored coffee and flavor it with your creamer or a flavored syrup.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavored Brew!
review/text: I'm not the biggest fan of flavored coffee, because it's rare that I get one that I actually like.  But Starbucks Natural Fusions Cinnamon is my exception.<br /><br />I bought a bag at Walmart for Christmas, since I try almost every year to find a special coffee to drink for the holidays.  And to my great joy, this one is now my Holiday Coffee!<br /><br />It was wonderful with and without sugar -- I also add cream.  And I'm going to be hard pressed not to drink it year round, it's so good.<br /><br />I'm pondering trying Starbucks other flavors now, but I've never found a vanilla or a caramel (Starbucks two other brews) that I've enjoyed.  But I've been so happy with the Cinnamon, I might try Starbucks' other two flavors to see if the magic strikes again.<br /><br />Good good stuff!

Bring this one back, please.  I want my sugar, just without as much caffeine.<br /><br />Flavor?  Tastes like most powdered chais I've had.  This is to say, it's convenient, but nowhere near as grand as regular, actual brewed chai...<br /><br />But then again, I wasn't expecting it to come close, so I give 5 stars.  Totally meets expectations: decaf, sugar content, convenience, doesn't taste quite like the real thing.  Ta da!  Perfect for powdered tea mix.

review/summary: Hibiscus-y and Raspberry-esque!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Refreshing, tasty and a real treat
review/text: I would like to first start out by saying that I really like ginger ale it happens to be one of my favorite drinks. However, over the years there seems to be a lot less ginger and a lot more  high-fructose corn syrup in regards to the mass market variety ones that are much easier to find in any number of stores.<br /><br />This Blue Sky real ginger and real sugar variety was a real find. First and foremost the Jamaican ginger ale is a real strong taste one that is a very clear difference compared to the ones that are easier to find in the local stores. The sweetness and taste is really great and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a natural soda treat.<br /><br />The price difference is not much of a difference compared to the mass market varieties when one considers the cost of shipping (which was `free' when I ordered it) and delivery. I do plan on ordering this again. Another thing that I really liked about this product is the design of the can which made the drink even more of a treat.

review/summary: Sleepy, you're getting sleepy....
review/text: I love bedtime teas and use different types. I would call this one of my super teas for sleep help. No, it won't knock you unconscious -- never the objective -- but it makes me very sleepy and provides a peaceful, restful sleep. I often use this on nights when I want to get to sleep earlier than my usual routine bedtime, for an earlier than usual wake-up time. I have no scientific knowledge to base this on, but I think the herbs/ plants in this help to shut off my brain a bit faster than just trying to fall asleep on my own, thus allowing me to change my sleep cycle to an earlier bedtime and wake-up.<br /><br />A few suggestions: Don't drink it before driving, as it may decrease your alertness. Don't sweeten it, if possible, because sugar before bed can also disrupt sleep for some people. It has a pleasant, grassy taste. I prefer to make it and let it cool down awhile so that I can drink it fairly quickly, about 1-2 hours before I need to fall asleep. Don't drink it right at bedtime, or you will probably need to get up and groggily go to the bathroom, thus disrupting your sleep cycle.

review/summary: nothing better as gentle sleep aid
review/text: This stuff works!  Why?  For all the skeptics - it is not because of the placebo effect.  It is because valerian root contains an active compound that has almost identical chemical properties to valium.  That is not to say that it IS valium.  The relationship between valerian and valium is analogous to the relationship between coca leaves and cocaine.  One *contains* traces of the compound in amounts that are no more harmful than caffeine in coffee, and the other *is* the compound - highly potent, pure, and either synthetically produced or isolated and concentrated - very dangerous, indeed.  Both valerian root and coca leaves also contain many other wonderful things that the pure active compound does not, such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidents, etc.  Valerian root is an herb that happens to contain a substance that is a gentle, natural sleep aid.  That is not to say one cannot take too much - after all, just because it is natural, does not mean it cannot be harmful if consumed in excess.  Let's face it, all secondary metabolites produced by plants and fungi are produced to protect the plant from being consumed.  In small doses, however, large animals, not only, are able to tolerate these toxins, but they often benefit from them.  The amount used in get some zzz's, however is the perfect amount.  I would go for this before I go for valerian root pills.<br /><br />Now, back to my review:  I am someone that has a hard time falling asleep and, once I do fall asleep, I do not stay asleep for more than 4-5 hours.  Once I wake up, I cannot fall back asleep.  This tea has been the answer I have been looking for.  I have been drinking one cup of this tea (one bag per cup) most nights for the past year.  When I do drink it, I do not toss and turn for an hour and a half before falling asleep, and, the best part is, I am able to sleep through the night - I don't wake up until the sun comes up.  If, for some reason I do wake up, I am able to fall asleep again quickly.  Also, unlike some other sleep aids I have tried (including cold medication when I am stuffed up), I do not wake up drowsy and "foggy" the next day.  So that's my review and a little extra...  Great product!!<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: This stuff is terrible!
review/text: Maybe I got a bad batch? This stuff doesn't even remotely smell like soy OR vanilla. It's so unappealing that I can't even bring myself to mix some up and try it - and usually soy protein powder is a pretty standard product that tastes pretty good (to me, anyway). Thumbs down on this one - something's not quite right here!

review/text: I really like this cereal. Eating gluten-free, dairy-free & cane sugar-free it was hard to find a cereal that wasn't just rice. Using unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk & a little stevia makes it a terrific tasting cereal. It has just the right amount of crunch for a good mouth feel. This is not Cheerios, and a change of diet forces you to think differently about what can satisfy your tastebuds.

review/text: Hickory smoked sea salt "Durango" has a wonderful aromatic scent and flavor.  There is a strong measure of salt due to the coarse sea salt, but if that is what you are looking for then you will enjoy this.  I would like a little more hickory for the ratio of salt, but I still appreciated this product.  My husband and I use it regularly as do three of our children.

review/text: Peter Pan is so delicioua you could sit down with a jar and a SPOON (if you DARE!) and enjoy it right out of the jar! Someone said Peter Pan is the Cadillac of PNB, but ROLLS ROYCE is more like it! This the PERFECT peanut butter and Amazon carries the crunchy style, too, if you like that. I personally use a spoonful as a diet saver when I feel like I just cant go on denying myself - very satisfying - works every time. The contents are basically the same as some other PNB but no HFCS or trans fat. Ingredients in order are: peanuts, sugar, and less thatn 2% of hydrogenated vegetable oil and salt.<br />Per 2 TLBS: calories 210 (150 from 17 gr fat), 6 carbs and 8 grams Protein.

review/summary: BOY, DID AMAZON HAVE A DEAL FOR US!
review/text: For the men at our house Peter Pan Creamy Peanut Butter is the staff of life.  They  don't spread it on their toast - they frost their toast with it, making thick delicious swirls.  They're not above just scooping a spoonful out of a jar and enjoying.<br /><br />  Now, the best price for Peter Pan Creamy that I could find in our area was $3.98 for a 12 oz. jar.  Didn't need to count on my fingers to see what a deal this was - three 40 oz. jars or 120 oz. for $16.00 or approx. $5.00 for a 40 oz. jar!<br /><br />  Had I gone to that local store I'd pay $12.00+ for 40 oz. of one of life's necessities.  (Please,  know I'm awful at math. so if you correct this, be kind).  But, you get the idea - this is an UNBELIEVABLE BARGAIN! Plus this hefty trio is available for Free Shipping.<br /><br />  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Great peanut butter
review/text: **UPDATE** I had this on a Subscribe & Save order from Amazon. I tried to put through the S&S order early, but Amazon has evidently decided not to carry it any longer, since they have "suspended" my upcoming order because my card on file expires in 6 weeks. To get around that, I cancelled my S&S and tried to re-activate it, but Amazon will not accept the order, saying that it was now only available from something called "Lil-BigShots"(no there's a household word!!), an Amazon 3rd party seller.<br />However, that seller charges what works out to THREE TIMES as much when their exorbitant shipping is added in. Since Amazon is courting the state of Texas as a possible new home, maybe this is just a sleazy ploy to make customers in Amazon's home state glad to see them go.<br />I contacted Amazon support in an effort to fix this situation, but was given to someone who didn't speak English well at all and refused to help. I then called, and spoke to an obvious native English-speaker, who at least attempted to help.<br />Right now, I'm more pissed off at Amazon than I've ever been in 12 years doing business with them!!<br /><br />Item review<br />I always liked Peter Pan PB, but for years it wasn't available in my area. Eventually, 12-oz jars came on the market in my area, but why waste all those plastic jars, so when Amazon started carrying these larger jars, I jumped on it.<br />One thing I like about Peter Pan is that it seems to taste more of Spanish peanuts, which may be why it seems less sweet than Jif or Skippy, and just tastes of peanuts. If I want something sweeter, I have the Peter Pan Honey Roast Peanut Butter, which I'm able to occasionally find locally in 28-oz jars.<br />And by the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00295GR3I">Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter, 40-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> is great, too!! I just wish Amazon would sell these in packs of 4: then I could use the Super Saver option without having to find something to add to take the total up to $25.00. Doing a subscription takes the price down more, which is nice.<br />One thing: since these are large jars, a longer knife is needed. I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DVYEQQ">Mayo Knife - Spreader</a>, which works fine, so I can get that last delicious bit of Peter Pan PB....or mayo, or whatever. The Mayo Knife will be fine until I can find a Spatula/Spreader for a decent price.<br />A couple of words of warning: These three jars are shrink-wrapped together, and as a unit are heavy, so it's not a good idea to order a CD or DVD to fill out the $25 for Free Shipping. The first time that I ordered, I added a CD, and the case was destroyed. Next time, I ordered a DVD & requested that it be wrapped separately or in cardboard. Again, the case was broken, and Amazon's response was "So what?"<br />Amazon ships this item via USPS, but it's a service like UPS or FedEx: no shipping to PO Boxes, so since I don't have mail delivery to my home, I have to put my street address, followed by my PO Box in parentheses. The PO needs a delivery confirmation(so they can't simply put it in a lock box), and when I've queried Amazon about this stupid policy, again their response is "So what??" Nice<br /><br />I've signed up for a subscription with Amazon on this. What a great deal!!

review/text: I am so excited to have finally found a way to get my favorite Peanut Butter in a 40 ounce jar since I haven't been able to find that size or even a 28 OZ jar size in any store in years since stores only seem to only carry them in the 16 ounce only, but I'm so excited that I can at least purchase some online since I've always preferred PETER PAN over JIF and SKIPPY since PETER PAN is smoother, creamier, lighter, and sweeter than both SKIPPY and JIF are, but for some reason the stores still sell JIF and SKIPPY in both a 28 OZ and 40 OZ sized jars, but wont sell PETER PAN in those sizes anymore which may perhaps be due to PETER PAN getting outsold by SKIPPY & JIF.<br /><br />The only thing that sucks about ordering PETER PAN Peanut Butter online is you can only buy them in a group of 3 jars or more since they wont let you order them individually like you can a DVD, plus Amazon sells JIF & SKIPPY individually in a 40 Ounce size, but not PETER PAN for some reason, so hopefully that will policy will change in the near-future to help reduce costs and waste.

Several years later, they had the recall and we could not find it anywhere for a few years.  Local stores now carry this, but this 3 pack from amazon is just about the best deal anywhere.  Of course I would love ordering a few 6lb cans, but that is actually more expensive.  I love the taste of this peanut butter more than any other.  I think it is more peanutty, and it is more creamy and spreadable than jif is.  To have this peanut butter again certainly brings back many childhood memories!<br /><br />Good Job Amazon!

review/summary: Good value, weird taste and texture.
review/text: I think I ordered the wrong brand. Peter Pan creamy has a texture like room-temperature margarine. It's much greasier and softer than other creamy peanut butters I've tried in the past and doesn't have much real peanut flavor. Now I'm stuck with three gigantic jars of this stuff. I guess I'll just shove it to the back of the pantry in case of nuclear war.

review/summary: A must for my Pregnancies!
review/text: I have drank this tea for both of my previous pregnancies (as suggested by my first midwife) and definitely plan on getting for our current pregnancy. I drink about three cups a day then the last month, I start to drink a lot of straight Raspberry Leaf. I have had 2 very easy pregnancies and labors.<br /><br />Raspberry Leaf Tea is very high in an assortment of nutrients including calcium, iron, and B vitamins, all of which are very important during pregnancy. The herb also contains a variety of chemicals -most of which have yet to be identified- that produce a direct effect on the pregnant uterus. They have been shown to strengthen the uterine wall, relax smooth muscle, and help to make delivery easier and speedier by helping the uterus contract more efficiently.<br /><br />Historically women have taken raspberry leaf tea throughout their pregnancies up to and including childbirth. Many mothers extol this herb's ability to make childbirth easier and less painful. In a letter to the editor of the medical journal The Lancet, Dr. Violet Russel wrote "somewhat shamefacedly I have encouraged expectant mothers to drink this infusion. In a great many cases labour has been free and easy from muscular spasm."

review/summary: Be careful if you are early in pregnancy
review/text: This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are early in your pregnancy (or potential pregnancy). I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it. As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf. It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor. Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks. The advertising is irresponsible, in my view. No more Yogi products for me.
