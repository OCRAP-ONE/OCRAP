review/summary: Perky Jerk
review/text: Admittedly this was my first purchase of beef jerky.  I felt the size of the package to be on the skimpy side.  1  1/4 or 1 1/2  oz would have been more satisfying.  The beef quality was not consistent.  Some pieces were in crumbs; others were almost large enough (and tough enough) that I was worried about loosening a tooth crown.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: I've been showing abd breeding Border Terriers for over 16 years and converted my 14 year old Border to Addiction's dehydrated raw.  It is somewhat messy to use when traveling so I switched to the Wild Kangaroo and Apples kibble.  This is perfect for him and much easier to deal with (versus the dehydrated raw).  My guy loves this food and he is doing very well on it.  I'm extremely picky about the food I give my dogs and this one is top notch.

review/summary: Proof positive that hot sauce really can make anything better.
review/text: I've got no complaints against the macaroni in this product. The product is designed to produce one bowl at a time of mac and cheese and the mac part comes out perfectly. I am still iffy on the cheese. Oh, I get that it's real. However, it's white, and it mixes with the starch water in such a way that... well, it's not appealing to look at. Even after adding a little butter. It tastes alright, but I cannot get past that weird, glue-like appearance. But a liberal dose of hot sauce later, it's easier to look at and quite palatable. This product is pretty convenient if you want a single serving of mac and cheese without a lot of additives, but in future I think I'll just boil a little elbow macaroni and melt some Muenster over it.

review/summary: "Seedless" Claim Is Inaccurate
review/text: I purchased two packages of this product, but have only opened one of them. Not only did this package contain seeds, but the seeds have been sliced and broken up into small sharp pieces that may harm one's esophagus and/or intestinal tract if swallowed. The only way to eat the tamarind is to hold a small amount in your mouth without swallowing, and allow your saliva to loosen the tamarind while your tongue locates the pieces of seeds so you can remove them with your fingers. Only when you're sure all pieces of seed have been removed should you begin chewing the tamarind. I gave this product a "1" rating but only because I wasn't allowed to give it a "0".

review/summary: Xanadu of Dragonsweyr Got It Wrong
review/text: This product is not supposed to be popped in your mouth and chewed without cooking.  You're supposed to use it to prepare tamarind water for use in a sauce -- think of it as sort of a sweet-and-sour replacement for sugar + vinegar (but fruitier).  It works just fine when you break off a chunk, put it into a saucepan with a cup or two of water, boil it for a few minutes, and STRAIN it through a sieve into whatever sauce you're preparing. Thicken it with cornstarch and it makes a wonderful sauce for pork. I use it frequently and it's just fine. A good product if you take it for what it is. It's not candy.<br />- Bill Warriner, Tucson, AZ (I moved)

review/summary: Very pleased with this tea!
review/text: I was hesitant to order this tea because there were only a few reviews at the time.  One reviewer said the tea was "tasteless" and another cited poor packaging affecting the freshness.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the chance because I disagree on both counts.  The taste is excellent which is, of course, the most important factor.  I love strong, aromatic, flavorful tea and this does not disappoint.  I had to add just a teeny bit more (a more rounded teaspoon for one cup) than with the tea I normally drink, Twinings Irish Breakfast, but that is insignificant since this Davidson's tea is half the price.  I love that it is organic since I drink a lot of tea.<br /><br />I also thought the packaging was adequate.  It is similar to the packaging used for the organic Ruta Maya coffee that I buy and I have never had a problem with freshness.  Of course it is best to make sure you press out all of the air before resealing the top...I usually tap it on the counter to settle the contents then bend the top over on itself while leaning over on it, then seal it. As it reduces in size putting a rubber band around it helps just in case you didn't get the seal completely closed. I keep a small quantity of the tea in an old Twinings tin so that I don't have to open the original package so often.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found this tea.  I still love the Twinings but it is just too expensive with three people in my family always drinking tea.

review/summary: Not bad for the price
review/text: We drink a lot of tea at our house, in fact we drink almost exclusively  tea.  I had been toying with the idea of trying one of the Davidson bargain teas so I finally took the chance and ordered their English Breakfast 16 oz. bag.  We love English Breakfast tea from PG tips,  Twinings, Taylors of Hargate and Dilmah Ceylon supreme tea. all of which have flavor and aroma in high degree.  My personal favorite is Taylor's Assam tea.  Since Davidson's English Breakfast is a combination of ceylon, assam and Kenyon teas I anticipated a rich and aromatic tea.  Unfortunately the experience was a little disappointing.  The initial taste was somewhat woody to my palate but I wanted to be fair so I waited a day and tried it again in the morning free from the taste of any other tea; same result!  I guess I'll use up the remainder as iced tea.<br /><br />4/20 addendum:  This tea makes excellent iced tea.

If had been packaged more airtight I think it would go from good to excellent. I would happily pay an extra dollar for better packaging. As it is, it is still a very good value on a good tea.

review/text: I guess it had to happen sooner or later but this is my first disappointment buying from Amazon. No aroma when the bag was opened and totally tasteless. I bought in spite of the negative reviews and now will man up and regret it. Too bad because it was to be my first subscribe and save experience. After contacting customer service full credit was issued, subscribe and save cancelled and I was asked to dispose of the item. Five Stars for Amazon!

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like English Breakfast Tea
review/text: I ordered this tea because it had pretty good reviews.  I got it a couple of days ago and have been trying to convince myself that I like it since you have to buy so much.  It tastes fine, but doesn't taste like English Breakfast tea.  I love having English Breakfast in the morning and am somewhat disappointed that I spent over $10 dollars on tea that I don't enjoy that much.

review/text: I read many of the negative reviews here, but decided to give it a try since the price is right.  I don't have any complaints about the packaging, but I also found the taste mediocre.  Despite trying more tea and/or additional steeping time I can't get a cup brewed that is both strong, but not bitter.<br /><br />With that said, it isn't bad tea and it superior to supermarket teabags.  But when I use this up I'm trying something else.

review/text: I give this 5 stars for price, 3 stars for flavor.  I need to use more tea than the directions call for to get the expected English Breakfast flavor.  I put 2 rounded tablespoons in a 4 cup pyrex dish and microwave for 6 minutes. At that time it is ready to drink without tasting 'stewed'.  For me steeping it per the directions made a thin brew with a 'stewed' aftertaste. When this is gone I will not automatically re-purchase but it will be my baseline for comparing others.

review/text: I normally buy from mountain rose herbs, but this is a really good price for organic tea so I had to try it.  In my opinion it tastes a little bitter no matter how long it steeps.  There is a powdery texture to it as you drink it.  With enough honey and milk it is ok.  The taste was unbearable as sun tea.

review/text: I have ordered the Davidson's English Breakfast tea a couple of times now.  I have really enjoyed the flavor.  I had only been using it on weekends because I didn't have time to brew it and get to work.  Now that I have retired, I have it every morning (2 - 14 oz cups) to get me going in the morning.  The lined brown paper packing looks simple but really protects the tea and keeps it fresh.  The delivery of the product is prompt and the price is very good.  I'll be ordering this one again.

review/summary: great tea
review/text: We love this tea. Because my husband drinks a lot of tea that we make in the tea pot from loose tea, we decided to switch to organic tea. We tried other brands too and settled on this one. It is great! You can make a 8 cup tea with a teaspoon of davidson's tea. We also tried Assam and other types of black tea. This one is the best because you can make iced tea as well as opposed to assam tea that gets muddy after boiling it and letting it stay for 1 hour or two. Now, we are subscribed to this tea and get a pack every month. You can't beat the price when you subscribe and save. Highly recommended!

review/text: This might just be my new favorite tea! I'm used to Twinings and Bigelow English Breakfast, and was worried that I might be stuck with a substandard "value" bag of stems and grit for the low price that I paid. But after the first cup my concerns were laid to rest - this is the most flavorful, hearty english breakfast tea that I've had. English Breakfast is my go-to morning cup, I drink it daily in lieu of coffee these days. This tea holds up perfectly to milk and sugar, and I love that it's loose so I can control the strength of my morning brew. I'm a recent loose leaf-convert, and I can't wait to see what other gems Davidson's has to offer!

If you're not steeping the tea for the proper amount of time, it'll taste terrible.  I have a feeling the negative reviews have come from people not using enough tea or brewing it the wrong way.<br /><br />I even used it in a french coffee press.<br /><br />I was impressed with the tea, and you can't beat the price.

review/summary: I surprised myself
review/text: The first time I tried this tea, I was a little disappointed. The flavor was very similar to an oolong that I had purchased at a Chinese supermarket. I don't believe I steeped it long enough that first time.<br /><br />I gradually discovered that the longer I steeped the tea the better the flavor became. I even started stirring the pot (Horrors! I know, not quite proper, eh, wot?) to mix the heavier concentration of flavor at the bottom into the rest of the tea. Now I had a good strong English Breakfast tea. Then I started using it in my French coffee press (which has never had coffee in it). The results were outstanding.<br /><br />I recently decided to try brewing the Davidson's English Breakfast right inside my new 40 oz. Thermos Work Series thermos bottle (double horrors!). I keep a small sieve by my desk to filter out the tea leaves, but the shape of the stopper (with notches in the threads so you don't have to remove it to pour) filters 90% of the leaves so I don't even need the sieve. Now, that is excellent, to my considerable surprise.

Tea is such a wonderful alternative to coffee and I think that if I really had to choose one or the other I would go with tea. Knowing how many types are out there does not make it very easy to choose but slowly but surely one can find all kinds of great tea. This one, for the value and taste, is a very convincing argument that one does not have to pay exorbitant prices to be able to drink a good cup of tea!

review/text: I usually buy PG Tips or Typhoon english breakfast tea in bags.  I wanted to try loose-leaf tea for a stronger flavor.  Unfortunately, I fill the tea infuser and it is just not as strong as the previously mentioned brands.  As for the packaging, it arrived just as pictured here but you should know the paper bag is plastic lined and has a ziploc to seal it. It's good packaging.  I hate to give it this review and I've only made 4 pots of tea so if my opinion changes later, I'll surely note it here.<br /><br />UPDATE: I figured out I was making a rookie mistake: in my desire to brew a strong tea, I was overfilling the infuser thereby preventing the flow of water.  This tea is not weak after all.  I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars.  Why not 5? I still think the PG Tips has a better flavor.  I am going to keep my subscription to this tea because it's organic.

review/text: I bought the Davidson's loose tea to go along with the Eco-cup for Keurig appliances.<br />It is really good! I fill the eco-cup half full, choose the larger Keurig setting,<br />and I get a great cup of tea really fast--no waiting for it to steep.

review/summary: Horrible purchase
review/text: The worst tea we have ever had the misfortune of drinking. Tasted like dishwater. The first time we purchased this tea it was acceptable. The second time it had all the taste and character of floor sweepings. We will never never purchase tea from you again. It was certainly not up to the standard we have come to expect from Amazon.

review/summary: tasteless
review/text: I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea.

Try a sliced tomato lightly salted with a fistful of lettuce leaves between two thin slices of crisply toasted rice/flour bread thickly smeared with Hellman's.  You won't even miss the bacon.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

I think that that focus on fame (and money) is apparent in his approach to dog food:  Give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name.<br /><br />That one's dog will eat it is no advertisement.  First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.  Dogs eat anything--including manure, which is part of this food as the meat flavoring.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.
