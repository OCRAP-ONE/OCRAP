review/text: Kay's Naturals are terrific. There is a wide variety of chips, pretzels, "bites" and cereals. The flavor and texture are satisfying. The protein/carb/fat balance is comparable to Medifast, at a much lower price. Love the fact that they're made in Clara City, MN!

review/summary: TOO SALTY!!!
review/text: If you are all about eating salt covered chips, you'll be OK. For people who don't like the taste of salt poured in their mouth. Might want to move on. The flavor would be ok, with a less salt flavor. Part of the salty flavor probably comes from the cheese, but it's just too much. Won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Workout Chips Alternative
review/text: After saying goodbye to chips about a year ago I've missed them.  Chips taste amazing am I right?  The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars

review/text: I am trying to find higher protein alternatives to my snacks, so I figured I'd give these a try. I've already tried soy crisps, and I really love them.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting these to taste like real chips, but I am seriously disappointed! I couldn't even finish one little bag. They taste like cardboard! I'm not sure what I will do with the remaining 11 bags... What a waste!

review/text: This snack is really good.  I'm not a chip eater but when I read how much protein these had and the low calorie count and high fiber, I thought they were worth a try.  They are actually a great between meal snack.  You feel guilty after you eat a bag of only 130 Calories!  They're that good.  The nacho is the best so far.  I tried the parmeson and they tasted kind of weird.

review/summary: Good Snack!
review/text: This was my first time trying this product and I enjoyed it.  I liked the amount of protein in the snack which is what motivated me to buy it.  The flavor was good (chili nacho cheese) and I will definitely try the others.  One big plus (besides the nutritional content) is the amount in each bag.  Usually with individually bagged chips I'm always reaching for more, but these have large portions in them that leave your crunch craving satisfied.  My only complaints (which are very minor) are that the bags are a little difficult to open and your fingers are left a bit messy.

review/summary: OK but not as good as the big bags.
review/text: I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.

review/summary: Really not that good
review/text: Saw the bunch of 5 star reviews and thought I'd give these a try. So people complained about it being salty, but that wasn't the problem for me, since really, potato chips are just as salty as these. I think someone else called this taste "unnatural", and that pretty much tells the story. These chips taste like they were manufactured in a laboratory, and not actually the product of natural consumables. They look like corn chips but they seriously just taste like flavoring and oil and basically empty of flavor besides these. Not recommended.

review/text: I was a little wary of these due to the mixed reviews here. However, I'm glad I purchased them. I think the flavor is good and the chips are crunchy and taste fried to me. One drawback is that they are pretty small so it's tough to dip them without getting your fingers messy. They cheese can also stick to your hands. I actually like the taste of these more than the sour cream and onion Pop Chips I purchased in the same order. These also have great nutrition compared to those (10 grams of protein per serving, 15 per bag!) I will probably buy these again, they make a good snack.

review/summary: Dangerous charger
review/text: We have large and small animals and needed something that would work for both. This isn't it. It's continuous shock will prevent animals that bite it from being able to let go and will cook them from the inside. It's killed two of our animals. We weren't 100% sure after we found the first one dead, but the second one was obvious.<br /><br />The company's website claims that none of their chargers will harm *any* animal so we called them up and let them know they kill. As it turns out, they already knew that their continuous chargers kill small animals so they sent us an intermittent one for free. (Doesn't really make up for the $400 worth of animals their product has killed and the fact that one was a pet.) They haven't changed their website even though it's a lie. I noticed that they also sell chargers specifically for birds that are continuous and run at the same power output as the chargers for larger animals. One has to wonder why they sell a product that they know will kill the very animals it's supposed to be protecting. Avoid this company.

review/text: Bought this to train raccoons and other critters away from a bird feeder they'd been emptying and damaging. Didn't take long! Probably over-powered for the job, but I wanted to make sure it would work through paint (it does). Nicely robust: something managed to dislodge one of my leads, which sat shorting through wet ground for a day or so with no apparent damage to the unit. May try it next to protect bluebird houses, which suffer a lot of mammal predation.

review/summary: Works a treat
review/text: Raccoons were devouring about a gallon of seed from my large bird feeder every night (at $60 per 50 lb bag of seed that gets pricey).  The squirrels I had baffled but the raccoons were driving me mad. and who likes to be outsmarted by a raccoon?  So I bought this fence charger, wrapped a coil of bare wire around 1.25" pvc pipe and slid the pipe over the mounting pole for the feeder.  This is done in such a way that an animal climbing the pole will have its front paws on coil and back paws on metal pole or ground.  I also mounted it high enough so that snow won't short it out. The hot lead goes to the coil, ground goes to ground.  No more raccoon problem.

review/summary: Comparison:  Santa Fe Bean Company versus Taste Adventure
review/text: Santa Fe Bean Company:<br /><br />-- Mild cereal flavor, similar to corn flakes (which I prefer).  Moderate sodium taste; in fact, this brand tastes as though it has more sodium, contrary to the nutrition labels.<br /><br />-- Some clumping of dry bean flakes.  Rehydrate slightly less rapidly, although no problem.  Two halves of an unflaked bean found, after the contents of ~5 packages consumed; no damage to my teeth.<br /><br />-- Lower price per ounce.<br /><br />-- Convenient bag, durable and resealable.  No individual box to discard.<br /><br />  Taste Adventure:<br /><br />-- Mild bean flavor.  No significant sodium taste, although the nutrition labels indicate this brand has more sodium.<br /><br />-- No clumping of dry bean flakes.  Rehydrate quite rapidly.  No unflaked beans found, after the contents of >60 packages consumed.<br /><br />-- Higher price per ounce.<br /><br />-- Packaging less convenient.  A little bit of bean powder sometimes found in individual cardboard box.  Plastic bag not designed to be resealed.

review/summary: Best Refrieds Yet ...
review/text: These are, without a doubt, the best refrieds I've ever prepared and/or eaten ... and I'm a long time lover of refried beans.<br /><br />They are a snap to prepare. Although the directions say to cover and simmer for five minutes, I've found it best to turn the heat to low and stir uncovered for about three minutes or so, then remove the pan from the burner and let them sit covered for a couple more minutes.<br /><br />A quick comparison to a can of top brand 'fat free' refried beans shows that the Santa Fe Fat Free Vegetarian beans have less than half the sodium! And, because of the handy packaging, you can reduce the salt further by shaking the pouch first. This knocks some of the salt to the bottom. Then scoop the contents of the bag into the boiling water, leaving the salty residue at the bottom of the pouch - don't need it.<br /><br />Plus, there are so many additional things you can do with refried beans that are prepared this way. (e.g. add extra water for delicious bean soup or use as a great base for chili). The creative possibilities with this simple "comfort food" are endless.<br /><br />Oh, and they are a great value, also!

review/text: I've used these for hiking and kayaking camp cooking. Lighter in weight than a can and easier to pack, the resealable foil pouch makes it easy to use a portion and save the rest for later, or a handy place to put leftovers. I've also snacked on the uncooked chips right out of the bag, although they are a bit salty. I've cooked a whole bag in a Jetboil PCS, but I recommend going with smaller portions, unless you're REALLY hungry, or have several people to feed. One bag makes a heap of refried beans.

When I go back to the U.S. each summer, I can bring these back because the packages are so lightweight.

review/summary: As good as my mom's!
review/text: I have to say that these beans are as good as my mom's home made. At first I wasn't sure how freeze dried beans would taste, no regrets. These are the best I've had and I've had them all! My recipe for them is: I heat up the water, add a tablespoon of olive oil or maybe bacon drippings, then add ground cumin to taste, garlic powder to taste, chili powder to taste, and onion powder to taste. Once it's all boiling I add the beans and mix until I get the consistency I like. Take it from someone who grew up on Mexican food... these suckers are good! Don't skip the oil part because the oil carries the flavors better. Also, no need for salt.<br />I don't get the southwestern because they have partially hydrogenated oil or something like that.

review/text: I love these dried refried beans.  I just add whatever seasonings I want like ground cumin, ground coriander, garlic, onions, be inventive and use your imagination!  Very easy and quick cooking.  You could even make these in a hot pot.<br /><br />My only problem is that I would like it if they would print directions for making smaller amounts of these than making the entire package at once.  They have a convenient zipper closure on the bag so that means they know that people may not make up the entire package at once.  I looked on their website and found that you just have to add equal parts water and bean mix.<br /><br />I am going to get some dried pinto beans and cook them and add these to them to be more like what I had in Mexico years ago.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had these for Subscribe & Save so I could get an even better price and have a regular supply.<br /><br />Amazon, please start carrying Santa Fe Bean Co. whole dehydrated pinto beans too!

review/summary: Great alternative to canned or cooking your own
review/text: When I can, I love to make fresh pintos with tomato and roasted garlic. During the summer I am so busy I'll often put pintos out to soak and throw them away 2 days later. And roasting garlic in the summer doesn't often happen.<br /><br />These are a great substitute. I work 12 hour days in the summer so it's great to come home, boil these for 5 minutes, and be able to make whatever I want. I'm a veg* who grew up in the southwest, transplanted to the southeast and these are perfectly good "refried" beans esp. compared to canned. When I want really good, I'll cook real pintos but I'd rather use my little time make a good pico de gallo along with these easy to make, smooth and creamy beans.

Although I liked it, I was disappointed at how much salt had been added. Usually with fat-free varieties, there is more sodium than the regular equivalent, but in this case, the fat-free is lower in sodium. This turned out to be perfect for my tastes and nutrional needs. I use equal parts of this dried bean mix and water, then I add a little bit of Clint's Salsa (which is relatively low in sodium) and a little bit of shredded cheese. The result is both flavorful and still reasonably healthful.

review/summary: Great product, easy preparation
review/text: We bought this product in the past to ship to our daughter, who lives in China. Refried beans is one food item from home that she craves from time to time.  She can buy tortillas at an import store, but not the refried beans. Cans are too expensive to ship, so a dehydrated product is the perfect solution.<br /><br />Last time we bought a box to ship to her, we decided to taste the product ourselves.  We found that we agree with all the five-star ratings.  This stuff is good!  I was afraid that a dehydrated product would be finely powdered, and yield just pasty glop.  Much to my surprise, the product has good texture, comparable to canned refried beans.  This tastes much more like home-made beans than the canned version, however.<br /><br />We will be buying more for us!  Great product.

review/summary: Good refried beans, but too salty...
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers that these refried beans taste good, but I consider the salt content too high - both in terms of taste and health. Whenever I prepare these beans, I add salt-free corn to reduce the sodium content per serving, which helps. If the Santa Fe Bean Company would reduce the sodium content of this product by one-third, I would enthusiastically buy again. As it is, I probably won't, as I am watching my sodium intake.

review/summary: Indeed, Good Beans
review/text: I used a similar product some years back, which was tasty, but had that negative "magical fruit" effect.  So I have since avoided anything like this.  However, I noticed in the reviews for this product that nobody mentioned any problems.  Thanks by the way, to all product reviewers - you help me so much with all of my online shopping decisions - I appreciate your taking the time to leave your reviews!<br /><br />These are the best packaged option.  Better than canned, dried, and many restaurants.  No "magical fruit" effects.  :)<br /><br />The package is a sturdy Zip-loc type bag that will stand upright in the cupboard.  Each bag has a good quantity of product, which you can scoop out for individual portions if you want (just mix equal parts beans and water).<br /><br />The result looks and tastes like real frijoles refritos (at least, non-lard ones), without an off, dehydrated flavor.  I'm not going to claim that you couldn't tell these from home cooked.  But they are better than any other option I've encountered.<br /><br />Finally, regarding saltiness - these seem just right to me, and I rarely eat salty foods or add salt.  Once a great Italian cook told me that all beans require some salt and fat, otherwise they are hard on your system.  She was right.  So, I add just a few drops of oil to these.

You can have great refried beans instantly!  I sometimes add a pinch of dried minced onion while the beans are cooking and a touch of garlic powder at the end.  Others add salsa, jalepenos, and cheese after the beans have been cooked.  It is totally up to you.  You could even add taco-seasoned ground beef.  You can eat them straight from a bowl or with chips as a dip or on nachos.  Also, you can put them on a tostada shell or crumbled tortilla chips and then top them with your favorite toppings (tomatoes, onions, black olives, cheese, shredded lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc.)  Instant Mexican haystacks!  I am trying to eat beans every day since they are so good for you, and this product makes that really easy to do.  I understand that Santa Fe Bean Co. has added a Borracho Beans product to their line.  I hope Amazon starts carrying that soon!

review/summary: Yummy & healthy
review/text: I eat a lot of beans & this sure is a handy way to make up a batch & put it in the fridge - I just measure equal beans & water, & make about 3 cups.  I don't have a car, so otherwise I'd be buying cans of refried beans at the store.  Cans are, for me, much more of a pain in so many ways.  By the way, you can recycle these plastic bags, along with any others, at the plastic-bag recycle bin in most grocery stores.  I admit I haven't calculated whether the canned beans are cheaper, but I doubt it, since so much of the weight is water.

review/summary: Awesome Refrieds!
review/text: I'm a refried bean aficionado and these are excellent. As others have said, they're infinitely better than canned. No offensive canned taste and the texture is smooth. Great in a tostada (a little lettuce, cheese, avo and salsa makes for a killer one), a burrito or as a side. With a little help, you can get them to taste just like a legit Mexican restaurant's. The trick is to get the right proportion of water to bean mix - go a little runny on the water, as they solidify while they're simmering and cooling. Along with this, all you need is a pinch of garlic powder, pepper and olive oil.<br /><br />For a Mexican food-loving vegetarian like myself, this product is a staple. High fiber, protein and flavor. I can make my own veggie burritos now that are just as good (almost anyway) as the taco shop.

review/summary: Super mild beans means you can spice it the way you like
review/text: I use dehydrated beans for both backpack camping and for my emergency rations (living in California, I think of it as preparation for the supposedly-overdue "Big One").  I've tried several vegi-beans and the reason I like these is because they're so mild, they can be spiced the way each person likes.  I used to buy spicy beans but it wasn't spicy enough for me, while others wanted them less salty/spicy.  Now I can take these beans and my super hot sauce and everybody's happy.

review/summary: AUTHENTIC MEXICAN RESTAURANT QUALITY
review/text: WOW! These refried beans and the black refried beans are sooooo good. I don't write many reviews, but with the quality of these beans, I just had to do so. Even better, they have only two ingredients: beans and salt!  That's just unheard of these days.  And, the salt content is just fine.  The instructions tell you to "season to taste," so I thought salt might have been needed.  But, I cooked them according to directions, and they need nothing else.  They're perfect.  Oh, and did I mention they are so easy and quick to make!!!  These are definitely replacing my canned beans!

review/summary: Too bitter, not even close to Starbucks store brewed cup
review/text: I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks house (and breakfast) blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither a like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brewer. But, for me, the house blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. Won't be buying this again, even if it was less expensive.<br /><br />For comparison, I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz). I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while (actually, the Tully's Kona isn't available on Keurig, either. But the Amazon price for that is so high!).<br /><br />(FYI - The Starbucks breakfast blend is ok, I guess. But it doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. So, to me, it's definitely not worth spending more on Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't like it as much as the Tully's above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

review/summary: LOVE the product, deducting one star for the high price
review/text: I cannot tell you how much i adore dried fruits, and mango slices are my absolute favorite. However, moving to the US from Ireland (where dried fruit is just that - naturally sweet and delicious) i found i was bitterly disappointed to discover that most of the widely available dried fruit here is heavily sugared and, in my opinion, completely ruined.<br /><br />I finally found these guys and they're a regular purchase for me at stores, but they are vastly over-priced here on Amazon. They've been hiked up to an excessive amount similar to the ridiculous pricing of such quality dried fruits in health food/vegan stores that aren't Trader Joe's, ie. aren't good for your tummy AND your wallet.<br /><br />It's sad that you can buy a near poisonous meal for a family for $10 at a 7eleven or Tedeschi, but the same amount of money at a health store or co-op like Harvest (my local grocery here in Boston) will barely get you a container of dried fruit or 3 decent bell peppers. How are people supposed to change their lifestyles and improve their health for themselves and their children if the good stuff isn't affordable and the ramen and pop tarts are .45cents? It sends the wrong message and is the absolute propagation of disease and obesity. We need more places who share the values and philosophy of Trader Joe's - customers first, accessible, unpretentious, understandable health education, feel-good food at a feel-good price. Thank you Trader Joe's!<br /><br />Rant over :)

review/summary: Perfect Small YUMMY Cake in a Bread Machine -- no leftovers!
review/text: We have my son and his girlfriend, roommate, and roommate's girlfriend over at least every couple of weeks for dinner and game-night activities -- and every one of these Dassant cake mixes (yes, we buy all of them) bakes a perfect, 6-piece cake.  Top with ice cream or some berries and whipped cream, and it's the easiest, fastest, freshest, still-warm-out-of-the-oven dessert you can imagine.<br /><br />And this one -- the vanilla pound cake -- gets the biggest "ooohs and ahhhs." Delicious!<br /><br />If you've got one of the terrific 2lb Zojirushi bread machines, you'll need to create your own CAKE program because the pre-set cake setting from the factory will mix the ingredients for far too long and change the chemistry (gluten) of the cake.  I'm not sure who programmed this for Zojirushi, but they screwed up.  Instead, create a custom program that mixes for 7 minutes, and bakes for 62 minutes, with a medium brown crust.  This custom setting will work for any of the Dassant cakes (also works for other cake/muffin mixes, and for cornbread.)<br /><br />just dump the cake mix, butter, water, and eggs into the pan, turn on your custom program, and walk away.  I usually start the machine as everybody is starting to eat dinner so we have time to eat, talk, start a game or a movie -- and then enjoy the wonderful vanilla pound cake smell coming from the kitchen.<br /><br />All the other flavors are wonderful, too.  The Vanilla Bean Cake makes a really light, fluffy cake, perfect for adding strawberries and whipped cream for strawberry short cake.  Our other favorites are the applesauce cake, and the pumpkin spice cake.  And the brownies are also very good....<br /><br />No nuts, no MSG, no preservatives, colorings, partially hydrogenated whatever, or any of that unpronounceable stuff in the "old grocery store" brands.<br /><br />Excellent product!
