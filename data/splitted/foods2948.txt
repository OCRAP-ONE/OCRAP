review/text: While the hot sauce smelled hot I never got to try it because the company that sent it out just threw it in a box and shipped it, No bubble wrap, no peanuts, not even those plastic balloons linked together just a bottle in a box. Needless to say the bottle broke in shipping and I never got to try it.

review/summary: Worth it : )!
review/text: My sweet dog is getting older, and her activity level was dropping off, as well as her gait seeming stiff.  Her vet advised a treat with supplements to help her joints.  I tried various brands, and discovered many sourced from China.  I found this brand at a PetSmart to try, and she loves them!  They are less at Amazon (thank you : )!).  My dog is back to her old self - chasing balls all over, and looks forward to these treats every day.  They are more expensive than those at most stores, yet I feel better knowing they are made here in the U.S. - she is a member of our family, and worth every penny : )!

review/text: These are really good coffee K-Cups.  The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is the price.  They are very expensive compared to other Kcups.  While they're very good, it's hard to justify me drinking these every single day when they cost so much more than other K-cups do.

review/text: When I was a wee-lass living in London one of my mum's favorite snacks was these. She taught me how to eat them by dunking them into milk tea for 2-3 seconds then eating them.. YUM!!<br /><br />Currently I live in California, I haven't eaten a lot of good British food/snacks in a while. When I was grocery shopping in a Chinese market I found these! I was profoundly ecstatic to find them. So for the first time in over ten years I've gotten to dunk these into tea again! Tasted just as I remembered it! Childhood.. Taste so good.<br /><br />If your from the USA, try going to ethnic markets/super stores. I found mine in a Chinese chain market called Ranch 99 based in California.

review/summary: Yum, they bring back memories.
review/text: When I was in college I used to buy these almost weekly in very small quantities from the bins where you purchase by weight.  I loved them.  I have been craving them for years.  Each Rum ball has a chocolate outside and inside there is a white sugar shell which when you bite it has rum flavored liquid inside.  From unprepared tasters I get lots of funny looks when they bite into them.  My daughter and I like them. My husband who is a chocolate connoisseur notes that they taste slightly like malt balls and that they do not have real alcohol.  I did find a store: Crossroads World Market in Palo Alto, CA that sell ones they say have real alcohol by weight.  They taste the same and I have not confirmed alcohol content.<br />The bag of candy arrived quickly.  There was some white marks on the candy from rubbing against each other but not too bad and they are fresh tasting.  I have had them over a month now and I am still eating 4-5 every day and savoring them.  I will try to not purchase 5 pounds more than once a year but I may not be able to resist. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  I wish they sold 1 or 2 lb bags with free shipping.

review/summary: Excellent strong chocolate flavors
review/text: This product is the real thing. It is not imitation chocolate flavor, it's got all the high and low notes of real chocolate beans. Some of those flavors are lost when the beans are processed and made into various products such as cocoa powder. If you want your recipes to have true chocolate flavors, this is the product you want to add. It takes very little because the flavor is highly concentrated. I used to use Torani chocolate syrup for my coffee, now I make my own for a fraction of the price. And, more flavors to boot!

review/summary: An Interesting New Discovery!
review/text: The last time I was in a nearby Fresh and Easy Market near where I live, I picked up a packet (1.41 ounces) of Sazon Goya Con Azafran, labeled as a unique seasoning. It was in the international food section near the Mexican foods. I've never seen it nor heard of it before and I had no idea what it was. The packet contained 8 smaller envelopes of a reddish powder flavor enhancer. The instructions were to add a packet to whatever you were cooking for four people. It said that the product would add more flavor and color to the food. Hmmm. That seemed strange. What flavor? To any food? The first-listed ingredient was monosodium glutamate, a well-known Asian food flavor enhancer, but the packet was not particularly high in sodium. Well, I just can't resist something like this. So, I was cooking up a few carrots along with some celery. I added a few bay leaves and some dill weed and one of the small packets of Sazon Goya. When they were done cooking I added a batch of prepared Split Pea Soup with ham. and heated up the entire batch. You know, that was the best split pea soup I can ever recall having. It had to be the Sazon Goya Con Azafran. Wonderful!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Genmai cha is green tea with rice, and has a smooth, almost nutty flavor. I find it to be a very satisfying tea, great for drinking all throughout the day. I really like this tea in particular. It has a lot of rice compared to other brands I have tried, close to a 1-1 ratio, so this would be a great tea if you prefer more of the rice flavor. This tea has quite a bit of dust, so I would suggest using a very fine-meshed filter if you can.

review/text: I love genmaicha and thought I would try this out because of the high ratings.  Boy was I disappointed to learn that my local Chinese market sells the same exact product for about 60% of the price!  I also spent hours going through the tea to take out the woody stems which seem to be a sadly significant part of what is inside the bag.  If you can't get genmaicha from anywhere else, this still makes good tea, but look around your local Asian market first for a better deal and possibly better quality.  Specialty websites for tea likely have better quality, but for a higher price - may be worth it.

When I saw all the great 5 star reviews for this tea and its a good price I decided to buy it... yuk!  Its full of steams and the green tea leaves are just awful.  The tea just did not taste right.

Not loose and broken like I imagined they could have been.  Compared to the small packets in the store these are like half price per cookie when you buy this large tin.  This is one large tin too.  This large size tin was bucks off from what it was last I looked so I was concerned they were old stock and inferior ( I ordered them the first week of December ) ; could be a year old from last year I thought.<br /><br />Nope, nope they are fresh and quite good.  I am picky so they are extra good.  The tin is BEAUTIFUL.  Elegant old time illustrations well executed, not chintzy.<br /><br />The cookies are heaven with a bit of your favorite jam or jelly on top with some tea or coffee in the morning.  Easy to eat this way because the cookies are only slightly sweet ( not icky sugary).<br /><br />I am so glad they are only slightly sweet.  Could not have been better.<br /><br />I am a happy boy.

But for those who are in it for the taste, gosh! I won't be without these yummy cookies. The best ever, will buy again after I finished the whole tin of 58.4 ounce of delicious goodness. I have a fast metabolism & I live in a cold climate so pure butter is no sweat... *eating this now actually*

review/text: I have to say these cookies were better than butter/sugar cookies I've made entirely from scratch.  They were easy to roll out and cut into xmas cookie shapes.  The texture of the finished cookie was excellent -- not too crispy, not too chewy.  The reason I say they were better than ones from scratch is they seemed to have more flavor.  This is probably due to some artificual or natural flavor that is added to the mix but, I have to admit, in this case it beats out the old fashioned cookies which had a more subtle flavor.  And yet the krusteaze cookies did not taste artifical at all -- I would have thought the were entirely homemade if I had not known.

review/text: I love that I can buy things like this on Amazon and ship them direct to my granddaughter (love Prime!).  My six year old granddaughter received an EasyBake oven for her birthday.  The easy bake prepacked foods taste terrible and are way over priced. I don't even want to think about the unhealthy chemicals in them.  Found these yummy mixes for her to bake her little heart out.  She is having fun baking.  Her family and friends can now enjoy what comes from that little oven.

review/summary: Nice for a quick sweet fix
review/text: I make large cookies, so I usually get about 18 cookies out of this bag.  We mix as directed, then add a pinch of salt, a few drops of vanilla, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  We bake them up in our toaster/convection oven in 8-9 minutes.  Yummy!  Not quite as good as my old t*ollhouse homemade, but quick, easy, and delicious.  Krusteaz mixes are excellent baking mixes.

And I'm an experienced hot sauce aficionado.<br /><br />It's hot enough to be powerul (use one drop at a time), yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking.  People who make hot wings at home, and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings...this is your sauce!<br /><br />Very, very good.

review/text: Flavor-doh is the most amazing product I have ever used! I learned about it through my vet. I was having a terrible time getting my pomeranian to take his meds. This is simply amazing! I use the handle of a spoon, scoop out a small portion and simply roll it in my hands with the meds. The meds end up rolled in a neat little ball! He absolutely loves taking his meds now! I was thrilled to find I could order this online,which is much less of a hassle and less expensive too! He loves the chicken. My vet ran out of it and I tried beef, no go. I have used this for several years. I used to dread pill time, now he looks forward to it! He actually sits by the kitchen island every morning waiting for his "treat"!!!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

review/summary: Nasty Pill Time Replaced by Special Treat Time!
review/text: My dog was once good about taking pills with a bit of peanut butter.  Now that he's on more meds, I've had to up the ante to get him to take the pills.  Cheese.  Hot dogs. Steak.  Most pills got spit out no matter the disguise.  (Of course, he eats the good part.)  The next tactic involved forcing his mouth open and shoving several pills.  Twice a day -- not a bit of fun.  My vet recommended trying flavor-doh.  Although I hate the smell of it on my hands (easily remedied by soap and water after the fact), "pill time" has become a pleasant ritual.  I'm convinced my dog watches the clock.  If I'm late with the "new treats" (pills disguised in flavor-doh), he reminds me.  Also, I feel better about using this low calorie carrier because my dog is less active now and doesn't need the higher calories of the previous pill disguises.

At the current time, it appears they may have changed how this appears on Amazon and their pricing.

review/text: I am a hot tea drinker; I love Earl Grey/English Breakfast teas. But it's summer. So I began a search for a lightly sweetened (no nasty faux sweeteners for me) and I found one: this Numi tea is very good. Just a touch of sugar to take the "nasty" edge off black tea, makes it great with food, too. Now if Amazon would just do a Prime eligible shipping deal, I wouldn't have to lug this from Gelsons. 40 calories in a 12 oz bottle; 9g Sugar; 10g Carbs.

review/summary: Not too bad before I saw the mold
review/text: I was so excited to get these because I thought it would be a great healthy snack to keep at my desk.  I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it.  I assumed it was a bad one in the batch.  I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives).  I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier.  The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy.  Apparently Amazon had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them.  Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.<br />I will not be ordering these again and will be wary of ordering other food products from Amazon.com.  They were great about refunding my money and I will continue to purchase from amazon, just not short shelf life food items.

review/summary: should be renamed "Fruity, Not-so-many Chocolate Chunk" cookies
review/text: I'm a veg who makes vegan baked goods and generally uses applesauce or banana as an egg substitute, so I'm no stranger to fruit in baking.  However, these cookies have an overwhelming fruity aroma, smell and taste, that I found hard to like and even swallow.  I'm guessing it might be the prune puree in the ingredients.  Oh and there were a disappointing number of chocolate chips in them - one cookie had two small chocolate chunks.  With no chocolate to compensate for the fruity aroma - 2 stars.<br /><br />However, I find these filling and better with a big cup of coffee.  So if you like fruitiness and want something filling for a breakfast on the go, this can be a good vegan breakfast item.

review/summary: non-vegan review of vegan product
review/text: I believe this is the first 'vegan' product I have ever knowingly tried - that is touted as vegan.  The title 'vegan' in anything rather tends to scare me (as in my ignorance I have nothing to compare vegan items to, coupled with a sincere love of dairy).<br /><br />However, Amazon dropped the price of these to a point where I could no longer deny my family trying them.<br /><br />Here is the best that I can do to describe the taste (and please, my vegan friends, do not have a stroke at the level of my simplicity - I mean no disrespect):<br /><br />They taste like cookie dough cookies not cooked.  If you like/enjoy cookie dough you should love these cookies.  My entire family does/did (past tense as the entire 12 cookies were WOLFED down by my cookie-dough loving crew).<br /><br />NOTE:  if taken from a FROZEN state (where we store all our Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies), they require only **20** seconds to totally heat up.  The non-vegan varieties we heat for 30 seconds and still have a cold-spot or two.  These TOTALLY heat through, for us, in 20 seconds and are unbelievably delicious.

review/summary: DEEEEEE-LICIOUS
review/text: I heard about these cookies many, many years ago from Weight Watchers meetings.  I used to eat them a lot, but had basically forgotten about them.  While running a search on Amazon, these popped up and, seeing they were vegan (I am now a vegetarian, attempting to eat vegan as much as possible), I had to try them.  They are every bit as magically delicious as their non-vegan counterparts that I ate many years ago.  I store them in the freezer, as recommended, and I pop them in the toaster oven on "toast" for about 5 minutes (microwaving them works, toasting is just better tasting if you have a few extra minutes - adds a bit of toasty crunch on the outer layer, while still leaving the cookie moist and chewy - exactly how I like them!).  At around 300 calories, they are very filling without going overboard, and full of healthy, natural ingredients.  If I am super hungry, I add a soy yogurt and an apple and I can go until dinner on this filling meal. I LOVE these cookies!

review/summary: Breakfast on the Go for oatmeal lovers.
review/text: You won't notice that it's Vegan.  It tastes good, and it's reasonably good for you.  We find that just keeping these in the freezer, then cutting the top of an individual package open and zapping it in the microwave for 25 seconds is the best way to handle storage and preparation.  Wash it down with a hot drink such as coffee or chai tea, and it's a pretty satisfying breakfast on the go.  My wife packs a two-pack of frozen veggie sausage and a small paper plate along with my lunch.  After I arrive at work, I supplement the coffee and cookie I had along the way with the sausage. (Morning Star Farms soy sausage tastes pretty much like traditional sausage to me, but it's less greasy, and can be zapped for 1 minute, 25 seconds on a paper plate by way of prep.)  I usually have old-fashioned V-8 or one of the veggie/fruit fusion versions as well.  Sometimes we switch it up and go with some of the better tasting turkey sausages -- surprisingly, Jimmy Dean has them.  My wife sticks to the cookie (there are lots of different flavors) and chai tea, then has the veggie sausage as a mid-morning snack with brown mustard.  She doesn't have the V-8 until mid-afternoon, after soup for lunch.  (My lunch is usually a 6-in. Subway or something relatively substantial.)<br /><br />I've lost weight slowly, which in my case is a good thing. Remember, these are 300 calorie cookies, so plan accordingly. I used to have a home-made breakfast sandwich every morning, and now do the sandwich only on occasion. I'm getting older, and don't need quite as many calories as I used to. In case anyone is curious, the breakfast sandwich consisted of two slices of whole grain bread, a slice of thin, pre-sliced ham (prefer Dap), and an Eggbeater omelet my wife makes. You spray olive oil to coat the insides of a microwaveable 2 C. (you can use a 4 C if you want the eggs spread out more) measuring cup, add about 300 ml. of Eggbeaters (I like their Southwestern-style), a T. or 2 T. of chunky salsa (we like Pace), and a couple of large pinches of your favorite pre-grated cheese (we like Sargento's light 3 cheese or "Mexican" cheese.) Cover and zap for about 4 minutes, or until fluffy and done.  Slap it between the bread with the ham, and away you go. Hungry guys can add one or two whole eggs to the whole thing, as it just takes longer to zap, say 6 to 6.30 minutes.

review/summary: Delicious filling, quality breakfast
review/text: *First I want to point out that the actual product I purchase lists whole rolled oats on the package as the first ingredient, not the second as is listed on the Amazon website.  Check out [...] to read the actual ingredients fresh from the baker.*<br /><br />I work in a facility that stocks these in their employee cafe, where I pay $2 a pop for each - it is well-worth it!  As an on-the-go mom and employee, I often don't get to eat breakfast at all, let alone sit down to enjoy it.  What I love best about these cookies is that they are made with quality ingredients, yet there are flavor options.  That seems so rare these days!<br /><br />I'm a major chocoholic, so I reach for the only chocolate flavor my work stocks: this vegan chocolate chunk.  As another reviewer pointed out - these chocolate chunks aren't plentiful, but they are big.  I like the fruity flavor, so then its a treat when I bite into a bite of chocolate.  I detect a hint of banana when I eat mine, but definitely not overpowering or even obvious unless you are trying to pinpoint the flavor.  I think they are sufficiently moist, not crumbly, and filled with flavor.<br /><br />The sticker shock of 300 calories and 54g of carbs initially took me by surprise, despite how big these are and the whole oats as the first ingredient.  The cafe employee assured me these were a "whole meal in a cookie" but I was still skeptical until I ate one.  The first one I had... I ate less than half around 10am, and then finished it as a dessert after lunch (1pm).  I was beyond satisfied, and FULL!  Then I started eating them for breakfast and I am just amazed.  It usually takes me about an hour or more to get through one (and I'm normally a mindless eater - just shovel in the fuel) but not with these.  They fill me up after just a few bites, so I'm able to slow down my eating.  If I eat the cookie by 9am I am full until lunchtime (or beyond).  In fact, on my long 12-hour days, I am able to push my lunch hour back by 2 hours so I can enjoy dinner with my family instead of out of a take-out container.  I just couldn't ask for a better option - to keep me full, be good-for-me, and be convenient.  In fact, I'm ordering regular ones for myself and the minis for my 4-year old.  What a FANTASTIC treat to help our mornings!!!  (And since they are cookies, she'll think they are an incentive to move along faster LOL).

I love that this is Vegan (unlike the other Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies) and the chocolate chunks are (few but) yummy.  The cookie really sticks with you throughout the day.  However, it is a little dry.  I highly recommend the Oatmeal Raisin.  I could eat those all day.

review/summary: Tastes really great
review/text: These do really taste great without having to toast them if you want a healthy snack any time of day. I got them because they were identified as vegan. Two disappointments regarding these:<br /><br />1. The packaging indicates that the product is made in a facility that processes milk, tree nuts, etc. So I'm not sure they should be classifying the product as vegan if there are possibly traces of milk in the product. But it won't stop me from finishing what I've bought.<br /><br />2. When you get the 12 pack, it does have a note suggesting that they be stored in the freezer to maintain freshness and then just pop them in a standard toaster when you want one. I will have to wait a week or so to do this with those I've not eaten as I had just gone shopping the day before getting the product and my freezer was full.<br /><br />Hope this information is helpful to others.

I have one almost every morning before work with some fresh fruit. You have to put them in the freezer when you receive them in the mail. They send you instructions telling you to do so. So all the people who keep posting about their cookies being moldy evidently can't read. We just stick them in the toaster on defrost and they come out delicious. The Chocolate Chunk is our favorite flavor so far, although I haven't had a bad one yet!

review/summary: Delicious Treat
review/text: I really like how these aren't factory made breakfast bars.  They actually expire which I think says a lot about the nutritional quality.  On the package itself it suggests to freeze the cookies to make them last longer.  I did this and was able to pull a couple down into the fridge whenever I needed to.  I even took a frozen one with me when I went out in the morning on errands and by the time I needed it, it was defrosted and ready to eat.  It has kind of a dense texture that goes better with a coffee or tea, but is fine by itself too.  I usually used them for an on-the-go thing, but especially delicious was warming it up in the toaster oven.  It really felt more like a desserty treat then.  I think the calorie count might be kind of high on this, but for me the ingredients and purpose outweighed that con.  The best thing about this item by far, was the fact that it FILLED ME UP.  I usually have to eat a big bagel to feel full in the morning...but I could grab this and an apple or banana and be good.  They have a lot of different varieties of flavors to explore.

To me this is not a vegan option and I'm disappointed that I ordered based on everyone's review that they were vegan.  They taste good to me, but I will not reorder and am disappointed the reviews led me in the wrong direction.<br /><br />So, I give a low review because I hope it will cause others to read the review and know this item is not vegan, as suggested and as searched.  Otherwise, if you are not vegan they taste good and I would have been happy.

review/summary: Little bites of bliss!
review/text: After moving to the East Coast many years ago, I was thrilled (and shocked!) to find my favorite chocolates at Walmart, of all places! They carried them for almost a year, with me (and my family, once they snuck enough to get hooked on them as well!) dutifully purchasing a box here & there as I rewarded myself for a job well done.. Childbirth- one box. Purchasing a new home- one box... eventually it came down to 'Spring break's over and the kids will finally stop pestering you for a chocolate!'- one box.<br />Walmart, alas, has finally taken them off the shelves, so when I get that craving again, I must order them from Amazon.com. Good to know I can still get them, once my stash of clearance truffles is gone (my kids saw the boxes and their eyes glazed over happily- I've gotta find a better hiding place!).

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I ordered this tea based off the other two reviews which had made it seem like a pleasant green tea with cherry notes - this was not, however, the tea which I received. I'm not quite sure what ingredient used in this blend gave it such an overwhelming, almost chemical, cherry flavor but nothing about it was good. Aside from being able to see that there were other ingredients in this blend, I would've assumed it was exclusively synthetic cherry flavoring. I love green teas, I even love to steep my teas for extended periods of time and never worry about straining the loose leaf ingredients, maybe these were faults of mine that made this tea so horrible but I tried over and over to brew it and even mix it with other teas I have to make it tolerable. The best result I got was taking a small pinch of this tea and adding it to a full glass of another to achieve a flavor akin to a Lysol disinfectant spray.

review/text: compared to the usual white bread bun you might not choose this but if you are diabetic or a low carber it is a no brainer. these buns make it possible for us to have a real hamburger and not raise our blood sugar unduely. One thing though, it is better to refrigerate the buns and microwave a few seconds to warm it and not do the usual bbq or toast warming. I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry. The ingredients are different and so the warming needed is different. Done this way they do not come out dry and cardboardy. and using more condiments helps also. So I give them a high rating even though the shipping makes them expensive and thus it is worth it for our health.
