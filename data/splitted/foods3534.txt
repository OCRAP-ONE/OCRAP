review/summary: Excellent snack bars
review/text: I bought these for my husband who is a recently diagnosed diabetic.  Right now he is counting his carbs and managing his blood sugar this way.  These are the perfect numbers he needs for a mid-morning snack and sometimes for a mid-afternoon snack -- the numbers for carbs and fiber need to be balanced.<br /><br />I like them because they taste good.  They are better than candy bars and better than most snack bars.

review/summary: Like a candy bar that's good for you...
review/text: Let me start by saying that all of these fiber bars that actually taste good aren't the absolute greatest source of fiber because they have chocolate and nuts so they have some saturated fat. I have tried the FiberOne and the Kellogs fiber bars and I have to say that as far as eating something that will satisfy your chocolate craving (but has a significant amount of fiber) the Kellogs fiber bars taste much better.  The dark chocolate almond satisfies my chocolate cravings better than any US candy bar.  I'm giving the bars four stars bc they do have a tad bit of saturated fat, though not as much as a regular chocolate candy bar.<br /><br />As an aside, if you want to get your daily fiber quickly, buy acacia fiber powder and mix it into some yogurt. Two level tables spoons of acacia fiber gives you 50% of your daily fiber (10g). Heather's Tummy fiber is the best brand and Amazon sells it. Also, acacia fiber does not create gas, bloating, or diarrhea.

review/summary: Great taste and texture - and high fiber!
review/text: Although a number of reviewers have expressed concern about gas and bloating, I have not had any problems with these bars - yet. I eat beans and high fiber cereal regularly, and I put inulin supplement powder in my coffee, tea or yogurt when I think to do so.  It doesn't surprise me that these bars can cause gastric upset because I have experienced mild symptoms with the inulin powder put out by Metamucil under the name FiberSure - but not the embarrassing flatulence that some people speak of with these bars.  The key fiber ingredient in the bars is inulin from chicory root.<br />The dark chocolate almond flavor is excellent and there is no aftertaste or weird texture to the bars.  I bought a few boxes at BigLots for $2 and I hope to buy some more, but if not, with Subscribe and Save, a box of five bars costs $2.38.<br />The ingredients may not be entirely organic or wholesome, but the sugar and fat content compare very favorably with other bars.  I would recommend that you add a high protein food such as nuts, peanut butter or Greek yogurt to create a more balanced "meal" or snack since the bars do not contain a significant amount of protein.  Of course, you should add fruits or vegetables to make a more complete meal.<br /><br />Happy Snacking!

review/summary: Got Gas?
review/text: These are great additions to my already high-fiber diet. For people who express a problem with flatulence (literally), try taking the recommended number of Beano tablets before eating a high-fiber bar; doing that has greatly reduced or totally eliminated any social embarrassment. These bars taste so wonderful that you will have a difficult time not eating several at once -- or at least you will until your first direct encounter with the results. For those taking medications that create constipation as a side-effect, these bars keep the digestive system working smoothly.

review/summary: Not a huge health nut
review/text: I love these, I was always disappointed in myself for not being able to top my boyfriend in farting contests, but with these bars, I think I'm winning. They do warn you on the box (it's yellow enclosed caption) says "NEW USERS: Increase your fiber intake gradually. Gastrointestinal discomfort may occur until your body adjusts." Anyways, these bars taste very good, they are quite sweet so I eat a bar a day with some water or green tea. If you've ever tried to just eat the FiberOne bran cereal, then you know what I mean when I say this might not be a healthier alternative, but it's something you'll probably be able to stick to. Bran cereal is like eating cardboard to me. I found that eating them at night helps me not give off so much gas during the day. The days I go to college and sit in a classroom for 3 hours, well, just eat them at night. I bought them at my local wal-mart for $2.50 a box (5-count). They will make you feel fuller longer too. Also Fiber Advance gummies at wal-mart are good too, they taste like gummy bears (will make you gassy as well), they are $10.00 for 90 gummies, in the fiber supplement section. I understand that these bars have 2.5g of saturated fat, it is to be expected since it has chocolate and almonds. Also BHT needs to be studied more, there are mixed opinions on the additive, nothing is actually solid yet. A lot of opinions also suggest that BHT might be beneficial, so it's all up in the air at this point. FDA considers it to still be safe. These bars are not for health nuts, rather people who are just trying to get their daily dose of fiber, added antioxidants doesn't hurt either.

review/summary: Soooo good, good way to save money too...
review/text: So I orignally thought uh, bad granola bars but I tried one because my parents are health nuts. OMG it doesn't even taste healthy which is a good thing! LOL! It has a lot of fiber which I have noticed a difference in myself, which is very good. Plus I save money rather than spending $.89 - $1.25 on snacks in the vending machines at work. IN 1 MONTH I'd spend $20 - $30, in two months on average $55.00. With the economy I'm looking to save as much as I can! If your a busy person like I am what your getting here it's abt $.58 a bar and your getting a 2 month supply. If your not sure go to your grocery store and get 1 box to try it out. PS ALL the Fiber Plus bars are good not just the antioxidants ones, try the strawberry almonds ones, yummo

I saw this for the first time on amazon when they had the gold box deal but was unsure whether to buy it or not since I've never tried them. Just to clarify for people, one 6.3 oz box contains 5 bars. I believe amazon sells 12 boxes so its 5 times 12 which is 60 bars. I'm disappointed that I didn't get the gold box deal because these bars taste really good and i will be returning for more.

review/summary: Better than Fiber One bars, better than any high fiber treat out there!
review/text: So if you want a candy bar, but want to eat well, grab one of these and prepare to be impressed!  These really do taste just like a candy bar, such a healthier alternative to a grocery store candy.  I eat one of these after lunch as a treat to provide a fix for my sweet tooth.  I find it is less gas inducing if I treat it like dessert and eat it after a meal.  I do get a bit of bloating if I eat it on an empty tummy.  A friend of mine who turned me onto these says the gassiness goes away once you are used to eating more fiber in your diet.  I have started increasing my fiber with more fresh produce, so I anticipate better digestion of all things in a few weeks.  I highly recommend these!<br /><br />NOTE: I would like to add that if you normally eat candy bars, cookies or pastries and switch to eating one these instead -- that is a great choice.  However, I am not saying to choose one of these over a piece of fruit which is clearly better for you.  These are healthier "junk food" that provide a nice shot of fiber and less sugar than most temptations out there.

review/text: First of all there is no HFCS in these.  Second of all these taste absolutely FANTASTIC!  Frankly, I love dark chocolate and that they use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate (although that version is also available) rocks my world.  They've recently come out with a new flavor with Peanut Butter which I also highly recommend and would give 5 stars.  I often eat these either first thing in the morning before I go to yoga so as to have  a little something in my stomach but not too much to make me feel sick while working out or I'll grab one in the afternoon for a pick-me-up snack and it always hits the spot.  Can't recommend enough.  I even will stop to tell other women in the granola bar aisle how much my family loves this brand of granola bars!

On that same topic, you HAVE to nibble at them slowly, or all that fiber will land in your tummy like a canon ball. They are not overly sweet, and there really is a very strong chocolate flavor, unlike some of the other chocolate snacks out there. They make a very filling low cal snack.

review/text: First of all, let me say these bars are great tasting. However, I can't get around the fact that if you eat just one, you are at risk of having exceptional bloating/gas that would probably make most people want to take a day off from work.<br /><br />I've tried these, a couple different times and had the same results... bad stomach cramps and gas. My girlfriend has tried these too and had the same problem.<br /><br />My advice is, if you're going to try these, try one bar first on a day you don't have much going on, so in case you do have terrible stomach cramping it's not on a big day. If you try them and they don't have any effect, great, cause these are very tasty, but now you've been warned of what you may expect.

review/text: This product is falsely advertised by Kellogg's as some kind of "Healthy Snack", using words like "Antioxidants" and "35% Fiber" on the packaging.<br /><br />After reading the ingredients, you will realize it is nothing other than POISON!! It contains several kinds of Hydrogenated Oils, Artificial Flavors, Colors, Polysorbates and other questionable ingredients.  Tell Kellogg's "NO THANKS" by boycotting its poison!<br /><br />I threw this product in the trash bin after getting it from a vending machine.

review/text: I have never tried packaged food before, but I decided to give it a try because I hate frozen food, but I like having food around that is ready to eat.  I was amazed at the quality of the food, its freshness and taste. I now find myself regularly fixing these little packets for dinner.  I even served it to guests last week, and they thought it was from a restaurant.  The instructions say to boil the packet itself, but I like to take out the contents and put it in a pan and heat it that way.  Then the house smells like I just cooked a homemade meal!

review/text: I really love Indian food but sometimes I just feel like staying at home to eat it.  I have tried several other companies who make Indian packaged food but nothing takes like Sanskriti.  Its easy to make and it tastes just like home cooking.  I highly recommend Sanskriti Indian food.

review/text: I tried other products in this brand and other brands as well.<br />i gotta say, the taste for sanskriti is leaps beyond the market. What i perticularly liked about this was the paneer (cottege cheese) pieces are large, whole, and soft. Most Ready meals have re-fried, crumbled, stale paneer, but none of that here.<br /><br />Sanskriti seems to have the science down, hands down best palak paneer i have had... second to my mom's cooking of course.

review/summary: Not too Spicy - Hurray!
review/text: I love palak paneer but it's so hard to find a pre-made one that doesn't taste like green, soupy fire to me.<br /><br />This one is seasoned just right.  It's spiced just to that edge of unacceptability for people like me who enjoy some flavor without spicy heat going into overdrive.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to say this is anything like fresh, home-made-by-grandma stuff.  There is hardly any paneer in it, but that typical with these kinds of products.  It's a drag and I wish companies would take a pretty good product and make it exceptional by such simple improvements.  I for one would purchase such products much more frequently if they weren't cheaping out on these points; but whatever.<br /><br />This product, being basically a thick spiced spinach sauce, I think is best used as a topping for something else, such as rice.  I also tried it as an additive to soup, which was good (a mixed-bean soup).  It definitely has a distinctive taste, which you have to take into consideration when thinking of what you might pair it up with.  I think you could also just thin it a bit and eat it as a soup by itself or with some additional paneer etc. tossed in.<br /><br />I would buy this product again occasionally, not often, because as I said, it's a little cheaped out on the paneer.  If it had more paneer, then I would buy this product very frequently.

review/summary: OK For Shelf Stable, But Not Great
review/text: This is a shelf-stable palak paneer that you just rip open the foil pouch and microwave or warm on a stove-top.  My case of six came with a "best use by" date in less than a month, but I doubt that would make any difference.  It is OK - it has a decent amount of spinach, the paneer (cheese cubes) are not too soft or too rubbery, but it is a little oily (which may be because it's manufactured and then able to sit in a pouch on a shelf for a couple years).  There is no comparison to fresh made or even the varieties sold in retail freezer sections.  It's not bad, just not great.  3 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Visually daunting. Not as tasty as Trader Joe's frozen Palak Paneer
review/text: I have become addicted to Trader Joe's Palak Paneer, which is stocked in their frozen section in individual (for me) portions. The cheese is very firm and the spinach is creamed with wonderful Indian spices and just enough of a kick for me. However, I can't get to TJ's all the time, and when I do I usually stock up and my freezer space gets quite cramped. I was thinking that it would be a lot easier if I found a palak paneer that didn't require freezing. The reviews on this were very good so I bought a pack of six. Man. The difference between frozen spinach (green) and this stuff (muddy brown baby poop color) is quite marked. It is not like you would try to serve this to a friend if they stopped by. Or your teenagers.<br /><br />But I wanted to like this so I closed my eyes and tried to keep an open mind. For me, the cheese is not as nice and the spices in the thin spinach gravy juice are not right. It is not awful to me, but it certainly won't take the place of Trader Joe's in my heart.

review/summary: This soup is surprisingly excellent.
review/text: I bought a pack of this in the local grocery store for kicks.  When I made it, I was expecting it to be a very thin, watery soup like Lipton cup of soup or something, so I only used 7 cups of water, when it calls for 8.  This soup was surpisingly hearty and delicious.  Next time I make it, I will follow the instructions, and it will still be a hearty, delicious soup.  With 7 cups of water, it was really good, but almost too spicey.  One of these packs, is easily enough to feed four average sized men without skimping.  I had two big bowls, and then put the rest in the fridge, which is easily two more bowls of hearty soup(not just broth).<br /><br />I was very surprised.  This stuff is WAY better than ANY canned soup I have ever had in my entire life. Whether it be WolfGang puck, progressive, cambell's thick and chunky, etc.<br /><br />The bag I got, was good until 2013, but I know dried goods last for a LOOONG time, because once you get the moisture content down below 10%, bacteria, and viruses can't grow.<br /><br />This brings me to another note.  This would be a very good thing to have around, just for emergency supplies. It is light, and is easy to pack.  You just add water, and boil for 15 minutes. Just buy this instead of canned soup, and you won't regret it, and at the same time, you will be providing emergency supplies.<br /><br />You will always have plenty of good soup to eat if you want a bowl.  Plus, it uses a lot less packaging, and materials than canned soup.<br /><br />I recommend this on taste, amount to feed 4 people comfortably, convenience, and smarts.

If it turns out to be cardboard-ish tasting I'll downgrade my review.

review/summary: Great Home Made Flavor...
review/text: I buy a lot of Bear Creek soup mixes.  Although I work from home and enjoy cooking, especially soups and stews, I often relent to a mix.  Not necessarily for it is easier and faster, but sometimes I simply enjoy a taste other than by my own hand.  Bear Creek (BC) mixes are in my opinion the best of all the mixes I have tried.  (My favorite is the Bear Creek veggie beef).  The stock in all the BC mixes are the very richest that I have ever used.  They certainly don't skimp on the spices, nor the veggies and other ingredients included.  The minestrone is no exception.  It is a fine rich and flavorful soup that one will look forward to both making, and enjoying on a cold winter day.  Especially with a good hunk of crusty bread. (I prefer making mine in a crock pot.  A slower simmer seems to give it added flavor).  As with all the BC mixes, they all accept well your own personal additions to what is already included in the pouch.  I have added extra tomatoes, (stewed is best) extra onions, a little more garlic, (I'm a graduate of the never too much garlic school), and extra beef stock as another reviewer here suggested.  Sometimes all at once, and other times just an extra all by itself.  The pre mixed stock is so rich and delicious that its almost impossible to ruin it.  Bear Creek mixes are available in most larger supermarkets, as well as of course here on Amazon as well.  Although I have never ordered this soup mix specifically from Amazon, I have ordered many others, as well a variety of other food stuffs, and have never had anything taste "cardboard" or otherwise.  My only recommendation to you if ordering this soup mix or any other on Amazon is to make it worth your while as to the shipping and order several at once.  Try all the Bear Creek mixes, especially the veggie beef.  I think you and your family will find them pleasingly lip smacking...

review/text: I always keep 2 packages of Bear Creek soup in my cupboard in the colder months. They make a nice variety, and I<br />usually have one package of Bear Creek Country Kitchens Minestrone Soup, and one of Potato or Broccoli. It doesn't matter<br />which you choose, go for your favorite, they are all very good. I always hated to pull out a can of soup for a meal, feeling that it<br />was just not tasty enough to serve as a meal unless it was one of those emergency meals. Bear Creek soups are so good, that I plan<br />to use them, make a bit of cornbread or get a nice crusty loaf of Italian bread and some cheese and fruit, and you get a good meal.<br />Don't hesitate to give these a try.

review/summary: Yummy vanilla flavor!  Plus decaf!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this rich flavorful tea. Some vanilla teas are thin and sickly in flavor--not this one! Celestial Seasoning has managed to make a sweet--not cloying--rich tea mixture that brews up to a fragrant, comforting and enjoyable cup of tea--I add cream to round out the flavor.<br /><br />Rooibos is the base for this tea. It is a healthy alternative to black teas because it is naturally caffeine-free and loaded with antioxidants--as much as green tea. You can brew this tea for a long time and it will not get bitter because there are no tannins.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

review/text: I first tried this tea as a free trial packet in a box of chamomile. (The Madagascar Red box never quite attracted me in the grocery store, as I assumed the red box meant it had a spicy or tart taste). This tea has a rich warm vanilla flavor, and it is not acidic (great alternative to black teas for those with sensitive stomachs - like me).<br /><br />2 months ago I started making entire pots of the tea, and our kids (ages 6 and 9) were immediately attracted to the scent.  They asked for cups, and have since become regular tea drinkers - specifically for this tea.<br /><br />Of course, just as our family fell in love with the tea, our local grocery store stopped carrying it.  So glad to see it on Amazon - and at a better price than the grocery store charged.

review/text: South African Red Rooibos tea, like all "red teas" isn't really a tea at all, but is made from a tealike shrub.<br /><br />Never mind the technical aspects of tea cultivation . . .<br /><br />I bought this tea on a lark---I liked the easygoing look of the teacup-holding lion on the box. Not really the best grounds for picking a tea, but in this case it worked.<br /><br />When steeped, the tea takes on a distinctive reddishness, with hints of fruitiness underlying a definite but undemanding soft vanilla flavor against tongue and palate, which is a perfect relaxant, especially when you ensconce yourself in a comfortable chair before the fireplace at the end of a workday (a light misty rainfall is optional for mood), and sip contentedly while reading your latest Amazon.com selection.

review/text: Celestial Seasons African Tea, Madagascar Vanilla Red, caffeine-free Rooibos -- my favorite just-before-bed hot tea.  I love coffee, and I love tea (Isn't God gracious with His gifts to us?), but I cannot tolerate any caffeine after 5PM.  Caffeine keeps me awake for hours in even trace amounts.  This wonderful tea has none!  And I love the taste of Rooibos and other African teas.  The stores in my area have stopped carrying this brand and blend, so I resorted to Amazon.com as a source of supply.  If you like it -- and I do -- then buying by the small case (6 boxes) is not a major investment.  Hope this review helps you out, tea lover.

review/summary: My Favorite!!
review/text: I drink a lot of tea both iced and hot.  Next to my regular standby black tea as a hot drink, this tea is my favorite.  The flavor is great.  Considering it is not an expensive tea, it has a very rich, soothing taste.  I was recently in the store where I originally purchased it and they no longer carried it.  I also checked a couple of other stores who said they did not carry it.  Recently while shopping in a store I had not shopped in before I spotted it on the shelf and bought three boxes.  All hope is not lost though, at least it can be ordered through Amazon.com or the Celestial Seasonings website.  If you are a tea drinker who loves rich vanilla flavor, this tea is for you!  If you want a sweet treat without a lot of calories and no caffeine this is a great choice.  I hope this flavor is never discontinued -- tea drinking would never be the same!

review/summary: One of my favorite teas.
review/text: Celestial Seasonings makes some delicious teas, but out of their offerings this is one of my favorites.  Rooibos typically has a rich, almost nutty flavor and a beautiful red color.  The Madagascar Vanilla Red pack adds just a hint of sweetness and a light, natural vanilla flavor.  Rooibos is also a naturally decaffeinated tea, so this tea can be enjoyed at any time of the day including with dinner or right before bed.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings teas come packaged in a waxy paper bag.  In my experience the packaging protects the tea, keeping it fresh for weeks.  My only real complaint is the lack of a string.  I know why they do it--the lack of a string eliminates a lot of waste products every year.  I still prefer my tea to have a string so I don't have to carry a spoon or use my fingers to fish around my drink for the teabag.

review/summary: Wonderful tea, clearly not fresh
review/text: I've bought this at my local grocer for some time and love it so I was happy to see it here. However, what I got here was stale and required 2 bags instead of 1 for the same cup of hot water. The teabags seem really stale. I would not recommend buying this tea here, especially since it ends up costing alot more (if you have to use twice as much tea). Plus you can't return it.

review/summary: DELICIOUS & NO CAFFEINE
review/text: For anyone who hasn't tried this tea, you really need to because it's just not like anything that's out there.  If you want a taste you won't get tired of, can have at night (it's a tea leaf which is naturally without caffeine) this one is for you.  Because the vanilla is a natural vanilla & vanilla bean it doesn't taste artificial.  Also, it goes great alone or with just about anything because it's not going to knock your socks off like Lemon Zinger, peppermint or any of the herbal teas.  The taste doesn't interfere with what you're eating.  Why it's so hard to find in local stores, I have no idea but so far, everyone that has come to my home and tasted it is hooked for life.....even their husbands.  I would advise you to really let it steep as it is not a very strong tea.  I like it with a LITTLE milk & sugar but alone is great also because it's not bitter.  Especially if you don't care for herbal teas, this is the one for you.

review/summary: New to tea
review/text: My girlfriend and I are on a recent tea craze that happened when we went to FiveBucks before a movie. She ordered a Vanilla Rooibos tea without sugar. We were instantly shocked at how sweet it was by nature. A week later, I decided to buy her the Celestial Seasonings version after reading the rave reviews on here. I must say, she is VERY happy with the taste and so are about 10 of my co-workers who keep coming into my office and begging for a bag. I have noticed you cannot really over-steep it but then again, we are new to tea in general.

review/summary: VANILLA! finally...
review/text: It is so very difficult to find a tea that actually tastes of vanilla. This one is amazing - totally unexpected from Celestial Seasonings. I tried another Vanilla Rooibos fom Stash and this one is a hundred times better. It's very creamy and the flavor is pretty potent while still being soothing and mellow. I love it. I sweeten it with a half a pack of stevia and it's better than dessert!

review/text: I originally bought a box on clearance at the local drugstore. So glad I did!<br /><br />It's a nice mellow tea, lightly fragrant with vanilla. I leave the teabag in as long as I can for the robust flavor.  Not citrusy, so I can add milk. It's perfect for the fall/winter season. And I like getting the antioxidants as well.<br /><br />Don't know why it's not in the stores anymore (at least not here on the west coast), but I'm happy to have found it here on amazon, it actually works out cheaper with a subscription than if I did buy it in the stores anyway.

review/text: I like to keep my pantry stocked with these delicious non-caffeinated Celestial Seasonings teas.  This flavor is my all time favorite! The red tea has a bold, exotic flavor and the vanilla has a natural, fragrant taste. I sometimes add a tiny drop of my pure vanilla extract just to accentuate the vanilla flavor a bit more.  This particular tea does not need any additional sweetening, however, a bit of sweetness definitely cranks up the intensity of the great flavors.  I highly recommend this tea for vanilla lovers!

review/summary: a staple in my cabinet
review/text: I've been brewing this awesome tea for several years. Rooibos, unlike traditional "tea" that is derived from Camellia sinensis, comes from an African bush. Rooibos is translated "red bush." When processed, the needle-like leaves turn reddish-brown in color and take on a distinct earthy flavor. Unlike green, white and black teas, rooibos is naturally decaffeinated and packed with antioxidants -- and delicious. I brew six bags of Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red in a large tea pot. When cool, I pour into a half-gallon jug, adding water and vanilla stevia for calorie-free (and safe!) sweetness. Guests have often commented on how delicious this recipe is. My family enjoys this beverage daily.

review/text: A quite mild tea with an initial vanilla flavor that enhances the roibos body.  I need caffeine free and this- as I understand it- never had any caffeine to begin with, so no processing to remove caffeine. Also thru Amazon it is one of the least expensive roibos teas I have found. Six boxes to an order doesn't quite make 6 months for me ,but it is very easy to have Amazon advance my next shipment so that I am never without.  Very convenient!

review/text: I love this tea and it's difficult to find in stores now. They seem to rotate the flavors regularly and I haven't seen this one in over a year.<br />One reviewer said it smelled like tobacco, and that's exactly what I think of when I smell the tea bags. It reminds me of the flavored pipe tobaccos my dad used to use. However, it doesn't smell like that once brewed and it isn't super sweet, unless you sweeten it yourself.<br />I tend to mix and match teas, and often pair this with chamomile tea. I use a little honey and I have a little moment of tea heaven while I drink it.

My husband and 8 year old daughter drink this tea with me and none of us add sweetener. It's also good as an iced tea. However no matter if you're making it hot or cold, I will say this, if brewed too long it does develop a bitter taste. This tea goes for around $4.00 in most grocery stores for a single box. It is a great deal on Amazon, espcially if your total order is big enough to take advantage of the Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />- A. Peters

review/text: I bought this based on it's many good reviews since I've tried and enjoyed many rooibos teas. To my dismay, other reviewers tastes and mine do _not_ agree. I found this tea to be almost tastless, no real vanilla flavor that I can discern. I even tried using two bags and it didn't help.Adding milk and sugar just made for a mug of sweet-tasting slightly tea-flavored hot water...quite unappealing. Like another reviewer, I also noticed the slight "good tobacco" odor when I opened the box, very weird for a tea.

I can't believe that I've actually found a tea that I like and that won't wire me up.  I can drink it morning, noon and night.  I have a lot of food allergies and this tea doesn't bother me at all.  I'm so thankful that Celestial Seasonings has produced this tea.

review/text: I have to say that I bought this box of tea while on drastic sale at a discount warehouse. I paid like 70 cents for the box. I figured if I didn't like it, I would just toss it since I paid so little.<br /><br />I was needing something to replace the chai tea that Lipton used to make that I can no longer find in the store.<br /><br />So, I brewed up a up one night, added a bit of sugar and some half and half and about died.<br /><br />This is the BEST tea I've had in a long time. It was just sweet enough to not leave that "tea" taste in my mouth, but not so sweet that I was gagging. I love the scent of the hot tea when it's brewing. I love the scent of the tea bag. I love everything about this tea.<br /><br />I knew absolutely nothing about it before I purchased it, so it's nice to know it still has the same amount of antioxidents as green tea and that it's caffiene free. My daughter loves this tea much better than any others she's tried.<br /><br />As soon as possible, I intend to buy some more!

review/summary: Tasty alternative in decaffeinated teas
review/text: I am a tea lover, and have found rooibos, with the bonus of vanilla flavouring, to be a pleasing alternative to other decaffeinated products. Normally, unless one loves weak herb teas, decaffeinated tea has barely any flavour. The richness of rooibos is enjoyable, and the vanilla essence is a lovely combination.<br /><br />I would caution those who, like myself, prefer strong teas that rooibos is of very light strength. I found I needed to use two sachets per cup, and steep them for ten minutes, for the blend to be satisfying.

review/summary: Made me an avid tea drinker
review/text: I believe it was in Best Life magazine that I read about this tea, and about the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea. I picked up a box at Whole Foods and from my first whiff, I was in love. Although my wife is a regular drinker of Starbucks' chai tea latte, I've never been a big tea drinker. (My brief foray into peppermint and chamomille teas notwithstanding; I was young and I was following my father's lead.) Now I drink at least two cups a day of MVR, plus a Thermos-ful at work. At first I was drinking it with half-and-half and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMTJL4">Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar</a>, but I've cut out the half-and-half. I would prefer to have at least a little caffeine, but I guess I'll have to drink coffee or black tea for that. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZPO">Lipton Black Pearl</a> tea isn't too bad, and the pyramidal bag is nifty.)<br /><br />So count me an enthusiastic fan. I am a little surprised at the price here, though, considering that it's available at Target and Vons for less than $2 per box.

review/text: I love this tea.  It's not real strong, but it has a great flavor.  I don't like my tea really sweet and this one is mild enough it doesn't require sugar.

review/summary: Awesome tea !
review/text: If you are tired of the same old teas or prefer a mild tea with flavor, this is for you. This mild yet flavorful tea is a perfect alternative to Lipton with milk.  I love the vanilla flavor! Very Smooth tea!

review/summary: Wonderful tea
review/text: This is my new favorite tea!  Lovely smooth flavor, and the vanilla is not overwhelming -- it's just right.  Naturally caffeine free, no artificial anything, and a good source of antioxidants.  My 11-year-old son likes it a lot, too.

review/summary: I'm one of the few that don't care for this tea
review/text: After reading the review by "That Chatty Gal" I have to agree with her. I really wanted to like this tea. What's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice. Unfortunately for me, the tea smelled like tobacco (good tobacco if that matters!) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor. I also tried it with soymilk, honey, sugar, milk, and both cold and iced. Still, I was unable to even drink one cup because I just didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. I used about half of the box trying to make it work, but it didn't.<br /><br />On the other hand, my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate. As for me, I'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar.

review/summary: Not my cuppa tea at all - fruity earthy and sweet rolled together
review/text: I wanted to love this tea. The reviews here were so motivating. I was seeking a tea I could drink daily with no caffeine, that also would not upset my sensitive stomach. Rooibos sounded like the answer. However, I absolutely am repulsed by the smell (both out of the box and after tea is infused), as well as by the taste and after-taste. I wish I loved it - I love the benefits it is supposed to have for health - but I loathe drinking it. I tried it (1) straight and hot (2) with sugar (3) with sugar and milk. All were horrible. It tastes strangely fruity - but there is an earthy taste that I just can't place that rises up and fills your senses. The aftertaste is like an artificial fruity taste, maybe artificial vanilla. Oh my it is awful. The color is quite pretty - it looks like a cup of pumpkin pie when you add milk - but I just can't down this beverage. Maybe if you like herbals as a rule that are fruity - you will like this beverage. I on the other hand love the flavor of black or green teas. I tolerate the taste of chamomile and peppermint. But this is just too much to ask. No rooibos for me. Sorry!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Tried rooibos tea recently and loved it. Nearly drank my parents' entire supply while I was visiting over the holidays (sorry mom and dad)! So far locally this Madagascar Vanilla Red is the only rooibos tea I could find. Well I'm sorry to say I'll have to keep looking. I'm even sorrier I bought two boxes. Not only is there no rooibos taste, there is no vanilla taste, and in fact not much of a taste at all. Celestial Seasonings is my brand of choice, but they have disappointed here.
