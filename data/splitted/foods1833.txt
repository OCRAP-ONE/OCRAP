review/text: I haven't tried the spice honestly, because when I opened up the box, both jars were opened a little and leaking out in the box. Doesn't this stuff have a better seal? I don't even know if it's just a bad container or they don't normally have seals, but I'm uncomfortable using food products that don't come sealed.

review/text: The ingredients sounded so delicious but then I tried making it to match my mouth watering fantasies about how it SHOULD taste.........Yukkkkk!  The lentils are hard little rocks that do NOT even soften no matter how long the soup is simmered.  There really isn't any mushroom flavoring in the watery soup base.  I ended up throwing out the first pack I dained to make edible but I gave away the rest of the packs to the local food bank.  Do not buy this discusting soup unless you're going to add a gazillion things to it to make it have any taste at all but I wouldn't ruin all those other 'ingredients' by adding this soup to them. I have learned my lesson about this company and will NEVER buy any of their products again!!!  My stomach turns over just thinking about how AWFUL this soup is.

review/summary: Great packaging, authentic taste, fabulous customer service
review/text: Having used Torani syrups in the past to make Italian Soda, we were excited to try this Root Beer syrup from Amoretti. The shipping was fast and we love that the bottle had a sleek, attractive design that we wouldn't mind leaving out, but was also break resistant plastic. It's also great that Amoretti includes the pumps, so you don't have to purchase them separately.<br /><br />At first, we had some trouble getting the "soda" flavor just right, but the customer service at Amoretti is OUTSTANDING and they gave us tips, like first putting a little soda in the glass, then adding the syrup and stirring until dissolved, THEN adding the rest of the soda. This way, the flavor is well blended without losing the fizziness. Also, with the Amoretti syrups, they are more concentrated, so be sure you start with a bit less than what you might normally use. Lastly, we have discovered that different brands of Club Soda or carbonated water sometimes cause variation in the flavor. For example, we don't care for Canada Dry.<br /><br />This flavor is a more "authentic" natural type of root beer flavor than what most of us are used to drinking in processed soda. You get a lot of flavor without having to make the soda very sweet. So if you're used to sweet, it does take a little getting used to. But considering how much better this in terms of caloric intake and natural sugars instead of HFCS, it's worth the adjustment. I also look forward to trying this in warm drinks, such as tea, when the weather cools off in the Fall. And maybe even finding some creative ways to bake with it.<br /><br />If you are new to making seltzer or Italian Soda with syrups, try some fruit flavors first. The Amoretti Cherry and Watermelon flavors are AWESOME.

review/summary: Best New Cooking Concept of the Century
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V7J0L2">Tsp Spices Spice Basics Organic, 12 One-teaspoon Packets, 40 Ounce Boxed Tins</a><br />  Pre-measured spices in one-time use packages are an amazing invention. Why didn't I think of this?  At first, I assumed these beautifully designed tins filled with individually wrapped spices would simply make charming and unusual little gifts.  They certain do that.  What a clever guest you will seem when you come to the door bearing little spice boxes rather than the usual bottle of wine or tired bunch of flowers.  A plus for you is that by giving "tsp spices" you won't be spending nearly as much money as you would on flowers or wine.  You don't have to mention that to you're friends (I certainly hope you don't have the kind of friends who are gauche enough to inquire about price), but it won't matter to them because they'll be too busy marveling at the whole concept.  That's assuming, of course, your friends are smart enough to appreciate fully this new way of storing dried herbs and spices.  As I say, I initially thought of this simply as a good gift idea,  not a radical new concept for my own kitchen. Then I tied the pre-measured spices for myself and the next thing I knew I was eying my collection of glass bottles half full of fading powders and disintegrating leaves.  Most of them I never use because they've lost all their flavor, yet I don't throw out the bottles because it somehow seems so wasteful.  Then I realized, it was time to redefine my definition of waste. The better way to conserve precious resources is to have my kitchen stocked with flavorful spices and herbs that are packaged in quantities that I actually use.  Who came up with the idea of ounce-size bottles for dried spices anyway? Did you ever read a recipe that called for an ounce of dried oregano? When word gets out, I predict that "tsp spices" will bring about a revolution in the modern kitchen, much as the Cuisinart did in my mother's generation and the refrigerator did in my grandmother's. If you think I exaggerate, invite me to dinner and I'll bring along a nice little gift that may change your mind.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V7S5NQ">Tsp Spices Sweet Basics Organic, 12 One-teaspoon Packets, 25 Ounce Boxed Tins</a>

Eden Foods has been using BPA free cans since 1999. Natural Value told me their cans are BPA lined and they are considering a change in the future.<br /><br />The beans are good, firm and a bit too salty. I will not buy any Natural Value product because of the BPA issue. All their cans are BPA lined. I feel cheated by a company that chooses to market an ORGANIC product in a can with a BPA lining when other choices have been available for over 10 years.<br /><br />I'll buy Eden Foods canned products. All canned tomatoes are in BPA lined cans per government regulations. Freeze your own or buy in glass jars or cartons.

To reduce the salt somewhat be sure to rinse the beans in cold water and drain them. This also helps cut heartburn...sorry I don't have any suggestions for reducing the "tooters" though.

I'm sure draining the beans gets rid of a lot of the sodium, but I would recommend spending the extra 5 bucks or so and going with another organic brand.

These Natural Value beans are 1000 times better than regular canned black beans you buy at the store.

I can't wait to get back home so I can stop eating crappy black beans from the store.-<br />Organic farming practices are way better for the environment and the watershed, therefore even though these and all canned black beans taste, look and feel exactly the same either way, you know you aren't contributing to the huge dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico by supporting all the farms that spray chemicals all over their fields. SO buy up.

review/summary: A tastey inexpensive caviar
review/text: This item is permanently on my grocery list, because an inexpensive caviar is an invaluable component to a healthy diet.  Caviar is likely the best source of healthful Omega 3 fatty acids on the planet.  Animal experiments have shown that this is sufficient to offset the cholesterol.  A single serving of caviar will get you _half_ of your B12 for the day, and that is not all.  Think of it, dripping with DHA, and half your B12 in one heaping teaspoonful, without killing a single fish.  I have written an Amazon guide about this.<br /><br />I have additional notes about the ingredients in the customer image section where I provide a blowup of the ingredients label.  It is true that some of the inexpensive lumpfish caviars have alot of food coloring, and this one is no exception.  After a careful evaluation, Blue number 1 is among the safest of the food colorings.  It is eliminated relatively fast, and may actually have some healthful benefits.  This caviar has far more Blue number 1 than the other colorings.  It actually detracts from the taste somewhat, but for the price, I give it an A+.<br /><br />I have some additional information and research in my seafood wishlist, so check that out.  These inexpensive caviars tend to store better than the others, so you can keep some in the pantry.  Lumpfish eggs are delicious, so go ahead, eat your caviar... with a little cheese and pepper.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

I would recommend serving or using this caviar with things such as sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or some nicely selected crackers. I have even found a pretty good recipe for a tasty little appetizer using this type of caviar. I recommend it either looking for a good recipe or using extras to mask the extra fishy taste

It is a little saltier and fishier than your better quality caviar, and the eggs don't have that crunch/burst to them when you bite into it. Just a small pop, maybe even a squish? In short, not bad for your everyday use, just not good enough for any special occasion.

review/summary: Good caviar at a great price
review/text: I enjoy so much the caviar I get from the salad bar when I go to the Chart House Restaurant in Redondo Beach, Ca, that I asked what the name and brand of the caviar they used. I found it on Amazon.com and it is exactly the same.  Now I can also enjoy this caviar at home and at a great price. It is really good!

review/summary: Caviar for less money
review/text: I developed a real craving for some caviar a few weeks ago, after not having had any for a couple of years. I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her "fair share." I would buy this product from this vendor again, but I also plan to compare it with what others have to offer. I would be curious to hear what others have to say about where to get low cost high quality black caviar. Thanks!

review/summary: Doesn't taste good at all
review/text: I bought this thinking that it was inexpensive and it was worth giving it a try. The caviar doesn't taste good despite the relatively low price. It has the texture of little plastic balls and it looks as if they added some black food coloring to it. I regret the purchase.

review/text: Started feeding my two older dogs (12 and 13) this food. My lab has always had dry itchy skin. After a week on Avoderm he is shiny and not flaky at all! My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper! Higher quality food really does make a difference in the health of your pets...I wish I had started feeding them Avoderm sooner.

review/text: With Amazon Prime free shipping this food is a great deal. Much cheaper than in the pet store.<br /><br />My two dogs, both seniors, love this food. My small dog has a skin problem during the warmer months and this food has helped him to not be so itchy. My large dog has arthritis, for which he is taking a glucosamine chondritin MSM supplement and aspirin. When my large dog began eating this food, after a few weeks I saw an improvement in his movement. Not so stiff now and it's easier for him to jump.<br /><br />Recommended for people who have senior dogs with skin or arthritis problems.

review/summary: Gassy and loose stool after 1-2 weeks?
review/text: My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??

review/summary: New formulation is awful
review/text: I used to love these crackers, but they have recently reformulated them.  Now they're awful... like a Wheat Thin knockoff, but not even as good as Wheat Thins.  Why do they mess with something that works??  I complained to the company, and was told, "As you might imagine, we conduct extensive consumer tests to determine consumer acceptance before introducing a food into the national market. Reformulated products are of special concern to us, so we use panels of regular product users across the country to ensure acceptability. Tests on this reformulated product showed that most consumers preferred the new product to the old. However, we realize that taste preferences do differ and can certainly understand your feelings."<br /><br />Yeah, I am sure that Coca-Cola conducted extensive consumer tests of New Coke, too.<br /><br />Look, you might like this cracker.  But if you liked the previous formulation, don't expect anything at all similar.  And if you don't like it, please complain to the company.  Maybe they'll bring out a 7-grain "Classic" cracker.  :-)

Sometime this summer the new boxes appeared in stores with the blue banner across front saying "Now with Tastier Crunch."  They are awful!  I can't imagine that they test marketed these crackers because nobody seems to like them.  I used to buy a few boxes and week and now I will never buy again unless they change back to earlier recipe.  I give Amazon 5 stars because they refunded my money.  This is because I called to check on formula before I ordered and I was told it was not the new one.  Beware -- it is...

The positives are that there are no hydrogenated oils and the limited sweetener is evaporated cane juice.<br /><br />Taste: 9 - Excellent taste<br /><br />Price: 4 - If you can find this for $2, it's a bargain.

review/summary: Great cracker for babies and toddlers!
review/text: Most teething babies and toddlers adore crackers, but many of the most common cracker brands just don't offer much nutritional value.  Either they're made mainly with white flour, they're flavored and sweetened beyond all recognition -- and, really, who wants to start their child down that path? -- or they're so light and "fluffy" that the child never feels full.  These crackers are none of those things, and the best part is that kids LOVE them.  My daughter is 18 months and would probably survive on these crackers and water if I let her.  Even the kids at her daycare have been known to pilfer some of her Kashi crackers right from under her nose!  I love that these are made with whole grains, are minimally sweetened, fill her up, and are a great dipper for hummus or spaghetti sauce (her favorite), and my daughter just plain old LOVES them.  It's a win-win situation!

review/summary: Just enough coffee from Amazon
review/text: I've never drunk coffee, but I find I like a slight caffine boost late in the afternoon.  This cocoa with just a little coffee fills the bill nicely.  I used to buy it in the supermarket, but I find it is no longer available in my neighborhood; fortunately I can still get it from Amazon at a good price (especially since I don't pay shipping as Amazon Prime).

review/summary: YUM_Mocha+Cocoa_tasty
review/text: I paid $8 for 6 boxes with 8 envelopes in each box_ i thought it was a steal at that price. I was also pleased when it tasted divine. It's gonna be sweet, obviously- so i make mine with more water than package says_ if you want to add a bit more coffee taste or caffeinne punch- you can add a touch of instant coffee into the cup, along with the mix and water.  It's probably as good as those mocha-cappucinos you can get out of the machines at convenience stores, 7-11's, speedways, etc._ they probably buy swiss miss powder to use for those machines. if the price is right it can't hurt to try it- long shelf life so it can stay around for months and months- and you can always share some of the boxes with others if 6 boxes is too much for you.  not the greatest review, but an honest one. good luck to you

review/summary: I REALLY LIKE THIS!
review/text: I am an adult who rarely eats cereal, even as a child. I really like this especially with fruit. The box states 14 g of heart healthy whole grain, 3 g of total fiber and 6 g of sugar in every 1/2 cup serving. They are toasted very well, and they are sweet, but not too sweet. I had no idea what 6g of sugar is, and I am still not very sure, because it depends on what you are converting. The best I can get, is that it is a little more than a teaspoon. Whole grain oat flour is the 1st. ingredient, and unfortunately brown sugar is the second.But there are no other sugars that I can see. There are 4g of protein (of course with the milk), and 23 g of carbohydrate. I can tell you besides being delicious, they help my digestion.<br /><br />I hope this helps in your decision making, and this is coming from a person who rarely is satisfied with cereal. I should add there is some BHT in the cereal.

Ever since we started taking these vitamins, she is healthy and strong and doesn't get an outbreak. My son is a very picky eater so as long as he gets his vitamins I know he is getting the proper nourishment.  We have tried everything from the grocery store to the health stores.  My sister in law owns a health store and she introduced us to these.  The kids remind ME that they need their vitamins.  They are so yummy.  I wish I knew about them a long time ago! They are are expensive for our budget but it is worth the investment.  Just order online and enough to get free shipping.

One taste later and she was raving over how good it was!<br /><br />Not only do I appreciate the health benefits that the Green Tea offers, but I am also delighted to find a great tasting thirst quencher that doesn't have any caffeine!  The antioxidants are a welcome addition to our diets and now my step-daughter's palette has been expanded a little bit more to include the green tea experience.  Way to go Crystal Light!

review/summary: Transcendental - you gotta try it.
review/text: I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.  If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain.

review/summary: This is the new Ketchup
review/text: I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. "Tongue Ought Shurocka?" I said. "DUDE!" "Not even close!" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST.<br /><br />Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. "The Rooster Sauce" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting).<br /><br />Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried "The Rooster Sauce" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu.<br /><br />As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins.<br /><br />"The Rooster Sauce" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember.<br /><br />Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated.<br /><br />One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get.

review/summary: Will not go a day without it.
review/text: I am still amazed at the number of people that have not experienced "The Rooster", as we have come to call it.  I have been using it for over 10 years, and have to say that it is hands-down the best, most versatile hot sauce in the world.<br /><br />The best part about this sauce is ability to not only add some heat to your food, but also blend seamlessly without overpowering it.  Pasta dishes, tomato soup, chili, to name a few that really benefit from The Rooster.  Come to think of it, I probably put it on 9 out of 10 meals I eat.  I have a bottle at my desk (which my coworkers' lunches have come to benefit from, as well), a bottle at the dinner table, and, of course, one on standby or travel.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints, and both are packaging related:  the green cap, in recent years, has become  a bit of a hassle.  Nothing major, but just noticeably problematic.  No one believes me, but I swear they changed the green cap.  Anyway, over time, the cap tends to leak out the red chili oil form around the threads.  It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.  Nothing serious, but when you use it as much as I do, it can be a bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Anyway, I swear by this stuff: it is my "island condiment" (the only condiment i would ever need should I get stranded on an island.)

review/text: This is my favorite multiple use hot sauce, hands down. Don't be fooled into thinking this is low brow either, they use this on Iron Chef and they know how to make a meal!<br /><br />A few foods I recommend trying this on:<br /><br />Chicken Shawarma<br />Gyros<br />Sushi (mix some in with your wasabi and soy sauce)<br />Cheese Quesadilla<br />Macaroni & Cheese<br />Eggs on toast<br /><br />An few extra notes: It is very hard to distinguish Sriracha from ketchup just by looking; it is similar thickness, color and consistency. I would give it a 3/5 on the hot scale, with 2/5 being a med-hot buffalo wing, 4/5 = 1st degree chemical burn on the lips, 5/5 = strait additive only sauces. If you can take the hottest of store purchased salsas and buffalo wings this will be similar and have no long term discomfort/burning.<br /><br />Usage may vary, void where prohibited

review/text: This hot chilli sauce tastes truly original. I used to live in Hong Kong and loved to put this sauce on almost everything. And it actually goes with everything, well especially Asian noodle soups and fried rice/noodle. It has the perfect flavor and heat and makes everything tastier. It's not too hot, but just enough to spice everything up. I recommend it to everyone.

review/text: This is good on so many things.  My favorite thing to do is mix it into some ketchup for dipping fries or tots in.  I also like to put a few dots of it on my cheeseburger.  A little goes a long way for me, but that's the great thing about this stuff.  You can adjust the spiciness just by how much you use.

review/text: If you don't like Sriracha then I'm guessing the rest of your life is equally bland.  Buy this, put it on everything and never go back to a life of bland.

review/text: I purchased sriracha on the recommendation of a friend and boy am I glad that I did.  Sriracha provides heat and flavor to a dish, but doesn't set your mouth on fire (like hot wing sauce).<br />It is good on everything from eggs, to chicken wings, to krispy kale chips.<br />So if you need a fantastic "go to" sauce this is the one (also fantastic mixed up in some mayo for a spicy mayo spread).
