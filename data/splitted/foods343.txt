review/summary: Should almost be labelled a "BOLD" flavor
review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best almonds ever
review/text: These almonds are my favorite almonds.  Wal-Mart used to carry them, but now I have to order online.  They are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet.

review/summary: If You Like Almonds and You Like Cinnamon You will like these
review/text: The Almonds are very very fresh tasting.  The cinnamon adds an extra bonus of goodness to the almonds with a great flavor.  We keep them in the fridge.  We also mix them with all the other nuts we have making our own nut mixture.  Excellent snack with protein.<br /><br />Just ordered some more of them.

review/summary: Best Almonds Hands Down
review/text: After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/summary: wow  really
review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/summary: Tea British, Me British equals Happy
review/text: I am British and personally I cannot stand Lipton tea for hot tea. Ice tea sure hot no way. I am always on the hunt for a nice British blend of tea. I have found many but often they are expensive and the boxes are so small that for an avid tea drinker like my self I feel as though I have to buy at least 3 boxes a time and I am always on the hunt for tea as not every store sells what I want. So when I came across PG tips subscribe and save I have never been so happy (well about tea any way) This is a little piece of home away from home and the fact I now don't have to worry about hunting the stores to get it means that I can be at ease. There is always a cuppa waiting for me at home. And the pyramid tea bag does make a difference when brewing the tea.

review/summary: That sigh of relief after a perfect cup
review/text: I've been drinking tea since the day I was born.<br /><br />No, really.<br /><br />My father was very British, but we didn't live in England so he felt inclined to drown me in everything British to make up for it.<br /><br />We lived in many places, including Sri Lanka, which is famous for its tea. The locals used to joke that the tea leaves get sent to Europe and Asia and the remaining dust in the bottom of the crates was shipped off to the United States.<br /><br />When we first moved to the United States, finding a good cup of tea was a challenge. They have this thing for stuffing it with sugar and lemon and pouring it all over ice - don't get me wrong its not bad - but you could do the same thing with water and get the same basic taste. The tea here didn't taste much like tea unless you steeped it for 10 minutes, at which point it became too bitter. We found a store that held some British teas we enjoyed overseas, PG Tips being one of them (Another being caffeine-free Typhoo for nights we had trouble sleeping). They had it in stock occasionally but you had to grab it when you saw it because it wasn't around often.<br /><br />Years later, I discovered PG Tips on amazon. I haven't gone a day without good tea since.<br /><br />These bags are so strong that you can get a bunch of flavor simply by pouring boiling water over the teabag and then immediately taking it out. About the same as steeping an american grocery store tea for two minutes. These guys are $5 for a pack of 40 at the local Harris Teeter so this is a great bargain.<br /> My perfect cup is two teaspoons sugar, one part milk and three parts water.<br /><br /> Drink it while its still steaming - and good luck not smiling afterwards!

I was delighted to find a service on line(Amazon.com)where I could continue to purchase the only black tea that I will drink. It's flavour is consistent - a full bodied delicious tea to start every day with bounce! In addition, we resort to the comforting brew frequently throughout the day. It is a refreshing break-time drink, as well as a comfort during times of stress. A good 'cuppa' will calm anxiety, especially when shared with a friend. So boil that kettle of water frequently and savour this delicious tea.<br /><br />It's so easy to buy this on line at a very reasonable price. Amazon makes everything simple. I have a standing order for a supply of PG Tips every other month. It is always delivered according to my schedule, and shows up on my doorstep. No more reordering, no more shopping, and the ability to cancel an order if I am going away. Should I wish to have my tea sent to a different location it is no problem either. Just get on line and advise the distributor of your need, and all will be taken care of. The service is first class.<br /><br />Go ahead. Enjoy for yourself the 'real' English tea!

You can't get it here in the states. Then I moved to Texas where Central Market is.  I found this tea and like it about as much as the Salisbury Brand. It's rich, full bodied. Not watery at all. Have me a cup every morning and sometimes(especially in winter, it's Texas you know) in the afternoon. Can't go wrong with this one. Now my teenage son drinks it too, he likes it better than coffee.

The pyramid bags make it possible to save money on brewing tea- where I used 12 tea bags of any other tea for a gallon of tea, I only have to use 3 of the pyramid bags. It is more cost effective!

The taste of this tea both with milk and without stands out, and the longer you let the bag steep, the better the tea. You can use the same bag for about 3 cups, or you can let the bag remain in the cup invoke a new pleasure everytime you take a sip.

review/summary: JUST LIKE IN LONDON, ENGLAND
review/text: My wife and I tried this tea while vacationing in London, England. Very smooth and provided a decent example of what a good cup of English tea is about. We were pleasantly surprised that Amazon offered this brand of tea. We love Amazon!<br /><br />Preparation: While attending tea presentations in China and England, what was consistent is the use of a ceramic/stoneware type tea pot; heat the water to near boiling (small bubbles); pre-heat tea pot (pour some hot water, swirl and pour out); put two tea bags in the tea pot ("one for the pot and one for the cup"); pour the hot water in tea pot; stir; close lid; then time for 5 minutes; and then serve. Its good to have the tea with sugar and milk (or cream), and of course your favorite biscuit. Once you enjoyed tea this way, going back to Lipton tea is just not the same. Enjoy! :)

review/text: I have been drinking PG Tips tea for about two years.  I drink several glasses of iced tea every morning instead of drinking coffee.  I have found that PG Tips is excellent.  The flavor is great and the tea brews up strong enough for adding lots of ice.  As a confirmed tightwad, I will usually brew two cups of tea from each bag.  This makes a nice large glass of tea to get me started.  I was a little concerned with the lack of strings and tags on the teabags, but this isn't a big issue.  With the pyramid shape the bag usually floats to the top of the container where I can easily pluck it out by the pointy top.  Works for me!

review/summary: I love this tea!
review/text: I had noticed this tea for sale at my local grocery store in the imported section, so eventually I bought a box there just to try it.  It is SO SMOOTH!  No bitterness at all.  Really a delightful tea.  I will not hesitate to buy it again here at Amazon!  I also plan to try the Special Blend variety of PG Tips to see what that is like.  I really think the fact that they only use the top 2 leaves and the bud of the plant must explain the big difference compared to other teas.  If you've been drinking the usual American grocery store teas (Lipton, Bigelow, etc.), you will notice a big difference.  At least I did.  I use one tea bag to make a tall travel mug of tea (even when I'm at home so it will stay hot), so I can't say if the bags make extra strong tea if you make it in a small mug as some other reviewers have commented.

review/text: After drinking this tea in England, I immediately had to find it at home and fortunately found it here on Amazon.  It is (to an American pallete) surprisingly strong, and I find it bitey without milk in it (I have tried it as iced tea - it still stung without even letting it brew for more than a few seconds).<br /><br />Regardless I still will five star it as it has entrenched itself in its selfmade niche in my cupboards.  I won't drink hot tea of any other kind any more, wont drink tea without milk, and now no longer drink coffee save on a very rare occasion. It literally turned me around from the first cup.<br /><br />To the English - mix single cream with blue-cap milk 50/50 to add to this, and then you too will be doubly spoiled by it. :)

review/summary: A great source for my favorite tea.
review/text: Finally, finally I have a great consistent source for buying my favorite British tea.  I've been drinking P G Tips since my first trip to England back in the 1980's but have often had trouble finding a source for purchasing it here.  I got it from British food importers for many years, then my local grocery stores began to stock it.  Except they don't always have it on the shelf and I often have to visit several stores to find it.  Amazon has definitely solved that problem for me.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this particular tea.  It is a very mild tea, without the harsh flavor some other black teas can have.  Since I make at least two pots of tea each day (and sometimes more) this lovely large quantity will come in very handy and keep my pantry stocked for a long time to come.  It was also much cheaper to buy in this larger size than the 40 count boxes I find in my stores, plus no sales tax and the additional savings of the Amazon Prime membership came in very handy with eliminating the shipping charges.

review/text: This is the stand-by PG tips my mother has liked for over 60 years.  Now that I have found a reasonably priced site, I'll order it again.  Arrived very quickly, and it appears to be very fresh tea.  Using over 60 a month, it will not be long before I reorder.  The tea is very gentle, yet offers a nice pick me up in the morning.  This is the best price I could find anywhere on the 'net.

review/summary: PG Tips - The tea you've been searching for.
review/text: Recently, a good friend offered me some tea she discovered while on assignment in London - PG Tips. A funny name, but a fabulous tea. Coming from an old line of tea drinkers, a 'good cup' has always been our go-to beverage and PG Tips is smooth, tasty, and full-bodied. This is a black tea that delivers the perfect cup every time.

review/summary: Just Right
review/text: This tea is exactly what I was hoping for after reading the reviews here.  Using loose tea in my office is more time consuming and creates more of a mess in my very rudimentary office kitchen than I want to deal with.  These tea bags are flavorfull, not bitter and I really appreciate that they have more cafeine than the basic domestic mass market tea bags. They give me the small afternoon boost that I need.  You can easily find higher quality varietal or blended tea and I have those in my cupboard at home and do use them when I have time for the fuss and want to savor something special, but I am really happy with these easy to use, inexpensive tea bags that make a quick just right cup of tea - either at the office or at home.

review/summary: The best true British tea!
review/text: PG Tips Tea<br />This is by far the best tea I have ever had, and I drink gallons of tea!  I was introduced to it by my sister-in-law, who hails from Great Britain.  She said it was all she ever drank there, but could not find it here.  We are both so very pleased to be able to purchase it quickly and easily on Amazon.com--and for a very reasonable price.

review/summary: No comparison
review/text: My daughter introduced me to PJTips in June. I had difficulty finding in the stores so decided to use my favorite Amazon to locate it. Got a great price and I can tell you, there is no comparison to any other tea. This is full bodied and delicious! I'd highly recommend it to any tea drinker.
