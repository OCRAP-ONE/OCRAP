review/summary: Fruit Slices - Red Raspberry 5 lb. Case
review/text: Very good quality made by Boston fruit slices. Very affordable pricing compared to other online candy companies. My only complaint is that they mixed up the order a bit by accidentally substituting two packages of cherry slices for raspberry, which is understandable considering that both flavors look almost identical.

review/summary: Irresistable!
review/text: My husband and I just looked at each other after eating one of the lemon wafer cookies and sighed.  The flavor is pure deep natural lemon, tart and bright, with a sweet creamy finish--nothing like any other lemon-flavored cookie I've ever bought.  Honestly, these are just terrific little cookies.<br /><br />And when we thought it couldn't get better, we tried the chocolate.  Natural, dense, delicious, dark chocolate taste.<br /><br />We plowed through both bags just going back and forth: lemon, chocolate, lemon, chocolate....<br /><br />No gross artificial taste.  No waxy texture to the cream.  No meek, bland flavors.  Just all-natural goodness that will blow your socks off.<br /><br />Time for another bag.

review/text: It is a very tasty treat I enjoy with my afternoon coffee. However, all good things must be had in moderation, and hence I will only buy one pack at a time from the local store.<br />However the price on Amazon is competitive.<br /><br />I don't know why it was tagged as "not vegetarian" because I don't see any questionable ingredient on the list - perhaps someone else can elaborate.<br /><br />The dark chocolate filling has a nice creamy texture without being overwhelming; and nor is it cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />Overall all, I definitely recommend this product.

review/text: These are the greatest wafer type cookies I have ever eaten. I've also tried the lemon ones which are out of this world as well. They are wafer type but are cut into small cubes (ideal for snack size) instead of how they usually appear as a longer stick. They are very creamy and have a high quality chocolate taste. Awesome stuff. You'll only be sorry when they are gone and you have eaten too much.

I will definitely buy this brand again. (Since you get eight bags in the order, I gave my mom a bag, my sister a bag, and a friend a bag of these wafers and they all told me the same thing...they love them, what great lemon taste, etc. and wanted to know where they could purchase them.)

review/text: Previously, these lemon wafer cookies were sold at Wal Mart; however, they no longer carry them.  Recently, I discovered that Trader Joe's carried a chocolate version and I inquired if they carried the lemon but no, they discontinued carrying the lemon as well.  So, I googled and found that Amazon.com was a source for the cookies.  YES, I can now satisfy that craving for a truly lip smacking little lemon wafer.  While I ordered only one box of them the first time, I will be ordering two boxes the next time--I have a friend and her husband who also enjoy puckering up!  Try them, you will love them!

Everyone who tried mine thought they were much better than they had expected from such a simple product.  Having no hydrogenated oils is a definite plus, but watch the saturated fat if cholesterol is an issue for you.

review/text: I first tried these cookies while visiting family in Panama.  They were available at the local grocery stores.  When I came back to the U.S. I couldn't find them locally but thank goodness for AMZAZON, I found them and at an affordable price.  I order a carton of eight packages and share them with friends.  They are a delightfully light and fresh tasting treat that soon become nearly addictive.  I have tried some of Loacker's other flavors but the lemon is my all time favorite.  I am tempted to subscribe to them!!

review/text: Here's another of the little items I find in my nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. This trip I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies. Oh boy, are these good! They disappear real fast. Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house? Well, I guess that a lot of others feel the same way. Did you notice that on the 33 reviews, 30 gave it five stars?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: WARNING: Addictive!  Ohhhhh so good!
review/text: These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!<br /><br />I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly.  Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles.  Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.<br /><br />Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.<br /><br />Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.<br /><br />Ohhhh, so good!

review/text: These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth
review/text: I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.  These are the best cookies ever and my lemon ones went so fast.  You will love these cookies!

review/text: I ran across the dark chocolate ones in Italy at an Autogrill highway rest area.  There were snacks aplenty, but the picture on the bag + the fact that it had an extra 20% attracted me.  So, I got a 10.58 oz bag!  I find them satisfying after eating just a few.  It seemed like a never-ending bag.  I googled when I got home, hoping to figure out where to buy more, and ended up here.  I'm glad I did because, after reading some other reviews, now I'm anxious to try the lemon ones!

review/text: I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a "slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.

review/summary: good coconut milk at a good price
review/text: Coconut milk is not always available in the general grocery stores, so I was thrilled to find this product here on Amazon. Good quality product at a good price. And it is nice to buy in multiples to have it around to make soup.

review/summary: Great product.
review/text: This coconut milk is great to use in receipts for food, deserts and ice cream. Tastes and smells like fresh coconut.<br />Tip: if you want to use a thicker coconut milk, keep in the coldest part of the fridge for a couple of hours. The thick coconut cream will come to the on top and the water will settle on the bottom. So, you can spill some of the water when opening.

review/summary: Foodie at heart will love Amazing Olive Oil Club!
review/text: We received the Olive Oil Club from Amazing Clubs as a gift a few months ago.  We were skeptical at first as we have visited many olive oil producers in our travels around the world and couldn't imagine that it would have the same quality.  BUT we were pleasantly surprised month after month. The Amazing Clubs selection is just as impressive as the olive oil we have picked up in New Zealand and Argentina and we didn't have to fly anywhere to get it.  It has consistently been a wonderful addition to our kitchen each month.  We have not able to find the same selection at the local grocery or specialty store.  We cook with olive oil for almost every meal... anything from salmon to roasted vegetables to homemade salad dressing.  With the new variations that arrive each month, we find yourselves coming up with new ways to continually enjoy these beautiful oils every day or just adding a little variety to some of our staple recipes... you'd be surprised what a difference a new oil can make in a meal.  We are extremely impressed with the quality and diversity of the oils that Amazing Clubs has given us access to.  We highly recommend ordering the Olive Oil Club for yourself or friends!  Great quality and great value!

review/summary: For those  who like mild coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.

review/summary: Caffeine Kick Without the Stomach Burn
review/text: After trying this new roast at the store and loving it, I was thrilled when I was offered a free sample of the k-cups to try on my office machine.<br /><br />Same as the store brew, mellow taste (to me that means no burnt after taste) and a high caffeine hit.  I am not a coffee aficionado so I cannot tell you about the cocoa or toasted nutty flavors that they tout.  What I can say, is that if you are looking for a simple blend that will give you the morning or afternoon kick that you need without leaving an acid stomach burn, try this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive as compared to brewing your own coffee from store bought beans in your Mr. Coffee, but that is the point.  You are brewing a fresh cup in the comfort of your own home without having to get out of your fuzzy slippers or in some cases, brushing your teeth.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a luxury and stop complaining.

review/summary: Best Coffee From Starbucks Yet, But, It Comes at a Price..
review/text: Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.  Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup?  I had to have a sip before I even sat down.  In that first sip I tasted some strength, some choclate and nutty overtones, followed by a smoothness I don't typically find in a Starbucks blend.<br /><br />For  the most part I don't drink Starbucks for several reasons.  First and foremost, they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew.  This Veranda Blend "Blond" brew isn't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee.  This coffee actually reminds me of what a good "Donut Shop" coffee used to taste like; before everything became darkly roasted.  But I stray...  The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity.  As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little.  It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity.  Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup, Millstone's Fog Lifter.  Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor doesn't change as the cup cools, the first sip is as good as the last.  The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd.<br /><br />I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day.  In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso (which sadly cannot be made in a Keurig).  My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either isn't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock.<br /><br />The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is, well, the price, and this is my reason for the deduction of a star.  Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception.  This is only a 16-count box which means we're paying right at a dollar a cup.  At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock.  Am I being cheap?  Maybe.  I just don't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee But Somewhat Expensive - Recommended
review/text: This Starbucks "Veranda Blend Blonde" K-Cup makes a nicely smooth cup of coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew.

review/text: Starbucks must think their coffee is made of gold.  A much higher price, and only 16 in a box.  While I agree with most others here, the taste is very good, but not worth the money.  If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.  I won't post prices, but you can do the math.

review/summary: A Treat in a Brown Box...
review/text: First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!

review/text: I usually brew a Lg setting cup and the first time I tried Veranda, it tasted like a coffee flavored Chai. Extremely weak coffee. For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine.

If I'd done some research before I clicked Buy it now, I would have realized these are WAY overpriced - $5/jar, when I saw them at Target yesterday for about $3/jar. I blame no one but myself - I've gotten so used to prices on Amazon being better than local retailers, I just bought without thinking. My rating is not for the Jif, which I love, but for the 66% overcharge.<br /><br />Perhaps, if prices do skyrocket, this price will actually be good, but for the time being, save yourself about $12 and make a trip to the store.

review/summary: Brittle Yes, Peanuts - Not Many - Enjoy the Review
review/text: When I ordered a week ago, no other reviews existed.<br /><br />So let's set the stage as they say.  It's 3:00am and the guilt from watching the last P90X infomercial while eating ice cream had just worn off.  Suddenly as if Billy Maze himself had yelled it through my TV - I got the craving for some Peanut Brittle.<br /><br />Not being one who needs instant gratification I turned to my old friends at Amazon. I figured ... If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box. The contents however were a different story.<br /><br />Which is kind of the disappointment here. The brittle arrived in such small pieces that a lot of it being simply brittle dust. On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order. But ...there is also the possibility, that if you like real peanut brittle your better off buying from a store where you can see the product first. See my pic<br /><br />Good Chomping :-)

review/text: This brittle is so much better than the cheap brittle at the grocery store. The actual candy part is so crisp and has such a peanuty flavor, almost as if ground peanut powder is in the batter of the candy. I also like that this brittle is less thick and chewy and is more crisp a crunchy. Delicious!!

review/text: I have had a t-disc coffee machine for a couple of years. My only problem has been finding coffee to buy. None of our grocery stores stock it, and the specialty places can be cost prohibitive and online offers were even more so. These Maxwell House discs are exactly the same as the ones I bought from Gevalia and produce a very balanced bold cup of coffee. The multi-package order brings the cost per cup down to about 63 cents a cup which is about half of what I pay locally. Excellent value.

review/text: This is one of the few larger cups (12oz) for Tassimo.  I like it slightly better than the Gevalia 12oz cup (they tend to be a little bit bitter at times), and since it is less expensive, it is a win win situation.  It can be a little on the weak side if you like a strong coffee, but you can stop it before it is done filling up the cup.  I add cream and sugar to it, and it's a great cup for the drive to the office.

To make this coffee bearable, I'm shutting off the brewing after about 4 oz, then adding a foaming milk t-disk. Actually, it does make a fairly good expresso if you only use the first 4-5 oz.

Turns out that the packaging for Maxwell House t-discs and the Gevalia t-discs is almost identical.

review/summary: one of the favorite flavors
review/text: I purchased my husband a Tassimo T-disc brewer and got him almost every different flavor of coffee available for the machine. I am not a coffee drinker so I can only pass on his review. His usual drink of choice has alway been Folgers, so I was kind of nervous switching him up since Tassimo has different coffee labels/brands. Which is why I got him all the different flavors available. The Maxwell House Morning Blend is one of his favorites so far. He likes that it makes a bigger cup of coffee and he loves the flavor. To me, it smells exactly like his Folgers. He says it tastes like his other brand too. I always thought he made his coffee strong, but this one is perfect to him. He tried some of the dark/bold flavors and even he says they are strong. I see tons of negative reviews, but honestly folks, everyone tastes thing differently. What is sweet to one may be not sweet enough to another person. I say, test a small bag first and see if this flavor is for you. And he has never had a problem with any disc every exploding. So far he absolutely loves his Tassimo and he has found some new flavors to love in his coffee.

review/summary: Not a big fan, a bit too watered down (though it is a "larger" cup)
review/text: I like my coffee somewhat strong, so maybe this is a bit unfair, but this seemed a bit too watered down (and I'm comparing this to other lighter-regular blend coffees I get on the street other than Starbuck$...). Since it is cheaper than some of the other Tassimo offerings out there and since it provides for a larger cup, I just assumed that it was nearly the same amount of coffee in the disc (as with the pricier offerings that yield less coffee...) and they were simply adding more water to the mix, however even  when I stopped the machine manually 1/2 way through the cycle, the coffee still seemed to have very little body/flavor(though it was less watered down).  Definitely not medium...more mild to light. Would not buy again.

I actually prefer this taste over fake cupcake/milk shake taste, which makes me want to throw up.<br />-Protein from hemp is better for you than protein from soy<br />-This is a go green product!<br />-You retain more muscle from hemp protein than soy protein, because hemp protein is more closely related to animal protein than soy protein is.

review/text: After going vegan I've tried somewhere around 10-15 different types of plant-based protein powders, all of which I hated. Then I bought this one when it went on sale at my local Sunflower Market and I thought it was great. After that sale, the price went way up and the only place I've been able to find Manitoba Harvest for a reasonable price is online. It doesn't taste as good dairy-based protein powders, but being vegan, I have no other choice. I actually like the nutty flavor of hemp protein anyway. Brendan Brazier, a vegan top-level triathlete, also recommends this protein, so it must be good stuff.

review/summary: Worth every penny!!
review/text: Halfway through my pregnancy I found out I was having twins and my doctor told me to start drinking Boost shakes (and the perinatologist further specified the Boost High Protein shakes). Being vegan there was no way I was about to drink Boost...besides the dairy who wants all of that sugar and corn syrup going through your (and your babies'!) bodies? Anyways, I began scouring the internet desperate to find a healthy alternative that was safe during pregnancy as well. After a week of searching, I settled on this hemp protein powder. It is amazing!! The texture is great...sure it's a tiny bit gritty, but what protein powder doesn't leave a little grit in it?! I mix the powder all sorts of ways and I have never tasted it. I generally mix it with chocolate almond milk (which masks the taste and green color perfectly)! I have also mixed it with green juice (usually bought from the store not homemade) and that tastes great too. I occasionally make smoothies with vanilla almond milk, peanut butter, and banana which once again masks the taste and color completely...and I am currently eating some in my oatmeal! So far the babies are super healthy and great (and equal) weights! My family and my doctors couldn't be happier! :) I cannot recommend this product enough!

review/text: I used to use Nutiva Organic 50% hemp protein prior to giving this a try. I have heard that Nutiva strips the Essential Fatty Acids and the omega 3's fro their protein. Manitoba Harvest consequently has 1300mg of Omega 3's, which is fantastic. This stuff tastes great in a post-workout shake with a banana, peanut butter, chia seeds, hemp hearts and sometimes a shot of hemp seed oil. I have had ZERO complaints about this protein and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into the hemp protein game; You will not be disappointed.

So best blended!
