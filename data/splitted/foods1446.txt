review/text: I purchased this online since we are no longer able to find this item at Walmart, it tasted GREAT however well more than 1/2 the bag was melted into on LARGE block, I am not sure if this is stored in a warehouse or if it was from traveling UPS in the Florida heat but it was basically a waste of money, we only got to eat about 1/3 of the bag and we discarded the rest :( This is my FAVORITE candy and to throw it away was such a waste.

review/summary: The BEST stuff!
review/text: I discovered these grapefruit gummies several years ago when the mall had a bulk-buy type candy store. When that went out of business, it became hard to find these yummy treats. I was so happy to find them on Amazon!  They are just the right mix of sweet and sour and I love the sugary coating on them. Like other reviewers, I like to leave them uncovered so that they "harden" just a bit. I like these better than the pink grapefruit gummies because the pink ones tend to stay real soft and I don't care for that texture. I will have to "ration" these to myself or I will go thru this big bag in no time! I highly recommend this delicious treat!

review/summary: I love these.. and I love them even more after letting them harden a bit!
review/text: I used to be able to buy these by the scope at my local grocery store, but they disappeared long ago.  I was ecstatic to find these on Amazon.  Others have mentioned them being bigger than they remember from Haribo's Fruit Salad.  I am not familiar with this offering, but these are exactly what I remember being sold separate from other flavors. They are tart but do not have the pucker factor or sour candy.  I think it is the perfect mix of sweet and tart, and now is what I crave when wanting gummy candy (hence this being my second order). I do like them immediately after opening, but I love them even more once I've left them open for a few days and they harden slightly and the center firms a bit.  Ahhh.. perfection! You will notice a decent amount of white sugar at the bottom of the bag, but when eating the individual pieces, I do not notice 'bald' spots or lack of flavor.

review/summary: The best, freshest, not-too-sweetest treat, EVER!
review/text: I have an extended family of 17 who go crazy over these candies; about 5 of us are serious addicts, so Amazon's price point is a real bonus.  We love them fresh, we love them slightly stale (but it's hard to let them "air out" to that pleasantly al dente consistency unless we hide them for a few days), and we love them half-dipped in melted dark chocolate.  I'd like to try the pink grapefruit slices, but I'm afraid they won't be quite the thing.  Long live Haribo (and Amazon)!

review/text: This gummy candy tastes like fresh grapefruit without all the sticky mess. Each triangle shaped piece is lightly dusted with just the right amount of sugar to balance the tartness of the candy. Candy stays fresh for a long time if the bag is sealed in an airtight container after it has been opened. The flavor is excellent for all grapefruit lovers.

This is the same candy you buy in the "dolled up" specialty candy store at the mall that they sell for 2-3 times the price per pound.  We have all gotten the little plastic bag at the store and thought we were going to buy just a little bit of this candy, only to find out it costs an arm and a leg when you checked out. This candy came fresh, delicious and at a money saving value.  Highly recommended!

Sweet with a little tartness to them makes the perfect combination!  Oh and the bag is huge! ;)

review/text: The candy was delicious, but it wasn't the same grapefruit slices I came to expect from the Haribo Fruit Salad.  They were larger and thinner. Honestly have the same taste but the ratio of surface area (powdered sugar) to volume (gummi sugar) was a tad off in my books.  Definitely worth purchasing, but didn't fulfill the void I expected it would (I miss living in NYC and finding them EVERYWHERE!)

review/summary: Unexpectedly Good!
review/text: The first time I bought these, I bought them for someone else who claimed them to be a favorite of theirs. Up until then, I had never tasted them. Wow, what a surprise they were to me! The flavor is tart and fresh and not artificial tasting as so many fruit flavored items are. Except for the actual chewy candy texture, they almost taste like eating that sugar-sprinkled morning grapefruit half I used to have for breakfast! Haribo also sells Pink Grapefruit candy like these, but I find the white to be much more 'authentic" and having that tart taste I like along with the sweet. The ones I have gotten through Amazon are a bit softer than ones I purchased elsewhere; the others were just as flavorful, but a bit tough and I much prefer the ones from here that are just a tad bit softer. Mmmmm......they make my mouth water thinking about them. I don't buy them for my friend now....I buy them for ME!!! If you like grapefruit, indulge yourself and buy these.

We are on our second bag and beginning to run low so we are conserving until they come available again(currently unavailable). I will only buy from Amazon so I can get the free shipping because the other companies charge as much in shipping as they do for the candy! They arrive very fresh and I have a food saver so I vacuum seal what's left and they keep fresh. My last order was in February and the candy is still fresh. Awesome product...but beware- once you try them you will be hooked!

review/text: I love Haribo grapefruit slices generally. They've been awesome when purchased at a local store, with a nice grapefruity and sweet/sour taste.<br /><br />However, buyer beware when purchasing online or mail order - when shipped around a lot, it appears that the citric acid granules get shaken off the candy slices, leaving them far less sour than they are supposed to be. My big 5-lb bag has a pile of citric acid in the bottom, and it does not reattach itself to the candy, even if poured over. The end result is a rather bland tasting piece of candy.  So if you're a sour gummy lover, only buy these locally!!

Compared to L&M, the Lakewood tastes sort of watery and flavorless, as if Lakewood used a lower quality of cranberry in making their juice.  The L&M is alot crisper and full of good cranberry flavor. The L&M color is also nice and bright red, whereas the Lakewood is considerably more brown.  As far as I know, they are about the same price.

review/summary: Better than regular wheat ravioli
review/text: We've been Gluten free for almost two years now. One thing we have really missed is ravioli. I debated on purchasing this because it's pretty expensive but I'm so glad we decided to give it a try! It's better than regular ravioli. It's really light and the cheese is really lovely... not that mushy watery cheese so many frozen ravioli brands offer. I only wish it was offered in a family sized bag. My son pretty much ate one bag by himself! Be sure to serve with a salad and some veggies to make it stretch.

review/summary: Something my Bengals will happily eat!
review/text: I have two Bengal cats who eat a predominately wet food diet.  A year ago my vet was horror struck to find out that I was feeding them Fancy Feast.  It was the only thing I could get my two to eat consistently.  One of my girls is on the skinny side, so it was very concerning to switch foods.  They would only eat chunky food in gravy, nothing minced/paste like and no seafood!  They won't even eat tuna from a can!  I finally found a food they with Nature's Variety Homestyle.  If you are new to the brand, it is important to know that the Homestyle indicates the chunky meat in gravy, where the regular Nature's Variety will be the minced/paste like consistency.<br /><br />I am only giving this product 3 stars because I really wish this was consistently an Amazon Subscribe & Save Item.  I am overall very happy that I have found a cat food both my Bengals and Vet can agree on.

review/text: My finicky cat would not eat any wet food but Fancy Feasts. When I found out what ingredients went into that product, I decided to switch him to a different brand. The pet store that I went to recommended several different brands to me. I bought several, including Nutro. He did not like the Nutro at all, and left the whole can out to feed some ants. Then, I opened a Merrick can. As soon as I opened it, he was bothering me to hurry and feed him. He gobbled up the wet food like I'd never seen before. Since then, we adopted a second cat, and she also loves it. She has the same response when I open the can. We brought in a stray cat several months ago, and she took to this food right away, too. I have not heard about a cat that hasn't liked this brand of wet food. I have recommended it to many people that I know who are cat lovers. The cats enjoy it, but I like it because it's healthy. My cats have great looking coats, which the vet always comments about. The true reflection of a cat's health is their coat, apparently.

review/summary: Kitty loves this
review/text: Recently, I got as many varieties of Merrick's for my cat to try as I could. I usually feed him a custom raw chicken diet, but for travel or when friends are taking care of him that isn't practical. I used to use Wellness CORE dry and wet cat food but it was just getting too expensive. I was pleased when I found Merrick's, and love that it is made in Texas (my native state!).<br /><br />My cat did not experience any bowel problems with this food. His litter box did smell much worse than when he gets raw chicken, but that is easily fixed by cleaning. I do recommend researching how to switch your cat's food safely to avoid any possible digestive system issues such as diarrhea or vomiting.<br /><br />My cat LOVED the New England Boil. He leapt up on the counter when I opened it and nearly tripped me in his rush to his feeding spot. I fed him this mixed with the Wellness CORE to switch him over and he actually licked up all the Merrick's wet food immediately and searched around his feeding area (with his dish still containing Wellness CORE kibbles) and came begging over to me when he couldn't find any more wet food.<br />Five stars from kitty!<br /><br />I also rate this five stars. It is made here in Texas, and with real quality ingredients, I can feel good knowing my cat isn't eating meat flavored corn and wheat!

Otherwise you could find yourself cleaning diarrhea out of your living room rug.<br /><br />I originally bought three cans of Merrick cat food. The first smelled spoiled and neither of my cats would eat it. The second was fine, though they didn't like the chunks and would just lick up the gravy. And the third one made one of them (and then me!) sick.<br /><br />One for three is an awful average, and I won't be buying this brand again. I'll stick with Wellness and Eagle Pack instead, thanks.

review/summary: Not like the others
review/text: I bought this tea as a gift based on the fact that all the other stash teas I've personally tried have been good, and several months later after the initial disappointment we are still trying to make it come together right. The problem with this one is that the chocolate does not blend right with the actual tea. The flavors are all there, but the chocolate unfortunately feels filmy and leaves a weird lingering taste. The package suggests adding milk and sugar to bring out the hazelnut. This works for that purpose but the chocolate still does not come out right in either flavor or texture. Also, mixing the tea with hot chocolate overpowers the hazelnut. It helps to steep the tea bag in pure hot milk with no water added, though.

review/summary: Somewhat weak, but pretty good.
review/text: The tea bags are smaller than I'm used to getting from Bigelow, so the tea itself is weaker with the same steep time.  Sugar and cream are absolutely required however, as it is only boardline palletable straight.  If you are expecting something along the lines of hot chocolate in tea form, you will be dissappointed.  There is a hint of chocolate in here, but its overpowered by the "hazelnut" which itself isn't exactly like any other hazelnut flavor I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is actually an enjoyable tea, but no one I've given it to as a blind taste test have been able to guess "chocolate hazelnut" as the flavor.  Several got that there was chocolate in it, but that was the closest anyone could guess.<br /><br />Very good as a late night relaxation hot tea, I honestly could not picture drinking this cold (and do not intend to try).  Once I'm finished with the box though, I do not intend to buy more.  It was an interesting novelty tea, but it isn't something I would drink on a regular basis.<br /><br />On a side note, I bought this tea at a Target for far less than the listed price plus shipping here on Amazon.  Indeed try it for yourself, but don't buy from here.

review/summary: Good quality, but beans tend to stick in can
review/text: The quality of all Eden organic beans is excellent.  Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent.<br /><br />The one complaint I have about Eden pinto beans is that they tend to chelate (leech their protein).  This causes them to stick in the can, and removing them requires one to force them out of the can with a spoon, knife, or fork.  The end result is that many of the beans get smashed, which doesn't work well if you want to boil or cook them, although it would save some time in making a vegan version of re-fried beans.<br /><br />Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans.  Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative.  The kombu can be consumed with the beans, or you can rinse it away.

review/text: I have been purchasing Eden Organic products for years.  We are particularly interested in "no salt added" products and Eden puts out great quality beans, at a very reasonable price.  Amazon makes it easy to order with free super saver shipping.  Prices are better than at our Health Food store an hour away.

review/summary: Eden Organic Beans are great - no salt added + BPA free cans
review/text: With Amazon's Subscribe & Save pricing, this order cost me less than $1.42 per can. At the local health food stores (HFS), the best price I can get is 1.83 on one discount day per week -- regular price at one HFS is 2.29, higher at the other.<br /><br />Our local Kroger affiliate stopped carrying 3 varieties of Eden Organic Beans in their health food and organic aisle. Perhaps this is because they offer store-brand organic beans in several varieties -- however, those are neither low sodium nor no salt added AND they don't use BPA-free cans.<br /><br />I have also purchased the Eden Organic dried beans through Amazon Subscribe & Save and they are excellent, but it's nice to have that better-than-fast-food convenience of just opening a can or two to make bean salad or other recipes.<br /><br />I like supporting organic farmers in the USA -- the dried organic red kidney beans in my local health food store are from China!<br /><br />Several of the cans in this dozen were dented and this may account for varying prices among Amazon's Eden Organic 12 packs. All perfectly safe.

review/summary: Replaces "Meat"
review/text: A wonderfully, smooth and creamy bean.  The best I have ever tasted.  Filling and satisfying.  My "go-to" bean I can always rely on for a variety of meal ideas.  The Bispheanol-A free cans give me peace of mind.  Although the beans stick a little at the bottom of the can, it's no big deal for such a good product.  I just gently pry them loose with a spatula.  Only two cans arrived dented, but were not bulging.  No worries.  I will be ordering these again and again as soon as I run out.

review/summary: Great beans, dented cans
review/text: I love these beans and Eden Organic is a great, trustworthy brand.<br /><br />However, more than half the cans arrived noticably dented. I've always heard dented cans can let in bacteria, so they shouldn't be used. Amazon is great about issuing a refund, though.

review/text: I was lucky enough to try these out as part of their Kickstarter campaign a month ago.<br /><br />If you like kettle corn as much as I do, you'll love this new way to enjoy both sweet and salty in one bite. The popcorn itself is delicious, and the flavoring just makes it outstanding.<br /><br />Maybe it's just the Canadian in me, but Maple flavour does conquer all simple sweets.

review/text: I really want to love this product.  First of all, the advertisement is wrong.  You do NOT get 3 boxes for this.  Essentially I paid $15 for one box which only has two bags inside.  That is 7.50 per bag.  Secondly, the bags would not pop.  After 8 minutes, not 3 minutes, I still had half the bag unpopped.  I microwave popcorn all the time so I can't figure out why it would not pop and the ones that popped started to burn.  Overall, great concept but poor quality and TOO expensive.

review/summary: Popped on the stove
review/text: I just popped a bag on my stove, and only nine kernels were not edible!  I used a 3-quart Revere Ware pan.  (The next time I'm going to try a stockpot.)  I put the heat on medium high and poured the oil in the pan.  I dropped three kernels in the pan with the oil and put the lid on.  When the three kernels popped, I poured the rest of the popcorn into the pan.  I put the lid on and kept the pan off the burner for 30 seconds (this brings all the kernels to the same temperature).  I put the pan back on the burner and shook it on the burner while the popcorn was popping.  It didn't take long for all the corn to pop.  (I found this how-to on YouTube.)<br /><br />The Quinn maple-salt popcorn was delicious.  The seasoning was light enough for me to taste the popcorn.  Popped on the stove, it was not oily.  If you are unsure how your microwave will pop the corn, I would encourage you to pop it on the stove.  Quinn Popcorn also has great customer service.

review/text: I love popcorn, but I don't buy the microwave stuff because it is so bad for you! I would eat it everyday, but breaking out the air popper is a pain. I will be buying boxes from my local market and enjoying this whenever I am too lazy to break out my popper. The Maple & sea salt is just the right combo of sweet and salty. I also love the Parmesan rosemary. I made it at work and everyone was mad for it! One review said you get what you pay for: they are right, you are getting the highest quality and best product on the market. Thank you Quinn Popcorn.

review/text: My family loves Quinn's!  I saw them on Kickstarter, but not in time to be a backer.  I placed an order on Amazon when it became available.  It was a huge hit!  My sister, sil, everyone loved it.  I sent a packet to a sleepover and the mom was eating the stale leftover popcorn the next morning.  She said it was too good to waste.  I sprinkled some cinnamon on one of the bags to mix it up and that went over really well.  The other two flavors (lemon and sea salt + rosemary and parmesan)  are really good too.

review/summary: YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TEA, UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IMPRA!
review/text: I was not a regular tea drinker until six months ago, when I spent time at my girlfriend's parent's home.  Her family is from Russia, where they culturally drink tea ALL DAY, EVERY DAY...  So, as you can imagine they offered me a cup of tea, and I said "sure", because I thought tea was nice to drink (but certainly not my favorite thing to drink).  I was blown away with how good this IMPRA KNIGHT tea is!  It is NOT bitter, but very smooth and gentle to the taste buds.  I am now a regular tea drinker!  I have also ordered the IMPRA EARL GREY tea, which is absolutely amazing tea as well (earl grey is spiced with a hint of bergamot - a small lime that grows in Europe).  The back side of the IMPRA tea boxes are written in Russian, the front side in English, so apparently they market the tea on both sides of the globe.  I guess it is fair to say, you haven't tried tea until you've tried IMPRA!  No joke.  To back up this claim, I've introduced IMPRA to my father, mother, sister, friends, etc...  all who are Americans - and not usual tea drinkers - and they've all been blown away with IMPRA.  They now drink it regularly.

I used a large kitchen knife to cut off a small section and DID NOT microwave it to make it supple as recommended on the package.  I simply kneeded it in my hands and then rolled it out.  I like this product much better than the Wilton Fondant... much easier to use, better taste and it didn't 'sugar' or change color over time.  i made samples and left them out over a week and they still looked awesome a week later!

review/summary: There are better choices.
review/text: I thought I could save some money by buying in bulk. Unfortunately, I made a disappointing mistake. Compared to other stevia extracts, I found this to be a very mediocre product. I found its potency to be very weak. To get the sweetness I like, I have to use about 4 times the amount of my favorite stevia, and then the aftertaste becomes too bitter. The stevia extract that I really like begins with a K. It may seem pricey, but you will need MUCH less and it will have a much better aftertaste. If you really want to try this brand, buy the smallest amount you can, because it can't be returned once opened.

review/text: I have Celiacs disease and must eat a gluten free diet or I get very ill.  It is great to find a cereal that NEVER makes me ill! It is 100% gluten free!<br /><br />I also love the taste of this gluten free cereal! This cereal is like corn flakes but without being boring! In fact, I mix them with plain puffed rice to lessen the fruity flavor because I like milder tastes and do not have a big sweet tooth.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this cereal and highly recommend it to people on gluten free diets...<br />BUT if you can eat whole grain cereals like wheat and oats EAT THOSE INSTEAD because they contain FIBER which is very needed in keeping your digestive tract healthy.<br />This cereal is created and designed for those of us who cannot eat whole grains.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE CEREAL MIX:<br />1. Gorella munch<br />2. Gluten Free Rice puffs<br />3. Amazon Flakes<br />The mixture is SO good that even non-Celiacs want to eat it!

review/summary: Great GF Cereal
review/text: I've been living gluten free for about a year, and I'm pretty much used to not being able to eat a lot of the foods I used to (wheat pasta, regular bread, etc). But cereal has been tough giving up, which is why I love the whole EnviroKidz line. This particular cereal is great because it's somewhat similar to Kellog's Frosted Flakes, but doesn't taste overly sugary. I've never liked cereals with lots of sugar, and this one doesn't contain a huge amount of sugar. It's also fairly low in sodium, cholesterol, and carbs, which is great. I'd also recommend Gorilla Munch, another EnviroKidz cereal. But these Frosted Flakes taste great (no pun intended.)
