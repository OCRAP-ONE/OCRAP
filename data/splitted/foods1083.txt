review/summary: Can anyone else confirm this?
review/text: I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner "meat" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!

review/summary: Save your money
review/text: In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.

review/summary: Never quite sure what it actually is, but it is a unique taste.
review/text: There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

review/text: When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!!

review/summary: A delicious, mouth-watering meat stick!
review/text: Ever since I was a child I have loved Slim Jim Meat Sticks.  The slightly spicy juice that comes out each time you snap into one of these bad boys is enough to convert even the hardest heart.  True, they do leave a waxy residue in your mouth, and it helps to drink something with it to wash it down, but you can't deny the flavor.  The smooth, exciting design of the meat stick makes it feel good in your mouth, as there are no jagged or rough edges, as is normal in your run-of-the-mill jerky-type snacks.  Plus, they are fun to eat!  I have never had such a great time as when I'm ramming meat stick after meat stick into my mouth, and sucking the juice out of this tasty meat.  They're so much fun to eat that you can stay home all night just eating these, and still have a better time than if you were to go out on the town.  In fact, I have considered throwing Slim Jim Meat Stick parties, where all we do is gather together and eat meat sticks.  I'm entirely serious about this.  They are that good!  And with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, you don't even have to worry about constantly re-ordering them.  You can have them sent automatically to your house every month!  A great deal for a great snack!

AND THEY ARE SMALL SO IT IS EASY TO CARY THEM AROUND IF YOU WANT TO EAT THEM IN A CAR,IN A PLANE,ON A BUS OR ANYWHERE ON THE GO. THE TASTE OF SLIM JIMS IS A MIX OF PEPPORNI AND AND BEFF JERKY BECAUSE THATS WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE. THIS IS A GREAT SNACK AND YOU SHOULD GET THEM.

review/summary: Get the original while it lasts
review/text: After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged "macho" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe.<br /><br />Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost. Even a team of scientists hired to reconstruct the glory of Slim Jims past failed in their efforts. We feared we would never see the likes of the "skinny james" of our youth.<br /><br />Happily, a warehouse cellar of the original was located near Hoboken, NJ. How the store had gone missing more than 30 years ago is not known. But, like fine wine, these Slim Jims have only improved with age. Get yours before they're gone!

review/text: These little smoke snacks are truly a gift from God.  And I an Athiest saying this.  I have loved these heart attack causing meat sticks since I was 5.  Obviously they are not good for you.  Obviously they are made from mechcanically seperated meat, (the crap left over AFTER making hotdogs), but man are they GOOD.<br /><br />They must put nicotine in them or something.  I used to work at a video store, I found myself eating, AND PAYING FOR, these things all day.  FYI they are horrible for your skin.<br /><br />Still though I allow myself around one a month.  I will never give these up completely, and who would want to.

I actually couldn't ask for anything more in life.<br /><br />I worry sometimes about buying food online, but there was no difference whatsoever between these and the boxes I pick up at Wal-Mart, except that these come in at a cheaper price per stick. And that phenomenon other reviewers have mentioned, the one where you feel compelled to eat every stick in the box as soon as you can?  It's real.  And also way more dangerous with 100 Slim Jims than 15.<br /><br />(But worth it.)

review/summary: The modern Slim Jim is a far cry from the original
review/text: Back about 30 years ago, Slim Jim made some DAMN fine beef sticks. They were probably the best that I can recall ever having since.<br /><br />Todays greasy orange Slim Jim is TOTAL GARBAGE, in comparison to what it used to be a few decades ago. I don't know when their recipe changed, but I think it was around 25 years ago.<br /><br />Those of you that think Slim Jims are good now would be shocked and disgusted if you were able to try the old recipe Slim Jim beef sticks. (which sadly are no longer made)

review/text: I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.

review/text: Sometimes you want a snack with a little substance (albeit mechanically seperated chicken and MSG), and Slim Jim's satisfy that craving. I polished off the box in about a month and I don't regret the purchase one bit. You probably should go easy on them if you buy them though. Whatever spicy juice or grease these things are packed with can become unpleasant if you go through more than 3 or 4 of these in a short period. I averaged about 3 a day and sometimes it was just what i needed to shut my stomach up during a boring meeting.

review/summary: Best Thing Ever
review/text: I remember eating these as a kid and loving them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I knew I had to get them.  It's been several years since I had these but my love for them has never died.  They are addictive and a great little snack.  I'll usually carry a couple of them in my pocket when I go fishing with my friends, at the local party scene or just cold chilling on the sofa with a ice cold soda.  Anyway you cut it, these bad boys are good to go!

review/summary: Kids Love Them
review/text: I have ordered these on numerous occasions because the kids love them.  The sticks are a little small, but they allow you to eat four (serving size 4 pieces) with 160 calories.  The fat is a different matter - 1g of trans fat and 6g of saturated fat - 14 total grams of fat per serving.  Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.  We throw one in to our youngest kid's lunch box and it makes her day.

review/summary: Slim Jim Chewing Gum
review/text: The first one I bit into was tough as leather and I had to rip it with my teeth. I made the mistake of biting it in half, and then I chewed, and chewed, and chewed. I couldn't get it to break down - it was like chewing gum! For the next one, I tried stripping off the outside, but that didn't make any difference. Still tough. I found they were easier to eat if I took tiny bites.<br /><br />That said, they were very tasty. But I don't like to fight my food, so I won't be buying this little stick any more.

review/summary: If you like Slim Jims and/or Tabasco, then these babies are fantastic. Hot, but delicious. A+!!!
review/text: This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/summary: First batch was great, second batch was stale and old
review/text: this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.<br /><br />This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.

review/text: Well, the 1 star reviews are from people who never liked Slim Jims and would never like Slim Jims so why they buy a whole package instead of spending a quarter for one at a gas station I'll never know... regardless, these are good and tasty.  Greasy?  Yes.  Bad for you?  Of course.  But you shouldn't expect anything but a fatty treat.  For some reason they seem tougher then they were a few years back when I had them last.  Not something I would eat daily, but a "good" treat if you like them.  With the sales lately amazon has had on them, the price is right as well.

review/summary: Low carb, spicy snack sticks
review/text: I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.<br /><br />These aren't the "spicy" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.<br /><br />I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.

I am very disappointed to get this in June 2011 to find out that the expiration listed on the box is Oct 2011.  That is in 4 months.  Truly disappointed in Amazon for selling a product with a short expiration date.  So if you are going to buy in bulk make sure to eat it up quickly because it may be short dated.  But other than that, it is DAMN yummy!

review/text: I have begun buying Slim Jims in a large box to save money over individual purchase by the stick.  Part of my low carb diet.  They make a good between meal snack and the .28 ounce size works well.  I suppose you either like the taste or not.  I like the spiciness as compared to Jack Links, but the texture (finely ground and extruded into a stick) seems a bit less like real meat.  All in all, a good product.
