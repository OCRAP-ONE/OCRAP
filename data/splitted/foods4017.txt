review/summary: Don't Buy the Plain Strawberry!
review/text: My children and I have had the Strawberry Banana Crisps and have loved them.  But after a while they started to pick out just the strawberry pieces.  So when I saw they had a plain strawberry option here I was thrilled.  When they arrived I was shocked to find out that unlike the strawberry banana variety, which are nicely sliced pieces, the strawberries were WHOLE strawberries.  And also unlike the strawberries in strawberry banana combination these strawberries were BITTER.  I mean inedible bitter.  Just a word of caution that Amazon does not take returns on grocery items.  I am now out $20.

review/summary: Tasty, no vitamins, made in China, deceptive packaging
review/text: While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them.  A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties.  By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA.  That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package.  I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind.  While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories.  Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope.  Draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Finally, the package counts are deceptive.  The subtexts often says "24 count".  Then in Amazon inset says "2 pack".  This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes.  In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24.  I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing.<br /><br />[Update, May 2012:  It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.]<br /><br />To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable.  However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to "freeze-dry" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients.  I find the fact that they are made in China troubling.  Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again.  [Note my previous acknowledgement of the improved product count description.]

review/summary: These strawberry crisps taste like they've gone bad
review/text: My daughter loves this product and often purchases it from a local specialty market.  But they are very pricey and this seemed a better way to purchase them.  But what we got was something that looked the same, but the product inside was much different.  The crisps in the store are nice slices that taste like strawberries.  These are mangled pink bits that taste like strawberries that went bad.  Maybe this is just a bad batch, but as you cannot return the items, I am not going too waste anymore money from this seller or on this item from him.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot. They make a great snack.

review/text: my baby eats these snacks frequently. They dissolve in the mouth easily. I like them too.  If you have to worry about food allergies, these are great b/c it is in a nut/peanut free facility.<br /><br />The apples & pears are the best. The peaches are ok...not as sweet, kind of bitter.  They also make potato chips which aren't fried or baked! They aren't as good though as regular chips, but a much better alternative.<br /><br />I love these products & glad to see Amazon is finally carrying them

review/text: Made in China! Food quality and growing conditions concern me.  Packages are full of small broken pieces. Couldn't tell how many of each fruit were in the 12 count variety box. Thought there'd be 4 of each flavor...Only 2 pears and 2 strawberries - rest were apples.  Taste is very good but never would have bought if I'd known the origin. Not sure where packaging failed but broken tiny pieces aren't what my 1-year old grandson wants. USA doesn't have fruit???  Won't buy again.

They are a fun way to have fruit on the go when food spoilage could be an issue.  I definitely recommend them.  We do, however, choose fresh fruit when it is an option as it is a less expensive option.

My four year old ate three packages the first day we had them and my husband loved them so much he bought the Asian Pears, Bananas, and Peaches too.  Love them all but the strawberries are the best.  They are whole berries not sliced and they come in individual 1/2 cup serving bags so they don't absorb unwanted moisture like some tubs of berries do after opening.  They are not sweetened, so if it's sugar you are after you might be disappointed.  The real berry flavor is awesome.

review/text: The back of the bags state that they're 100% dried fruit, but they aren't like any dried fruit that I've had before.  Each chip feels like a rice cake or rice cracker, with a light, puffy texture.  This makes it really easy to eat a bag very quickly, which apparently contains 1.5 pears, 1.5 apples, or 1 banana and 4 strawberries, depending on which flavor you grab.  The strawberries are pretty similar to the ones that you find in Special K with Strawberries, but they're even lighter.<br /><br />I don't think they're terrible, but I can't say that I love them either.

review/text: These may be good for you, but they taste absolutely terrible.  I'm a huge fan of healthy food that is good for you, but these taste HORRIBLE.  They taste very little like fruit and very much like sulfates and preservatives.  I would return them if I could, they aren't even palatable.  I tried to give them away for free and failed, the only way I might be able to choke these down would be in sugared oatmeal.  Not even space food, just definitely not food.

review/summary: Eh...
review/text: First of all, these are way overpriced. The individual packets hardly have any food in them. My son is 1 1/2 years old and 1 packet isn't enough of a snack for him; I have to give him two. Secondly, the strawberry-banana ones are very messy, particularly the strawberries. The strawberries left red traces all over my sons hands, mouth, and clothes. So bad that his skin stayed "stained" until I bathed him (didn't come off with baby wipes). He likes the apples.

review/summary: Okay but small servings
review/text: I think fruit is generally a hassle to eat, but I love the taste. So I thought this product would be a good way to satisfy some of those sweet tooth cravings, in a semi-healthy way. They offer 3 sorts of flavors in this pack: asian pear, apples, and strawberry bananas.<br /><br />Asian pear: My favorite! Very authentic taste and not too sweet.<br /><br />Apples: Okay, slightly sweet and slightly tart. The texture wasn't that great though. Not that crisp and more like styrofoamy.<br /><br />Strawberry and banana: Banana crisps are great, sweet and crunchy and the strawberry is just tangy.<br /><br />The problem I had was not so much with the taste but the meager portion sizes in each bag. I'd say each contained literally only a handful of dried fruit and considering the packaging and cost, its not very environmentally or economically (for us anyways) friendly. I guess, for kids this would be a perfect but I need something with a little more substance.

review/summary: Best Snack for Toddlers
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this product.  We originally found individual bags of fruit crisps at our local supermarket, and were paying almost $2 a bag because my almost-two-year-old son loved them so much.  What a find on Amazon, a pack of 24 for so cheap!  We subscibed and saved.<br /><br />Less mess and more portablt than fresh fruit, better than a "fruit snack" or salty snack, and easy for little ones to chew.  Not enough strawberry and banana in the variety pack, we run out of them first, but my son loves all the flavors!!

review/text: I got these snacks when I was searching for the Veggie Straws.  They LOOKED tasty.  However, I didn't care for the consistency.  Since they are called "crisps" I assumed they would be crunchy...like chips.  But instead they dissolve in your mouth...kind of like party mints.  I cancelled my subscription and gave the packages that I had to someone else to try.  Lesson learned.

review/summary: Stale
review/text: Based on the recommendation of my sister-in-law I ordered a couple of boxes of the Brothers-all-natural fruit crisps.  I also ordered the Kirkland brand as well.  I would have to say that I prefer the cheaper Kirkland brand over the more expensive Brothers brand.  I am not sure if the Brothers brand is supposed to taste stale or not but at least two of the packages that I have tried have tasted stale and not crisp as advertised.  The expiration date on the individual packages is 01-06-14 which leads me to believe that this brand either taste this way or I just got a bad batch.  Nonetheless, I will stick with the Kirkland brand and just chalk this one up as a loss.

review/text: I really enjoy the Fuji apple and Asian Pear and each pouch is the equivalent of 1.5 pieces of fruit. Some pieces do get crushed, but the majority are good size pieces.<br /><br />Personally, I do not like the strawberry/banana. The pieces are too small and there is an odd taste to them (The item lost its star for the strawberry/banana).<br /><br />You do pay a premium, as compared to most fresh fruit, but you don't have to worry about the fruit going bad.<br /><br />I recommend this pack to pick your favorite fruit and then order that one individually.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: These fruit snacks are an excellent way to get fruit into your diet.  I'm a diabetic and a one bag serving is about 8-10 grams of carbs and that is it.  Because the carb count is so low, I do not need insulin and the effect on my blood sugar is negligable.  I know a low of people are upset that these are made in China, but for my purposes, they could be made in Saskatchewan for all I care.  I need the health benefit that the fruit provdies without all the carbs and if this works, I'll take it.  I buy these from Costco for a slightly cheaper price than Amazon offers them for (but not much).

review/summary: Delicious, convenient and healthy snack!
review/text: I ordered these freeze-dried snacks after I found a similar product in the grocery store and loved them. Unfortunately, at nearly $2 a bag at the store, it quickly became a luxury expense. I decided to try these from Amazon because they were considerably less expensive than the in-store brand, and had great ratings. I was not disappointed! These are fantastic little snacks that are neat, convenient and healthy. So easy to throw into my lunch bag or stash in my car on long trips. I love the strawberry-banana and the apple flavors. You can really see and taste the quality of the fruits they use. These little 40-calorie bags will absolutely be replacing my afternoon potato chip habit, at a FRACTION of the calories.  If you're hesitant about trying these -- don't be! These are a new staple in my household.

For such few calories it is a nice snack, the apples and pears are really good. It is really difficult to find 100% natural dried fruit like this brand as most have added sugars or HFCS which seems crazy because these are plenty sweet on their own!

review/summary: Great snack when fresh fruit isn't an option
review/text: I can't stand the thought of feeding my daughter processed, sugary snacks that lack nutrients. I give her fresh fruit and vegetables as often as possible. These are perfect for stocking the diaper bag so she can have an impromptu snack. I try everything I give her because if I won't eat it, I won't make her eat it. I love these! The apple is probably my favorite. The banana does leave a strange after taste but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I saw a review that said they only received a 12 pack but I didn't have that problem. They\re packaged in a 12 pack but I was sent 2 of them. I received these very quickly too.<br /><br />Overall, a great product.

review/text: I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter.

When we ask her what she wants for a snack she says "Ap-ple"  It is great, she gets a full serving of fruit and there is nothing in them that is bad for her. I think that the prices here seem high, however when you take into account that each bag has one whole apple, you would pay that amount for fresh produce and end up throwing out some of it anyways.  My daughter easily finishes an entire bag and what she doesn't we can save for the next day.  WE LOVE these apples!

(Sugar)  The slight spelling difference is to decieve those that read ingredient labels to think they are reading Sucrose and not notice it is Sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose causes severe abdominal pain, so if you have had that after chewing gum, now you know why.<br /><br />Aspartame has dozens of books and thousands of websites explaining what is wrong with that, as well as the other one.<br /><br />Very sad that I never again will get to enjoy my childhood favorites of Wrigley's Spearmint, Juicy Fruit or Big Red ever again.

review/text: One of the greatest snacks I've ever had in my entire life. Before, I usually only ate the occasional bag of Hot Cheetos� and thought it couldn't get any better than that, but I was dreadfully wrong. Ever since my first Mud Buddy(tm), I've gotten out of my deep depression, gotten a girlfriend, and learned the old and complex art of pancake crafting. Did any other snacks do that for me? No, just Mud Buddies(tm). Thank you Chex�, for making this once seemingly worthless life have a new breath again!

review/summary: SUPER HEALTHY DOG FOOD AT GREAT PRICE!
review/text: My toy poodles are older now and some are losing teeth so I have to go to canned dog food to supplement their Bil-Jac. They really loved the Happy Hips and Canidae Dog Food and they are great but  I was looking for something as good for them but also a little more cost effective since I have so many poodles...11 of them!  Good thing they are well mannered and trained!<br /><br /> A case of 24 cans of "CS For The DLS"  is the price of most cases of 12 cans with other brands. The ingredients are top notch with this one too. [...]<br /><br />One of my tinniest ones, Baby Doll,  gets so excited  and lets out one big yelp whenever we pop open the top tab then she does this little dance around on her back two feet.  It is so cute! I also like that these cans have the pop top lid so I do not have to use the can opener.  I know, the epitome of laziness!  It is a nice feature though.<br /><br />The 4-5 lb. dogs get mostly all can dog food now as their teeth are sooo little.  This canned dog food is specially formulated for seniors but I would guess from reading the ingredients, it could be for all ages. does not have lots of watery juice to take up space but more of a soft/solid form. My larger dogs, up to 12 lbs get mostly the  Bil-Jac mixed with canned.  I mix about half a can with a little water to their Bil-Jac dry food and they graze and eat it up as they feel like it.  This keeps them in shape. They tend not to over eat when they know food is always available. I have always fed my dogs this way and it has always worked. I am going to add glucosamine to it for their hips as a few have problems with hips at their old age.  It is easy to do, just google correct dosage for them then crumble pills and add. Since I have so many dogs, I mix (hide) all meds in a teaspoon with the canned dog food and give it to them individually.<br /><br />I would also like to say that if you have small dogs and /or dogs with problem with their teeth, it is difficult for them to chew the harder kibble. If this happens they will just quit eating except when absolutely necessary and do harm to their health due to tooth pain. Bil-Jac is the only food I have found in dry form with the tiny kibbles which are easily crumbled. There are also dog aspirin formulas you can add, sneak in, to canned food for pain. Don't use unbuffered aspirin for dogs as it is hard on their stomachs. I also add Dr. Katz's water additive to prevent and help tooth and gum problems.<br /><br />My dogs are on an antibiotic regimen ounce a month, first 10 days of month, to help prevent infection from gum disease.  They also have allergies. I was using Benedryl ( at Vet's recommendation) but after researching Zyrtec (generic form), for dogs, I am using that and it works wonders for their allergies. All of the a things I give my dogs are  available on Amazon for a fraction of the price at the drug store.<br /><br /> Please, if you are going to use Benedryl , Zyrtec or any other medication on your dog and cannot afford to go to to the vet, research it completely before doing so and make sure you have the dosage down carefully so you do not harm, or even kill, your pet. It is a very serious undertaking to medicate your dog on your own but can be of tremendous benefit to your pet if you know what you are doing, so research, research, research before doing it!<br /><br />You may ask why I don't take my dogs to the vet for tooth cleaning.  Well, their  are several reasons; one the cost, of course, but the most important is that I do not want my little ones subjected to anesthesia once a year as it is dangerous, hard on their hearts and can cause other problems and even death.  I just make sure they are as pain free and as comfortable as possible in their later years, now.<br /><br />Sorry, I got a little side-tracked!<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this dog food.  I am grateful the price is so reasonable so I can afford to feed my dogs this good food.<br /><br />Blessings!

He hears them and goes for his dish. A great Doggie success at my house.

review/text: We have a 90 pound dog that is 11 years old. We thought that it was just age causing him to cough and spit-up a lot. He also did not go to the bathroom regularly and often was "in a hurry" to get out. Since we started feeding him this dog food, along with Beneful dry food (mixed), both problems have gone away. He really likes the food and seems to feel better.  We give him the Adult formula. We tried the Senior formula, which is almost the same as Adult, but we found that he was happier with the Adult formula.

I love that it has so much meat and not wheat.  Pick up a competitors can & read those first five ingredients!  The price is also incredibly lower than other gourmet or premium dog foods as well.  I would have preferred to not order the cans for Senior Dogs, but that is what Amazon had and that's what I ordered.  The dogs gobble it up and they have not had any gastric issues with this food.  I believe in holistic food for humans & pets, and this product belongs on that list.

review/text: My 10 year old husky doesn't go crazy when he smells it like he did with the Blue Buffalo food...<br /><br />The only reason I tried to switch him to do is because its a really great value, you basically get double the amount of cans for the same price, but I think I'll be going back to Blue Buffalo or maybe Wellness and just stick with them.<br /><br />On another note, I found the food filled with maggots one day, I havent had that issue with any other food, but I'm guessing it was just because it was a hot day and the food was left out.<br /><br />Also, i got the dry food with it, and I noticed when the food gets wet a bit from water or if the food gets a bit old, it has a really strong and bad odor...again I never noticed that with the other brands...

review/summary: Saves a lot of calories and money
review/text: This might not be as great as the coffee down at your local cafe or Starbuck's but it is the next best thing, low in calories and fat. With all the calories you save, you can dress it up with your own cocoa powder on top and still be ahead of the game. Buying in bulk means saving even more money. Just keep in mind that the pack will be half milk discs and half coffee discs so it will be more expensive than buying just straight coffee. You might want to use only half the milk disc by brewing two cups and then splitting it.  Some people find Gevalia bitter, but it is certainly better than Maxwell House. I love the House Blend Starbuck's discs myself, with one of these creamers. Still a fraction of what you have to pay in a shop. Enjoy!

review/summary: very different and very good
review/text: These are crispy, tasty and very much lighter than potato or corn chips.  I have ordered both sea salt and creamy dill - hard to say which is the favorite, they're both so good.
