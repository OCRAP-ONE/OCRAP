review/summary: New and Improved Formula Much Better!!!!!!!!
review/text: I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!! The new and improved formula is the way to go!!!!

review/summary: As good as they say...
review/text: This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...

review/summary: Tried others, this one is best value
review/text: I have purchased another soy based chocolate power product (ASIN: B000HCX5RQ), and that other one wasn't as good as this Naturade Total Soy.  We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1/2 scoops, 8-12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after-taste - probably due to the soy - but it's better than using pure cocoa!<br /><br />Update: All Star Health is very very fast.  I reordered it on 9/10 and received the very next day.  It wasn't expected to arrive until 9/16.  I will order from them again.  It's too bad this item from them is not on the subscription program.

review/text: I've tried coconut water a few times and never liked it, but had to try this when I saw it at the store last night. I am so glad I did...it is really refreshing and the best tasting milk I've ever had.<br /><br />It's unsweetened, 45 calories and gives you 45% of your daily calcium per cup. If only I could have discovered this as a kid; I would have quit normal dairy milk immediately. In a blind taste test, I would choose this every time.

review/summary: Very strong and very effective
review/text: I first tried these drops when a friend left them at my house by accident.  I instantly loved it and ended up using the rest of the bottle over the next few weeks!  (Note to self buy a replacement for my buddy!) One to two drops and you will have SUPER minty breath.  I use them at work and people twenty feet away will start saying they smell peppermint :)<br /><br />They can be very strong so start off with one drop and work your way up.  Currently I will use two to three drops on my the back of my hand and then lick it up.  It sounds funny but these are the directions for use.  I believe you can also mix a drop or two with a glass of water and use as mouthwash.  If I eat something like onions or garlic I will use up to four drops, but I love the mint smell and sensation of inhaling the vapors so you're milage may vary.  You can also put a tiny bit uder your nostrils and it will help with sinus issues.<br /><br />As far as any negatives go one I can think of is that after putting the drops on the back of your hand it will leave a white residue behind but it is easily washed off.  Also the price is a bit high in my opinion but a bottle can last about a month and its a good alternative to gum or mints.  Lastly I wish it came in a larger bottle size even just for refilling the small 10oz bottle it comes in.<br /><br />Some people might not like this product.  I have let some co-workers try it and a couple have said its just too strong for them and I have heard one even say he did not like the way it tastes.  Personally for me it's a smell thing and to me it tastes fine, basically like nothing if you take the smell part away.  Some of my friends just think I am weird for putting drops on the back of my hand and licking it off :)<br /><br />I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you want some serious minty breath!<br /><br />Also I think its a natural product with the ingredients being peppermint oil and chlorophyll if that kind of thing is important to you.

review/text: I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.

It has a spicy but pleasant aroma, and no harsh peppery taste like a lot of supermarket chais. Instead, there was a strong note of cinnamon with a hint of ginger, so if you like either of those ingredients, you would probably enjoy this. Unfortunately, as others point out, it is no longer available in leading grocery stores, so you will have to buy it here.

I just bought 6 boxes of 20 at the ridiculous price of $46, BUT NO MORE!! For those of you who also love this tea, there is great news.  Lipton has a Spiced Cinnamon Chai tea that has all but one of the same ingredients of the former Spiced Chai.  So do your self a favor, keep some of your pennies in your pocket and get the same taste with Liptons Spiced Cinnamon Chai.  Now this same vendor I purchased 6 boxes from is selling it for $56.00 taking advantage of the fact that we love this tea.  Go back to your local grocery stores and purchase the Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai so that these won't also disappear from the shelves.

review/text: Amazon is one of the few places I have been able to purchase Lipton Chai Tea.  Its so good and if I don't have it in the mornings I'm not going to have a good day.  Its great with honey.  I ordered it from the company and then from Amazon and its more economical from Amazon.

review/text: This is a excellent chai tea. I drink it after dinner with a tablespoon of half & half.  I have served it to husband, Dad, sister and bother-in-law and now they all "want a cup of tea" too. Since I try to stay away from sugar, I use the chai tea as my dessert.

review/text: I have been drinking this for at least a couple of years and then could  not find it anywhere in Walmart in my store or two other states. Or others stores I shopped either. Needless to say I was thrilled to find it online and at a reasonable price. This is the second time I have ordered it from you.I always order several boxes because I am afraid I won,t be able to find it again.I don,t like any of the other brands except Lipton.Thanks again for having this available as I am only a hot tea drinker, no coffee.

review/summary: My Favorite Chai Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea! I love the balance of spices - not too much of anything, not too strong, just nice flavor. Other brands of chai tea seem to be too strong, too bitter, or too much of one spice or another. Lipton Spiced Chai is just right; a nice flavor change from standard tea, Earl Grey, English Breakfast or fruit teas. I've just subscribed to this tea because I have been having a hard time finding it any more, and I drink several cups a day year round. I've tried most of the other brands, but don't like any of them nearly as well. I hope Lipton continues to make this tea!

review/summary: Excellent Lipton Chai Tea
review/text: I first bought this product at Walmart but when they stopped stocking it, I was very pleased to find it on Amazon. When you add a sweetener and milk, it tastes just like the expensive Chai tea you get at coffee shops. However, for the cost of one shop drink you can have 20 at home. I've also tried every other company's Chai teabags and this one has the best blend of spices, not overdone.

review/summary: Lipton Chai Tea
review/text: My friend and I were so happy to find this product at Amazon.com. Locally all the stores have stopped carrying it. Not sure why? Shipping from Lipton's site was atrocious so we ordered from Amazon. The tea is exactly what we expected although in the one box that I have opened so far, the tea bags seem to be slightly wrong. When you pull the string topper off the bag, it pulls off the connection between the two sides of the bag. I have not, however, and any tea leakage so this is a small price to pay for the tea that I love so much!!!

review/summary: Good chai without any medicinal taste
review/text: This is a good spiced chai tea.  Not the best, but far from the worst.  It's one that I always keep on hand, and I love ordering it from Amazon because of the great price.  It's inexpensive enough that I don't mind using it for an iced tea too.  My favorite way to make it is with some sugar & hot water, then stir in a couple of spoonfuls of Nestle's Nido instant whole milk--delicious!  (I like the instant milk better than "real" fresh milk even.)  My other half usually prefers his minus the milk through some strange prejudice that milk or cream are not to be mixed with tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend Lipton's Spiced Chai--there is NO medicinal taste like some other brands, and the spices aren't as strong as my favorite brand (Bigelow), so its something that those who aren't as fond of spiced chai can enjoy.

review/text: I love this Chai tea and it is so much less expensive than getting some at a coffee shop. Other brands just do not have the flavor I (or my Chai Loving Daughter) care for. This has a mild mixture of all the spices normally found in chai with none overwealming the others. Mixing in milk and sugar or sweetener makes the Chai Tea Latte a warm comforting drink for morning, mid day or evening (if a bit of caffiene does not bother you)

review/summary: Super tasty and super easy marinade.
review/text: I was a bit nervous buying something in bulk when I didn't know what it might taste like, but I've had NOH products before, and they didn't sell the Korean BBQ marinade in the Chinatown stores I frequent.<br /><br />The first time I made it (with red meat) my husband said he loved it, but I didn't get to taste it until a couple days later. Bad idea, he confirmed. The taste was so completely different than when first cooked. Probably could've given myself food poisoning, too.<br /><br />The second and third and fourth time, we grilled the chicken after marinating it overnight. Bad idea. I still had no clue on taste because the charcoal taste overpowered it completely. Waste of marinade.<br /><br />This week, I tried marinating chicken and placed in freezer for 2 weeks. Let thaw and marinate for 2 days in fridge. This time I just baked it. The aroma and flavor was tremendous. My picky 2-year old even loved it. And this time, two days later, it was still super tasty.<br /><br />My only warning is that the packet STINKS when it's first opened. That's not how it tastes, nor how it smells once it is reconstituted with water. That first whiff is just horrible, but the flavor is great.<br /><br />Is it true Korean BBQ? Um...it's the Hawaiian version of it. Still super tasty, but maybe not 100% authentic.

review/summary: Great Flavor (but unsure about the red dye)
review/text: This came exactly as I expected and on time. It has a great flavor. I'm a very, very good cook and I can tell you that marinating overnight (as they suggest on the package) is not really necessary. A few hours is fine. That said, prepare as directed and the flavor is exactly like the familiar Chinese ribs you get in a restaurant. My only concern is the vibrant red of the marinade. There was a real scare about red dye in foods a few years back and I'm still a little wary of any product that uses dyes (such as red dye #3, used here). I'll probably use what I ordered but I doubt I'll use anymore because of the dye additive. Seriously, why does it have to be red? Why can't it just be great flavor?

review/text: I m a fan of this soup maker; I have purchased Bear Creek Creamy Potato and Brocolli Cheddar in large cans, each sufficient for 24 servings. Bear Creek shipped them directly to me, but their phone no longer works nor does their email address.They were well priced at 10.00, kept forever, and much could be done to these soups to make a short and simple meal fancy enough for friends. So, as a trial, I ordered this soup-in-a-sack from Amazon. The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen. They never replied. I do not recommend any Bear Creek in a sack products....not only because of a critter problem but also since they are far more expensive than the large cans.

review/summary: Some kind of a soapy substance
review/text: The instructions on the package say to wash this first before cooking it into something. It really needs the washing, because there is some kind of a soapy substance that comes out when you do, and, judging from my reaction to cooking it, it can cause gastric upsets. This may be a general problem with similar products made in the USA. I don't understand exporting what should be nutritious food from India, thereby depriving people in India, anyway. It is from India, by the way, and the Amazon web site writeup doesn't say this. Also, the package printing is in (I am guessing) Hindi, not Egnlish, with a picture of someone from India growing big and strong from eating it. I wouldn't want to do business with this overblown, pompous, ill-willed storefront again.

review/summary: Perfect for Gum Lovers - Saves Money!!
review/text: For those of you looking to buy this, don't wait any longer and pull the trigger. Why? Because in the end, it will save you money. Any gum lover who likes these jumbo packs can tell you that at your local grocer, these things cost you $3.59 each PLUS tax.<br /><br />on Amazon, they are $9.99 for a pack of 4.  Divide 9.99 / 4 and you can get each 60-piece container for $2.50. Even if Amazon charges you sales tax for your state, you still end up saving $1 per container.<br /><br />So go ahead and buy this 4-pack of Eclipse gum with 240 pieces of delicious gum. By buying it now, you have $4 to save on other things, like a quick lunch at your local fast food place.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Eclipses Most Gums Out There
review/text: I love Eclipse gum--it keeps my mouth fresh, and tastes great. However, packaging is everything. I find that the flat packs with foil wrap give a gum that has way more flavor and lasts longer than the plastic containers such as this. There is a very noticeable difference in taste between the two; however, this "economy pack" still tastes good, and usually saves you money. By the way, whatever happened to the cherry flavored version of Eclipse?

review/text: Not sure there's much to say about gum - this is my favorite gum, so I decided to buy some in bulk.  The big container looks pretty stylish, but is prone to bust open if it gets knock off a table or desk - for that I had to deduct one star.  In any case, I'll likely keep my stocks refreshed with another order down the road.

review/summary: Fun For Throwing, Delicious For Eating!!
review/text: Just one chocolate orange lasts for a very long time :) You'll be savoring each slice, so it lasts. Each slice is detailed to look like a real orange slice. The chocolate is so creamy and melts instantly when it hits your tongue! The chocolate is not as sweet as other chocolates, and the orange flavor does not over-power the chocolate flavor either. Each compliment eachother perfectly! The chocolate orange is also the size of a real navel orange!<br /><br />And the throwing? Get ready to bash the heck out of this thing! The slices don't come apart unless you bash the bottom on a table or other hard surface. You can get your rage out! Or, you can get one for each family member at Christmas and see who can get all of their slices to come apart at once! It can become a very fun Christmas tradition!!

review/summary: High Quali-tea
review/text: I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I found this tea to be of very good quality and certainly not "fishy" smelling at all as another reviewer notes. The small pebbles are tightly rolled and very uniform with a nice shine to them. These are the things too look for in a good quality gunpowder tea.<br /><br />This tea has a great flavor: grassy yet peppery and I've found it to be excellent blended with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9UI1Y">Tea's Etc Organic Black Tea, Mint Fusion, 3-Ounce</a>.

The quality of every box is consistent and they aren't dry either. They are hard to find in stores though, which is why I bought them on here.<br /><br />If I had a nickle for every time in my life that I ate a burnt Cheese-It I'd have enough money to buy 50, six packs of these Cheese-Nips through Amazon. These are a great snack cracker but six boxes is just too much unless you have a huge family of munchy kids.

You can definitely taste the chocolate and mint flavors, it's just that the are not super sweet. You get the aroma of the chocolate and mint, but it's not like drinking a peppermint patty. It's a great blend for the holidays and during the cold winter months. For summertime, I sugguest trying out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00745DOK2">Harney & Sons SoHo Chocolate Coconut Tea</a>. It's got the same great chocolate flavors, but with a very slight coconut aroma to it as well.

The Hot Cinnamon Spice and the Earl Grey Supreme is a different story. I've tried most of the H&S teas, most of which are wonderful. This is among my least favorites as I enjoy most of their varieties however this one was disappointing. If you ever try the Green tea with coconut you must add honey and lemon and WOW major flavor explosion...without those condiments its very mild. Just a tip.

The tea itself smells like Thin Mints - sooo yummy! - but the taste is mild and refreshing. It's like a peppermint tea but with much more depth than regular herbal teas. It's great for after dinner, but I've also been drinking it in the morning (instead of my usual Earl Grey - hell must have frozen over) because it's been so cold and dreary and this tea is a perfect fit. I love it and will definitely be buying more!

review/text: When Jack Link's named their super sized beef stick Hot & Spicy, they weren't kidding!  I was initially leery about buying this product, as I have found Jack Links jerky to be mediocre at best, but these sticks are delicious.  Soft and chewy, with a succulent mouthfeel, and big enough to really be satisfying.  Oh yeah, and they're hot!  Spicy hot to the point where a lot of people I know can only manage a bite or two, and then have to put the stick down for a few minutes to recover.  They always pick it back up again, though.  In fact, I have a stash of them in my office, and I have to smuggle them into work, because all of my co-workers hound me for them as soon as they know that I've re-stocked.  Kudos to Jack Links for a great snack!
