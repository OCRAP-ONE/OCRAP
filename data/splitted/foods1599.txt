review/summary: I love this Salsa!!!
review/text: I first tried this salsa at a local market in Kemah (Boardwalk Fudge) and loved it! I bought a couple bags and made it at home, it was really simple to make and my husband loved it too. He makes a quart every week! We eat it on everything, eggs, burgers, nachos, chicken salad, gucamole. We marinated burgers with the concentrate at our 4th of July party, it was awsome.

review/summary: The Good and the Bad
review/text: I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: "I hate you SATAN Ice!!" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br /><br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot) com

review/summary: Better than WIlton fondant, but not the best.
review/text: Satin Ice is more plyable and better tasting (for fondant0 than the Wilton boxed fondant at Michael's and WalMart. If you need colors, they are vibrant and strong--their blank and read are the best.<br />While I have used Satin Ice many times, I will say that whatever fondant is used and marketed as the "Duff" brand (from Ace of Cakes) is a MUCH better product than even Satin Ice. You can re-rool and stretch it to fit like nothing I have ever seen. It really is the easiest fondant I have ever worked with--worth waiting for the 40% off coupons from the large chain craft store and buying the Duff brand.<br />You can find Satin Ice elsewhere on the Internet cheaper than here, but at least you know Amazon is pretty dependable.

review/summary: Easy to work with and tastes good
review/text: I ordered this product to make a birthday cake for my son.  I had never worked with fondant before, so I made a practice cake in advance.  The fondant was brightly colored, relatively easy to work with (with ample amounts of powdered sugar to prevent sticking), and didn't taste bad like many other fondants do.  What I especially liked was that I was able to store the remaining fondant away for nearly three weeks, and it was just as good as when I first received it.  The green is a bright kelly green.

review/summary: Difficult to work with
review/text: I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to "step it up".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said "It's fondant!"  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said "It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I got this fondant for my brother's wedding. I won't be using it until this weekend, so the only things I can comment on right now are the taste and the color and texture.<br /><br />First off, right out of the bucket, this fondant was very stretchy and easy to work with, I pulled out a chunk just to see out it worked, before I ordered more. I found it very nice, and I'm just beginning to work with fondant. I was very concerned with the fact that it was being delivered on a 90 degree day, but it stayed gummy and workable and didn't melt or stick to anything.<br /><br />The color was gorgeous. I was a little worried about it leaving a blue or green color residue or not quite being black, but it's a great color and didn't bleed everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the taste, I tried it and I have to say this is some of the best tasting fondant. I liked it so much, that I ordered the white and I plan on making the flowers out of it, because I know people will love them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Worked very well. I made many flowers and other decorations for the cake with this. Everyone thought it tasted great and looked wonderful. My only complaint is that it didn't dry as hard as other products I have used, so I had to be very careful when moving them around as they easily lost shape or fell apart. I'm not sure if this was because of the fondant or because of the heat, even though i made sure they were in a cool, dry place.<br />My other issues is that no matter what I tried, it was very sticky and stuck to the mat that I was rolling it out on. Once I let it sit out for 15min or so, it got much easier to work with and I was able to actually roll and cut ribbons without them breaking or sticking.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy this again, just takes a little bit of getting used to.

I needed to get the product to me quickly, so purchasing from Amazon 2 day was the most economical for me.  Which is good for when I need to try out mixing a few colors before ordering a large quantity. I used this blue along with the red to make purple which was perfectly stable to light. (unlike mixing gel colors which sometimes fade in direct light).

The frustration has caused the hair on the wolves on my "three wolf/one moon" t-shirts hair to fall out, they look like they caught the mange and the moon is no longer full. How can I go to Wal-mart like this- I feel my wolfen power slipping away and will no longer be the babe magnet I once was. How will I be able pick up women now- Maybe I'll try at Target. All due to Frito Lay and my great disappointment in never savoring the flavor of the mythical but non-existent 3rd Degree Burn Doritos... Shame.. Shame Frito Lay.

review/summary: BEST CHOCOLATE EVER!
review/text: It's the best! No one other brand compares. My Mom first discovered it a few years ago, when my older sister and her family took a trip to France. They brought back the Milka bar, and Mom and I fell in love! Now every time they go to Europe, my Mom always requests the premium "Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate" bar.<br /><br />Milka is produced in several European locations (i.e., Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Turkey). Unfortunately, availability in the US is slim; best bet is thru an online candy merchant or perhaps any of your local international stores. Nowadays I don't enjoy most American based products, as they are usually artificially flavored. In contrast, Milka is 100% natural! The taste and quality is superb--rich and creamy. No one beats it.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!

review/text: I first encountered these heavenly chocolate bars in Austria back in 1990. I couldn't believe how good they were! Milka definitely beats out anything made by Lindt, Cadbury, or Hershey. (My apologies to the Swiss, English and Americans, in that order). The taste is truly unique. Very creamy and as another reviewer put it "refined". It has a great blend of a sweet and creamy milk chocolate feel with just a hint of dark chocolate flavor. It is truly fantastic and must be experienced for one's self. Up until now, I could rarely find Milka in the States, except for at the occasional gourmet food boutique. I am very happy that Amazon has made it available to the American market.

review/text: When I received my shipment of Milka chocolates from Euro Food Mart, they were already stale! I opened the first chocolate bar and more than half of it was discolored and obviously stale. I find it suspicious that the expiration date was coming up in six months yet the chocolate was already stale, and when i wrote to the customer service department of this company they told me I had to pay return shipping to send back the unopened chocolates for them to refund me. This is not the right way to do business and I am never buying anything from this company again. They should pay for the return shipping since I already paid a $10 shipping fee for this company to send me stale chocolates.

review/summary: "I never saw a purple cow..."
review/text: A friend gave me a bar of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NF4C7E">Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate 100g</a>, imported from Poland by his girlfriend's family. I've had lots of amazing European chocolate so I opened it with high expectations.  Yes, it has an exceptionally creamy texture and very nice mild flavor, a bit sweeter than I expected and quite milky.<br /><br />Milka's not the chocolate for me, though. I prefer chocolate that's less sweet, darker and more strongly chocolate-flavored; 60 or 70% cocoa. Milka is probably not more than 30%. It's a nice product for those who like that concentration.<br /><br />Though this may be more information than you want in a review of a chocolate bar, I'd like to tell you about the company. Milka, first created in Austria over 100 years ago, is produced in several European countries and capitalizes on the idea of creamy milk from cows raised in the pure air of the Alps (though they don't mention where the cocoa comes from). Its wrapper is, and always has been, a distinctive lilac color with a purple and white cow pictured on it (explaining the Ogden Nash in my subject line).  Since 1970 the company has been through a couple of mergers and was acquired by Kraft Foods in 1990.<br /><br />I went to the company website to see if they sell darker chocolate. The home page asks you to choose a country--U.K., Turkey, Russia, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, etc. Each country's page is the distinctive Milka purple with an Alpine scene, and several have sound effects of lowing cows and chirping birds.  On the U.K. site you can follow an interactive tour and meet an Alpine cow ("Make a Moooo Mate") and there seems to be something similar on the other pages.  Each country's site has a link to other Kraft company sites.<br /><br />To sum up: very nice chocolate if it's the sort you like. I enjoyed it well enough but liked the website much, much more.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010

review/text: VERY HAPPY WITH EMMETS! If Baileys is a 10, Emmets is a 9. I loved Baileys but it is much too expensive to drink daily if you are on a limited budget.  I searched for an alternative and found Cask and Creme but it was bitter, not at all enjoyable straight, in fact I found it very difficult to finish the small bottle I'd purchased.  I drink my creme straight, cold and on ice so I actually taste it.  After this I was afraid to waste more money on bad creme but I talked to a few people who recommended Emmets. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH EMMETS. It's very smooth and sweet.  It did seem a little bit thinner and didn't have quite the same "punch" from the Irish Whiskey but it is a truly GREAT,INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE to Baileys.  I will buy Emmets for all but the very most special occasions and will enjoy it. Thank you Emmets!

review/text: I'm not kidding! This is the best tomato spaghetti sauce ever offered in jars on supermarket shelves, and the only one I'd use unless cooking for my in-laws. But it's not sold just everywhere; most of the big mall supermarket chains don't carry it. The price here for six 14-ounce jars is roughly what you'd pay in a market, but then there's the shipping cost. Mom's also makes a puttanesca that's oxymoronically respectable.<br /><br />What makes it better than average? It might be just that Mom's uses real olive oil in abbondanza, rather than tasteless soya oil. In this "garlic & basil" sauce, you'll see whole cloves of garlic and rough-chopped leaves of basil, and what's better, you'll taste both. Possibly the sauce-wallahs don't overcook the tomatoes. All I know for sure is that Mom's has more gusto italiano genuino than its competitori.

review/summary: RECOMMEND HIGHLY
review/text: I was about to purchase Wellness for puppies, but our trusted Vet gave this food her highest praise (she had liked the Wellness brand, but said the company had been sold and could not vouch for the quality going forward).  We have an Airedale puppy, who was being fed IAMS when we got her.  As you always should, we transitioned from the IAMS into HOLISTIC, and she is now solely on this food, and LOVES IT, and this food seems to love her as well!!!  Read the ingredient list.... it's top notch.  I bought this 30lb bag from Amazon since the price is comparable and the shipping is FREE!  As always...  great service.

review/text: I'm very happy with this food. Our Golden Ret was on it a year and her weight is excellent, beautiful coat, and firm stool.<br />I used to get it at our local Petco but they stopped carrying it. It broke my heart. You know how it is when you get something you're happy with and it's no longer available.<br />Anyway, Amazon to the rescue. No additional shipping charge with my Amazon Prime membership. I'll keep our dog on this for another year then switch to the adult formula.<br />Now if I could only get it delivered with groceries from Amazon Fresh :>)

review/summary: Great food and awesome price
review/text: As an owner of a young American Mastiff pup, we had to switch to this due to some protein concerns. The more popular brands like Blue Buffalo and other brands are actually 25% higher in protein. The Holistic Select in my area can only be found in two specialty stores. Not only are they out of my way, they are about a buck higher in cost. I was hesitant about ordering from Amazon at first being a food product. I can assure you the service is outstanding. Each bag has always come inside a box and the food was protected. The shelf-life remaining on the food has always been greater than six months remaining. Plus, I save the gas money having to go get as it is left at my front door. I hope Amazon keeps this in their inventory and would be neat to see it added to their auto delivery program. Giant Breed dogs tend to do better on lamb based lower protein foods. If you are on the fence about Amazon handling this, let me reassure you that you will not find better pricing and consider the service of delivery to your door!!!

review/text: Doberman puppy had terrible diarrhea on Blue Buffalo Longevity and Purina Pro Plan. This was the last effort before putting him on a hypoallergenic food that would leave his skin dull and lifeless. This has worked wonderfully, although we feed him a little more than recommended due to the lower protein content. Cannot complain

review/summary: Great Food!
review/text: Purchased this for an Irish Wolfhound puppy. With my older male I had a terrible time getting him on a good food and had ended up switching his food about 4 times in the first 2 years. Now that he is older he is on a higher protein diet that is not suitable for the new pup. Most of the large breed specific puppy foods I've food contain higher levels of protein and calcium that are not suitable for giant breed pups, and with my older one I did a lot of research and had him on adult diets from the start. The breeder of the new pup recommended this line and after researching the product I started our new pup on this. They have done extremely well on this diet and I am pleased with the high quality ingredients used in this product.

review/text: Our Great Dane puppy loved the first 30lb. bag, no problems whatsoever. The second bag, however, caused extreme projectile diarrhea(no joke), which isn't cool for anyone or thing, especially an inside dog. My wife was pretty ticked(she cleans that stuff up). Our 13 week puppy lost ten pounds and spent time in the vet hospital, just to get her digestive system back on. We will not be buying this anymore. We know for certain that it was the food. After switching to another brand, she would get better, then we'd try again. It would come back immediately. We switched to eagle pack, (red bag). It's the best!

Fortunately, no glass broke and not mush of the sauce was lost. That having been said, Don't let bad packaging deter you from what I consider one of the perfect condiments around - not as hot as Tabasco, but a similar taste. Can't do that much hot, but I do dig the taste, so this is a very happy medium. But, so buy the plastic container if you can.

review/summary: Makes a decent diet cola
review/text: I have an iSi Twist and Sparkle Beverage Carbonating System and wanted to make a diet cola.  Most diet cola syrups on the market for home users use splenda and/or acesulfame K which I don't like the taste of.  I'm used to and prefer the aftertaste of aspartame or saccharine.  This was the only extract I could find that was unsweetened so I could try my own sweeteners.  I ordered the cola flavor from Jack's Country Store here on Amazon.<br /><br />I tried making the soda with both erythritol and saccharine (sugar twin).  I couldn't get the sweetness right with erythritol, but the Sugar Twin worked fine.  The extract flavor is between a cola and a rootbeer flavor.  I used the following mix: 3.5 cups water + 1 tsp cola extract + 1/4 cup Sugar Twin (if using erythritol use closer to 1/2 cup) and optionally, juice of a lime to boost the acidity and push the flavor closer to a cola and away from rootbeer.  You could also use a bit less extract and sugar twin, I like it a bit strong.

That said, this product has been around for at least the past forty years. We used to buy this at Calico Ghost Town and Knotts Berry Farm in the '60s and it has same delicious flavor today. Try the Sarsaparilla or Birch Beer mix if you want a different old-fashioned variety. This stuff is great for flavoring homemade ice cream too.

review/summary: If you got Ginger Beer, consider yourself lucky
review/text: I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything.

review/summary: If you like weak coffee - and doctor it liberally
review/text: maybe you'd like this.  I thought it was terrible, and am looking to give it all away.  I don't know why I ordered it - and the same for the "Chocolate Donut" type - because I don't really like flavored coffee, and ESPECIALLY when the flavors all taste alike and the coffee is so weak it tastes like dishwater.  I like a rich, full-bodied (but not bitter) cup of coffee, which this most assuredly is not.  Maybe if you like lots of cream and sugar, and just a touch of coffee flavor...

review/summary: Donut Shop Cinnamon Roll - Worst I have tasted
review/text: I love flavored coffee so thought I would try this.  This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had.  I can't say it even tasted like coffee at all not much less having any type of flavor. Maybe the one I tried had something wrong but now stuck with having to toss out the rest of the box!<br />Very disappointed!  I will stay with my Hazelnut and French Vanilla

review/text: Maybe its me, but I don't taste ANY cinnamon in the Donut House Cinnamon Roll coffee. In fact, it tastes like a VERY weak cup of bad blueberry coffee. I just got my first Keurig coffee maker a few months ago and have been trying new flavors like crazy. I have to say, this is the worst flavor I have tasted yet. I would never buy this coffee again.

review/text: Not a favorite of mine, but I don't really like cinnamon in my coffee.  I purchased a Donut House variety pack and this came in the box.  Friends of mine who do like cinnamon in their coffee have tried it and thought it was good.  The coffee brews a bit weak, as well.  I do love the regular Donut House flavor, as well as the Chocolate Glazed Donut (yum!).  Overall, I think people that like a light brewed cinnamon coffee would love this.

review/summary: Not bad coffee. Horrible price
review/text: Let me start off with the coffee itself which is pretty good. I will say that these coffee's (green mountain and such) have really huge swings. I've bought cases that were wonderful and the next will have a burnt aftertase or be noticably weaker in comparison so realize that these reviews may be reflective of the wild inconsistant nature of the brand...<br /><br />Now for the major point; 1.04 a cup!? I know K's have gone up quite a bit recently but not that much geez. This brand is a staple at "Bed Bath & Beyond" so you know and is 10.99 up from 9.99 for a box of 18, which is .61 a cup. But hey if ya don't wanna leave the house go for it. Oh wait you can order if from them online as well... oh well I tried gimme my star back.

review/summary: Seriously Delicious!
review/text: I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I'm writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a "soft" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!

review/summary: Slight Cinnamon Flavor
review/text: This is a Light Roast coffee with only a faint cinnamon like flavor. I brewed this In my B40 at the 7.20oz mug size. Adding a sugar substitute and liquid creamer and it created a mellow flavor with at best a very slight cinnamon flavor. I was expecting more. I will try this coffee at the larger 9.25 mug size and report back.<br /><br />I brewed a cup at the larger 9.25oz lever and still no real desirable cinnamon flavor. But as a light roast coffee alone, it has a nice smooth flavor with low acidity; just wished they'd would have put just a tad more cinnamon in it

review/text: As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you.

review/summary: Total misrepresentation as far as flavor is concerned
review/text: This is the first time I have taken the time to review something on Amazon.  This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is cinnamon roll flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of cinnamon roll while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no cinnamon roll flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad "Chocolate Glazed Donut", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another "flavored" coffee.
