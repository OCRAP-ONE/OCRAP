review/summary: Mixed Results
review/text: I have followed the instructions religiously, but am having problems with this kit.  One of the plants is about a third of the size as the others.  It hasn't grown at all in weeks.  I am at 10 weeks with my garden and two plants have a ton of tomatos.  Customer service suggested trimming back my good plants so the smaller would be closer to the light.  I can't see cutting off all my flowers and tomatos to take a chance on a plant that seems defective.<br /><br />Added May 6th, 2007: I woke up this week to discover the two plants that actually grew were tipped over and falling out of the garden.  They were fine the night before.  They have been cared for exactly as the book suggests.  I tried "staking" them, but the only option is to tie them to the grow light arm, and doing so just does not keep the plants upright.  The just tip the side instead.  On a positive note, I finally harvested my first tomato (yellow variety) after about 95 days.  It tasted okay.  I am hoping the reds taste more like a real garden tomato.<br /><br />Added May 14th, 2007: So far, all of the tomatos that have been harvested are quite sour.  I had such high hopes, but now I am sorry to say I can not recommend this kit to anyone.

review/summary: Room for quality improvement
review/text: I love the concept. Living in New York apartment, it's great to be able to grow your own herbs. We use them for cooking and aromas are great. However in my first kit chives never came up. I spoke to customer support and they made me wait a few weeks before they have sent the chives replacement, but by the time it was too late, as all the other plants were huge, so the new seeds didn't really have a chance. I have planted my second kit a few weeks ago, and this time sage didn't sprout. Chives are also looking weak, dominated by huge basil and sorrel. Obviously, I am quite annoyed with dead seeds in both kits.

review/summary: The only thing I couldn't grow...
review/text: I don't know if it was just me or what but I CANNOT get any tomatoes to grow.<br /><br />I've followed all of the instructions (of which there are many) and so far I've only had flowers bud but then never come to fruition.<br /><br />I've done the manual pollination, I've made sure they didn't fall over, I've even trimmed them but dang it if I can't get a tomato.  And, these plants are a total water hog.  I have to fully fill up my water every 4-5 days due to how immense these plants grow.<br /><br />So, if anyone else has had a good time growing the tomatoes please let me know.  I think I'm going to have to go back to herbs and lettuce.

review/summary: Growing Tomatoes in my Aero Garden
review/text: I thought what fun. Fresh tomatoes all year round. The tomatoes bushes grew and grew and went past my hood of my garden and drooped over the top. I am loaded with tons of green tomatoes. Unfortunately, the bottom of the stems are slowly dying and I will end up not harvesting any tomatoes.<br />I have 3 aerogardens. I have tried the lettuces----GREAT. Herbs---GREAT. Petunia-----still blooming up a storm. The tomatoes.....I am hoping to salvage two plants by taking them OUT of the 'water' and planting them in real soil. The Aero Garden works great on the above except the tomatoes.<br /><br />I love my machines. I have given the Aero Garden as Christmas and birthday presents....(I should have stock) but, the tomatoes are a bust. Sorry.

review/summary: Fruitless
review/text: After having been reasonably successful with the initial herb seeds that came with the garden, I thought tomatoes would be a nice next step.<br /><br />The tomato plants grew quickly and required a lot of trimming and pruning.  They also do require support to keep them from falling over.<br /><br />After 5 monthsI saw some yellow tomatoes (the kit comes with 2 red tomato pod and 1 yellow one).  I have not harvested them yet, since they still show hues of green.  So I cannot comment on the taste.<br /><br />The red tomatoes never came to fruition.  One of them became sick or certainly looked sick so I pulled it. The idea is nice - unfortunately the execution lacks.

review/summary: Disappointing!
review/text: I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes.  When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it.  My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him.  When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits.  However, the plants just grew and grew.  They became overly bushy and never produced any beans.  I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes.  This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again.

review/summary: More fun than cost effective
review/text: Having gone through two herb seed kits, I have had mixed results.  For my first kit, the basil really thrived and provided me with far more leaves than I could possibly use, and the dill also did well.  Unfortunately, the cilantro never sprouted, the mint provided enough harvest for maybe a few mojitos before it died, and the chives were just barely alive.  I had better luck with the second herb kit: both types of basil and dill did very well again, and the mint was at least respectable.  The cilantro sprouted this time and provided enough leaves for a bit of salsa, but results were still underwhelming. Once again, the chives again were disappointing and barely did anything beyond surviving. I do enjoy watching the plants grow, but the operating costs alone ($20 that seed kits costs plus a few dollars per month on electricity that the bulbs use) are probably far more than it would have cost me to buy these herbs from the grocery store. Still, I'm just not inclined to go and build my own hydroponics garden, and I do plan on using the aerogarden in one way or another until it falls apart.  It only kind of works as advertised, but it is an interesting introduction to hydroponics, and I can't imagine making this product any easier to use.<br /><br />Update:  I tried the salad greens kit and would not recommend it.  The lettuce plants grow quite well, but I find the leaves to be limp and flavorless.

review/summary: Best kit from Aerogarden I've tried to date
review/text: So far, I've grown lettuce and gourmet herbs in the Aerogarden. The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.<br /><br />The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)<br /><br />All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up.

review/text: I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with this seed kit.  First, neither cilantro pod even sprouted.  I went to the Aerogarden website and got replacement pods, but they don't offer a replacement for cilantro, so my garden is not likely to be very "South of the Border".  In addition, the only two pods that are really growing are the globe basil and epozate.  The thyme, parsley and oregano are a pathetic bunch of sprouts that are beginning to turn brown after four weeks.  I'm following the directions and just finished a successful garden, so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong.  These gardens are supposed to be idiot-proof, at any rate.  I would not bother purchasing this seed kit in the future.

review/text: I started this seed kit in February. All three plants grew well but one of the Red Heirloom did not get any flowers. The other I was able to harvest around 6 tomatoes and the Golden variety around 10 tomatoes total. After that I didn't get any more flowers due to having to keep the plants trimmed so they weren't growing into the lights. I would probably not purchase this seed kit again. I love the herb kits and have had nothing but success with them. The tomatoes I found too pricey for the actual yield I got.

review/summary: Not as bad as others say
review/text: I have to agree with one of the other reviews that the kit does become "Bushy" and large for an aerogarden.  I actually thought this might happen since I have grown String beans in an outdoor garden and have seen how big these plants can get.  The size of the "crawl" and the overall size of the plants is much smaller than what you would see in an outdoor garden so don't let the reviews put you off.  The plant will hang over and spread, but so does my lettuce garden.<br /><br />As far as output goes my review is somewhat tainted with the fact that my pump gave out 3 months into growing and I did not figure this out until it was too late to recover.  I harvested a decent sized bowl not too long into growing and the plant was covered with flowers (which obviously was going to produce more beans, much more actually)<br /><br />I don't know what happened to the other reviewers but I got a decent harvest (and in hindsight I think I would have had much more) until my pump went out and killed the plant.  Do I think I was going get $20 worth of beans?  Do you really think you get that from any of these kits?  I don't.  I like the fresh food and the fun of growing them.  Then again with food prices, maybe you can get your money's worth out of these kits, the healthy fair is a nice bonus too.<br /><br />I do recommend getting the trellis to help hold the plant up, the little wires that come with the kit are pretty much worthless.<br /><br />I hope my review helps others.

review/summary: Still haven't mastered the Aerogarden art...
review/text: I tried to post this on the Aerogarden official website, but I doubt it will be approved. It seems they only approve the reviews in which consumers rave on and on about the wonderful qualities of the Aerogarden. My review is meant to reflect my personal experience, which is neither all good or all bad. I just want to be realistic...<br /><br />"Though I do enjoy my Aerogarden, someone needs to come out and say that it's not quite as simple as just sitting back and watching your herbs grow. It requires a lot of careful pruning and there is a certain art to getting everything to grow properly.<br /><br />This is my second Aerogarden, and compared to the first, it was far more successful. In my first garden (the gourmet herbs kit), I was able to keep only the two Basils and Mint alive. This time, I was able to harvest herbs from four out of seven pods. The problem (for me) is that the basil, mint, and parsley grow so much faster than the other herbs that you have to prune them half to death in order to allow slower-growing herbs a chance to get a foothold before there just isn't enough light or room for them to grow. The savory and oregano seedlings got so leggy right away that they just flopped over and never really grew properly. Eventually, it became clear that they'd never grow enough to be worth anything, so I stopped my aggressive pruning and decided to just enjoy the basil, mint, and parsley. Don't know if I'm doing something wrong. I am an avid (outdoor) gardener and I consider myself pretty plant-savvy. I'm going to try again and hope for better results.<br /><br />I'd also like to say that the Aerogarden company does excel in the customer service department. When a couple of my pods failed to sprout, they sent replacements -- no questions asked. They also were willing to impart very good advice and didn't even keep me on hold for very long. I'll keep aero-gardening for some time, even if my yields aren't quite what I feel they should be."

review/summary: A Must Have!!
review/text: Aerogardens are amazing. With very little effort you can grow fresh herbs and produce right in your own kitchen, or anywhere else in your house for that matter. Overall Aerogarden offers a great line of seed pods however with that being said, most Aerogarden owners are at some point going to be tempted to plant something that isn't available and that is where the Master Gardener Kit come into play. It really opens up the world of indoor gardening by allowing you to plant your own seeds. We wanted to plant catnip as not only do we have multiple cats, so does everyone else in my family. I also am a big Bonsai tree aficionado and this kit allows me to use my Aerogarden to start my Bonsai seedlings. This kit gives you a year's worth of seed pods and nutrients.<br /><br />The bottom line - Aerogardens are great but they would be severely limited if it wasn't for the Master Gardener Kit. This kit really opens up the world of indoor gardening. A must have for every Aerogarden owner!!

Also have tried on another set to grow cilantro with no success even after trying to transplant from a very small potted plant, similar failure with trying strawberries.  I'm getting the impression that aerogrow is really good for growing their standard herb package and nothing else.

review/summary: Herbs were great, tomatoes a flop
review/text: I was so pleased with the herbs I grew in my standard Aerogarden I bought a second one so I could grow both herbs and cherry tomatoes. Wrong! The herbs did fine again, but what they fail to tell you is that the tomatoes require 8 hours of absolute darkness. If you want to have the two gardens in the same room, or even in your living area, forget about the tomatoes. Lovely greenery, no blossoms = no tomatoes. I finally just threw them out. I'll grow herbs again, and maybe try another kit, but I can't recommend the cherry tomato kit.

review/summary: Basil explosion
review/text: My gourmet herb kit came with basil, mint, chives, dill, thyme, and parsley, but I refer to it simply as my basil garden.  The dill sprouted late, grew one anemic stalk, and then keeled over dead.  The mint likewise made a meager appearance before turning brown.  The thyme and chives were small but enjoyable, and I had given up on the parsley before it finally flourished and seasoned a few meals.<br /><br />But OH MY GOD DO I HAVE BASIL!  I've trimmed it aggressively many times, only to have it return bigger and bushier and beating out the other herbs for light.  I celebrated the fresh basil for a while, but now I stuff it unceremoniously into ziplocs and store it in the freezer until one day when it will all become pesto.<br /><br />Judging from mine and other reviewers' experiences, the aerogarden produces imperfect and unpredictable results -- but it has been fun to have fresh, growing herbs within my lightless apartment even if the outcome was not as planned.  I look forward to trying other seed kits.

review/summary: A fan of the cilantro and basil!!
review/text: I did the starter kit (parsley, dill, basil, purple basil, cilantro, chives).  It takes a while for everything to emerge, but worth the wait.<br /><br />The cilantro grew like crazy - it practically had a tree trunk coming out of its pod and stole the light from poor little parsley.  I think the dominant plant effect depends on 1) the position of the plants in relation to each other, and 2) where the nutrients land when you throw them in.  It's a good thing that the cilantro took over since it goes well it lots of different types of dishes (Thai, salsas, etc.).<br /><br />Both the green and purple basil are full of flavor and make a kickin' pesto sauce.  Don't harvest the basil too early or it gives up.<br /><br />The mint is a great garnish for mint chocolate chip milkshakes and is perfect for mojitos.

review/summary: Salad Greens kit
review/text: This is the kit I used first with my AeroGarden.  It sprouted well and was ready to harvest in 3 weeks.  My problem is that there is not enough lettuce for 2 dinner size salads.  You are also supposed to only harvest 1/3 of the product, which is enough for a small side salad.<br /><br />It takes about a week from picking to be able to harvest again, and the plants do have long stems.  I won't be getting this kit again.  Hopefully the Herbs will be better.

Admittedly, they take up a lot of room, but I think I can manage that on my own! Each tomato plant costs about $7, which is outrageous. They had better yield a hell of a lot of tomatoes.

review/summary: Out-of-date Salad kit
review/text: This is an out-of-date kit (the ad on the back of the box says, "New for 2007!") so I wasn't surprised that the Romaine lettuces did not sprout. The others are doing fine and sprouted quickly. This is my first time growing salad greens in my AeroGarden, so I was pleased with how quickly everything sprouted and how early I was able to remove the growing domes. With that said, the leaves on the plants are very thin. It has been 3 weeks since I "planted" and I already need to make a small harvest - but early nibbles were disappointingly bitter. I love my AeroGarden, but the company's excessively expensive shipping to Alaska has forced me to go elsewhere (at THEIR suggestion!!) to buy their products. Unfortunately this means I don't have access to fresh kits.

review/text: Be warned: Amazon must have an old or bad batch of herb seeds. Only 4 of the 7 seed pods grew (the parsley, chives and dill never sprouted), and this is our second batch that had some fungus or mold in the purple basil pod. They have changed from the tablet nutrients to some liquid nutrients in a bag, two of which leaked (one was nearly empty and leaked all over the instruction booklet).<br /><br />The seed pods that did grow are growing wonderfully (more basil, mint and thyme that we can use), but it seems to be a shot in the dark whether you'll get a good batch.<br /><br />Based on the quality of this product, I cannot recommend purchasing it.

review/text: I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one.

review/text: Almost to the day, this salad greens garden only lasted 3 months... I thought it would last 6 !!  It was good stuff, healthy, produced good for the first couple of months especially.  I was just sorry to see it end so soon, made the salad greens quite expensive.  We eat a big salad just about every day with dinner.  The greens available at any given time was never enough for us both.  I'd rather see them do away with the mixture and offer the best leafy one for the whole seven holes in the Aerogarden.  The "spring mix" and another one (I forget it's name at the moment) did not produce quickly or enough.  I will look for those generic refills so I can make up my own salad greens garden the next time around.  This was just too expensive for what it produced.

Sadly, the green beans I considered a bust. I got one meager handful of beans from this; no more. I'm going back to the herbs after this.<br />One thing that is a challenge with the beans - once they flower, you have to be your own "bee" to get them pollinated.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would not recommend this seed kit.

review/text: I started this seed kit four weeks ago. It started a little slower than the salad greens that I've previously grown. It took three weeks before I could harvest a small amount, but now it's growing fast. I think it's doing better than the salad greens which I tried four times, always grew very leggy and didn't last two months. I'm hoping the romaine will last longer. Although it's fun and easy to grow, it's way more expensive than buying organic from the store.

review/summary: Chili Peppers Seed Kit not very fruitful
review/text: Today is June 29th and I began this adventure on March 1st, 4 months ago and the production expectancy for this set.  The sprouting was slow, but the CS Rep from AeroGrow suggested I be patient.  He said they would really take off once they sprouted.  Well, they did and we were off to the races.  So far, 1 mini jalapeno and 1 purple super hot have bit the dust completely.  The second mini jalapeno grew huge but never produced a single pepper.  Two of the purple super hots are still alive, but have never even produced a flower either.  Both of the red fires are lush and have produced a total of 10 peppers so far.  Considering the cost of electricity, the kit, the extra nutrients which needed to be purchased because there are not enough included, the replacement light kit, and the hours upon hours of talking to, touching, fertilizing by movement and a tiny hand held fan (CSR's suggestion) These are the most expensive peppers I've ever consumed.  I'm thinking of transplanting these into my garden plot to see if they ever produce.  I have one more seed kit (herbs) which I'm going to give a try and then I'm going to give up on this, and I'm not going to buy another set of bulbs even though it's advised.  If you want alot of leaves which you do not consume, then this is the seed kit for you.  I, on the other hand, wanted something to use in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, a couple of the pods never sprouted, and the others that did took such a long time and ultimately ended up dying shortly after coming up. I have purchased other seed kits from Aerogrow and have had great success. This one was a dud. After the fact, I did some research and found that others had marginal success, so not sure if it was something we did, or just a bad batch of seeds. Amazon was great about refunding the full purchase price, and I thought about purchasing another to see if we would have better luck, but decided against it based on the few reviews I read. Maybe others will have better luck.

review/summary: Home made wine kit review
review/text: I am very pleased with this product. Delivery was quick and there were more items in the box than expected. Came with juice, 30 corks.30 labels 30 gold foil caps, additives and instructions. Some of the bottles I used were large and some were small, but we ended up with 29.5 bottles. I let the wine sit a little longer than the instructions advised so it took 32 days from opening the box to popping the cork on a chilled bottle. The wine came out a little dry but still very tasty. We are planning to buy the same kit and make another batch but add a little sweetener at the end. Out of 29.5 bottles a week ago we are down to ten. Time to start another batch. This was my first try at making wine and I am very pleased.<br />Mike

review/text: I can't find a true "Hot and Spicy" dill pickle in the state of OK.<br /><br />These are thick sliced pickles, very crunchy, good dill flavor, and a medium heat level.<br /><br />If they were thinner they would rock on a sammich. (Since original review, sliced in half and put on sammich. Excellent)<br /><br />Jar was [..]. Shipping bumped it up to $14.05. Ridiculously high. (Since original review, price is a little high, but the flavor is worth it.)<br /><br />But, throw in 3 jars, keep the shipping price the same, and I am there!!<br /><br />Will buy again. Now just bump up the HEAT!!

review/text: These pickles are ADDICTIVE. From the first time I sampled one at the Rosemeade Market and Greenhouse in Carrollton, TX, I have been obsessed.  These pickles pack the perfect amount of heat and tartness.  If you don't like things real spicy, try the "Purdy Hot" pickles. If you like your tongue to burn with the fire of a thousands suns, try Harold's famous Beer Pickles. These Durn Hots sit right in the middle at "just right" for me.

review/text: From what I've seen on the jar, these pickles are made in Dallas.  I like to buy as much as I can from nearby, to support our local economy.  In the Texas Panhandle, Pak A Sak sells these.  I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I tried them.  It's almost scary, that the pickled cukes are A LOT hotter than the pickled habaneros that they share a jar with.  The flavor is a little garlicky, a little tart, and very spicy.  I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's also a plus that there's no preservatives or chemicals in the product.  I will definitely try the other flavors.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended!

review/text: There is nothing special about this side dish. There is a  hint of tomato, a hint of some other spices and a very vague ting of heat.<br /><br />The dish is VERY easy to prepare but there is nothing special about it nor anything terribly wrong either. There are no "off-tastes" - really there is not much taste - period.<br /><br />I'm afraid bland says it all. To call this dish "Mexican" seems terribly wrong. Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.<br /><br />At the right price I'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes. They are extremely easy to prepare, have no off tastes -- yet they are not stellar.<br /><br />My favorites in the Lipton/Knorr family are the Teriyaki Rice and the Stroganoff and Alfredo noodles.

review/summary: IT'S A HIT !!!  STOPPED SMELLY POOP!!!!
review/text: This product is definitely a hit with my two finicky cats.  One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.<br /><br />I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!  I haven't found anyone to beat their prices!<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Incredible food!
review/text: We recently found that our cat has an allergy to chicken so we went on a search for a food that was equal in quality to the ones she was use to.  Our first attempt at a replacement was lamb and brought catastrophic results.  Her eyes even got red and swollen from just a few bites!  Very sad.  We had given her duck before so I felt it would be pretty safe to try this one. Being from the school of hesitation, first she sniffed her bowl at every point it seemed.  I was beginning to wonder if she would grace me with consuming it at all.  First she nibbled on some of her regular food that was mixed in, which tonight was the Newman's organic turkey.  Then she started in on the duck and that was it!  She finished her whole bowl and licked it clean in good time for her because she is my pokey one.  It seems like a winner for her and I have to say I was very impressed with the food as well.  The consistency is like a course grind which I think she liked better than a smooth pate.  You could see the carrots and peas mixed in and it had a nice sauce around it.  This seems like a regular for her.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-2011 : I do have to say that our allergy challenged kitty started having the same itchy, scaly skin with this duck as she did with her chicken.  I still would give it 5 stars though, because it is an incredible food...just not for her.  Turns out all she seems to be able to eat is rabbit.  She loves it and there hasn't been anymore flaky skin or excessive shedding since she has been on only that protein.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-13-2012 : Our oldest cat has now developed a chicken allergy so I tried this for her and she still was flaky too.  I think the turkey liver, which is the second ingredient, has been the culprit all along.  We'll see as we go on with her testing.  She is able to have rabbit and beef though so that is a huge peace of mind for me.  Blue Buffalo makes a duck that is all duck and we are trying that for her as well.  I did take a star away from my original review because I can't believe a company would mix proteins when people are obviously looking for single protein solutions.

review/summary: Even Mr. Bi...Witch & Moan Loves It
review/text: A few years ago, my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to IBD and then Pancreatitis. We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature's Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he'll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he'll also eat just not always.<br /><br />He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He's active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn't survive, he couldn't survive, without this food.<br /><br />I'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn't doesn't like leftovers. It doesn't hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz.

review/summary: Worked great for my cat
review/text: This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more "grainy". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that this Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>

The demands of the breeder caused the deal to fall through so my unspoiled cat reaps the benefit of the non-returnable gourmet cat food.  He loves the duck and now will not eat his dry food except when I win the face off and he is forced to eat a morsel or two.  He is now a spoiled brat and I am forced, at gunpoint, to order this $1.27 a can gourmet duck!  Well I guess he is worth it with all the abuse he has had to experience with my less than desireable diet.  Thanks a lot Nature's Variety!

He can very quickly lose weight and become dehydrated - this is a constant worry for me. However, he absolutely adores this Instinct Duck flavour. He will eat an entire tin in one sitting if allowed. He also likes the Instinct Lamb flavour ... but not as much as the Duck. The only other food he really loves and will consistently eat is the ZiwiPeak Lamb flavour. I've tried all kinds of expensive prescription foods, but Instinct Duck and ZiwiPeak Lamb have thus far been the best products for my cat.

But likes the duck better and eats about 7 times a day. She has an allergy that she cant have normal cat food--- she gets sick on about every other cat food. Yes she also drinks about 2 cups of water per day also and has feline leuikemia since  she was 2 yr old.  This stuff works and your cat will love it also. Do I recommend it Yes i do....

review/summary: Perfect food for picky kitty
review/text: I started buying this food for our cat after offering her "tastings" of many of the high quality foods out there. She has a sensitive stomach and is 13 years old. We narrowed it down to the chicken and duck flavors. She liked both, but definitely went crazy for the duck flavor. The subscription makes it easy (no more last-minute runs to the store) and our cat is much healthier and happier after switching her to a non-grain food. Highly recommend. P.S. part of our order contained some cans that had much more liquid than food in them (had never happened to us before) and Amazon promptly sent a replacement at no additional cost. Great customer service!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: My cats love this Duck formula. It has a better solid/liquid ratio than the venison and the lamb. Both of those varieties can be too dry and too solidly pressed for my cats to eat comfortably. To those formulas I usually add some water and mash them up before serving. With the Duck formula - the consistency agrees with them right out of the can. Also, the Duck formula appears to be better mixed at the factory; with other Instinct Grain-Free formulas, I find clumps of white matter - appearing like cottage cheese, however, there is no cottage cheese in them. The Duck formula does not have this problem.

review/text: I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called "cat" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers.  My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk.  It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crap you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you!  Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Gummi Worms FOR TEH WIN
review/text: Hands down the god of snackfood.<br /><br />They take the succulent sweetness of gummi-bears, and elongate it into pure ecstasy of the mouth. They are great at all times and cure any woe. I come home from a hard days work, and suck down a few slimy ones. They are colourful and grand. Everyone should buy gummi worms. If you dont buy gummi worms, then you dont like having a party in your mouth

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: The gummy worms were fine.  I put them in little scary cups and gave them to the neighbor children for Halloween, and they loved them.  But honestly, $5 for the candy and $5 for the shipping is a little out of line for the sad little shrink bag of about 30 worms.  I won't purchase candy through Amazon again.

review/summary: Yummy gummy worms
review/text: I bought these gummy worms for my boyfriend who is somewhat of a gummy worms connoisseur. He said they were definitely one of the better gummy worms he's had and that the gummy worms were fresh definitely made it more enjoyable.

review/summary: B.I.N. G.O.
review/text: Fridays is BINGO day in room 5. First grade likes BINGO sight words over BINGO math facts, where oddly they can read "every word" unlike when they are called to the "Little Room" by the reading specialist once a trimester to read "the 100 word list." Funny, but my prize for a BINGO seems to motivate paying attention. You get to eat "a worm." I personally feel not many 1st grades can boast that.<br /><br />Sour last year was "the thing," this year they are into sweet. It is completely aligned with future indicators whether you like sweet or sour worms. A kind of diagnostic. I'll let you derive the matrix, I learned it in years of teacher training and without consultant fees this stuff is pretty sensitive to give out over the net.<br /><br />I prefer the tang and the sweet sugar rubbing off a sour worm some days.Then I know pretty much that little bite is coming.Umm... Then there are the days like today when the clean sweet worm hits the spot.<br /><br />I doubt there is a drop of nutritional value nor anyone holding on to these as extrinsic delights anymore. Probably it's a yogurt raisin universe. Still I do like to savor one with my tofu laced mug of smoothie fruit shake. And watch the kids show me how motivating it is to continually de-contextualize and rote the learning of a word list (noticed first because these were the sight pieces in literature once counted up as most common words in text) often seen as stand alone comedy bits now with many 6 year old. I call it " Words you gotta know so you can't read them in the books we don't allow for lack of time and understanding why you need to read"....no not really, but literature has taken quite a beating in our routines in 8 years.... we do not read enough to really see as useful these exercises in words within something as foreign as a "book." Oh no, it's simply too often an end in itself. A mistake for it causes no wholeness of knowledge. Fool's paradise. Too much time to drill, not enough to apply. Good to try to explain to the ether. Have a worm. Sit down.<br /><br />I particularly like this company as they keep pretty well and aren't those rock hard plastic ones. My daughters turned me on to them long ago when we were trying to make our days fun. Other reviewers here have excellent ideas! A nose slurpie, wow! I recall dissecting a realer one in high school. After that came the frog then pig. I suppose we could chop them lengthwise but why rush it. They probably moved that stuff into third grade anyway....so they could all demonstrate the excellence we have developed these past few years in our lesson design.

review/summary: a childhood favorite
review/text: This is a true story.  Once, many years ago, I was on vacation with my family at a famous amusement park in Florida.  My father bought a package of gummi worms. He removed a worm from the package and inserted one end into his nostril and the other end into his mouth.  He then slurped the worm into his mouth, mortifying my mother.  These gummy worms allow me to reinact that pivotal moment from my childhood and feel like a kid all over again.

review/text: I have a mini Chihuahua and she is the PICKIEST eater in the world. She won't touch wet food and only eats a certain brand of kibbles (the ones that are catered to Chihuahua's). Anyway, it's a pain in the [...] to find treats that she likes but when it comes to this brand and this particular flavor (lamb), she goes CRAZY over it. If you have a finicky eater, try this treat.

review/summary: old candy
review/text: This product arrived on time but it sure wasn't fresh.  The caramel part is hard and one must hold it in their mouth awhile to soften it up so it is chewy.  If this had been the first product I purchased thru Amazon I would not be purchasing any more thru you.  I have purchased the vanilla caramel creams locally many times and they were nice and soft and chewy.  Cannot get the strawberry or chocolate flavored creams here so decided to order thru Amazon, much to my disappointment.  Will never order from Office Snax again.  Hope this can prevent someone else from getting stuck with stale candy.  Lorraine Oelschlager<br /><br />I ordered the Office Snax Goetz's Caramel Cream Assorted,  24-Ounce Tub  (Pack of 3)

review/summary: Refreshing scent
review/text: Bought this after speaking with a co-worker. It seems this is the cure all cream in India.  Personally, I take turmeric when ever I have a boil, or impetigo.  I get both on a regular basis.  This cream is soothing, and feels wonderful.  I really like this cream, and smells wonderful.  I understand you can use this for a variety skin care concerns, blemishes, overall skin quality, and boils.  I have had great results with this cream, and I will be ordering it again.

review/summary: Best condiment made
review/text: Huli Huli sauce is that condiment that you can't find or describe anywhere else but just by taste.  It isn't soy sauce or huisan sauce or worschire(sic)or Maggi nor any combination of either.  It is the sauce that restaurants use on take-out teriyaki chicken with rice or gyoza dip.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive but aren't all the best things in life that way?  I purchased 6 bottles, gave 2 away and am nearly finished with the first one my family and I have used.

review/text: We have used Huli Huli sauce for years.  In the past we were able to get it from local stores.  I found it online, but the bottles are heavy and shipping costs were extremely expensive.  This company uses the US box for a flat rate.  We are now able to get our beloved Huli Huli sauce and keep it on our kitchen shelf at all times.

review/summary: Much Lower Price !!!
review/text: I Live in Federal Way, WA.  This sauce is teriffic, I highly reccommend it !!  I Put chicken in a ziplock bag, pour in some sauce, seal, give the bag a massage, and let set overnite in the fridge.  Then bake in the oven till done, this comes out quite tasty !!!! Only thing is,  I can buy this this sauce in a Asian store in town, for $5.99 a bottle, quite cheaper, for the same size bottle !! So check any Asian stores in your area, for substantial savings....

review/summary: Cats also are enticed by these!
review/text: We have one cat who insists that the Sergeant's Sniffers Shake-Ins be put on his food.  Just a few granules will get him to eat his wet food when he is being picky.  Our other two cats don't seem to be affected, but if you have a cat who is finicky, you might give these a try.  I don't know what we would do without it for the cat who loves it.  He seems to prefer the bacon flavor.
