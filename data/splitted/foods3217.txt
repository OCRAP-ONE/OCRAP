review/summary: Moldy bread
review/text: The bread shipped quickly and arrived ahead of schedule but that did not keep the bread from being moldy.  I received 6 loafs of this bread and 2 had to be thrown out because they were moldy.  That aside, the bread is tasty when toasted with a topping (quite delicious with butter or frosting).

review/summary: Pretty good toasted.
review/text: This is the first and thus far only gluten-free bread I have tried. I find it quite tasty and satisfying when toasted and unfortunately inedible (DRY!) when not. I like it enough toasted that I would continue to buy it. I was very surprised by the fat content-4.5 grams of fat and 100 calories per SKINNY slice. That makes a hefty sandwich diet-wise. Still, being able to eat bread when I couldn't before is worth it. The loaves come individually air-tight wrapped so there is no need to freeze, which is great. Also very impressed with the company-one loaf in my box had the seal compromised and was MOLDY. When I contacted the company they sent me a 6 loaf box free of charge. So, overall...if you don't mind toasting I find this a great bread to enjoy SPARINGLY due to fat content.

review/text: I eat alot of organic foods and health foods but this has to be one of the worst tasting food items I've tried.  Maybe it taste better toasted but I was under the impression you could make sandwhiches with it.  I like my them untoasted.  Do you want to know what this tast like? It taste like soft sawdust.  I'm not kidding you.  I will try their other bread but this was aweful.  Please consider changing the recipe.  The bread breaks apart easily and has ruined what ever I've eated with it.  Very bad tasing.  I have to eat it though because I live in a rural place and have to wait till I'm out to reorder my foodstuff.  I wish I had a toaster maybe it would taste different.  I've made a few sadwiches with no bread because it taste better plain and even dipping it in dishes let's see I dipped it in beans still tasted aweful and diped it in some soups.  It's definatly the bread.  :)

review/summary: A More Exotic Chai Flavor
review/text: I wish I'd found this earlier this holiday season but actually this tea is great year round. It is not caffeinated so you can drink it at night as you sit by the fire. The ingredients are interesting and include: organic rooibos, organic ginger, organic nutmeg, organic licorice root, organic chicory root, cinnamon flavor and caramel flavor. I drink this with two tablespoons of powdered milk and a packet of stevia. This tea is also fair trade certified. Zhena's Gypsy Tea continues to amaze. This is such a creative company and their products are of a very high quality. If you like chai tea then you will love this. It is even a little more exotic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I love this tea! It is like a warm pumpkin pie in a mug. I add little stevia to it, and it makes it even more delicious! For me personally, it helps with not snacking throughout the day, because it satisfies my desire to have something sweet. I would highly recommend this tea if you like the spices in a pumpkin or apple pie; one other thing, unlike other holiday teas it does have a more ginger flavor if you like that, as I do.

As a matter of fact, we used the whole box in about a month. I will definitely buy these on a regular basis!

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My last cat became diabetic because I didn't understand the damage that most commercial dry foods inflict.  By switching that cat to a canned food diet and monitoring his carbohydrates, I got him off insulin and he lived another five years after his diagnosis.<br /><br />When I got my current cat I was determined to never go through that again.  Imagine my dismay upon realizing that this new cat gives a whole new meaning to the word "fussy"...and that he'd cheerfully starve to death rather than eat something just because I decided it would be good for him.  Unfortunately, most canned foods were on the list.<br /><br />I eventually did find some excellent canned foods that he would eat, but I also discovered this dry food.  As others have mentioned, it's grain-free, which is my highest priority in a cat food - canned or dry.  After researching the other dry foods out there, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ONLY one I'll feed my cat.  (It's a good thing he likes it!)<br /><br />I hope others get to the same place I did and realize that too many of the foods on the market today are downright toxic.  I also hope others realize this before their cat's diet turns into a chronic health problem.  Because sure, this food is more expensive than Meow Mix and even the "premium" foods like Iams and Science Diet...but it's still far, far cheaper to choose a more expensive food than it is to battle a chronic health problem.<br /><br />(That said, I would recommend doing some comparison shopping and find places where it's on sale.  Right now this seller's food is listed at $12.99 for 2-point-something pounds.  You can find it cheaper elsewhere.)

review/summary: I would not recommend this food.
review/text: May 15, 2012.  I purchased both Turkey and Chicken dry cat food and Weight Management Adult dry cat food about a month ago.  Both my cats began to vomit after eating the food for a couple weeks.  One of them got so ill she threw up bile for 4 days and would not eat.  She ended up in the kitty hospital for 3 days on IV fluids, antibiotics and steroids.  An object on the xray led the vet to think that she had cancer.  After 5 days of anguish thinking my cat was dying, they did an ultrasound which revealed either an ulcer or a reactive lymph node related to the gastrointestional tract.  The vet feels there was an intolerance or allergy to the food which has caused the GI/node issues.  My cat will remain on the medications for another 10 days. Then we will ultrasound again, and perhaps surgery will be required.  This has cost about $1200 so far and I would not recommend this food to anyone.

review/summary: Helps keep your cat healthy
review/text: This is an excellent food for your cat since meat is the first ingredient, the cheaper brands of dry cat food all contain huge amounts of carbs, though they are not listed as such among the proteins and vitamin statistics. Basic science lesson: carbs are converted to sugar by the digestive process, the more carbs the more sugar and the higher risk of your cat contracting diabetes. But yes, higher protein does cause smellier bowel movements. If you love your cat, you'll opt for better food and put automatic scent sprayer by the litterpan.

Incidentally she also said that the best way to control litter box odors is by buying quality food like this. The smell of my cat's number 2s are absolutely horrendous. It is something the litter box cannot contain and it smells the entire apartment. It is something I cannot take and was glad that I bought the small bag.<br /><br />Incidentally my cat didn't seem to like it either. He would be hungry at dinner time and when this would be poured in would nibble at it. Or he would eat the wet food and leave this until he was forced to.  He has been sleeping much more and has been less playful.<br /><br />Never again!

review/text: One of my cats has become diabetic and I must have some dry food on hand so that I can leave home for a long day [wet food after a bit gets dried out and won't be touched].  Was just at my local pet store, saw this, but thought I'd like to look at reviews first.  Then, when I saw the price here, I thought terrific as the 6.5 pound bag at the store was about $20.  Nearly instantly ordered a bag ["free" shipping]. Thankfully, folks here pointed out the miserable two+ pounds for close to $15.  When I went back to the page with the photo I noted that the weight was not displayed there and had to find it neatly tucked away from obvious view much further down.  Pfui.

By the time the express shipping is added to the order, each block of cheese has a fairly hefty price tag.

review/summary: One of the best I have received
review/text: I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses, but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out.  This is one of them.  I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it.  The quality of this cheese, even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where, is absolutely excellent.  My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one.  Secret for you:  I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away, and simply not share!  I do recommend you give this sampler a try...you will be absolutely delighted.

review/summary: Great breakfast addition
review/text: Don't know why I decided to try my spelt flakes with my oatmeal but I did and am so glad I decided to experiment! I do 50/50 oatmeal/spelt. It makes the oatmeal  chewy, which I like and so does the little one with whom I share my breakfast! I like them so much I have them delivered regularly by Amazon so I don't run out.<br /><br />Little hint.... I have saved up little butter tubs(8 oz. ones). I spread them out on the table, put 1/4 cup of oatmeal in each, add 1/4 cup of spelt flakes to each and top off with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in each. Top goes on and I stack them on the pantry shelf. Time comes to eat, I dump the contents in a bowl, fill the butter tub with water, which I pour over the cereals, pop them in the microwave for 2 min. (on my microwave) and I have a quick yummy breakfast!

review/text: I bought this tea because I never tried Turkish tea from the Black Sea before and I wanted to know what it tasted like.  I purchased this particular brand because I enjoy apple juice so I thought they would make a good combination.  Although the tea gave me the taste of the Turkish tea I was craving I did not care for the apple tastes at all.  Therefore I will not buy this product again.  I thought the product was a little on the expensive side as well.

review/summary: Okay but not the best of the MTR soups
review/text: The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.  Overall, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the contents of the pouch, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I used it as a base and added leftover peas, carrots, and corn and pasta but I do think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UURF5W">MTR Hot & Sour Clear Soup</a> is better for this purpose.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, edible starch, potato, carrot, cabbage, khol khol, beans, peas, sugar, salt, onion, macaroni, refined sunflower oil, garlic, and pepper.<br /><br />Khol khol is more universally referred to as kholrabi, a vegetable in the cabbage family that looks much like a turnip.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian and appears to be vegan but is not labelled as such.  The nutrition information is per serving at five to a packet but two or three servings would be much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup and a little over half a cup per serving is not realistic unless you serve it in a teacup.<br /><br />Calories 35<br />Calories from fat 5<br />Total fat 0.5g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 600mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein less than 0g<br />Vitamin A 4%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 3.0g of sodium.

review/summary: Savory Sauce!
review/text: Crosse and Blackwell is my go to brand of chutney. I found this variety of chutney at one of our local stores a couple of weeks ago. I just wish I could remember which store. It has carmelized onion which I am mad for!<br />It is wonderful on so many things - roast beef sandwiches - chicken curry - a spread with cheese and french bread... The flavor is very similar to the British branston chutney served with a classic pub lunch in the UK. Nicely oniony, and the sweet/tart  of sugar and vinegar is artfully balanced. But the consistancy is wetter and smoother than the Branston,making it easier to spread on a sandwich. I am not too keen the diced vegies in  Crosse  & Blackwell's Branston pickle. This chutney  suits me much better. Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Great dark tea
review/text: I learned to love English "black" teas drinking Tetley during a study abroad trip in London. The taste is unlike anything found in coffee shops or grocery store shelves in the States. Tetley, like Typhoo, has an impressively strong English Breakfast taste--so strong that I found myself using 5-6 English breakfast teabags after my return to the US simply *trying* (and failing) to duplicate the flavor. After many unsuccessful attempts, I was disappointed to find that Tetley was not available at Costco World Market or any other import stores in my area. Reluctant to ask my British friends to mail me some, I decided to try the only brand that was available, which was Typhoo. This stuff, in my opinion, is very similar to but ever so slightly better than Tetley.<br /><br />For those who haven't tried this "kind" of tea before, I'll describe it in a word as being very heavy. One teabag can powerfully flavor a large American mug of water--far more, thankfully, than the 8-ounce maxim most instant beverage companies push. Its taste, like I've said, is similar to a very strong English Breakfast tea, but that taste is so strong that I personally would hesitate to call it by that name. It's an altogether different kind of tea in my opinion, labeled on the bag simply as "black tea," reminiscent only (in my experience) of Tetley and PG-Tips. With just water, it produces a rich, slightly bitter drink with a somewhat fruity aftertaste. Adding cold milk to the already-steeped drink can smooth the tart taste a bit (as well as cool the drink if you're not one for piping hotness). Adding sugar to either the dark or "white" versions can change the flavor more than you'd expect, too. The first cup of Tetley I ever drank had *a lot* of milk and sugar in it, and the taste wasn't ruined at all: it tasted very much like a sweet and mild desert drink, something like cocoa (only with a completely different flavor). The same, I've found, is true of Typhoo. I've not tried it with honey, lemon, or any other additions.<br /><br />The teabags diffuse their flavor FAST. If you're one to microwave your water (blasphemous in all parts of the world except America, and with good reason, you might know, if you've ever tried tea made with stovetop- or kettle-boiled water), you can have a cup ready in about two minutes. Electric kettles are available too that are designed specifically for boiling water and can accomplish the task faster and better than a microwave. (These products, incidentally, are great for anyone who drinks lots of hot beverages of any kind: though the devices' directions will tell you to only use them to heat water, I regularly boil milk and other non-viscous liquids in mine without problems.) To help with the steeping process, put the teabag in an empty mug or cup and pour the hot water over the bag. The water will immediately begin turning a dark amber color. After a few seconds, if the water is stirred, the diffusion process will speed up, and before you know it, poof! You have a very dark bronze, almost black, cup of tea with the strongest flavor you could hope for. Great for the office or people on the go.<br /><br />Sadly, to me at least, this tea tastes horrible when cold. If you have a tendency to let your hot drinks sit undrank until they are no longer hot drinks (oh, the tragedy!), you may be disappointed in the consequences of inattention to this cuppa. The actual flavor doesn't change much, if at all, but the strong punch this beverage packs is far better suited for a hot drink than a cold one, a problem this tea's weaker English Breakfast competitors don't face. Though this is an opinion, my advice is to not allow this (or any other tea) to become cold, if only for the fact that drinking hot tea which, through apathy, preoccupation, or forgetfulness, has been forced to watch teary-eyed as its hotness slips away, is the most cruel sort of ridiculous. Be kind to your tea and drink it fast, lest it begin to believe it is not tea at all, but perhaps some mutated spawn of the Kool-Aid Man.<br /><br />Ergo, this product makes for an excellent meal tea or desert drink, though not necessarily for breakfast on account of its heady flavor. Oh, and this is a good tea for English biscuits, too, though I would only drink it with the plain ones. (Chocolate doesn't get on well with this stuff.)

review/summary: Full bodied, well rounded
review/text: I live in Japan, a land of excellent green tea but when it comes to brown (the Japanese call it red) I prefer British. The only British teas sold here in Japan are Twingings and Liptons. I don't like the fussy leafy taste of the most "prestigious" big British tea manufacturer, Twinings. The Liptons sold here is weak, and other brown teas here taste like cardboard. I import tea bags from Britain.<br /><br />The British drink a lot of brown tea. I guess that this means that they have the purchasing power to get the best ingredients shipped, processed and packed most efficiently. Of the big three British teabag producers in order of retail volume, PG-Tips, Tetley, Typhoo, the former is for me a little too leafless and rounded, so thick it is reminscent of Cocoa and in that sense perhaps the most "British". I prefer the the "fresher" taste of Ty-Phoo and PG Tips. They are almost fruitily fresh. All are excellent and will change your perception of tea if you have not tasted tea from the small island.

review/text: I endorse the opinions of previous reviewers. From time to time I have been served flavorful, enjoyable tea (in restaurants and people's homes), and I have tried long and hard to duplicate that flavor at home. But I never could. I thought I must be doing something wrong -- preparing the tea wrong, steeping it too long, getting stale tea, or something. I could never match that delicious tea flavor I remembered and liked so much.<br /><br />Then I bought some Typhoo tea (at Big Lots -- cheap, but who knows when they'll have it again?). Now I know the fault wasn't mine. It was the fault of the cardboard-tasting tea I had always got in supermarkets before. There isn't a brand of tea in our supermarkets that can match the wonderful taste of this tea.

When we visited England and Scotland, 25 years ago, I had my first taste...and there is absolutely no match to the lovely comforting taste of Ty-phoo!  I have tried so many other "English Breakfast" teas here in America, but none can touch the lovely flavor and rich smell of Ty-phoo.  As soon as I take a sip with a touch of sweetner and a little whole/2% milk (NOT cream)I am transported back to the British Isles and I feel instantly calmed and delighted!

The tea leaves immediately release a delightfully scented reddish liquor to the pot.  Compared to American tea, which tastes like brown water, Typhoo tates like...TEA, a bold, fragrant beverage that stands up to added milk and sugar(that's the way I like it).  I also prefer the tea bags to the loose tea as the loose variety is cut very fine so that even my finest tea infuser left tea sludge in the cup.

review/text: Having traveled in England and Scotland, I have enjoyed many different types of tea.  But on the cool, damp nights when one might want a cup of tea for a bit of comfort, I have been glad to have Typhoo as a first choice.  It is hardly exotic in England or Scotland as it is readily available on most store shelves there.  In the States it is more difficult to locate, though well worth the trouble.  With a bit of honey, sugar, or sweetener, it is a very smooth and pleasant tea without any unfortunate aftertastes.  And with a lightly sweet biscuit (or cookie), it is enough to teach an American the virtues of tea time.

They are not as hard as conventional lifesavers; they have a softer texture, which is more enjoyable to chew as it crushes gently.<br /><br />Each mint is individually wrapped, which makes these a great choice for candy dishes.<br /><br />I usually have one to two after lunch and my breath feels fresh for the rest of the afternoon.  A good choice of breath-fresheners!

review/summary: Perfect flavor extract
review/text: I'm having great success with the simple Cuisinart ice cream maker to make many different flavors, but thought I was stymied concerning pistachio (using Trader Joe's out-of-the shell nuts) until I found this product at LeRoux Kitchens in Portland, Maine. It's perfect, just a scant 1/8 tsp of the extract does the job for the two-cup capacity of the machine.<br /><br />Those who complain about this product probably haven't read the listed contents, where it is made very clear that this is a highly concentrated extract. For sure, don't try to taste-test it on your finger tip.

review/summary: Simple, Amazing, Delicious
review/text: I'm a huge tea drinker; loose tea, bagged tea, any kind of tea. I personally prefer simpler teas without too many competing flavors.<br /><br />I used to rub lemons with sugar cubes to infuse my green tea with a lemon flavor. It tasted amazing. Then I bought these tea bags on a whim and I haven't gone back. It's easier, there's less mess and it tastes just as great. I go through as many as six or seven cups a day.<br /><br />I buy mine at a local grocery store instead of online and as long as Bigelow makes them and my local grocery store sells them, I'll continue to buy them.

review/summary: Okay, even though I've eaten them for years
review/text: I wonder when Keebler first started making these - it seems like forever because I remember eating them when I was very small and believe me, that was a LONG time ago!  The chocolate on these shortbread cookies tends to be a bit on the semi-sweet side, more towards the NOT sweet side, so if you have stomach problems that are aggravated by chocolate, you might want to skip these.  They are eaten here but VERY slowly so keep that in mind - these are always passed up by the boys so again, keep that in mind if you're new to this product.  Boys will eat about anything that isn't nailed down and if these are overlooked, well, you kind of get the idea.

review/text: My mom is to blame for my newest addiction. She sent me these as a part of my birthday present and now I'm utterly in need of having them around at all times.<br /><br />As a lifelong lacto-ovo vegetarian I've never had gummis of any sort before. Now that I've had these I can understand the draw. At least as far as these imitate the real, gelatin based, gummi is concerned.<br /><br />These are chewy, yet not taffy chewy. They're more akin to a marshmallow that uses kosher gelatin, with a melting effect the longer it stays in your mouth. The flavors are fruity and not too sour. They're truly delicious!<br /><br />Whether you're vegetarian or not, I believe that you should definitely give them a chance. If you have children, the tapioca based recipe may be a touch better for their health - sugar is not the first ingredient!<br /><br />I know I love them and will continue to keep them on hand for a small snack that doesn't make me feel too guilty to have them included in my diet.

Perhaps how Juno's tongue looks after the blue slurpy (in the movie "Juno"...).  What a failure.

I was afraid these would be too salty, but they have just the right amount of salt. They're also very crispy and have a wonderful "buttery" taste without all of the fat that you'd expect.<br /><br />The pita chips are thin enough to enjoy right out of the bag, but thick enough to be useful with dips. You definitely need to try with hummus because it seems like the shape and size were made perfectly for dipping. Best of all, the light seasoning doesn't overpower the flavor.

review/summary: Surprisingly good, tasty, chip worthy
review/text: The more "healthy" snacks I taste, the more leery I become of reviews because 99% don't come anywhere near their not-so-healthy counterparts and most taste like cardboard with chemicals or fruit juice that are supposed to taste like the real thing.  I don't know if the people who think they are equivalent are just so into healthy food that all of it is "delicious" to them,(my mom can eat an unflavored rice cake and rave about it - ughh) or if they've never had the equivalent and therefore don't really know the difference, or if they've eaten so many bad "healthy" foods that the slightest decent taste is considered terrific - but most of the time, they are not.<br /><br />Some I'll eat anyway for the sake of a healthy alternative - but do admit they aren't very good and other times it's just not worth spending so much more money for something I have to force myself to eat and hate every minute of it, and even worse it increases the craving for "REAL FOOD" that was made for taste.<br /><br />However, these "naked" chips are actually very good, and chip worthy.  I sought them out from my pantry on purpose yesterday.  There's a difference between wanting a yummy snack and settling on a healthy one and actually purposely wanting to eat something, and it happens to also be healthier than chips.  These are chip worthy in every way.  They are salty enough, crunchy enough, and have enough taste for you to want them, and enjoy them and not feel like, now I want a real chip.  I was very pleased and very surprised...however, I do not feel the same way about the cinnamon and sugar variety -those are nowhere near what I wanted.  I was thinking they would be like a cinnamon and sugar bagel chip but they are not - the pita taste takes over the tiny bit of cinn/sugar on them.  Not nearly as sweet as any cinn/sugar product I've had - healthy version or not.  I'm trying to force feed myself when I want a sweet, but I think I'll end up giving away the cinn/sugar ones.  It actually has more cinnamon and very little sugar which kills any chance of sweet - and again the strong pita taste overwhelms the little bit of taste there actually is present.

review/summary: Tasty Rocks
review/text: I have mixed feelings about this product.  The pita chips are tasty, being flavorful and lightly salted; however, they are very hard.  I feel like I'm consuming slate when eating these.  Most of the chips are comprised of the two sides of the pita "pocket" layered together solidly.  A few of the chips are just one-half of that (one side of the pocket), and those are not too hard.  If you like bagel chips, you might like these.  I would say these are even harder than bagel chips, but they are similar.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this product is that there are many broken chips in the bag.  It appeared that at least one-half of the chips had shattered into tiny pieces.  These pieces are too small to do anything with, except maybe throw them on top of a casserole.  But that's not what you are paying for in this product.  I might have just gotten some badly mangled ones; but because these are so brittle, I can see that they would shatter easily.  So I just wanted to warn others that you might only get about one-half value out of the bag, in terms of chips being a reasonable size.  Even the usable chips vary a lot in size and shape.<br /><br />These do taste good, and I'm disappointed that otherwise I find them unpalatable, because these would be great for hummus.  But if you like a very hard, brittle sort of snappy chip, you might enjoy them.

review/text: I love these pita chips! They're all natural and delicious, with a huge satisfying crunch. They're very similar in taste and texture to another of my all-time favorites, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT7TEC">New York Style Mini Bagel Chips Garlic, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>. Very tasty on their own, I never dip them in hummus or anything else.<br /><br />I don't feel too bad about eating 1 or 2 bags of these. They're baked, so they are a bit healthier than regular potato chips (which are fried) at about half the fat calories. One bag is 130 calories, with 45 of them from fat. A 1 oz bag of normal chips is about 90 or 100 fat calories.<br /><br />Made in Randolph, MA. Highly recommended for parties, long bus rides, hiking, whatever! Just watch out for Amazon's crazy pricing. Currently a box of 1oz x 9 bags is 6 time more expensive per ounce than a box of 1.5oz x 24 bags!

review/text: We have ordered Stacy's Pita Chips many times before for our plane owners, who have very exacting taste in their favorite snacks.  They love Stacy's, so we order it often.  We can always count on the product to arrive exactly on the date specified, and in perfect condition.

review/text: Already knowing Stacy chips were are fabulous, I was even happier when our PORTION CONTROLLED SIZED BAGS arrived!  After all, who can eat just one!  They are the perfect dip chip for hummus, easy to pack for kid's lunch bags, of course have the best crunch, love the simple and natural ingredients and are priced well for the 24 pack.  My family loves them and I love their packability and yes, to top it off, the portion sized bags!
