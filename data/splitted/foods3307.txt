review/text: My toddler loves this stuff! She would eat the whole can if I let her but I only give her a handful as a special snack. The cheesy taste is not as strong as goldfish snacks but its cheesy/salty enough to excite young taste buds.

review/text: I have twin girls and they can't get enough of these.  They eat them slowly.  Mostly they just suck on them until they get mushy then they break apart into pieces they can chew.  I actually like that they are bigger and easier for my babies to hold.  The puffs were too small and were harder for them to pick up and get into their mouths.

review/summary: Some are too big!
review/text: My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!

review/summary: DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD
review/text: Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth.  My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth.  Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke!  I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth.  On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!!  We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBU2CO">Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

OMG it tastes great!!  The Veggie Dip and Mild Cheddar are also great.

review/text: Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start!  Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy?  One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more.  America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger!  And thank goodness this product "tastes good" -- because that's all that matters, right?

review/summary: Excellent for those using lots of onion powder
review/text: I purchase McCormick brand 4.5 ounce containers at my military grocery store for almost exactly this price.  As the other reviewer described, you cannot find large containers of granulated onion powder easily.  I wish the price for this bulk buy was lower, however, this is my second purchase in four weeks.<br /><br />If you like McCormick brand granulated onion powder, not Tone's powdered onion dust, then you will also love this brand...almost identical in texture, flavor, and consistency.  To avoid potential price rises I ordered the second batch.  We make our own taco mix, chili mix, and liberally apply this when seasoning all steak types.  Also, we get great flavor addition when pre-soaking black beans in combination with garlic powder and cumin.<br /><br />The company offers a better price for regular shipments.  I suspect only a restaurant or large group of friends who split the order would do so.  For regular folks, I encourage you to buy it once.  You can always share with friends or family, unless your friends are your family.

review/text: At less than $24 for a total of 48 oz of very tasty coffee, this comes out to less than 50 cents per oz (which is how much I use daily, roughly 2 large cups of pretty strong java).  If it weren't for this value, I'd probably keep buying at the grocery store (some of the better brands).  I wasn't sure whether I'd like the flavor, and at first it seemed a bit too spicy.  But I've grown to like it a lot.  I'll be trying a different flavor for my next order of four 12-oz bags, but I'll keep this one on my list of 'flavors I like'.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

Anyway, I think this is the best mint chocolate ever.  It is the perfect balance of dark to sweet and the mint flavor is very pleasant and not overwhelming.  I personally like the "crunch"- I can still let this chocolate melt in my mouth slowly and the crunchy sugar pieces just melt along with it.  I have tried a lot of chocolate and this one is the one I buy repeatedly!

review/text: I love mint chocolate, and I wanted to try one that was fair trade and organic. (All of the products in the Equal Exchange line are fair trade and organic.) The flavor reminds me of a less sweet version of an Andes Mint, and I would have given this 4 stars except they added "crunch" to it. The ingredients list says these are "peppermint crisps." For me, I prefer my chocolate smooth, unless I'm eating chocolate with almonds or toffee bits. The flavor of this bar is really good, but I don't care for the texture.

review/text: An excellent tasting chocolate. It seems to strike a near perfect balance between (traditional) milk chocolate and dark chocolate thanks to its higher than "usual" cacao percentage. I'd describe it as a very flavorful chocolate with quite a few interesting flavor "notes". I like the fact that Scharffen Berger doesn't rely on sugar alone with their milk chocolates to try and create a good taste. The sweetness is just right for what I'd look for in a milk chocolate; it's not over the top but not lacking either.  I really enjoy it.

review/summary: The Chocolate Gift On Your Wish List
review/text: Our friends in Japan covet this artisan chocolatier's luxurious, milk chocolate bar. Unlike the jaw-aching, super-sweet chocolates prevalent in the U.S., Scharffen Berger chocolate highlights the true, rich flavors of cacao.<br /><br />This confectionery chocolate is creamy with a hint of caramel. From personal experience, this 41% Cacao Milk Chocolate pairs well with Sauvignon Blanc, Wheat Beer, figs, hazelnuts, and (especially) strawberries. While I haven't yet paired this chocolate with either cheese or a full-bodied coffee, I can attest to its delicious pairing with a cup of black tea.<br /><br />We send a box of American delicacies to our Japanese friends each New Year's holiday. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NVU5BK">Scharffen Berger Chocolate Bar, Milk Chocolate (41% Cacao)</a> is our choice because it delivers a European flavor profile, which is favored in Japan as well.<br /><br />In summary, Scharffen Berger makes a decadent gift for an adult who can appreciate its delicate balance. My wife has it on her wish list.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: Tastes Like Meiji Chocolate
review/text: This bar reminded me of good Japanese chocolate, like the premium bars sold by Meiji. Lots of chocolate taste without overwhelming sweetness.<br /><br />The caramel flavor really warms my palate and adds a lot to the taste. I prefer the way the milk Scharffen Berger melts in my mouth over their dark chocolate. It is really a wonderful chocolate experience--one that you just can't find with most commercial chocolate today.

review/text: I bought these Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bars having eaten and enjoyed this company's chocolate bars which had a New Guinea chocolate base.  I've eaten one thus far and am resisting the temptation to eat all the remaining five in one sitting.  Although these are a real treat, they are expensive.  But, you get real satisfaction!

review/summary: Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate (41% Cacao) Bar, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)
review/text: Amazon had this on sale and sent me an e-mail the price was to good to pass up.<br />To be honest, when I first tried a bar I thought it had a dark chocolate taste but not as bitter. After the first bar I was hooked. This chocolate is the smoothest and best tasting I have ever tried. I am not a chocolate connoisseur but I know what I like and this is it. The price is a little higher than what I paid but even at the listed price I will be buying more. I might have to try the other kinds of chocolate bars from this maker. This will also be something I will be giving to close friends and family for birthday and holiday presents.

review/summary: A mix of dark and milk chocolate
review/text: This does not taste like typical milk chocolate.  I don't mean "Hersheys" -- I mean whatever milk chocolate you might get from a good chocolatier.<br /><br />This bar tastes very much like dark chocolate that has milk/cream mixed into it.  I guess that certainly makes sense with the 41% cacao.<br /><br />For me, personally, I prefer my dark chocolate to taste like dark chocolate and my milk chocolate to have a milder taste.  But certainly the more "sophisticated" taste probably prefers stronger tasting chocolate - even in milk.<br /><br />I'm not going to ding  this bar for tasting like 41% cacao when that's what it is and how it's advertised.<br /><br />So:<br />If you love dark chocolate and just want a milder, creamier version of it, this bar is great for you.<br />If you love milk chocolate but want to ease your palate to dark chocolate, this bar is great too!<br />If you love milk chocolate and just wanted to check out a higher quality version, but didn't necessarily want the stronger/bitter flavors of dark chocolate, this bar might be a disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, I will certainly enjoy my bars.  But I will probably not order these again.  I, personally, prefer the milder milk chocolate taste.  But I certainly think many people would prefer these bars.  Especially true dark chocolate fans.  Although they may just prefer dark chocolate to being with. Who knows.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Good chocolate.
review/text: Now I don't have the taste buds of a tester, but this is where I feel the chocolate stands and my overall experience.<br /><br />Shipping:<br /><br />The chocolate is delicious, and the packing was good. I've opened and eaten one bar out of 6 and this one bar arrived in decent condition. Taste-wise it was fine because it's pretty cold right now so it probably hadn't melted at anytime during the trip, though one half of the bar was broken into a few pieces. It wasn't a big deal to me, but take into consideration it is pretty hard to keep chocolate in shape through shipping. The usual Amazon packing with a lot of extra room inside filled with air bags. The 6 bars were stacked and contained in a plastic bag that was sealed. It said "Ready to Ship". The plastic was high quality and probably is specially made for Amazon groceries.<br /><br />Price: The price of $25.01 seems a bit much for chocolate but consider you get six 3oz bars of chocolate, so it costs about $4.17 for each bar. Compare it to chocolate you can find in stores such as Ghiradelli and Godiva. Bars of the same size cost around (with tax) $2.13-$4.26. So you're not paying too much of a premium. Maybe a dollar extra per bar, but it really isn't luxuriously expensive, you're just buying in quantity (which not that many people do with chocolate).<br /><br />Chocolate:<br /><br />I like chocolate a lot, but most of the chocolate I eat are from common brands like Hershey's, Lindt, Cadburry, Godiva, and Ghiradelli. If I were to rate these four common brands that I'm sure most people have heard of in America, I would rate them like this:<br />Lowest-end: Hersheys<br />Low-end: Lindt, Cadburry (U.S. version)<br />Med-end: Ghiradelli and Godiva<br /><br />With this chocolate, reading all of the rave reviews, I was anticipating a high-end product or at least med/high-end for my standards. I fully admit I am not a very good judge of food, but for the average American consumer, these are probably the most common kinds of chocolates.<br /><br />This chocolate, in comparison, I would say slightly higher than Med-end. This bar was delicious to have and I'm still craving more, but it wasn't bliss like I expected after reading the reviews. First I drank some water, then I opened one bar. I ate each piece a bit differently to see if I could get the best experience. I ate a whole piece and chewed it in my mouth which didn't give me that much taste. I let one melt in my mouth and that probably tasted the best. I actually tasted a strong resemblance to Ghiradelli milk chocolate. There was a hint of caramel (like the packaging says). Overall, it's good, but it's not amazing. Probably one of the best made-in-U.S. chocolates you can get, but that's not saying much.<br /><br />One of the best chocolates I've eaten, but again, that's not saying much.<br /><br />Worth it? Yes.<br />Beats other American chocolates by far? No.<br /><br />(Edit: I rated it four originally but I've decided to change it to five. The reason why it was at four was because it didn't meet my expectations, which I now don't seem fit. It is at five stars because it is really good for the price of about $4.17 per bar. Thank you.)

review/text: Warning!  This chocolate is addicting.  It has a taste of caramel and is very good.  As a diabetic, I have only barely nibbled with chocolate since 2009.  I ate an entire bar.  I have to hide these because they are not good for me.  But, they are oh so good!!<br /><br />My plans to have a small bite each day failed miserably.  I never have had much control with chocolate consumption which is why I don't keep any of it in the house unless it is the splenda variety.  If you can control yourself, go for it.  Otherwise, I recommend that you exercise extreme caution.

review/summary: Wonderful milk chocolate that's not too sweet
review/text: I purchased this when it was Gold Box Deal of the Day, and it arrived in a box, with the 6 bars wrapped up in a plastic bag. One of the outer bars is cracked - doesn't affect the taste, of course. The chocolate is smooth, rich, not too sweet, the sweetness is in between "regular" milk chocolate and dark semi-sweet chocolate. Melts wonderfully in the mouth. If it comes without calories, it'll be perfect :) Meanwhile, I think it's worth the extra 1/2 hour on the treadmill.<br /><br />Ignore the description that talks about chocolate like wine if that puts you off - just know that they truly taste great. And at this price, not too expensive for a little bit of luxury. Except for the diet.

review/text: Yum - this milk chocolate has everything going for it!<br /><br />Very creamy, not too heavy on the sweetness, doesn't have that sharp (what I call "cheap"!) taste to it that I sometimes find with some brands.<br /><br />In fact, this reminds me of a chocolate my mother brought back for me from her trip to Switzerland... but this chocolate is made in the USA (in Robinson, Illinois, according to the label).<br /><br />The design on the bar is elegant.  It breaks into triangles with a diamond imprinted with their logo in the center.  However, this makes it a little difficult to break the thing in half for sharing or saving part for later.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the chocolate softened/melted slightly on my porch (no one was home to get the box), even though it was only 75� that day.  When it solidified again, the ends of all the bars that apparently were hardest hit by the heat changed color drastically (I added a picture to the product photos above to show what I mean).  Please note, this is what happens to good chocolate when it is kept in a too-warm environment and then cools again.  I just caution you to think about the temperatures where you live when you order, where your mail sits, and whether or not you'll be able to get it into the house right away.  If you're planning to use these for gifts, you need to take this into consideration.  If you're just going to treat yourself, it is easily overlooked, because this is still delicious!<br /><br />Chocolate is my favorite treat, and I will occasionally purchase a a good bar for $4-5 to break up and eat over several days. I'll be getting these again, I enjoyed them so well!

review/summary: To die for
review/text: I grew up in Germany where chocolate is not quite so sickeningly sweet. This American-made product comes as close to European fine chocolate as some of the regional makers, such as South Bend Chocolate and Coffee Company in northcentral Indiana.  This chocolate has a smooth, silky melt and refreshens the tongue with a very pleasant taste.  It's chocolate and not sugar that tantilizes the tastebuds.<br /><br />I never heard of this chocolate until Amazon offered on it sale before C'mas.  Then Amazon offered it again about a week ago and this time I bit...and bit and bit and bit.  This stuff really is that good.  I also tasted the Papau at 68% cocoa and the Bittersweet at 62% but this 41% chocolate tops the cake.<br /><br />I will order it every time Amazon offers it on sale, because even though this is delicious, it's also very expensive at the "regular" price.

review/text: The flavor and texture of this chocolate is very nice, and even though it is milk chocolate, it has more flavor than some dark chocolates.  The feel is smooth and never waxy.  It is almost too good for me to want to cook with, since it is so perfect as it is.  The pack of 6 offers a decent amount of chocolate entertainment and would make a good gift.  The stronger chocolate flavor means that it goes further, with smaller bites being satisfying.

review/summary: A very pale shadow of its former self!
review/text: We bought this chocolate last year when they had the big sale on it here on Amazon. It was just great. Scharffenberger milk chocolate has a deep rich flavor with a great snap and the texture is very smooth.<br /><br />This latest batch of "Scharffenberger Milk Chocolate" is obviously Hersheys attempt to make it more profitable by removing any value from it. It is lighter in color with a slightly chalky and waxy texture, it is barely creamy and the texture and flavor are not remotely as good as the actual Scharffenberger used to be.<br /><br />It is much more a third rate Swiss style chocolate and completely lacks the straight forward high quality chocolate flavor that real Scharffenberger had. And if you want Swiss style chocolate you are much better off buying Lindt or Tobler than this over priced and very poor imitation.<br /><br />This is not nearly as good as the original bar. It seemed obvious that Hershey's would eventually abandon Scharffenbergers high standards, quality beans and traditional methods and simply try to maximize profits. This "chocolate" proves that beyond any doubt.<br /><br />In the end, it seems they probably only bought the company to eliminate it from being competition.<br /><br />They are certainly destroying any remaining brand loyalty now.

review/summary: Milk chocolate versus Dark Chocolate
review/text: I'm not a big fan of Hershey's chocolate bars although I do eat one occasionally but to me they have an aftertaste and feel gummy on my tongue.  I used to eat Newman's organic chocolate bars and learned to love those but they have since disappeared in my area.<br /><br />Hershey's chocolate bars are approx 10% chocolate whereas this chocolate bar states it is 41%.  Semi-sweet is labeled at 35%, but in Europe milk chocolate is labeled as being  below 43%.  So this candy bar although not officially dark chocolate is right on the edge between milk and dark chocolate, if you absolutely hate dark chocolate then you might want to sample someone else's first.<br /><br />Having said all that I"m not normally a fan of dark chocolate.  However, Sharffen Berger is creamy and just the right sweetness.  I didn't feel guilty eating it and it satisfied the chocolate craving.  It's absolutely fresh because of the superb packaging.  I couldn't smell even a hint of chocolate outside the wrapper.  Also contains non-GMO soy lecithin.  However,  I wish it was scored into squares to more easily share.

review/summary: Outstanding Chocolate
review/text: Chocolate is good for you!  At least a high percentage cacao chocolate, consumed in moderation, can provide some healthy benefits; not to mention the emotional stroke that comes from savoring a delicious product like this.  The flavor is rich and without any hint of waxiness that often sullies "common" chocolate bars.  But then you would expect high quality from Scharren Berger anyway.<br /><br />Since my own chocolate tasting abilities are fair at best (at least I didn't embarrass myself at the one chocolate tasting I went to), I shared this with my wife, sister-in-law and daughter... serious chocohalics all!  The verdict was unamimous with mine.  More impressively so when you consider the fact that my daughter is known to question restaurant chef's as to whether they used Girhardelli or a Belgian chocolate in their recipe.  Suffice to say, she knows what she's talking about, and she was very impressed!

review/summary: Is this what heaven tastes like?
review/text: Perhaps when you think of gourmet chocolate, you think of truffles or tiny, fancy-shaped chocolates.  You probably don't classify <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXWCQO">Hershey's candy bars</a> in that genre of high-class chocolate.  Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bar may very well change any idea you have that candy bars aren't gourmet.  Everything is absolutely heavenly about this bar from is rich, creamy texture to it's exotically delicious taste.<br /><br />Many candies claim to be smooth and velvety, and I'll admit that I have eaten chocolate that I considered to be exactly that.  This was because I had never truly experience what creamy chocolate was.  Creamy chocolate is when the chocolate melts from a solid to a creamy, delectable liquid in your mouth.  I know that this sounds like some cheesy commercial, but I am honestly not making anything up.  That's exactly what this bar does.<br /><br />The taste isn't traditional milk chocolate either.  It has the tiniest bitter aftertaste to it, making it seem like it isn't completely loaded down with sugar.  However, 1/2 of a bar (which is one serving) contains 18 grams of sugar, 14 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbs, and 50 mg of sodium.  Surprisingly, though, it also has some significant fiber, calcium, and protein as well.  Unfortunately, the worst part is the calories...all 210 of them in one serving (meaning that a full bar is a whopping 420 calories).  A full bar is about the same size as the aforementioned Hershey's bar.<br /><br />Overall, it's delicious, but this deliciousness comes with a slight price in calories.  It's something worth cheating on a diet for, although you might gain a few extra pounds just buying the bar.

review/text: Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars. The fact that this is American made chocolate appealed to me right from the start.  They offer many different kinds of chocolate.  I would consider this just a little on the dark side milk chocolate, there is just a hint of the dark bitterness.  The taste is great and melts very smoothly in your mouth.<br /><br />The only reason I took off half a star was because the bar itself was hard and broken in many pieces.  I think the reason for this might be that the inner foil wrapper is loosely wrapped around the chocolate and can't help wonder if the chocolate dried out a little.  Overall not quite the best but still highly recommended.

review/summary: This is some good stuff!
review/text: First, a word about the size of the bars. The description "3 ounce package" did not create any visual picture for me, but it didn't sound very big, so I was very surprised to get a pack of 6 very large (about 3 x 6 1/2 inch) chocolate bars. The "pack of 6" is a generous amount of chocolate.<br /><br />Now, on to the chocolate itself. These are delicious. The texture is smooth and creamy, with just the right degree of meltiness in your mouth. (I know "meltiness" isn't a real word, but for chocolate descriptions it ought to be.) This is identified as milk chocolate, but it is quite rich and darker than most milk chocolates, so I think maybe "dark milk chocolate" is more accurate. The description on the wrapper says that this chocolate has "a hint of luxurious caramel," but I didn't taste any caramel undertones at all. However, I did force myself to share with a few friends (trying not to be too chocolate greedy) and a couple of them said they did taste a hint of caramel.<br /><br />I only have one teeny little complaint about these chocolate bars, which is that the bars aren't scored for easy breaking into smaller pieces. So, when you break it up, you end up with a bunch of irregularly shaped and sized pieces. Certainly that isn't a big deal and it has no effect on the taste, but still, I would prefer to be able to easily break the bar into multiple evenly sized pieces.<br /><br />I highly recommend this chocolate, particularly if your tastes run more to the dark chocolates than to the light milk chocolate.

review/summary: Exquisite
review/text: With the large number of choices in the chocolate market, it can take a lot to impress but ScharffenBerger Milk Chocolate manages to do just that.  Not knowing what to expect, I thought this might be the smaller squares common with higher end confections but this was a rather "king size" chocolate bar.  So the questions as to what one might get in quantity for the price is answered for the positive.<br /><br />Then we get to the taste and this is as good as anything one can find with prepackaged chocolate.  The texture is rich and creamy and the taste sweet without being overbearingly so.  There are hints of caramel in the flavor but more in the background and integrated into the chocolate rather than as filling.  It achieves an exquisite balance and manages to produce one of the upper echelon milk chocolate bars on the market.  Those who like their chocolate more on the heavier and/or bitter side might not be as impressed but then they would probably avoid the milk chocolate genre entirely.  If their achievement here is any indication, they likely would have other high quality products to satisfy such preferences.<br /><br />Schaffen-Berger Milk Chocolate is not a bar to be eaten quickly but one to be savored slowly.  This is my first experience with this company and I have come away highly impressed.

review/text: First of all a confession. I am an acknowledged Chocoholic so my review will be somewhat colored. The Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bar is excellent. A 3 Ounce bar gives you at least Three snacks. With 41% Cacao you get a delicious chocolate taste with just a hint of caramel flavor. There is no sticky caramel in it, but it does have that hint of it. I plan to try the rest of the Scharffen Berger product line, if the rest of it tastes as good as this bar it is worth the price. All I can say to quote Vincent Price is "Here it is you Chocolate Lovers"!!

review/summary: The "I don't deserve this" chocolate
review/text: It took me a while to review this chocolate because I was torn.  On the one hand, I don't get to eat chocolate this rich, so I wasn't sure that it was even milk chocolate.  On the other hand, it was so rich, deep, and satisfying, that I didn't care.  So I ate another bar just to make sure.  Unfortunately, I'm hooked on this chocolate now and don't know if I can eat a Hershey bar anymore (well, okay, this chocolaholic most likely could be talked into it).  But for sure, I'm hiding the rest of this stash and not sharing with anyone.<br /><br />The taste is extremely rich and refined.  I found the melt factor - always important in my chocolate eating to be higher (must savor it longer to melt it in my mouth) than the milk chocolate you buy on a general basis.  This gives it a lasting taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Worth the extra money and definitely a wonderful product.

review/summary: Different than Expected
review/text: Although I have quite a sweet tooth, and love gourmet chocolates, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NVU5BK">Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate (41% Cacao) Bar, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> was a bit sweeter than I expected it to be. I thought that 41%  cacao would have given it more of a bitter taste. I was also hoping to be able to detect some of the more subtle flavors in the chocolate, but I suppose my palate is just not sensitive enough to notice.<br /><br />I don't regret eating it, though! It was definitely worth the calories. This was very tasty chocolate, to be sure, but just a little too sweet and subtle for my taste.

review/summary: Delicious high-quality chococate with a fascinating story
review/text: There's no question Scharffen Berger chocolate is delicious, but equally appealing is Scharffen Berger's attention to detail and its commitment to making some of the best chocolate in the United States. Scharffen Berger scours the globe to find the world's best cacao beans and performs the entire "bean-to-bar" process in its factory. I like that the company focuses on perfecting the natural cacao flavor through careful blending of different varieties of cacao beans instead of just loading it up with sugar and other ingredients and declaring it finished. The result is high-quality chocolate that is superior to the cheaper mass-produced chocolate--and without a lot of unnecessary ingredients (I count 7 ingredients on the label). If you're a real chocolate snob (or just want to justify the price to yourself), you'll also appreciate the artisan chocolate-making methods and the use of vintage European equipment in the manufacturing of this chocolate.<br /><br />The verdict: Scharffen Berger chocolate is delicious and the bars are big enough to last more than one sitting (at least for me). It's also more expensive and, depending on your chocolate budget, may be a reason to cut back on the cheaper stuff in order to savor the good stuff from time to time.

review/text: This is how milk chocolate is supposed to taste. Smooth and creamy. Melts in your mouth. It's simply wonderful. The only thing I didn't like about this chocolate bar is that it isn't easy to break apart. I tried to break off a small piece and the whole thing cracked and broke into large pieces. Most chocolate bars are easy to separate into smaller pieces because they're made with lines to crack. While there are lines for breaking, they are to break into large triangular pieces, I'd prefer it if they could be smaller, just so I'd eat less and have it last longer.

review/summary: Only Fine Chocolate Will Do.
review/text: First off, your average candy bars - Snickers, Three Musketeers, Reese's, Milky Way - are not chocolate. They may have a little cacao (the seed of the Theobroma cacao tree used to make cocoa powder and chocolate), but mostly they are sugar and other candy substances. Hence why a large Snickers bar doesn't really fulfill your craving for chocolate.<br /><br />A fine chocolate bar will contain at least 30% - 45% cacao for milk chocolate and 50% - 80% or more for dark chocolate. A fine chocolate bar will usually provide multiple satisfying chocolate experiences as it only takes one or two squares from a bar to truly deliver a satisfying chocolate experience. This is also why the price tag for fine chocolate is worth the price of admission; a 2 oz Snickers bar will cost you from 75 cents to over a $1 at your local convenience store and while 3 oz of Scharffen Berger chocolate will cost you about $4. But, that 3 oz will provide you with an infinitely higher level of satisfaction than the Snickers bar.<br /><br />Now that I have separated fine chocolate from the candy bars, let me tell you that even all fine chocolate is not the same. Scharffen Berger is a small artisan chocolate maker from San Francisco, California that makes some of the finest chocolate in the world. Their milk chocolate contains 41% cacao, which delivers a full bodied chocolate flavor with a silky smooth texture that will just melt in your mouth; wrapped inside these primary flavors is a hint of caramel.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger is one of my favorite makers of fine chocolate and you cannot go wrong with the Milk Chocolate bars, or any of their other flavors. If you prefer Dark Chocolate, I recommend the Nibby Dark Chocolate bars... a nice, but mild dark chocolate flavor with nibs of cacao beans mixed in. The Milk Chocolate with Sea Salt is also fantastic!

review/summary: Hipster super premium chocolate not worth price
review/text: Nothing bad about this chocolate - it is luscious and elegant and sophisticated as other reviewers have stated - except the price. The price - currently $25 for just over a pound of solid chocolate in six bars - is the deal breaker. With super exotic bean origins (Papua New Guinea? Really?) and bragging rights from "vintage chocolate making equipment", I can only guess this is marketed for chocolate hipsters. If you have watched coffee hipsters lecturing about proper pouring styles for a vintage Chemex coffee maker, you may know what I mean by coffee hipster.<br /><br />All that said, this chocolate is good. I really wouldn't call it great, but my taste and palette is probably too pedestrian too appreciate the subtlety of the "artisan chocolate making resurgence". I do wish to state that at 41% cacao, the flavor of this milk chocolate bar seems far closer to a semi-sweet.<br /><br />No doubt that sophisticated and experienced tasters will find bliss in this chocolate, assuming that 1) price is no object and 2) they don't want their milk chocolate either creamy or particularly sweet. But the rest of us everyday chocolate lovers, people looking for a satisfying chocolate at a reasonable price, should probably keep searching.

review/summary: Yumm! Oh my oh my that's yummy.
review/text: I like chocolate - good, rich, strong chocolate, and Scharffen Berger is a particularly reliable brand.  I've had plenty of Scharffen Berger bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolates in my time.  Their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NVW20W">82% Cacao Bar</a> is wonderfully intense, and has to be experienced to be believed.  And my wife made a triple chocolate cake once which must have been mostly extra-dark Scharffen Berger chocolate, and which was just insanely good and so intense as to be practically aneurysm-inducing, but I digress...)<br /><br />This, however, may be my favorate Scharffen Berger chocolate, ever.  Texture-wise, it's perfect: creamy, smooth, and doesn't crumble.  And taste - the perfect blend of rich authentic theobromicity and mellow dairy-ness.  And they get the sugar balance right, too - it's sweet, but the sugar complements the cocoa and the milk just so, and doesn't overwhelm.  There's not much more to say.<br /><br />Taste in food may be irrational and very uniquely individual, and there may be some people out there whose taste runs more to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXWCQO">Hershey</a>.  That's OK - to each their own.  But let's just say I LOVED (yeah, because something this good doesn't stay present-tense for too long) this chocolate bar.

review/summary: Chocolate on Another Level
review/text: In a word: Wonderful!<br /><br />This chocolate tastes AMAZING and the ingredients reflect the quality.  The soy used (as soy lecithin) is NON-GMO!!! I have sought that for some time, and could previously only find it in a much smaller, organic DARK chocolate offering in the only health food co-op in our small town.<br /><br />This 6 bar pack is a substantial amount that satisfies my chocolate craving with plenty to share with my family. My daughter who doesn't usually like sweets (hates brownies, cakes, etc.) was constantly begging for more.  My husband, the die-hard DARK chocolate lover was greatly impressed with the taste/texture as well.<br /><br />This extra milk chocolate tastes like it is richer in cacao without going all the way over to dark.  I couldn't identify this flavor as caramel until I read about it. I guess the subtle caramel flavor enhances the chocolate so well that it translates into a richer, full-bodied experience.  This has the right subtle sweetness that is so much more than your average milk chocolate.<br /><br />The typical milk chocolate pales in comparison. There is nothing diluted or skimpy about these bars. With 41% Cacao and a total of 28g. of fat (per entire bar!), I felt totally pampered.  I could actually FEEL a difference in my body after eating a bunch...I wasn't lethargic or bloated, but alert and revitalized.<br /><br />Wow, what a difference QUALITY makes...<br /><br />We haven't had any problems breaking off pieces to eat.  Although it doesn't break uniformly, it don't crumble excessively. Surprisingly, I noticed that it doesn't melt easily in warmer temperatures, either.  I had a few pieces in the car on a sunny day and it never melted, but stayed firm).  That's pretty significant when you're looking for a chocolate bar to pack for an outing.<br /><br />*Note: These bars could make desirable additions to homemade gift baskets for the holidays. Each 3 oz. bar (wide and flat, larger in appearance) is individually wrapped (completely) in conservative, thick, well-printed paper over the foil under-wrapping.  This is on par with anything I have seen contained within professional gift baskets, for sure.

review/text: I've never heard of this brand of chocolate before but I'm thinking of buying more in the future now that I've tried it. While it's not as rich-tasting as Godiva, I like the smooth and creamy taste of the milk chocolate; it has a slightly fruity taste and is just the right texture (neither too hard nor too soft). My only quibble is the packaging, which seems a little dull and wouldn't catch my eye in the supermarket. Compare the package, say, to Lindt's, which has a shiny foil and festive look to it. Other than that, I highly recommend this brand and look forward to ordering more in the future.

review/summary: Mixed reviews from the family
review/text: I am a Ritter Sport aficionado (Alpenmilch is my default flavor of choice).  Hubby likes dark chocolate.  Son likes anything sweet.  So we all tried this candy bar.<br /><br />My thoughts:  it feels somewhat "grainier" or "grittier" than a smooth Ritter Sport (or even a Dove or Hershey bar).  I also felt it to have a slightly bitter aftertaste, almost like a coffee bean flavor, but there is no coffee in this one - just cacao beans, sugar, milk, soy lecithin, cocoa butter and vanilla beans.  So overall I don't like it.<br /><br />Hubby says "It's good" and asked for more.  That's about all I could get from him.<br /><br />Son says, "It definitely has a hint of bitterness, but that's very good.  I like it.  Not overwhelmingly sweet."<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it again because I dislike the gritty texture, and I'm the primary chocolate buyer in the household :-  But you may like it.

review/text: These biscuits are excellent and have become a staple in my cupboard. I will have to agree that the packaging and shipping from Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I have received two shipments on this product. The first shipment was great with little to no crumbling or crushing....as good or better than what I found in my local grocer. The second shipment arrived in very poor condition. The box looked like it had been dropped kicked a couple of times. There is no effort to cushion or protect these biscuits from shipping damage. The six biscuit packages are simply put in the shipping box, and shipped. My first shipment was obviously a lucky shipping experience without need for cushioning, but the second shipment had obviously been mishandled. If you're listening amazon....you need to start using air pillows with this product, and enough of them to actually work. My last experience has left me wary of ordering again without improvements to the shipping packaging.<br /><br />Product = 5 stars<br />packaging = 1 stars

I was delighted to find them available at Amazon and after reading a few reviews that sounded as if the packing problems had been taken care of, I ordered a box of 6 packages. The biscuits are great, the packing...not so much. All six packs were stuffed into a small plastic bag which was crammed into a bubble bag which was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed into a box with air pacs stuffed around it. Four packs are mostly crumbs, the other two had a lot of breakage on the ends. I think they might have been ok if they hadn't forced them into the too-small bag and bubble bag in their zeal to over-protect. Maybe carefully wrapping each pac individually in bubblewrap and placing them in the center of a box of air pacs would get them delivered in one piece, but I doubt that will happen so will not bother to order them from Amazon again...

review/summary: An English Classic
review/text: "Rich Tea" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest "Rich Tea", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. "Rich Tea" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!

review/text: I'd purchased these based on the reviews here and their reputation abroad. A delightful little tea-time/anytime snack, these little cookies do remind you of graham crackers in taste, but they're not as sweet and have a slight baking soda aftertaste that remind me of Violet Crumbles. The consistency is course grain but crumbly. In your mouth, the cookie falls apart into small crumbs like what you'd find on a graham cracker pie crust.<br /><br />Amazon did a wonderful job in shipping. I know a lot of people have stated that theirs came in crumbled, but almost none of mine were broken. Mine arrived as a box inside a box and had bubble wrap and tacky tape that tried to keep each roll stationary. But another reason for their good condition might have been that they didn't have to stay in transit long. It looks like mine came out of Florida, and they were delivered to South Georgia. Either way, I'm extremely satisifed with the quality and shipping of my purchase.

A good alternative to fat-laden, overly-sweet cookies.<br /><br />Because they are no longer readily available at the grocery stores in my area, this is an excellent way to keep them in the pantry.

review/summary: Biscuits are tasty, packaging is not
review/text: I was looking for McVitie's Digestive Biscuits in many local supermarkets in my area, but unfortunately I couldn't find any. So I went to Amazon.com and searched for it, and here it was.. the delicious biscuits with the red and blue cover. I ordered it right away and I received it within two days. I have to admit that the biscuits were tasty, however the packaging was not vey good. Once you tear the wrapping cover you notice that the biscuits on the top and the bottom are crumbled. The problem is the biscuits crumbles very easily, so I am not sure whether it is fair to blame the packaging for the crumbled biscuits.<br /><br />Would I order it again from Amazon.com? most probably yes.

review/summary: Great biscuits
review/text: McVities make a great product. Unfortunately the shipping still leaves much to be desired, though it has improved somewhat. In order to protect the biscuits bubble wrap has to completly wrap the product. Simply putting it across the top doesn't protect the bottom and sides and you end up with a case of broken pieces! it is very frustrating as this does seem to be the least expensive way to buy them (short of going to England where you can get them for about 70 cents for a 14 oz pkg.)

review/summary: Great biscuits, lousy packaging
review/text: McVities digestive biscuits are great - not nearly as sweet as competitors. Biggest problem is how many are broken by the time they get to you. The Amazon packaging job does not hold up in shipping. This is true for all types of digestives I have received over the last couple of years from Amazon. Unfortunately they are the best source in the US. I wish they could think up a better packaging scenario for fragile items like this.

review/summary: McVitie's are the best!!!
review/text: Ever since first having McVitie's Digestives many, many years ago, I continue to maintain that they are the best. Nothing that compares to them in the States.  Awesome to find these available through Amazon.  I've bought digestives at Whole Foods...different brand, pretty expensive.  No comparison to the taste of McVitie's.  Love them with goat cheese.  In the UK, loved them with Cranberry Stilton.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Graham crackers?  No comparison.  You gotta try 'em.

review/summary: Love These, But Was Sent Old Cookies
review/text: This is my second time ordering the "bulk" amount, because these biscuits have no match, and they are hard to find in stores. Packaging was MUCH better this time -- bubble wrapped and double boxed. I'm giving a lower rating, though, because I received these in early August, and the expiration date is already up this December. So I feel I've been sent old merchandise. I would expect at least a year for a processed and packaged food item like this, especially ordered in this quantity. I don't know if Amazon will allow for a return or exchange.<br /><br />***Update***<br />Food items cannot be returned, but I was pleased to see that Amazon refunded my money! Now that's customer service.

review/text: The biscuit is reasonably good, better than most made in US biscuits. However, Amazon's packaging is horrendous. Most of the biscuit came crushed in their individual packs.

review/text: For a bit, Amazon improved the packaging on these delightful biscuits. Now they are back to their slacker ways and every single packet is broken and crumbly.<br /><br />Shame on you Amazon!

review/summary: Selling McVitie  Biscuits close to expire April 2011???
review/text: Believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of McVitie's Digestive Biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on April 2011.  If I had known you were going to do that I would not have bought them.<br />Please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits - they're either too sweet or too bland - but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the packaging though. In the pack of 7, only 3 turned out perfect, 2 were slightly crumbled, and half of the last 2 were badly smashed.

review/summary: PACKAGING
review/text: Love, love, love the biscuits!  Like other reviews, the packaging needs attention.<br /><br />Our boxes arrived in a huge outer box - with many of the balloon-type bubbles to protect the biscuits. The biscuits being heavier than the bubbles, the boxes were on the bottom of the box - unprotected - and the bubbles were all on top. We did have some breakage.  I would suggest bubble-wrapping the boxes with the large sized wrap.<br />Otherwise, very pleased.

review/summary: Bad Packaging
review/text: These cookies are very tasty. Mildly sweet & satisfying. However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges. These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles. We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.

review/summary: Excellent source of these hard-to-find biscuits
review/text: I have ordered the 7-pack of these Digestive Biscuits several times. They are delicious with a cup of tea, and are a slightly healthier version of a "cookie" but with more fiber and perhaps not as sweet as the traditional cookie. I agree with previous reviewers that Amazon packaging has been insufficient in the past, resulting in crumbled and crushed biscuits. However, my most recent shipment (ordered January 8, 2012)arrived in nearly perfect condition, in improved packaging, with all biscuits intact. Since this brand is difficult to find in a regular grocery store, I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon with Prime shipping!

review/summary: Nice oder!!
review/text: Just received my order. The box was a little beaten up from outside. I was worried that some of the cookies might turn into crumbs. When I opened the box, the worry was gone. It was so nicely packed!! Each pack was wrapped with bubble sheets individually, and any space between the wrapped packages and the box were stuffed with plastic airbags. (See pictures that I uploaded) I will definitely order from them again! However I think the current order can last me for a while :)

review/summary: McVities Digestives
review/text: This was the best deal on buying imported digestives I have ever found.  Seven large packages of the one and only true digestive fromn MvVitie.  The name "Digestive" might put you off but the taste with a cup of tea is out of this world and the price unequaled.
