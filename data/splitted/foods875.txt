review/summary: Way better brands available
review/text: Like the last person to review this product, I also find that the flavor on the Spitz seeds is very short lived. It tastes like the seeds are lightly roasted (not roasted enough for me, the flavor of the seed is close to raw) with no salt or flavoring. Then a light coating of flavoring is put on at the end. It does taste like dill pickle, but only the outside of the seed. Despite this, I was still a fan of this product until I tried Bigs brand. Bigs Dill Pickle is so superior to this product that it puts it to shame. If you are buying from Amazon anyway, you should buy the Bigs since local availability isn't the problem. One thing I will say about Spitz brand is that because the flavor is mild, I can eat a lot more of them before my mouth becomes raw from too much salt. This is nice since I usually eat sunflower seeds in a setting where I'm just passing the time. Still, I'd take the good flavor of Bigs and a raw mouth over Spitz any time.

review/summary: No "Bigs" that's for sure!
review/text: Bigs Dill 12 packs always seem to be on back-order, so I figured instead of heading to a Sports Authority (the only retail store I KNOW has my Bigs Dill packs) again and again for too much mark up, I'd try a case of these.  While the initial flavor is OK, it wears off really fast, and if you eat sunflower seeds the proper way, by stuffing a handful into your cheeks, you'll find it's quite like what happens when you are chewing bubble gum...good at first, but quickly becomes a bland, mushy mess.  Bigs brand is WAY better.  Bigger seeds, better tasting, and the last one in a cheekful still actually tastes like dill pickle.  I think even David's might be better, and that's saying something! I've gone through 2 packs of my case of Spitz, and I've already ordered a new case of Bigs brand.  I will throw these out or give them away when the new case arrives...they are that inferior.

review/summary: PLEASE PUT CRACKED PEPPER SEEDS ON AMAZON PRIME
review/text: This is an open letter to anyone at Spitz and or Amazon.com,<br /><br />Please put Spitz cracked pepper sunflower seeds on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Let me say I freaking love Spitz cracked pepper sunflower seeds, frankly they are the reason I get out of bed in the morning. I sit at my desk all day and chew seeds, seriously it is the only thing that gets me through the day and prevents me from attacking my co-workers. I need them and not having the cracked pepper flavor on amazon prime is really becoming a problem for me.<br /><br />Seriously what is the deal? Every other flavor of Spitz sunflower seeds are offered on amazon prime EXCEPT for cracked pepper. Why would you not make your best and most addictive flavor more easily accessible to your customers, its just un-American! I have tried to cope without the cracked pepper. I tried the other flavors they just don't cut it. Seasoned was ok, but it did not come close to satisfying my need for that rich and full bodied cracked pepper taste.<br /><br />So this is me down on my knees begging that you can have mercy on Spitz Nation, and put cracked pepper on amazon prime. I know you can do it, You have the technology! I am willing to forgive you for your mistake if you can get those deliciously little seeds to me with burdening me with having to wait 5-7 days and paying eleven dollars in shipping to feed my addiction.<br /><br />If my demands are not met i will be forced to switch to David's Original. But be sure this will hurt me and much as it does you. thank you and goodnight

review/summary: Spitz Sunflower Seeds
review/text: Being a fanatic at eating sunflower seeds, I've tried just about all of the brands and many flavors. Without a doult, Spitz's Dill Pickle seeds are my favorite. So much so, I used to buy them by the case from a grocery store in a city about 100 miles away because grocery stores in my area did not carry them. Then I found out I can get them online and have been purchasing them there ever since. The 6oz bags are perfect for in the car or at ball games and the 16oz bags I keep in the house at my favorite recliner. I prefer Spitz brand over others mainly because they don't have a salty taste or leave your mouth feeling num after eating them.

review/text: I bought a quart ($50 + shipping) direct from the vendor, expecting to be amazed based on AMZN reviews and reviews on the vendor's site.  I wasn't amazed.  Yes, it is delicious, something like a lobster bisque with a few chunks of claw meat added.  Very rich and flavorful, but not noticeably better than any premium lobster bisque in your grocery.  Did I enjoy it?  Absolutely!  Would I buy it again?  At $50 a quart plus shipping, no way.  A can of good quality lobster bisque plus a few big shrimp will satisfy your craving for the flavor and leave a lot more money in your pocket.

review/summary: Thin, Watery, and Lacking in Flavor. Unimpressed.
review/text: I purchased this with the expectation that, like most lobster bisques I've had at high-end restaurants, it would be creamy, thick, and filling.  Instead, it was watery, thin, bland, and not at all worth the price I paid.  Yes, there is a decent amount of lobster meat included in each serving, but it does not compensate for the lack of flavor and texture in the soup.  I would strongly advise against spending your money on this.<br /><br />That being said, Hancock's lobster mac and cheese is fantastic and worth every penny.

review/text: This is a great mustard when you are just getting into a low sodium diet.  It is a great way to jazz up and low sodium sauce.  I found combining it with zero sodium bbq sauce and a few shots of Tabasco created a sauce even the 12-year-old enjoyed.  This, some no salt bread, Swiss cheese, homemade salt free mayonnaise, and a popular brand of lower sodium turkey can get you a decent sandwich at 400mg of sodium.  It also works as a great dip for unsalted pretzels.<br /><br />The only thing keeping it at four stars is that you can do better experimenting with making your own from scratch.

You do taste a tad of a vinegar bite like in some other mustards, but I think even that's good.<br /><br />And the good thing is, on the case I got anyway, there is plenty of time to use all 12 bottles because the expiration date is March 21, 2009.  I was concerned about this aspect, but I took a gamble and it worked out.<br /><br />Thanks Westbrae for producing such a great product at a reasonable price.

review/text: The vinegar in this mustard is very strong so you won't feel comfortable eating too much of this mustard all by itself without putting it on some kind of food.  Similar to broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, radishes, and turnips, mustard seeds contain glucosinolates, which convert into cancer-preventing isothiocyanates.  However, vinegar slightly increases our risk of developing cancer.<br />Big Picture:  Because this product has no salt added, it is much healthier for us than other mustard products.

review/summary: What More Could You Possibly Ask For?
review/text: Torani's White Chocolate Mocha Sauce is an absolute acceptable substitute to StarBucks! And if you think not than you're just too picky and you should go there and pay the price for the real thing! I mean seriously what more could you ask for? By signing up for subscribe & save thru Amazon it drops the price down to $19.12 with free shipping and you pick when you want your next shipment to be, up to 6 months out, plus if you put in the promotional coupon code UNILEV51 you get another 15% off bringing your total to only $14.62 for a case of 6 average ketchup size bottles 16.5oz! Which breaks down to be $2.44 per bottle. You can go into your account and skip an order or get one sooner or even cancel anytime you want. Once you open a bottle you put it in the refrigerator, they're not gigantic size like the 64oz ones which may expire before you have a chance to use it up. The quaility of the product itself far exceeds it's price. Rich flavor and thick texture, a little goes along way, even for those who like there's extra sweet like me! I drink my latte's with quadropple shots and use more syrup to level out the bitterness while keeping the strongness. My coffe mug is large and I make at least one if not two drinks per day, with that being said for a reference it still takes me at least a week to use one bottle. I do buy the StarBucks beans, the Italian roast instead of the Expresso it's a stronger bean so I don't have to use as much. What I use to pay $7.88 for(6 shot, venti, white mocha)I now pay approximately $0.86! My savings in the first month alone paid for a cappichino-expresso-steamer-coffee maker macchine and I didn't buy a cheap one either. Of course it's not exactly StarBucks, but once you've played around and experimented to get it the way you like it the difference is minor enough for the sacrifice and the HUGE savings! What I use to spend per year at Starbucks will now easily cover the cost of my utility bills: gas, electric and my cell phone! So exactly how picky do you really want to be?

review/text: If you love those white chocolate mocha lattes at Starbucks, this is a nice substitute. Yes, you can go on ebay and order soon-to-be-expired gigantic bottles of the real deal, but it's so expensive that the savings over just going to Starbucks in the first place is negligible.<br /><br />Torani sauces and syrups are great in their own right. We use this with our Tassimo system (with both the latte/espresso discs and the cappuccino/espresso), and it's fantastic. If you're going for lattes, get this over the syrups as the consistency is much better. This stuff is great mixed into hot chocolate and over ice cream, as well. I've even made milkshakes with it. In fact, I've made so many things with this stuff that I think the next time, I'm going to have to go for the sugar free version!

review/summary: Really Good Syrup
review/text: For Christmas, my husband and I got an espresso machine.  The only coffee I like are the White Chocolate Mochas from S***bucks, so I set out to find their syrup. . . almost impossible, unless you plan to use 63 oz in a month.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try the Toriani White Chocolate Sauce.  Based on other reviews, I added a little more than the bottle said.  Here are the recipes I used for both iced and regular drinks (because I wished I could have found recipes).  For hot drinks, I used the recommended 1/5 espresso and 4/5 steamed milk and the 2 tbsp of syrup (I actually like a little more milk).  I actually used 1 oz. espresso, 5 oz. steamed milk and 2 tbsp of syrup.  This turned out really well.  I really liked it.  For the iced version, I doubled the entire recipe.  2 oz. espresso, 10 oz. skim milk, 4 tbsp syrup.  This is actually pretty good as well.  It's a little sweet (which isn't usually a problem for me), so next time, I'll try 3 tbsp and see if I can get good results that way as well.  The downside is that the syrup is 120 calories per 2 tbsp, however, I'm pretty sure that's not much difference from the coffee chain.  I'm allergic to aspartame, so I don't want to try the sugar-free syrup.  I'd recommend this syrup.  It's not exactly like the coffee chain, but considering that a White Chocolate Mocha is the ONLY coffee drink I've liked from there, and I like this, I consider that a win.  Also, you will most likely use a lot of syrup. This isn't that bad, considering it's probably $1 per drink instead of the chain's $5.  Enjoy!<br /><br />So, I made an Iced White Chocolate Mocha today with less syrup and it was perfect!  10-11 oz. of skim milk, 3 tbsp Sauce, a double shot of espresso.  Can't complain when I can save 60 calories per drink!

review/text: I don't know how anybody can say this tastes even at all close to starbucks white mocha sauce. It has a really bad artificial after taste and is not rich and buttery like starbucks white mocha. My husband and I both drank this equally and he agreed that it was not worth a second purchase. If you really want a good white mocha, go with the ghiradelli sweet ground white chocolate powder. Now that is fabulous and tastes exactly like a starbucks white mocha. This torani white chocolate sauce is just plain bad, we had to almost plug our noses to get it down.

review/summary: Part of my Starbucks replacement recipe
review/text: After getting somewhat addicted to Starbucks White Mocha Frappe's, I decided I could probably save a lot of money and make my own.  I bought this and MOCAFE's White Chocolate Frappe 3-lb bag mix.  I also like mine with a pump of Sugar Free Hazelnut, so I also bought Torani brand through Amazon.<br /><br />For coffee, I bought 2-lb bags for French Roast beans at Costco.  I grind and then make a strong pot of coffee (14 heaping teaspoons per 10 cups of coffee).  After the coffee is made, I pour it into ice cube trays and freeze them.<br /><br />The recipe is to add about 1 � cups of milk (I use 1%) in a blender, about one scoop of the White Chocolate Frappe mix, one "squirt" of the white mocha sauce, and one pump of the SFH.  Last, I add eight coffee ice cubes. I blend it all up, and it makes about 20 oz. of Frappe.<br /><br />Both my wife and I like it as much if not more that Starbucks, and of course it's much cheaper.  By using both our Prime membership and the Amazon Subscribe and Save, it's even less, the supplies are always on the shelf.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ABOCC0">MOCAFE Frappe  White Chocolate, Ice Blended Coffee, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RM">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

I order Torani Original White Chocolate by the case and use good bold coffee beans from Costco, usually from Rwanda. My daughter and I both agree, that my Saeco Giro, Torani and good beans make BETTER coffee than the big name coffee house, and we save close to $300 per month!!!!!!!!

Along with the peppermint syrup it makes a great peppermint white mocha drink, too.<br /><br />The pack of six is less expensive than in any store I've been able to find and the expiration dates give you plenty of time to use all six bottles.

review/text: I've found this to be very tasty in coffee, hot chocolate, and on ice cream. It's getting cold out and I frankly don't have the money to pick up a white chocolate mocha at Starbucks every time the whim strikes me--this works FAR better for getting that taste at home than the soda style syrups. It really does taste of white chocolate, not just a thick sweetness.<br /><br />A previous reviewer mentioned a thin, runny consistency, but I haven't found this to be the case. Perhaps there was something wrong with their batch? I wish it didn't have to be kept in the fridge after opening; the colder storage makes it even thicker.

review/summary: Watered down and runny...
review/text: I first purchased this from Amazon back in Mar 2008 for my lattes (to get the Starbucks flavor) and was extremely happy with both the price and product.  The sauce was nice and thick (actually had to squeeze the bottle a bit to get the product out) and delicious.  And you can't beat $19 price for 6 bottles (free shipping to boot!).<br /><br />I finally ran out last month and placed another order with Amazon.  The consistency this time was VERY runny and watered down... In fact, I ended up spilling some of the first bottle as I wasn't expecting it to be so watery.  I had to actually shake the bottle to get a more uniform consistency (which I never had to do before) and even then, it was still very runny to where I had to be careful when I poured (yes, poured... not drizzle) it into my coffee.  I checked the other 5 bottles and they were the same.<br /><br />Not sure what changed in their formula but I am definitely NOT happy with this new batch.  I would return it, but it wouldn't be worth my time and shipping cost (Amazon was running a special promotion at the time and I got the 6 bottles for around $15).<br /><br />I am generously giving it 2 stars only because the 1st order back in March was absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Not nearly as excited about my weekend lattes anymore....  :)

review/summary: Listen here Starbucks Fans!
review/text: Having worked in Starbucks years ago, I came to learn a great deal about making the "perfect" cup of coffee. Although I typically just use a dash of creamer to cut my espresso, when I want a latte I need something to give it the sweet kick it calls for. The problem is unlike the Fontana brand white chocolate syrup I used at Starbucks, this syrup requires a great deal more solution to give it the same sweetness. Mind you, this stuff works and taste great but the only downside is the amount you'll need to use to make your drink a White Chocolate Mocha Latte. Since both brands are the same price, the choice is up to you. Either way you won't go wrong, just be sure to avoid the mistake most baristas make... stir your drink good!

review/text: While to some the cost of this item may be appealing the taste is less than desirable.  It tastes nothing like the white mocha drinks that I have had in "any" coffee shops.  And, I see several mentions of Starbucks ..... it is not even close.  This is very artificial in taste and very runny.  We spent a lot on our espresso machine so we are not going to skimp on flavors, beans etc.  We use Fontana White Chocolate and while it does cost more it is what Starbucks uses per upper management from several locations - different label as Buck$ has their own labels.  Fontana is what was in Starbucks years ago - same container - same label.  A little more but also you use less syrup and the taste is spot on.

I feel like it is inferior to the real version!!!<br /><br />update:  they totally upgraded their bottle design, i nearly had a heart attack when i saw the new bottle.  it's so terrific.

My husband bought me the Tassimo machine and I found these here on Amazon to make my white mochas at home.  This sauce is amazing and the mochas I make at home are just as good if not better than the ones at Starbucks.  I always had problems getting them consistently good and it depended on the barista who was making them how they would turn out.  Now they are delicious every time and I don't have to leave home to get one.<br /><br />Just make sure you read the details that this needs to be refrigerated once opened.  I haven't used it in anything but mochas or regular coffee so far but I am looking forward to trying it on various other things.  I'm on my 3rd bottle already and I just bought it less than 2 months ago.  I drink mochas at least 4 times a week now.

review/text: I have had a venti white chocolate mocha (skim milk, no whipped cream) every morning at Starbucks for the last six years. After I bought a espresso machine, three weeks ago, I thought about making my own white chocolate mocha at home; so I decided to buy this product.<br />This morning I read the instructions on the bottle and put two table-spoons of that chocolate in my cup of coffee... Then, three, four and, finally, some sugar to add some flavor. I put over 250 calories in my coffee for nothing. I never got white chocolate flavor at all.<br />I am, to say the least, disappointed and, definitely, I will never buy (or recommend) this product again.

review/summary: Good black tea
review/text: Comes packaged in an airtight aluminum/plastic bag with a zip top and a scoop.  The dry tea smells good, not stale or bland.  The brewed tea tastes great as well.  I normally put a bit of sugar into black tea but I've been drinking this tea as is, although I'm sure it would taste good with cream and sugar as well.  I use an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">IngenuiTEA</a> brewer, which works great.

review/summary: Lakanto the "Best Sugar Substitute" for Me and My Family.
review/text: Just started using Lakanto Sweetener, and it was total success with my baked goods on Thanksgiving and with my Sweet Potatoes Casserole.  No one knew it was not sugar, and NO ONE Complained of Stomach or Intestinal problems.  So, I am sold on this sugar even know it's a bit pricy.  It has a nice brown sugar taste and works in most cookie recipes. The only thing I don't like is the price, but if more of us like it and more stores will start to carry it then perhaps the price will go down.  That would be wonderful.  Anyway, I prefer this over "Truvia" and other stevia like products that I have tried.  And I think it's healther than "Truvia" because there are no Unknown fillers in Lakanto. It's just pure Erythitol and Guo Han Guo.  So, I'm sold and will continue to buy this product.  There two other places where this can be bought. Saraya health  [...]

review/summary: Pricey, but so worth it!
review/text: I have been a sugar addict most of my life. If you had any idea the amount of sugar I ate on a daily basis you would be shocked... sugary cereals for b'fast, donuts mid morning, large amounts of sugary flavored creamer in my numerous coffees throughout the day, candy bars whenever I got a little peckish, desserts after lunch and dinner... and of course a little something sweet at bedtime. Always craving it. I had tried stevia and splenda over the years, even splurging on Vanilla-flavored Stevia for my coffee hoping to finally eradicate that addiction, but it was horrible tasting! Stumbled across Lakanto by accident, and read the reviews. This stuff is awesome! I have kicked my sugar addiction completely, and lost 12 lbs in the last month. My belly is gone... I have converted over to just Lakanto in my coffee, which is rather pleasant, though a little less so if it starts getting cold. I simply drink my coffee quickly or reheat it if needed. I have baked with it as well, and it works beautifully! I don't know if I have lost my sweet tooth, but I actually have to back off a little on the substitution, as a one-to-one substitution is a bit too sweet for me. I love that it has a wonderful brown sugar/mapley flavor. Tastes very natural and does not have that icky weird fake sugar taste. I have requested my local Publix supermarket to carry this, and am hoping they come through, as I am running low. I will def be on this stuff for life. I am a Registered Nurse, and very aware of nutrition and its effects on health, and couldn't be happier with this choice.

Being so fresh they tasted better than ever. Well, since I could not have so many bars around me I gave most of them to my primary grade students.

Difficult to cook properly & tastes like a wretched abortion at the end of the process. The absolute WORST Hamburger Helper variety I've ever had. We barely touched it for dinner that night & it took days for the critters to completely scavenge it out of our backyard.<br />Just say "no" to this "product!"

review/summary: One big bag with many leaking
review/text: Not nearly what I was hoping for.  They are indeed the candy wax bottles as hoped for, BUT...<br /><br />As the other review stated, they do not arrive in 1 lb bags, there is just one large 3 lb bag, so the product details are slightly off on this product.  That is not that bad though.<br /><br />The problem we experienced was that many of the bottles had leaked, and were still leaking, and many of them were stuck together.  I do not have an exact count of how many leaked, but it was enough to disappoint and prolonged the enjoyment of the remaining bottles until they had all taken a nice long bath.  I don't know if the leaking and clumping is a matter of the seller's handling or from shipping.  I can say that for $5.99 in shipping, I did expect the product to be packaged in more than 2 plastic bags and a USPS envelope.

review/summary: Tasty, organic, eco-friendly. VERY impressed.
review/text: Received a sample of this product at a natural foods show and tried it. There are so many things I love about it - only beginning with how good it tastes. This product is low sugar, low calorie and it has no artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners. Its organic so no pesticide residue and no genetically modified ingredients. The small foil packet is easy to transport and can be mixed to your taste preference: 8oz water for a sweet drink, 12-16oz water for medium sweetness, 20oz water for a flavored water drink. Cheaper than buying a bottled drink of this sort - especially with the subscribe and save option from Amazon. Absolutely love that this takes a disposable plastic drink bottle out of the equation! I usually drink this at home when I feel a cold coming on so I can mix it in glass. The packet is easy to open and easy to mix - just pull the perforated tab at the top off and pour into a glass of water or your own water bottle. Makes a great smoothie base too. This helped solve the problem of how to take psyllium husk and make it taste decent: mix a packet with 12 oz water, pour off 8 oz (save the other 4 oz to drink later) and add 1 rounded tsp psyllium husk, let sit to thicken. You end up with what I would describe as a healthy jello that tastes more like a treat than a fiber drink. Cons: can't think of any. And no, I don't work for this company!

Many dog foods are grain recipes with a smattering of meat ingredients. In B.G. there's no wheat, no corn, no soy, no rice, no oatmeal. What you will find is salmon, chicken meal, turkey meal, egg, and dried chicken liver. There's plenty of protein here for your carnivore dog without those distasteful animal by-products.  An extra special enhancement for me is the inclusion of Sweet Potato!

review/text: I have two miniature schnauzers, one of whom has started suffering from skin allergies that makes him incredibly itchy. In order to help him, I switched him to a grain-free diet and wanted to emphasize salmon as the protein for the Omega fatty acids (which also help skin and coat issues). He also has a nail condition (which is under control) but I think that this food also helps with that. Obviously, he loves it, too! He gobbles it right up -- always a good sign. And I love and trust the Merrick brand, knowing I'm giving my dogs high-quality food.<br /><br />The only unfortunate part is that my other dog, who is smaller, doesn't particularly like this food. I think the kernels are simply too big for him to chew comfortably (I had them on a small breed food before which he had no problems with). I hate the idea of having to feed my dogs two separate kinds of food, but oh well. Such is the life of being one of "those kinds" of dog owners!

review/summary: Best Earl Grey in the Market
review/text: We are tea drinkers and drink multiple cups of tea in a day. Dilmah Earl Grey is one of the finest teas in the market and we kid you not. This is the only 100% pure Ceylon single origin tea available in the market at this time. We have tried several other items of this brand - Ceylon Supreme, Orange Pekoe and Green Teas and they are by far several times better tasting and refreshing than any other brand. We just read in an article that Dilmah Earl Grey has twice the amount of Antioxidants than Bigelow Earl grey as Dilmah Teas are packed fresh and at source.<br /><br />Our entire family is just truly hooked on Dilmah. The key to any Artisinal and traditionally manufactured tea is to brew it properly for min 3 minutes or the taste profile will not come and the tea will stay light. The cheap brands use a method called CTC (Cut-twist-Curl) which gives an instant color but lack the soul of the tea, which is flavor and of feeling refreshed.<br /><br />There are multiple reviews on Dilmah Brand on Amazon and no one has rated the particular item or the brand as the previous reviewer.

review/summary: Not even Earl Grey
review/text: I have been on a lifetime quest to find the best Earl Grey tea on the planet. Other reviews said Dilmah had a strong fragrance, and was an excellent Earl Grey. Bunk. I LOVE to breathe the wonderful, exotic aroma of a freshly-opened Earl Grey tea box or pouch. But when I opened a brand new box of this tea, I got nothing.Perhaps it's because of the foil wraps, I mused. Alas, even when I hold the pouch with a tea bag still inside it, I get no aroma-none. There is no oil of bergamot in this tea. It is not Earl Grey. The label is misleading. As a Ceylon tea it is fair, with average to weak strength. But as an Earl Grey it is an abomination. Stick to the proven winners- Stash is great, Yorkshire is very good, Harney and Sons is superb, as is the Republic of Tea. Don't buy this tea! There's a reason it's marked down.

review/summary: Not Twinings!
review/text: It was an impulse purchase, new product  to me, and inexpensive, Dilmah Earl Grey tea. Figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is a weak tea with little body and flavor. Barely a hint of bergumont in smell or taste. I brew 2 tea bags per cup just to get close to what I'm accustom to drinking. So there is no savings in cost when compared to my favorite premimum brand.<br /><br />I will not purchase Dilmah brand again.

review/summary: Worst Earl Grey I've Had
review/text: This is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had. Bar none. The tea is so incredibly weak it is indistinguishable from normal black tea. I kid you not. I often looked at the box and the bags trying to determine if some mistake in packaging was made. The insert says "mild flavor" and they really do mean it. So mild you cannot taste the bergamot oil at all! I ended up using these as black tea filler in my iced tea mix, but I will never buy a Dilmah product again after being ripped off by this substandard tea. I can recommend Bigelow Earl Grey for economy minded folk. Just one of those tea bags has more flavor than an entire box of Dilmah's wretched excuse for an Earl Grey.

review/summary: Strong Bergamot Perfume
review/text: ***<br />This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.<br />***

review/summary: The best way to buy gluten!
review/text: If you bake a lot of homemade yeast bread and rolls, this is the best way to buy gluten.  Even bread flour doesn't have enough gluten to make yeast bread light and fluffy, and whole wheat flour is a different story altogether.  I order gluten in these great big cans, and it beats the heck out of trying to find it in little boxes in the stores.  Even my whole wheat bread is light and yummy.

review/summary: Perfect for seitan
review/text: I buy this to make huge batches of seitan. Freeze it down and cuts back on weekly cooking time drastically.

review/summary: Great value for the money!
review/text: The only source for Vital Wheat Gluten available locally is a 1.5 Cup package on sale at Wal-Mart as a baking additive -- at a cost of nearly $2.00 (USD). This 3.5 pound package was a godsend as I have an entire folder of seitan recipes I've wanted to try -- and now I'm working my way deliciously through it!

review/summary: That's a lot of gluten
review/text: I never really realized how much gluten was in a 3.5 pound can. I now have gluten for life. Bought this to make wheat bread. It works as advertised and makes the wheat bread rise nicely. Since we have so much I decided to expand our horizons and make some seitan (sp?). That didn't go over very well with the family. I guess I'll stick with using it for bread. At two teaspoons of gluten per loaf of wheat bread, I won't need to buy any for a while.

review/summary: great for breads
review/text: It really made my bread rise and stay fresh.  I have been told that home made bread from bread machines does not keep for longer than one day or maybe two.  My bread stayed fresh longer and I think it was due to the wheat gluten.  It tasted very nice as well which is fantastic

review/summary: Best deal on Wheat Gluten
review/text: Hands down, this is the best bulk deal on Wheat Gluten around. If you were to buy this same amount at Whole Foods (in the tiny boxes they offer) you'd pay 2-3 times as much.
