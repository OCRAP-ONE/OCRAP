review/text: Great Product!<br /><br />This was a gift from my friend who's a top chef & he loves using it.<br /><br />It sure makes it easy for me...one bottle and the meal is "spiced" just right....no guessing how much of what herbs to use.<br /><br />AWESOME GARLIC FLAVOR!  The garlic tastes fresher than the garlic in my fridge...it's amazing and ORGANIC....maybe that's why it tastes so rich??

review/summary: Yummy Goodness
review/text: This jerky is my favorite snack treat.  I buy it in quantities of ten packages at a time because it goes that fast.  I can eat a bag by myself in one sitting.  It is highly addictive.  The honey pepper flavor is my favorite kind.<br /><br />I bought a bag of this to work, and after tasting it, people were asking me where they could buy it.  Everyone loved it.  It went like hotcakes!  Now people are always coming to me asking me if I have any more beef jerky.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to everyone who loves jerky.  It is a bit chewy and gets stuck in between your teeth, but the taste it well worth it.

review/text: The Buffalo Bills "Honey Pepper Beef Jerky" is a very tender and good tasting snack. The honey flavor is not overpowering and the pepper adds a nice "bite".<br /><br />My only issue is that it does contain MSG (which I didn't notice until ater I ate it), so be advised if that is an issue for you.<br /><br />A very good tasing, high quality jerky!

review/summary: The best online
review/text: I recently found myself on a jerky hunt.  After visting Texas and finding out that real jerky is nothing like a Slim Jim I have been looking to find anything with serious pepper and heat.  This is the best I could find.  The only reason this is not five stars is because there is better jerky, just not packaged as far as I have found.<br /><br />The pices are meaty and firm.  They could use more pepper but there is enough to give you a nice little burn that builds while you eat and for a little while after.  The 8oz packages are far more than you will find in most stores but if you find this is what you like, you will still go through it in a week pretty easily so you might as well buy two.

review/summary: Hands down, the best jerky I've EVER eaten!
review/text: While I discovered this product through Amazon, I purchased it through their website so that I'd be sure to receive a free sample (also saved 1 penny!). Sorry Amazon, I still love you! Amazon is a better deal if only ordering one or two of their products.<br /><br />This jerky FAR exceeded my expectations.  It's not too peppery nor is it too sweet.  They balanced the flavors PERFECTLY!  The flavors don't taste artificial as can be the case with some products.  There's a subtle sweet honey flavor in the background, with a stronger peppery taste in the foreground.  Just DELICIOUS!<br /><br />The beef itself is not too moist, nor too tough when chewing.  The consistency is perfect.  It even looks appetizing, the pieces not being thick and clunky, nor too thin.  They really nailed this product.<br /><br />I purchased this to eat when I'm working late and need a quick snack.  Considering the price, I'd planned to save it for when I really needed it.  It's already gone, including the other flavors I ordered.  It's THAT good!<br /><br />BUY SOME!

review/text: I got this and the western cut sweet n' spicy. I liked this more. The country cut is thicker pieces and overall just better; seems more homemade. I love the combination of the pepper and the honey. You wouldn't know it was honey; it just adds a little sweetness. I wouldn't have liked a strong honey flavor anyway. It also has a smell that I really like. You have to try it. If you have to pick one kind of Buffalo Bills, try this one first.

review/text: This jerky is just great.  It was expensive, but at the same time the consistency and softness of the jerky was absolutely great, and the taste was very good for packaged beef jerky.  I would definitely recommend this, however I wish they were less expensive... I might not be buying this regularly just because of the price, since it's pretty much double of what I paid for Wild Ride jerky, which definitely isn't as good, but is more economical for me as a poor college student.

I had to use a knife to scrape the pepper off of the surface before I could stand to eat it.  Also very salty.  If you love pepper or can't taste pepper, then this might be for you.

review/text: Purchased these during a fantastic Grocery Deals promotion. I am in my car a lot for work and find that I don't eat properly.  One of my NY Resolutions was to at least find healthier ways of eating poorly :) .  The best thing about this mix is NO RAISINS. I am one of those people that dislike raisins and it has always been an issue with trail mix.  The mix is a perfect balance of nuts, granola, and dried fruit.  The dried fruit doesn't have that overly sweet taste and the granola chunks are nice.<br />These will be something that I will throw in the saddlebags on long motorcycle trips as well.

review/summary: An Excellent Food
review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it! My only quibble with the senior formulation of this great food is that it is very dry - I really do recommend that you add at least a touch of a good oil and water to it to prevent dry skin - dogs get most of their hydration from food.

review/summary: used to love it, but a scary experience for my golden raised questions
review/text: I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent.  Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach.<br /><br />Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms.  (Both bags were not expired.)<br /><br />I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system.<br /><br />I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not.<br /><br />If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods.

I have spent the last year and a half rescuing dogs from high kill shelters and after vaccinating, spaying, neutering, caring for many different needs, have found homes for 352 dogs. Many have fostered at my home. All dogs have thrived on Wellness original formula. My largest, oldest dog is 14 and weighs 140 pounds and is doing great, though before I found Wellness, the lab/chesapeake was showing symptoms of hip dysplasia. He actually has lost 20 pounds and doing well.

review/summary: High quality, but be cautious with picky eaters
review/text: One of my dogs has always been picky with dry food, and this one here is not his favorite. He gives me the saddest look when I put this down in front of him, and it takes him forever to eat it. I do wish the bits were slightly smaller since he's missing a big chomper (and I imagine lots of older dogs have sensitive and/or missing teeth). It's the same size as other Wellness dry foods, from what I have observed: triangle shaped...small, but sort of thick pieces. He tends to prefer thin kibble.<br /><br />I know this is a high quality food because I've done my research, and my other two dogs love the taste (they love anything) but I would start out with a small bag and see how it goes before buying a large bag. Start out gradually, mixing it in with their old food, so they have a chance to adjust.<br /><br />Also note this stuff has a distinct smell compared to most other dry foods; it's not bad, just unique. It's like a spice of some sort. Maybe that's why my picky eater doesn't like it. I do know that Wellness Healthy Weight is much more mild smelling.

review/summary: High quality food that helped my dog lose weight
review/text: I switched to this food about two months ago and it's a perfect fit for my dog. He has a sensitive digestive system and I was looking for a corn- and wheat-free food. He also has joint issues (ACL surgery 6 months ago), and he's 13 years old. After two months eating this food, he has shed his excess weight almost effortlessly (although we've cut down on the treats a bit too). He loves the flavor and I've noticed that he has more energy. His coat is silky soft. I feel good feeding him this high quality food and hope that it will extend his life... forever.

review/summary: The Best Dog Food For Seniors Look No Further
review/text: My 13 year old Rescued Belgian Shepherd Groenendael has passed on after a short 6 year stay with me! I was a newbie to pet care when Samantha (Sammie) came into my life, initially I feed her one of the advertised dog foods (I---). The females shed twice a year, in my case it was 12 months a year, it was awful to the point of me almost going insane. I loved and hated my beautiful dog! I researched the internet and asked anyone I could if there was a solution to Sammie's problem. I even tried other brands which she wouldn't eat, this became costly.<br />Finally a Petco representative turned me on to Wellness Senior blend. It is as special blend minus fillers , etc., it had vitamins, plus G. Condrodin (sp) for her hip problems.<br />I gradually adjusted her diet over a period of a couple weeks Wellness is a very rich dog food, dogs need to adjust to the new food. She loved the taste, after a short period of time her shedding almost came to a stop along with her dandruff.  After her passing I found out Groenendaels need to be brushed daily or at least several times a week, if you do this regularly they do not need bathing. That is what the experts say. The breed is really Very Special, a great family dog check them out.<br />There is no way you can go wrong with Wellness dog foods, be sure to go to their web site to check out their science, be sure to read the customer testimonials. You will be happy you did!!!!

review/summary: Best dog food ever
review/text: We have a lab mix, now 12 years old and doing amazingly well on Wellness Senior. We had a scary experience with another "natural" dog food. After using it for over a year this other brand suddenly made our dog very ill. We did not figure it out right away as he is a lab and will eat ANYTHING. Usually once or twice a year he gets into something that make him ill for a few days. Last time, we did our usual routine of rice and chicken stock. He got better, put him back on the other food, and he got worse again. After another cycle like that, we realized it must be the other food. So we went down tot he local pet shop looking for something better. They recommended Wellness and we have never looked back. After only a week or so on Wellness, Bear's coat got was noticeably more lustrous. Now, almost two years later we still are amazed by this food. I love the fact that it does not even smell like "dog food". The ingredients list is totally free of the usual gunk that is in most food. Yeah it is a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Even his stool does not smell!

review/summary: Switch from Science Diet
review/text: Wellness had been recommended by several pet owners, primarily because of the use of more natural ingredients versus more processed ingredients in Science Diet.  My dog has made the transition from Science Diet to Wellness without any problems.  Still too early to tell if this will have a positive impact on her health, but I could probably say that about the Science Diet even after all the years I have used it.  I started buying Wellness through Amazon after my local pet chain store stopped carrying the Wellness we use in the larger size.

review/summary: My pug loves this food...
review/text: My pug comes running when he see's me filling up his bowl with this stuff. I really like it because since I started him on Wellness Supermix senior , his shedding has almost stopped , he is getting around much better (he's 13) and his is as slim and trim as he was as a teenager. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Wellness has no oils in it to keep his skin moist. So if you buy this , be sure to add a few drops of Omega 3 oil to it or your dog may be scratching more from dry skin. It is a very healthy food for your dog. I plan on feeding any dog I ever get in the future this stuff.

I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)

review/text: I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than "NA/CL", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt. But I do not know if Himalayan does supply iodine. The food tastes great, you can feel the difference. Great product!!

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

It does start to clump rather quickly.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

review/summary: Fluoridated salt
review/text: I thought this salt was fluoride free unfortunately it is fluoridated, avoid paying extra. [...]. (Over the last few years a new scam has emerged in Europe which is rapidly spreading across the world.<br /><br />  It involves ordinary rock salt from the "salt range" in Pakistan being marketed as luxurious and healing "Himalaya Salt".<br /><br />  It is also sold as "Himalayan Crystal Salt", "Hunza-Kristallsalz" or natural "Kristallsalz", "VitaSal", "AromaLife", etc..<br /><br />  The scam is currently being introduced in India and the United States.<br /><br />  It will result in very high overall fluoride intake in anyone who follows the various "therapy recommendations") also noted from above website.

review/text: Great product. Tastes amazing. I am in love with this salt and will definitely get more. I got the salt at a great sales price. I did think the shipping was a bit steep but I don't often ship a "pound" of something. I kind of felt the shipping was making up the sales price but maybe it was justified. Overall happy with the product.

review/text: I won't bore you with stats about salt, the good bad or ugly. Yes, you are supposed to take it in moderation, so when you do salt your food, it should be done with this salt. It is a really high quality pure, and tasty treat. It offers a little more distinction that your Kosher Sea Salt, which is a bland NaCL. This is chock full of trace minerals that your body needs.<br /><br />Bottom line: good product.

review/summary: This salt blows away "Real" salt!
review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

When I smoke Salmon, I will dry rub this salt on to the fish 8 hours before I hot smoke it with hickory.  Himalayan salt taste is quite unique and the flavor it imparts to smoked meats and fish is very good.  It is not at all bitter as some other salts are.

review/text: Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.  I use this salt for all my salt uses including cooking but cut the amount in half since it is so salty.  This salt is not processed like other salts so is not iodized if you need that process.  We like it much better that our regular table or kosher salt.

It is amazingly smooth with slight but perceptible mineral notes in the flavor. Kosher type salts seem to have a sharper edge to the taste. I highly recommend it for steaks or grilled salmon. It also gives a unique flavor and appearance to margaritas. Wonderful product.

I find that sea salt has more of a mouth watering quality, whereas this salt is more of a sharp saltiness.<br /><br />It would be excellent for desserts - like salt water taffy or a salty caramel.

review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...
