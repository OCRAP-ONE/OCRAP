review/summary: Jesus Should've Turned Water Into THIS!
review/text: I was looking forward to this soda for quite a while and after such a prolonged wait I was more than a little concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Well it is with great relief that I can now say those worries went unfounded.<br /><br />7-Up beautifully captures the true meaning of effervescence and it captures it rather appropriately in a plastic bottle. A clear bottle at that because 7-Up has nothing to hide. Everything that makes it great is there for all to see and see through, unless you're blind, in which case I'm afraid you'll have to settle for listening to it. Not that listening to those sparkling little miracles we call bubbles is any less satisfying than seeing them. In fact hearing those popping and fizzling sounds canoodle in and around your earlobe area can be quite cathartic, depending on what type of day you're having.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Go grab a nice refreshing bottle of 7 Eleven!

review/summary: Great price, low salt, hypoallergenic oil, but.. sand....
review/text: Our family got hooked on smoked baby clams, and we're exploring our options.  This product attracted by its price, low salt content, cottonseed oil (hopefully hypoallergenic)("olive oil" unless its extra virgin is usually mixed with soy or corn oil).  Unfortunately, the taste of this product is just tolerable it is not that great - it smells like raw seaweed and tasted similar;the smoke flavor is more like "fried" flavor, it is not very prominent. The biggest minus is - this is why i will get a different brand instead of Roland - the clams are not well rinsed and have a lot of sand in them...

review/summary: Caol Ila 12 is big peat married to a lush floral honeyed flavor and a soft gentle manner
review/text: Caol Ila (kaal ee-lah) was always the last word in iodiney in my previous tastings.  This current 12 year expression impressed the heck out of me with its sweeter flowery side and gentle nature.  I usually dock points for being less assertive - but this is a real winner.<br /><br />Pale gold/straw color in the glass.<br /><br />The nose up front is peat smoke and iodine. With time rubber and medicinal notes and a hint of sweetness and richness come underneath that opens into toffee and nougat.  It's a complex and lovely aroma.<br /><br />Entry is toffee and vanilla sweet with immediate vanilla floral notes and a nicely moderate peat smoke presentation that turns intensely honeyed and floral at midpalate after extensive time in the glass.  At the finish the smoke and medicinal iodine reasserts itself and a bitter edge adds a citrus quality. As the afterglow fades the medicinal note lingers and becomes herbal - eucalyptus?  Finish is long but gentle.  Mouthfeel is silky and light.  There is a deft and nimble quality here that is absent from most Islay malts with this much peat smoke in evidence.<br /><br />Big honeyed peat, but with a gentle edge (for an Islay, anyway).  Caol Ila 12 is a vibrant strong peat and sea air voyage with a lovely honey sweet floral quality.  The whole ensemble of disparate elements is remarkably well balanced and, frankly, delicious.  This is a must for Islay enthusiasts of peat and ocean, but with it's flowery sweetness and lighter texture, weight, and proof, it's also a bridge into this flavor profile for drinkers of "regular" scotch.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: This formula helped our colicky baby
review/text: Unlike others, I am reviewing the product itself, not delivery of the product.  This formula has given us our happy baby back.  She is still slightly gassy, but all babies are and it is MUCH better on the soy.  We tried at least four other formulas before the pediatrician gave us samples of this; the change was immediate.  That first evening was one of the quietest we had in a while (previously, the crying started at 7pm and lasted a good 2 hours).  I was concerned about giving our daughter soy (Google soy formula on the Internet), but she advised that the concern is over Soy milk - not formula; that the formula is made for babies and is regulated.  You can't believe everything you read.  You should always consult with your baby's doc first (obviously) and in the end, do what's right for your family.  I gave 4 stars vs. 5 because the ready made stains baby's clothing more than the powdered.  However, I prefer the ready made because it looks and smells better and the powder doesn't mix well.  You have to warm the water first to get it right.

review/summary: Great formula...packaging could be better
review/text: We began using the ProSobee after determining that our little one suffers from formula intolerance (just can't handle cow's milk at all). The ProSobee is wonderful at addressing this problem and the ready to use cans are a life saver!<br /><br />The only issue I had with my order was that 3 of the 6 cans arrived badly dented (not enough padding around them inside the box) and as dented canned goods present risk of botulism poisoning I couldn't use them for my 4-mo-old.<br /><br />Amazon replied to my inquiry within a couple of hours and the rep was wonderful at helping me sort out which return policy applied to this particular item. Then they issued a credit for the damaged cans...without requiring any additional paperwork which was nice because let's face it, with a baby in the house, I'm busy enough! :)<br /><br />Great customer service! I'd just like to see them work to improve the way they package items like this for shipping.

review/summary: Tops in my house
review/text: Okay, how do you "review" somthing called "cheesy nacho"?<br /><br />It's hambuger helper.  You add hamburger, stir in the boxed ingredients, simmer the requisite amount of time, perhaps add some special ingredients (see below,) let it sit for a few minutes, and your hungry guys (make that "my" hungry guys) will fight over the serving spoon and you'll hope there's some left for you, while you feel like a hero.<br /><br />Honestly, this goes over well and I feel a little bit guilty that it is really that simple (or they are really that simple to please.)<br /><br />I recommend experimenting with adding a tiny bit of pepper and/or Carribean Jerk Seasoning (don't overdo it!) and/or nutmeg.  I almost always add a dash of sour cream, which generally overcomes the tendendcy to be a bit "boxy" tasting. This stuff generally already has enough salt, so I wouldn't add any more.<br /><br />I usually serve this with a side dish of corn, and some of the family members like the corn mixed in (the hard-core casserole crowd) and the rest just like it on the side.  Either way, it's a solid fills-you-up meal that will satisfy all but the most persnickety family member, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg.<br /><br />Drain the hamburger before you add the other ingredients to remove excess fat, and you won't have to feel guilty about the fat content.  Life should be so guilt-free all the time.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Brew over ice! Instant sweet tea
review/text: I am not a drinker of sweet tea (though a friend of mine years ago made the most incredible tea on her stove and I know it's an addictive drink. She'd boil up about 10 bags of Luzianne and add sugar after brewing, chill it and it was phenomenal.) But all that sugar is not good for my waistline so I try to avoid it. But once in a while, there is nothing like a glass of it on a hot day.<br /><br />This tea for the VUE can be brewed right over ice using the Iced Drink setting. How cool is that! If you want a taller glass, remove entirely the black base (it's three parts--a drain insert, the platform--silver colored, and the black base unit which pulls forward and out with a bit of a tug to come out entirely.) Add ice to the glass, set up the VUE on the touch screen for iced brewing and blammo, tea.<br /><br />I brewed it 10 oz and that was too much for a glass full of ice (16 oz thermal glass.) I'd suggest brewing 8 oz and it will melt the ice but be cooled, and then you can add more ice as you choose. Note that the sweetness is concentrated at the bottom (I noted the tea brewing in a stream that headed right down the center of the glass of ice) so stir well.<br /><br />This tea is not bad at all, pleasant flavor of black tea--and it is partially sweetened with Stevia, which is a non-sugar sweetener derived from a South American herb. I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners--but stevia is supposed to have beneficial properties and has been used in Japan for years, where saccharine and aspartame were never approved by their version of the FDA. Stevia's flavor is compatible with tea so this tastes fairly good. Not as good as the syrupy sugary true Southern sweet tea, but this has less sugar and is very convenient.<br /><br />If you are diabetic, well, sad to say, there IS sugar in this blend, and if you hate stevia, you'll have a problem as well, but for most people, this would be a welcome cup of iced tea. I did not notice any particular flavor of stevia (in large amounts, it can have a sort of licorice twinge, but even at the bottom where the sugar settled, I noticed no particular flavor.)  I think it's a good compromise in this circumstance, and if you have ice available at your office, you could use the VUE to offer a glass of sweet tea to a guest or have it in your breakroom. And it's nice for guests at home, when you don't have a big pitcher of sweet tea handy in the fridge and you want to offer it to a neighbor who stops by.

review/text: These are great. I ordered these for a nautical themed bridal shower to give away as favors. They look like they shouldn't be edible, just like stones, but they taste great. Exactly like M&Ms to be exact, and who doesn't like M&M's? There were some that were broken in the bottom, the seller shipped in a bag and I think if these were shipped in a box there would be less broken,... but there are 3 pounds of them, so the broken ones are essentially negligible. The centers were slightly melted, but it was hot out and this did not destroy the integrity of the product. Some time inside room temperature or a refrigerator would solve this problem anyway. I would recommend these.

review/summary: Passed muster in our house!
review/text: We ordered these to see what they tasted like as compared to other GF bars that we keep on hand at home. Most of the typically on-hand bars are loaded with calories (over 200), so for us the junior size was ideal. We have a house that can't have any gluten, oats, barley or rye. Yes, the minis are small, but for a quick 100-calorie bite or to carry for long runs or bike trips, they're perfect. Both my husband and I think they're tasty and the price is very reasonable as compared to other GF options. It's not a meal, but for a snack, we love them. Because of my husband's oat allergy, we can't eat any granola options, even if labeled as GF. So these are a great substitute for that favorite of ours that is no longer in the house. We'll definitely purchase them again.

review/summary: Not to our taste
review/text: There are few bars which contain only ingredients that are on our diet and these seemed worth a try since there were several different flavors to sample.  However, they are dry and have very little taste. As far as the different flavors,they all were so bland that there didn't seem to be much difference from one "flavor" to another.<br /><br />Perhaps we are terribly spoiled because I make delicious fruit and nuts bars, but we keep commercially made individually packaged bars on hand as carry along snacks and emergency on-the-road meals.  We do enjoy the Lara bars and the Rise (formerly Boomi brand) bars that contain ingredients we can eat.  We did not like these. Other people might think they are great.

review/summary: Not great
review/text: I bought these for my 8 year old son because he has Celiac disease and I wanted to buy him something different to try. He has been eating gluten free for for 7 years and is used to the sometimes bland tastes and different textures of gluten free foods and generally likes most things.  Even if the product isn't that great, he will almost always eat the item anyway.  These, however, were not something he will eat. He tried the different flavors in the variety pack and told me they are gross. He won't even eat them when he's starving before dinner as a quick snack. He would rather go hungry.  So, for us, this wasn't a good product.  The size of the bars are pretty small, which would make a good snack size for a toddler (if you can get a toddler to eat these), but I can't recommend these based on my son's experience. This is the absolute ONLY gluten free item he has ever refused to eat.

review/text: I enjoy Halvah bars occasionally as a healthy treat and I was surprised to find some brands still use partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (aka Trans Fats) ...which is the opposite of healthy!<br /><br />Camel Halvah bars are completely natural with no partially hydrogenated vegetable oil!!! It is delicious, contains 4gms of omega 6 fatty acids, no cholesterol, low in saturated fat and contains no granulated sugar.<br /><br />This is not a diet food however. Each bar serves 3 at 150 calories per serving. The problem is: its so tasty, its hard to stop at one serving and so easy to just finish the whole thing. Thats 450 calories, which is more than enough for an entire meal. It would be nice if they could package bars in one serving sizes.

So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price significantly lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, "Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful".<br /><br />In addition, they are "hand packed" and "100 % natural".<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!<br /><br />25 tins is not too many.

Enfamil does not smell as strong as the Similac and my baby seemed to do better on it.  Both of my kids needed to be formula fed/supplemented.  My older child did better on Similac.  Sometimes it takes trail and error to find what your baby does best on.  Your doctor usually has free samples to try until you find the right one.  Delivery was prompt and I had no other issues with my order.

They adhere to the highest standards for both product and manufacturing processes, far exceeding the requirements for organic certification. This is the most delicious soy milk we have tried, and I like that it is enriched with vitamins. Our daughter loves the vanilla. I use it to mix up my protein vitamin shakes - YUM! Great to have milk in a shelf-stable package -- just chill a few for school lunches, toss them in your picnic cooler, or pour over ice when you want to enjoy a healthy delicious drink. I used to order cases directly from EdenSoy (at high shipping cost due to weight!) Now I am SO happy that Amazon is carrying this soymilk (and other EdenSoy products) with free super-saver shipping!!

review/summary: The REAL Soymilk
review/text: As most soymilk drinkers know, this is the epitome of all soymilks. Edensoy is a tested, tried, and true soymilk. It is far superior (exception may be homemade versions) to other soymilks. Edensoy is *real* soymilk and is what soymilk is *really* supposed to taste like. It is simply exceptional.

review/summary: Edensoy
review/text: Edensoy has great stuff. I buy it because my 2-year old has milk allergy. This time I bought the extra fortified, for all those vitamins. He didn't go for the taste--just cuz he was used to the store brand soy milk. But graduallywe're working up to a full cup of Eden. I particularly like these little almost-9 ounce boxes, cuz they are great to take along in the car or whereever and fit right in my purse.<br /><br />I can't wait for Amazon to  get the full size container tho.

review/text: I stumbled across Mega Smarties in a convenience store, bought them, loved them, and then found them here on Amazon. I've eaten the little Smarties since I was a kid, but Mega Smarties have a different taste - a bit more tart. I can eat more of these in a sitting than I care to admit. If you like the original Smarties, SweetTarts, Spree, etc, you can be confident you will like Mega Smarties.

review/summary: Doesnt taste like coconut
review/text: This product shipped quickly and is inexpensive. That shouldve possibly tipped me off. I dont remember that the ingredients of the tea are listed here, but in any case there is no real coconut in the tea itself, just coconut oil and some other flavored oils. It really does not smell or taste like coconut. It also is probably made of an inferior black tea, AND it contains Mate (per the inredient list on the pckge) which is highly caffeinated and has a wierd hay-ish, grassy taste that I dont really like. I wouldnt have ordered this tea if I knew it did not have any coconut in it and contained yerba, but that said, maybe some pple (according to these reviews) like those tastes so .....in any case it was a relatively inexpensive experiment. I'd like to find some high quality black tea with real coconut in the ingredients.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I have tried every kibble known to man on my dogs over the years, and this one is the best. I feed a primarily raw diet, but supplement with kibble.  Previously Wellness Core had given me fairly good results with allergies etc, but the stools were 'greasy'. I also had them on Orijin, but had horrible sloppy stools on that.  I had been searching for a grain free food that had some carbohydrates in it to reduce the protein and fat content, but has no grains.  This food ticks all the boxes and then some! Great stools, shiny coats, no more 'eye goop', less hair loss, no more 'itchies'!  They have been on it about a month and a half, and the difference in the three girls is absolutely amazing.  Love it!

None compare with this food. It's well priced, has amazing ingredients, and my dog has never been in better health. Her stool is as good as it gets - no more soft or runny poop. It's also a six-star (best) food according to numerous dog food review sites. The only thing better than this is raw.

review/text: I have two Jack Russell terriers who have different dietary challenges. One has a grain allergy and the other digestive issues with bloat. Since using this food, both dogs are looking more lean, have more energy and their alertness has improved. They can both eat this food and really love the taste. I am almost done with the 26 pound bag and they still look forward to mealtime with zest. I have tried Wellness Core and Buffalo and neither can compare. My dogs had gas with the Buffalo and they really do not like the Wellness Core. Try this food, you will not be disappointed. I am so glad Amazon is selling this food as I have not found it in my area except for one grocery store and the smaller sizes are only available.

review/summary: The best dry food
review/text: We recently purchased a new Boxer puppy and I did allot of research beforehand on what is considered the very best dry dog food. This is the one I chose over all the others. I slowly switched our puppy over from what the breeder was feeding and she is on straight GO! NGFEF and has not had any problems. So glad to see Amazon has picked up this product as it is hard to find in my area and it can be delivered right to my door for the same pet store cost without driving across town to get it (after I special order it). As one reviewer mentioned, only a raw diet is better than this one.

In one week after having my Lady Belle on Go Natural, I saw a huge improvement: her break-outs lessened, she was more energetic, she lost weight. After two weeks her break-outs had mostly cleared up. I'm not claiming that this is some miracle dog-food, but if your dog has food allergies, this brand is a good choice. My dog loves this food and it loves her back :)

review/summary: Stopped the constant itching and licking of paws
review/text: Tried this product to reduce the itching and licking behaviors that have plagued my two dogs. One dog was scratching so bad, he sounded like "Thumper" and has had surgery two times to heal wounds caused by the licking. The other dog has a history of ear problems. Within a week, the dog with the itching problem stopped scratching, and both dogs stopped licking their paws.  The dog with the ear problems hasn't had symptoms (shaking and digging at his ear)since we started this food in December 2011. The jury is still out on that one sinced Spring has not yet sprung, but this is a potential outcome I had not expected.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results of the grain-free diet. One negative is that the older dog has very bad dog farts at times. Whew! I would like to see a grain-free for seniors! I don't mind the increased cost, especially since it is offset by their improved health, fewer visits to the vet, and the fact that they eat half as much.<br /><br />Now, fellow humans....if this is what grains do to dogs, what do we think is going on with our diets?????

review/summary: Dogs switched to it easily, cleared up an apparent alergy in one dog
review/text: Switched dog food again. The last brand was okay, dogs liked/ate it well enough, but we noticed our larger dog seemed to develop some strange skin reaction. (If you rubbed her fur in certain places she would grimace as if irritated, even through there was no visible rash.) We bought "Go! Dry Dog Food, Natural Grain Free Endurance Formula" and I immediately liked it better than the previous stuff. It's darker, softer and my dogs took to it immediately without any discomfort (bloat, gas, loose stools). The good news is that my large dog immediately lost the weird skin discomfort. She's totally back to normal. My wife had been worried that it was some allergic reaction to some grain in the previous food. She must've been right. My guess is that dogs will prove more vulnerable to GMO grain. Grain free may be the only way to go from here on out, at least in America where GMO now shows up in everything.

review/text: My 40# mixed breed pup thinks that this is a treat ... little does she know it is good for her.  She has a sensitivity to chicken, and this food does give her the itchies, but not nearly as bad as many foods.  If it weren't for the chicken, this might be our go-to food.  As it is, I only get this if I can't get hold of something as high quality without chicken.  I have recommended it to several of my friends for their dogs, as well.

My dog loves the food after I switched him from a pretty decent dog food (kirkland super premium adult chicken formula), but I noticed my dog was licking his paws and was scratching every once in a while on that food. I switched to this food and no more licking his paws, he scratches less, and has a beautiful coat.<br /><br />dogfoodanalysis.com has this as a 6 out of 6 star dog food and it truly is a top end choice. It is a bit pricy at $50 for 25lbs, but much cheaper than Orijen it appears. Too bad they don't make a 40lb bag!

review/text: I bought this food after looking at various reviews of dog foods on many different sites. My dog a American Staffordshire terrier has a grain allergy and is very picky when it comes to which food she eats. I bought this because it was a reasonable price and wasn't to high in protein content, and had no grains. She instantly took to it, finished the bowl and still wanted more. She loves it and having her on it for months her allergies cleared right up and her coat is really nice.<br /><br />I tried Nature's Variety Instinct, and Wellness Core Ocean, she wasn't a huge fan of either shes wouldn't really eat the Instinct and the wellness core took a while and a lot of coercion for her to eat and it gave her more gas.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this food to anyone looking for a Great dog food for a reasonable price.

In the past, my Shih Tzu was either allergic to most foods that I served her, or the particular flavor of a food did not please her exquisite and royal taste. My Shiba Inu had runny poo with other foods. I tried this one, and they love it. When I open the bedroom door to feed them in the morning, they both bolt to their food bowls. My Shih Tzu is no longer constantly rubbing her face, chewing on her paws, or rolling around on the floor to scratch herself; my Shiba Inu's poo can easily be picked up, and he is no longer embarrassed to do #2 in the park when others are watching. Win win win.
