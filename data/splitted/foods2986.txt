review/summary: Sophie Loves This Food!
review/text: Purina Healthful Life Cat Chow is the only food that my cat, Sophie, will eat. I tried buying a few others when they went on sale and she just hated anything else. Sophie is a very picky eater; she'll refuse to eat cat food that she doesn't like. I'm not sure what makes this cat food taste so much better than the others, but Sophie loves it.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that they found insects in their cat food. This is a common problem with cat food. I haven't found any infestations in Healthful Life food yet, but I always toss a new bag in the freezer for four or five days before I feed it to Sophie. I read that this kills any insect eggs that may be in the cat food. It doesn't hurt the cat food to freeze it. If I stock up on more than one bag at a time, I keep the extras in the freezer until they are ready to be used.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price on this cat food; I've bought my last 4 bags online from Amazon and I'm thrilled not to have to go to several stores to find it. Many of the stores in my area don't carry this brand anymore.

review/summary: My cat loves it.... I hate it
review/text: My 9 year old Tortie LOVES this food and ate it for almost three years.  When I tried to give her other food she would eat just enough to not starve and cry for other food.  However, a month ago she started throwing up once or twice every single day.  The throw-up was almost half-undigested food.  Then I noticed she was having diarrhea as well.  Additionally, during this same time period I opened up one of the bags of this food and saw cobwebs and insects inside the bag.  I returned the bag to my local food retailer and was told it was not uncommon and that they were "onion moths" and that the manufacturer has been having problems with them.  Add all of this together, and I had had it with this food.  I switched to Eukanuba and IMMEDIATELY the vomiting ceased and the diarrhea ceased.  I also noticed that her coat improved as well.  I don't know if there are quality control issues or what, but I would stay away from this food.

review/summary: Cat says "Mmmm good"!
review/text: I have a 5 year old, indoor tabby and she absolutely loves her new food! I bought it since she was showing signs that she no longer cared for her Goodlife Recipe anymore. I read the ingredients and they looked very well-balanced. After opening, the food both smells and looks fresh and flavorful. I was nervous switching her food, but SO glad I did! She even seems to be a bit more playful now, too!

review/summary: Not as healthy as I thought
review/text: 9 year old, domestic shorthaired:<br />I made the mistake of purchasing a large 14lb bag. I read the ingredients and they seemed pretty decent vs IAMS. The percentages were fairly comparable with each other. I figured let's give it a try. After a month, my cat has thrown up food+hairballs at least 3 times already (but at least no diarrhea). It seemed like it would've been a good change and my cat certainly didn't object to it.....but he's never thrown up so many times and consistently too. I emailed Purina to see what they say but I'm sticking with IAMS. There's no substitute for quality.

review/summary: A Super Cuppa Joe
review/text: On vacation, I had breakfast at "Two Cats" Restaurant in Bar Harbor, ME. The breakfast was excellent, the ambience was colorful & intriguing, but it was the coffee that is my lasting memory. What a unique, delicious way to start that day. The following day I drove a considerable distance to that restaurant again just for another cup (I'd already had breakfast) AND to find out what kind of coffee they served. This product is their source. I often order coffee from Hawaii or Costa Rica and tend to buy the best brands locally, because I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. This particular coffee has a flavor that reminds of a french or dark roast, but it lies a bit more softly and pleasingly on the palate. Like a fine wine or light dessert. There is a mellow boldness about it that satisfies with a smile and invites another sip, another savoring moment, another cup. It is one of the few super cuppa Joe's I have found that are affordable enough to be enjoyed often. The flavor/price ratio is as high as I've found.

review/summary: Very nice cup
review/text: I am very fussy about coffee.  This trait had relegated me to all coffee buying responsibilities for our small office.  These beans are mellow but full bodied (crowd pleaser and snob pleaser, all in one bag).  We haven't poured a bad cup and have been using these beens for months.  Stocking my office with acceptable beans is no longer a chore.  This is a simple one-click, 2 days later (prime)we get our fresh beans.  Saves a lot of hassle and I really enjoy the coffee.  You can get a 5 star bag by searching and scouring local roasters, but I'm very happy with these beans for their price and convenience.

review/summary: Best coffee I have ever tasted
review/text: I hesitate to write a review to add attention to this coffee.  I want to keep it a secret!<br /><br />My husband and I decided that if we are going to be drinking something everything morning for the next 50 years of our life, we want it to be organic.  Fair trade just happens to be another bonus.  Both coffee and sugar are the highest sprayed crops in the world.  Coffee especially so we first made the switch over this brand and tried this flavor first.  We grind it at home and brew it with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBCVX0">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker with Bonus 350 Micro Filters</a>.  The combination of grinding it fresh every morning and brewing it with the aeropress makes for the best cup of morning coffee EVER.  We use a simple <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU">Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black</a> and simply grind it for 15-18 seconds.  We also switched sugars and now use organic and fair trade sugar as well along with locally bought raw milk.  The best sugar for this is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIO">Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />YOU CANNOT GET THIS TREATMENT AT STARBUCK!<br /><br />It really does make for the best coffee in the world if you grind it right, brew it right and use wholesome ingredients.  My husband threw out his old coffee pot and went from being a die hard pot of Folgers a day to simply drinking four shots of this in the morning.  We both feel like we are drinking delicious coffee from Vienna every morning.  We tried this flavor first, but we are going to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L6OZRO">Equal Exchange Coffee, Organic Colombian, Whole Bean,12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> next by the same brand.  We prefer light roasts instead of darker roasts like French.  Incidently, most people don't know this, but the lighter the roast - the more caffeine in it and in our opinion, the better the flavor.  Darker roasts seem to really kill the flavor of coffee and you run the risk of more oils and higher acid and bitter flavor.  I don't really know why people like dark roasts and I think it is more the sound of it than the actual flavor that they fall for.  We both discovered at one point that lighter roasts such as breakfast blends and Columbian has better flavor, more caffeine, less acid, etc and ever since stay away from darker roasts.  We might also try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WQI">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Breakfast Blend, Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 3)</a> at some point as well along with the decaf so we can enjoy an afternoon drink.  I notice this particular blend seems to have two colors of coffee beans in it, one is light and one is medium.  No darks which we love!<br /><br />This might seem like an elaborate set-up, but we actually came about all this after struggling for a couple of years drinking coffee and getting sick from it.  I finally discovered that I am sensitive to the acids in coffee.  This put me on a lot of research on coffee, the acids in it, how it is made and the best ways to grind and brew it.  Both my husband and I are fairly frugal but after reading that coffee is the worst sprayed crop in the world except for Christmas trees (ever notice how Christmas tree farms have nothing but dead ground around the trees.... yeah, exactly like that!), we made the decision to do this.  Also, I now can enjoy and drink coffee every morning without any abdominal pain.<br /><br />So remember, this coffee + good filtered water + fresh grind + aeropress + rapunzel sugar + raw milk = best coffee in world!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I selected this coffee after reading all the glowing reviews. I must be the odd man out because I was a bit disappointed with the flavor. For my taste it was too earthy and just didn't stand out compared to some other coffees. Perhaps it is because I'm from Louisiana but I prefer Community Coffee Breakfast Blend beans for a medium coffee. I order it from their website to insure freshness.

review/text: I would have given this coffee 5 stars if it had been a little darker roast which I prefer.  It seems to be a medium bodied coffee with a lovely  flavor profile.  Very smooth & delicious even when brewing it stronger than suggested.  I use a French press and wound up using about a tablespoon more grounds than I would normally use with a French roast coffee. Highly recommend it!  Very important to buy only Equal Exchange Coffee.  Look it up.

I didn't know if I would like the chocolate, but that flavor is very mild and actually a nice touch. Well, long story short, I am now "subscribed" to this coffee for regular monthly orders.

review/summary: Very picky coffee drinker; very pleased.
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I'm an extremely picky coffee drinker. I do not like pre-ground coffee of any kind, I typically prefer a single-source coffee, but honestly those are hard to come by these days and I can't always afford the coffee I would love to drink. I grind the beans, and make single cup pour-overs using a single filter & a drip cone. I love the flavor of these beans. They definitely have a nutty tone to them, but are pretty full-flavored. Not over-roasted, either (my complaint about Starbucks' beans). A satisfying, well-priced, delicious cup of coffee. Also makes excellent cold press - grind for french press (coarse), pour grounds in large pitcher, and pour about 4:1 ratio of cold, filtered water over beans. Let soak for 12-15 hours and strain in mesh filter. Mmmm!

The aroma of the freshly ground beans is robust, the scent as it is brewing is mouthwatering, and the first sip, God, the first sip is absolutely heavenly, as is every sip thereafter.  For two years I lived just down the street from a coffee bean seller in Mexico City (the family that owned the store also owned the farm where the beans were grown).  Their coffee was the finest coffee I have ever tasted in my life, nothing I have tried in the nearly five years since my stint in Mexico City has even come close to that.  Until now.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this coffee in the near future for myself -- and for gifts for friends and family who are coffee lovers.

I want to buy fair trade and organic to support those in other countries with low wages and poor living conditions with our coffee habit, and I want to be sure I'm getting what I'm paying for.  So I started looking around for one to order via the internet since I didn't trust our store.  So far, so very good.

It is a bonus that this is equal exchange and organic too.<br /><br />Price is slightly higher than other premium coffee but you get what you pay for.  The few bucks extra is worth it in my book.

Well worth the money spent.

review/summary: Delicious as a Regular Coffee or an Espresso
review/text: We have a Saeco machine, my husband drinks espresso and I like regular coffee. We're used to darker roasts but this one was nice, smooth, flavorful. I thought a medium roast would be too light for an espresso, but my husband said, "this is a tasty coffee." If you eat it with fresh homemade cream scones, it'll tastes even more delicious! Someone said the oiliness of the beans interfered with the burr grinder in their machine, but my husband does regular maintenance on our Saeco and it's been functioning great for over 5 years now (previously he used Lavzza for 2-3 years, then we switched to Costco Sumatra roast coffee, which was awesome, and a few other trial brands here and there.)<br /><br />Oh, I also love that it comes in three 12-oz packages. Easier to keep fresh!

review/summary: You can't go wrong with any Peet's teas
review/text: This is not my favorite tea from Peet's.  But as a breakfast tea, which in my mind is always a stronger-flavored black tea, it is good.  I don't usually use the word "good" in a review--I know it sounds kind of ambiguous. But I did this time, as I think that the breakfast teas are all a bit ambiguous.  I prefer a tea where I can pinpoint a unique, or different, flavor--a flavor that I can distinguish from other teas.  I also have a few other Peet's breakfast blends and I can't really distinguish a unique flavor in this one.  My experience level?  I don't claim to be an experienced tea drinker.  I have purchased at least 12 different teas from Peet's.  Of the teas offered here at Amazon, I rate the Pride of Port tea at five stars.

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/text: Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!

review/summary: Suggested by Dr. Oz
review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal.

review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.
