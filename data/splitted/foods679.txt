review/summary: Pucca fan
review/text: I developed a Pucca addiction during my year in Japan.  They became quite a comfort food to help with the homesickness.  Though I have been able to find other Meiji treats here in the States, all have been quite inferior to the one and only Pucca. Puccas have proved to be quite elusive here.  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Jell-o Vanilla Cook & Serve, Sugar-free, Fat-free Pudding
review/text: It had become a quest for me to find Jell-o VANILLA Cook & Serve Pudding in the sugar-free, fat-free recipe, and NOT the Instant type.  I could find chocolate occasionally, but NEVER vanilla.  I like to use it not only for a lower calorie pudding dessert, but it makes delicious pies.  Use a little less fat-free milk, add a little cocoa powder, and it makes a yummy chocolate pie; or add some sliced bananas and a graham cracker crust, and you have a dessert you can serve to guests.  Or, what is really delicious is to add the cocoa powder AND the sliced bananas for a chocolate/banana cream pie.  Top it with some low calorie whipped topping and some chocolate shavings, and it looks like it came from your favorite bakery.  It's wonderful, quick and easy to prepare, and tastes great.  I had literally looked in every grocery store where I live and could NEVER find it, so I did an on-line search and there it was at Amazon!  And the price is very reasonable.  Thank you again, Amazon!!  In fact, the guests we had at dinner last night also thank you!

Then they started to get scarce - everyone was discontinuing them, or charging exorbitant prices.  I bought them at WalMart until they discontinued them, and then special ordered from my local market until they couldn't get them for me.  Then I discovered them at Amazon -- and at a good price, delivered.  I am a happy customer!!

As I wrapped my dad's present, I smiled, thinking he's just going to love this, and this will make him really happy. Planters Redskin Spanish peanuts are his favorite type of peanuts, but they are really hard to find. It's been many long years since I could find them in the grocery stores. So just like I found my favorite candy on amazon, I found my dad's favorite peanuts. When it came time to opening his present, he just couldn't believe what I had gotten for him! His whole face lit up, and he immediately opened one and started snacking. While continuously waiting for his approval, he said he's finally gotten that good old taste back into his mouth again!

review/text: Nope, let's not talk about honey roasted peanuts.  Or cocktail peanuts.  Or cashews. . .pistachios. . .or even mixed nuts (unless we're talking about my family reunion).  When I crave a high protein snack, I reach for the Redskins--PLANTERS SPANISH PEANUTS (REDSKIN).<br /><br />These little red goobers are delicious; and even better, I can scarf down a few handfuls of them and not have my waistline explode.  The Redskins are a perfect addition to parties and get-togethers, and what better way to watch a sporting event than to munch on the Spanish.  And with the name Planters, you know you're going to be getting quality and freshness.  So if you're hunkering for a wholesome, salty snack, look for the peanut sporting a tophat, monocle, and cane--PLANTERS SPANISH PEANUTS (REDSKIN).  You'll go nutty.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Five Star dropping to One Star
review/text: My wife and I discovered Planters Spanish Redskin Peanuts a number of years ago and since that time there was always a place on our kitchen counter where everyone could share this wonderful treat.<br /><br />Recently the 56-Oz can we purchased contained only very light colored peanuts. These were not as well cooked,  appeared to have less oil used in the roasting process and therefore the salt normally found evenly distributed mostly migrated to the bottom of the can.  Worse, a few peanuts were so brittle I first thought they were foreign objects.<br /><br />In an effort to find the good formula we purchased three of the 12.5-Ounce size and two of the 56-Ounce size.  Unfortunately all were the disappointing new version that we dislike.<br /><br />I just concluded a phone call with Kraft foods (10-8-12), the parent company of Planters.  While they did not admit to the product being changed I was told Spanish Redskin Peanuts were discontinued and would soon be out of stock everywhere.<br /><br />Kraft offered coupons as a good will gesture for all the Planters Spanish Peanuts we're throwing away, but since the old perfect treat is no more, it's a disappointing resolution.<br /><br />Seldom does a commercially manufactured product like this win over both my wife and I.  I must say I'm really sad to see it go, especially since the newest, poorly roasted version is not worth stocking up on.

review/summary: Nothing Like Spanish Peanuts
review/text: Saw a bad review on these; can't imagine why someone would rate these things bad? Hey there ain't nothing like Spanish peanuts, they're much better than Virginia peanuts (sorry Virginia that's the way I feel)and from what I have tried, these Planters are the best especially for the price. They're fresh and good flavored. Peanuts are good food as are most other natural foods like eggs beef vegetables etc. Unlike what the food freaks we have today want you to believe. I know they will say peanuts are bad full of fat salt etc but it's not true! That kind of thing does not hurt you if you don't sit and eat two cans or something! Eat good food take supplements and stay away from fast food and prepared junk you may live! Drink whole milk (fresh raw milk may be even better but they will surely deny that)plenty of clean NON Fluoride water and make your own drinks like tea. Fix your own food so you know what's in it! Stay off of the soft drinks fluoride water and prepared food to keep your health. DO NOT listen to what big brother says is good for you, they want you in the hospital!! Vote Them Out!! Though many now disagree it's not a crime to want to control your own diet and health.

review/summary: I am my father's hero!
review/text: I rarely review products after purchasing things online - I guess I'm not a great contributor to the online community except in the case of being extremely impressed or extremely upset.  I was having dinner with my folks recently, and my dad was complaining that he could never find Spanish Peanuts at the local grocery store anymore.  He said he would find them at Wal-Mart on occasion (about one out of three times he went) - he also tried out a local supplier but was unhappy with the inconsistency of the quality of the nuts.  While he was explaining all this to me, I jumped on Amazon on my iPhone and searched for Spanish Peanuts, found a pack of 12 cans and bought them.  A few days later they showed up at our office and he was blown away!  He couldn't believe something that had been frustrating him for so long could be made so easy by the power of the internet (since then, I've got him connected on an iPad and am hoping I can get him to start surfing Amazon and other online retailers on his own!).  He was so grateful that he gave me two of the cans and I promptly went home and opened one up, made a bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge and spanish peanuts on top - talk about a trip down memory lane!  Reminded me of having dinner over at my grandmother's house when I was a kid and both my father and I have been smiling about this purchase ever since it was made.  Thanks Amazon!!

review/text: Spanish peanuts were my Father's favorite; therefore they became mine. I was able to get them in my old age for awhile, but they disappeared from the shelves of Northern Virginia groceries. I went with the flow for awhile, but eventually got smart and looked to Amazon.com. I was rewarded for my intelligence for I now have my Spanish Peanuts whenever I desire. I am also super happy that Planters uses Sea Salt. Thank you, Suzi

review/summary: For the true peanut connoisseur
review/text: Spanish peanuts are caviar to peanut lovers. They are a little smaller than other peanut types and have a richer flavor due to a higher oil content. That adds a few calories, but to the peanut connoisseur, it's worth it.<br /><br />The red husk or "skin" adds additional flavor. If you've ever tried cooking your own, you know how easy it is to burn the skin. Getting them to come out "just right" is a real art.<br /><br />Planters has mastered that art. Their Redskin Spanish peanuts are consistently plump, fresh tasting, and perfectly roasted. The sea salt variety is terrific too.<br /><br />Buying in bulk like this seems like overdoing it, but if you have a peanut lover in your family, you may be surprised how quickly they'll disappear.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have pointed out, Spanish peanuts seem to be getting harder to find these days, so grab 'em while you can.

review/summary: My husband loves spanish peanuts
review/text: My husband loves Spanish Peanuts more than any other kind, and especially Planters. We always had several cans of Planters on hand but over the past few years all of our local stores stopped carrying them.  I had family and friends on alert to let me know if they found them somewhere.  We had just about given up when I decided to check Planters themselves and sure enough, they were available thru Amazon. I bought a case and we're almost thru the 10th can, must order more after I finish the review. The peanuts were very fresh and just as good as we remembered.

review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/summary: Doesn't taste bad... but does not impress
review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

review/text: I can just look at a carb and I gain weight.  This product allows me to eat pasta and not get all the high impact carbs on my blood sugar.  18 grams of fiber is outstanding! Unlike the other reviewer I think it tastes really good.  The texture is a little more chewy and thick but again this is something I like.  I dont miss white pasta at all when I eat this.

These also are low in sugar and I like that it is a vegetable flavoring. My 5 year old likes this flavor just as much as the other Puffs flavors.

review/summary: Excellent  English Orange Marmalade
review/text: I was recently shopping for my favorite orange marmalade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061KXV4">Dundee Orange Marmalade 16 oz - 2 Jars</a> and my local supermarket was out of it. I noticed this Robertsons brand on the shelf and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The Robertsons was a couple of dollars less than the Dundee brand, but it was only 12 oz as opposed to 16 oz for Dundee.<br /><br /> I found it to be an excellent bitter sweet marmalade, although slightly sweeter than I prefer. A more bitter than sweet flavor would be more to my liking, but that's a matter of personal preference. I like rind in my marmalade and it had a decent amount of rind in it but it seemed less than the Dundee brand.<br /><br />Scotland is the home of bitter sweet marmalade, this is where Dundee was made for many years until they shifted there plant to England recently. All of the rest of Europe and the U.S. produce a sweeter version of orange marmalade.<br /><br />I would defiantly buy this brand again, that is of course if I could not find the Dundee brand.<br /><br />NOTE;; I am assuming the SCOTCH on the label refers to Scotland, there is unfortunately no Scotch whisky in this marmalade.

review/summary: Totonac Sugar Free Syrups
review/text: I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.

review/summary: Not great if you are a supertaster, but has potential
review/text: I really wanted to like this syrup, first because I can't eat much sugar and second because it's made in my home state and I like to support local businesses. Also the ingredients are high quality and all natural.  I picked 4 different flavored bottles up at a Home Goods store and was anxious to try it. Unfortunately this was really bitter for me, as almost all products with stevia are. (Truvia in iced tea seems to be an exception, perhaps because the bitterness enhances the tea flavor.)I'm a supertaster, which means I have more tastebuds than most. It also means that anything with stevia will always have a funky bitter taste to me, no matter how hard it is masked. I was hoping the Lo Han Guo would help ease the bitterness but it didn't. I tried it in milk and the only way to get rid of the bitterness was to pour a lot more milk in the cup, but then the almond flavor washed out too. In short I'm giving this a three, because even though I didn't like it, the quality of the ingredients will ensure that it will probably be very tasty for others who are not supertasters.

It's much quicker to make than hamburger, lower fat, and obviously stores for much longer.  We aren't vegetarian but I try to limit our meat intake so I always use this in our tacos.  I'm glad Amazon carries this because it's not available at our local grocery stores.  Yummy!

review/summary: FANTASTICALLY GOOD!
review/text: I am always willing to try New Products; however, I didn't want to buy Twelve Boxes from Amazon, What if we didn't like it? So I got one Box of FANTASTIC Taco Filling from somewhere else, and decided to give it a try, Followed the Cooking Directions and made the Entire Package in a Sauce Pan with 1 3/4 cup of boiling water and two teaspoons of oil<br /><br />Since I found the Sodium a little high for our taste 520 MG, 22% (we don't use a lot of salt) I decided to compensate all that salt by adding about one Tablespoon of Onions and another of Green Bell Peppers to the mix, very finely chopped that I had sauteed in a non-stick skillet with two drops of oil (no salt) even though in the List of Ingredients there is Dehydrated Onions and Onion Powder but I also wanted something fresh, so I mix it all up reduce heat and simmer 5-6 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirred every now and then...and like Magic it turned into what it looked like Ground Beef,...Wow, Wee! It was Good, we were very Surprised<br /><br />I make my own Taco Shells, I like the White Corn Tortillas, Crispier, fry them in vegetable oil folded into a taco shape, I use tongs and a spoon for help, drained on paper towels, filled them with about two or three Tablespoons of the Fantastic Taco Filling, add Salsa, Chopped Romaine Lettuce and top them with Shredded Cheddar Cheese,...So Good, The Best Tacos We Had in a Long Time<br /><br />You can get about 10 Tacos out of one Box and Yes, we liked it Better than Meat, and we felt good knowing we were NOT Eating a Cow-Steer, Now we are ready to order the Twelve Boxes from Amazon.com,... in fact we just Did! ...

review/summary: Good product, but......
review/text: I've been a fan of this product for about 12 years now.....it is easy, fast, healthy and delicious....but I have to gripe about the price.....less than ten years ago it was about $23 a case (shipped) now it's over $33<br /><br />Soon I'm going to stop buying it (like I have with so many other products) because they are (unjustifiably) raising the prices exponentially on a simple dried soy protein product. Realistically, it should be about $1 per box.<br /><br />America will pull out of this recession when we finally figure out that sticking it to ANOTHER American is not going to help pull us out of your financial problems, and when we decide NOT to stick it to the next guy to recover our losses<br /><br />Having said that, I still eat this product, but the price hike turned me off bigtime<br />If I see it go up one more time, I will add it to my list of gouger companies, and never buy it again.<br />At that point it will be cheaper to make my own.

review/text: My wife and I recently became vegetarians, some days its a little harried to get home, kick off your shoes relax a minute before you start dinner..FANTASTIC FOODS to the rescue...some days when you need help to get a meal out in a few minutes..FF does the job well..we have tried several different flavors like the Taco filling, Tofu Scramble, Hummus, Sloopy Joe's, Vegetarian Chili, Falafel...none of which have dissapointed us and as you can see I am semi-retired chef. The best part is the  ease of preparation...amazing flavors with no meat!! and nothing really strange in the ingredients label. We have learned to buy it by the case as it can be somewhat expensive at most grocery stores as they price it like a specialty product...I'll put it to you this way..it taste go enough to fool most meat eating palates and if you want to turn the kids over quick..use the Sloppy Joe's as much as the Taco Filling.  The taste is a winner!! Bon Apettit!

review/text: Fantastic World Foods mixes are terrific! We're new to vegetarian eating and experimenting with the many products available now.  We've tried the falafel, chicken patty, hamburger, hummus, sloppy joe, and taco filling mixes.  Every one of them is delicious.  For me, it's about the texture and flavor.  This taco filling nails it - you will not be able to tell the difference between this vegetarian mix and hamburger.  As a matter of fact, I like the taste better than ground beef. Amazon makes it easy and inexpensive to stock up with the 12-box packs. You can also find Fantastic Foods brands at most whole/health food stores. I like to add diced onions to the mix. Toss in some jalapenos for a little kick. Yummy!
