review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is my favorite sugar for my morning cup of coffee. It's sweet and has a nice bit of molasses flavor without being too dark or too flavored. It doesn't overwhelm the flavor of my coffee, just adds to it.<br />It's also wonderful on top of sugar cookies hot out of the oven, sprinkled over farina, or just a few crystals sprinkled on homemade chocolate candies. It adds something special. One of my daughter's favorite treats is simply frozen phyllo dough thawed, brushed with a bit of butter and sprinkled with this and baked until golden. It looks very special, and if you fill pockets with Nutella and  a good jam and bake them with a bit of this sprinkled on top you have a very easy dessert that looks and tastes very special.

review/summary: Wonderful natural cane sugar flavor
review/text: When I was a child an annual tradition in the Fall was to buy stalks of sugar cane at the local farmers' market. Our parents would strip the husk and slice the middle into bite-sized pieces for chewing. What a treat!<br /><br />This sugar tastes like that fresh sugar cane juice. It's wonderful.<br /><br />Yes, the crystals are large and don't dissolve as easily as refined white sugar. But hey, you are burning calories for the few extra stirs it takes, and the flavor is worth it!<br /><br />And it's just nice to know that the nutrients are still in there and haven't been processed out.

review/summary: LOVE this product!
review/text: I have purchased this item and brand several times now, usually in bulk. It is a much healthier alternative to white sugar. We love this in baking, recipes, over oatmeal, really with anything. We use it cup for cup compared to standard sugar and the best deal on it in bulk I have found in our area is through Amazon. I do a lot of baking and making most things from scratch at home to save our family money and eat healthier. This product is a big part of me being able to achieve this. I did have trouble with one order where 1 of the 12 bags had an issue. I contacted Amazon and they replaced the whole order for me. Very very nice and generous. I can not recommend this product enough, very happy with it each and every time I have purchased it!!

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Looking at the picture on this website, I envisioned a thick curry dish with large slices of bamboo shoots and whole baby corns, but it pours out of the can with the consistency of a thin soup with stringy bamboo shoots no more 5 inches long and 1/8 inch thick. The bamboo shoots have an interesting texture but they are tasteless.  They derive taste from the curry.  For baby corns, you have to fish for them.  I counted five to six pieces of fragments, each for � inch to 3/8 inch long.  They have the texture of dried wood.  The can was labeled 15.4-oz net weight; I estimate that more than 2/3 of it is the watery curry.  It is mildly sweet from the coconut milk and has a pleasant curry favor.  I poured the curry over macaroni and it made a good eat.  Overall, this green curry is okay but not what I expected.

review/summary: Where are the hazel nuts (filberts)?
review/text: My company had a celebration where this was one of the snacks served. I had one of them and was excited because these are a lot of my favorite nuts in one pouch, which is hard to find. The first thing I did after the celebration was go on Amazon to subscribe to get these regularly. However, I should have looked at the picture more closely before I ordered because when they arrived I was disappointed to find out that the hazel nuts had been "replaced" by walnuts. Everything is exactly the same as the ones I had at work. The package looks the same, they both say "Heart Healthy Mix" on them, except walnuts have been substituted instead of hazel nuts. Unfortunately, hazel nuts are my favorite.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are very good, just not as good (in my opinion) as if they had hazel nuts in them. So minus 1-star for Planters having two versions of the same thing without changing the name.<br /><br />What Amazon is selling (look at the picture of the box closely): Peanuts, Almonds, Pistachios, Pecans, & WALNUTS<br /><br />Also available, just not on Amazon: Peanuts, Almonds, Pistachios, Pecans, & HAZEL NUTS<br /><br />One other thing, the "per ounce" price that Amazon is showing is incorrect. This is a "3-pack" (3 separate boxes) of six 1.5 ounce pouches, so there are 18 X 1.5 ounce pouches total. This is a total of 27 ounces. Amazon is doing the calculation as if it is only 4 total ounces, so disregard Amazon's "per ounce" price.

review/summary: Best dark chocolate anywhere.
review/text: We had been buying this same dark chocolate under the label "H&auml;geland" for a few years now.  Under that name, it was limited to a well-known big box store.  They stopped carrying the product recently, which I don't understand because this chocolate is sooo good.  When my mother-in-law called the number on the H&auml;geland label to ask where we might buy it, she was told to check Amazon under this name.<br /><br />I am far from a chocolate connoisseur, so I can't use fancy words to describe color, aroma, texture, or flavor.  I just know tasty and not tasty.  This one is quite tasty.  The thing that set this chocolate apart for us was the lack of soy lecithin which is used as an emulsifier in most other chocolate bars.  To me, the soy lecithin gives other chocolates a bit of a waxy consistency.  (Don't get me wrong, if it's chocolate, I'll eat it happily. However, this one is our favorite.)  If you're looking for simple, reliably delicious, dark-but-not-too-bitter chocolate bar, please give this one a try.  I'd love to see them do well on Amazon.

review/text: I don't think I'd be a girl if I didn't love chocolate.  I don't think anything could be better than matching raspberry with chocolate.  My sister-in-law buys these chocolate covered raspberries (in bulk!!!) and so I ordered this matcha hoping that it would satisfy me enough so I wouldn't steal her stash and become 400 pounds!  I opened this matcha and was pleasantly surprised to smell chocolate!  I couldn't seem to smell the raspberry in it.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh, if it'll make it very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I really wasn't sure how I wanted to prepare this matcha.  First I prepared it with just 1 tsp matcha and 16.9oz of water.  It was ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I seemed to get more chocolate from it this way and not enough raspberry flavor.  SO, next I heated up some milk, added a bit of sugar and frothed it up into a latte.  Now here is where I get more of the raspberry.  It's a nice creamy truffle.<br />On a side note, I'll be learning to make truffles from tea as a local tea shop this week so maybe I'll be able to use what I have left in making a tea truffle!  You can never go wrong with chocolate and raspberries that don't make you gain weight.<br />THANKS again Red Leaf for another wonderful matcha creation....keep'em comin'!<br />To get your own tasty Raspberry Truffle Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]

review/summary: Wow how do they do this?
review/text: My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!

review/summary: Great, intense flavor!
review/text: As I was considering which flavored matcha I would try next from Red Leaf Tea, I was stumped. There are so many amazing flavors! However, this Raspberry Truffle matcha caught my eye fairly quickly and I knew that I had to give it a try. I am a sucker for all things chocolate, particularly super rich truffles of all flavors. I had very high expectations for this matcha and I have to say that it more than exceeded my expectations! You can find out more about this matcha here: [...]<br /><br />Once again, I was very pleased by the intense aroma as I opened the package. I could have sworn that somebody just opened a very expensive box of raspberry truffles somewhere in my kitchen. The matcha was a very bright green color despite being flavored. I first tried this traditionally as a hot bowl of matcha in my chawan. Initially, the slight bitterness of the matcha hits your palate, but it is followed by an intense and slightly sweet raspberry flavor with the chocolate aspect occurring more in the aftertaste. I love how the aftertaste lingers several minutes after your last sip and I also appreciate that the matcha was very easy to whisk with no noticeable clumps. While this is a super awesome way to drink this matcha, I just had to try it as a cold latte since it is so unbelievably hot here in Texas.<br /><br />For the cold latte I added a healthy scoop of this Raspberry Truffle matcha and milk into a blender bottle and shook it all up. Once again the matcha blended beautifully without any clump which is something I've noticed in other matchas when preparing them with a cold liquid. Although I didn't add any sweetener, the matcha seems a little sweeter now, but not by any means overly so. I also think that the flavor profile is a bit more balanced at this temperature. The bitter edge of the matcha is almost non-existent and the raspberry and chocolate flavors are more unified as a raspberry truffle would be. It is quite refreshing on this hot day and I was impressed that it didn't settle out even after being left on the counter for 10+ minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this is another big success from Red Leaf Tea! Not only is the tea quite tasty, their customer service is amazing. My order arrived within 2 business days! If you haven't tried anything from this company, you are missing out!

review/summary: VERY tasty, but BEWARE THE AFTERMATH!
review/text: These fiber bars are so tasty. My favourites are the peanut butter and the coconut chocolate ones. The coconut ones taste like Samoa Girlscout cookies. So because my husband loves them too, we were buying them in bulk and eating them every morning for breakfast. However, several weeks into this routine I noticed I was experiencing higher than normal gas activity...and REALLY stinky gas too. I couldn't understand what was wrong and was actually considering seeing a doctor because it was really getting out of hand and embarassing. However, due to a lack of sale prices on the fiber bars, they were unavailable to me for breakfast for about a week. After 3 days of not eating them anymore, I noticed my gas problem COMPLETELY disappeared. So, as with most things, enjoy these delicious treats...only in moderation! If anyone else if having the gas issues and can't figure out why - try cutting these out for a while!<br /><br />Eek!

review/summary: A reasonably healthy candy bar
review/text: With subscription it comes to 2.50 per box or 50 cents per 1.2 oz bar.  A reasonable price and I do not have to remind my wife to get them for me at the store.<br /><br />I keep these handy at work.  If I get hungry and do not have time to eat, these tide me over quite nicely and are very tasty and handily satisfy my chocolate cravings if I am under a lot of stress (which I used to fulfill with Fastbreaks which, per oz, have 40% more total calories, 60% more fat calories and 1/7th the fiber).<br /><br />I actually prefer the chocolatey peanut butter, however it seems to come and go from Amazon's offerings: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317ES2A">FiberPlus Antioxidant Bars, Chocolatey Peanut Butter, 5-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />There are many alternatives out there, but I find that these have the best ratio of taste, cost and nutrition out there right now.<br /><br />Warning 1: Some people have trouble breaking down chicory root fiber and may wind up with more gas than they'd like, but like beans, there is a good chance it will go away with repeat consumption.<br /><br />Warning 2: There are a lot of man-made ingredients and many would not consider that to be "healthy".<br /><br />Another big bonus with Amazon subscription is that they are probably a LOT fresher than the stuff you buy in the grocery stores.  It may be coming directly from the factory as it arrives in a Kellogg box, not an Amazon box (tho it does have an Amazon return address).

Then my grandma would comment on how they made her gassy all day & I thought maybe these were to blame but wasn't too sure. I just had one again for the first time in a while & was passing gas all day :/... Now I'm sure these things are the cause. I'm sure it affects everyone differently though. But for taste, these are delicious especially if you're looking for a little extra fiber in your diet. Next time I eat one of these bars I'll be sure that I'm staying home all day.

review/summary: Have it on auto-ship!!!
review/text: This is a great way to get your daily fiber intake, and satisfy your sweet-tooth in a guilt-free way at the same time.  I take two or three of these to work every day, and particularly enjoy them with a hot cup of coffee around lunch time and mid-afternoon.  I am getting my daily fiber intake and enjoying a chocolately cookie/cake/candy bar (and it tastes like it can pass for all three), which doesn't make me feel deprived of my love for chocolate.<br /><br />My husband, who normally turns up his nose at anything that remotely sounds like healthy eating, just loves these bars (we get the chocolate chip, although I like the almond dark chocolate as much, but he doesn't).  In fact, he's the one who insisted we get these on auto-ship, and we look forward to receiving these once a month.<br /><br />We tried the Fiber-One cranberry bars, but they were hard and brittle, and reminded me of something a person could break a tooth on.  I got about a third of the way through one and threw the rest away.<br /><br />It takes a little adjusting to at first, if your system is not used to a steady intake of fiber.  Just increase your daily intake of water to keep things moving as they should.  Eventually, you'll adjust to this change in your diet.<br /><br />Try a box at the supermarket, and if you agree with my review, get them on auto-ship from Amazon.  The price is great and the convenience can't be beat!

review/text: I barely incorporated fiber into my diet (so you can imagine how hard it must have been on me). I started out eating the Fiber One bars. Boy, it was really really harsh on me. They tasted a bit dry and somewhat hard to swallow. Then I saw the Fiber Plus bars. They are so much better! Softer, more chewy, and much easier to eat (even better because of the huge chocolate flavor). And the digestion wasn't as harsh as the Fiber One bars. I highly recommend these to fiber starters. They're easier to eat than other fiber bars (in my opinion).

This bar, plus a bowl of a high fiber cereal I like, helps me to reach my goals.<br /><br />Also if you like peanut butter and aren't counting calories, try slathering some peanut butter on this fiber bar.

review/text: I was looking for a granola bar that I can grab and go in mornings when I don't have time for breakfast. I came across this box and thought I'll give it a try since it's low in calorie, relatively healthy, and the picture looks appealing. When I tried it, I didn't like it at all. It was the chocolate part that made the granola bar taste kinda synthetic. In my opinion, the chocolate doesn't even taste like real chocolate. However, the granola part tasted fine. I'll have to go back and look for another brand of granola bar.

review/summary: Best tasting way to get fiber. Though not health food
review/text: First off I think these taste really good. Much of it has to do with all the chocolate that is in them.  I like them better than Fiber One bars which use Chicory Root extract as the main ingredient vs chocolate.  For me they taste like candy bars but have 35% of the daily allowance of fiber so you do get something from these you don't get from candy bars. They are the best tasting way of increasing fiber in your diet I know of, even if not the most healthy.  Just be aware that they are essentially "candy bars with benefits" with all the chocolate and sugar and limit your intake accordingly. They are most certainly not health food but if you need to increase your fiber intake and are finding it difficult these will do the job.  There are other healthier ways of accomplishing that, I generally eat very healthy food and incorporate cracked flax seed in to my protein shakes for example.  But these are fast easy and taste good and sometimes it is OK to take the easy way out once in a while. Just trying to present the facts as I see them, you make the decision. These are small bars comprising of 120 calories that taste like a candy bar, a pretty easy way to get that fiber.  No real secrets here, they have a lot of chocolate in them and you can see that in the picture and in the description.  And it is true that you do get a lot of fiber in a small package.  It is easy to add vitamins to anything and claim they contain vitamins and minerals or antioxidants.  Even the most sugary cereal made for children will have vitamins and minerals added to help their image.  So these are definitely NOT in the health food section.  So again, bottom line these taste great, have a lot of fiber in them, especially for their size, but otherwise are about as healthy as a candy bar.<br /><br />As for price this has fluctuated on Amazon, historically they have been significantly less expensive here but not always.  Typically buying these on Amazon in a 60 count which is either six 10 packs or twelve 5 packs (check both to find the best price, sometimes they are different) I have purchased these in the past for around $.40/bar.  In the grocery store, when not on sale I find they usually cost $50-$.65/bar.

review/summary: Better than Fiber One bars, better than any high fiber treat out there!
review/text: So if you want a candy bar, but want to eat well, grab one of these and prepare to be impressed!  These really do taste just like a candy bar, such a healthier alternative to a grocery store candy.  I eat one of these after lunch as a treat to provide a fix for my sweet tooth.  I find it is less gas inducing if I treat it like dessert and eat it after a meal.  I do get a bit of bloating if I eat it on an empty tummy.  A friend of mine who turned me onto these says the gassiness goes away once you are used to eating more fiber in your diet.  I have started increasing my fiber with more fresh produce, so I anticipate better digestion of all things in a few weeks.  I highly recommend these!<br /><br />NOTE: I would like to add that if you normally eat candy bars, cookies or pastries and switch to eating one these instead -- that is a great choice.  However, I am not saying to choose one of these over a piece of fruit which is clearly better for you.  These are healthier "junk food" that provide a nice shot of fiber and less sugar than most temptations out there.

The serving size is appropriate (although I usually eat two if I that's all I am eating for breakfast).  In comparison to the similar FiberOne bars, I would pick FiberPlus bars everytime as they have the feel and taste of a traditional chewy granola bar (the supplemental fiber is not pronounced as I found it to be in the FiberOne bars).<br /><br />In terms of portability, FiberPlus bars are excellent for slipping in a bag or a pocket without having to worry about ending up with a pacakge of crumbs.  I recommend FiberPlus bars for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to the traditional granola bar.

On the few occasions when I don't have any left, you'd think I told her the tooth fairy isn't real --- she gets THAT upset.  I like them enough to eat them myself when I've run out on my usual go-to snack and while I like the Chocolate Chip flavor, I prefer the other two flavors (Dark Chocolate Almond and Chocolate Peanut Butter) over this one.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are only 5 bars in a package for the price.  (FYI your local Wally World sells these at the same price, but I can only find these at the same price at the grocery store when they are on sale.)<br /><br />There's no HFCS in these bars so that's another reason why I like them so much.

review/summary: Health Risk
review/text: My beloved golden retriever passed away today unexpectedly.  The subsequent autopsy we requested showed that she had an intestinal blockage due to bone shards.  We had purchased this product for the first time just 2 weeks ago.  She loved it so much we bought a 2nd one a few days ago.  For 5 years we only bought nylon bones with no issue.  Upon closer examination of this knuckle bone, it was evident that it was prone to shredding.  We've already contacted the manufacturer suggesting it be pulled from the market.  I suggest you NOT use this product - or if you do - use it only under very close supervision.  Your pet is too valuable to risk.

review/summary: Disappointed.
review/text: The tree does not look as good as the one in the picture. It was packed in too small of a box, thus, from the base of the plant to the tip it curves to form a 90 degree angle. I'm sure I can train it back to being vertical again though. Not a major problem just annoying. Also the leaves are not as healthy or whole looking as I thought it would be. A lot of them are deformed looking in the sense that the leaves are separated in half or thirds the same way as if you were to cut the leaf with a scissors. Color is a little different too. Not as many leaves as the plant in the pic either. Also it was pretty dry.

review/summary: best soymilk ever!!!
review/text: I love this machine. It is a breeze to use. It is easy to clean. I usually soak my beans over night, and in the morning I have fresh delicious soymilk in fifteen minutes. I've tasted alot of soymilk and this is by far my favorite. The machine comes with a recipe book. The only downside for me was that I thought it would make rice milk. It makes rice "paste", which i guess you could drink. (a little thick though)But overall, well worth it!

review/summary: The "Elegant" Soyabella? Let me save you some pain!
review/text: My family and I have been drinking soy and rice milk for a number of years and this machine seemed to be a good solution as I wanted to cut down on our grocery bill. After learning more about the problems with tetra-pak containers, I was completely turned off.<br /><br />I purchased the "Elegant" Soyabella and wanted to share my own personal experience. I was initially excited to receive my machine and begin making my first batch of milk. Overall, I found the Soyabella to be very problematic.<br /><br />I read the manual and followed the instructions carefully but when I made my first batch of milk it continued to boil over leaving my counter a sticky mess. After 3 unsuccessful attempts, I did finally get it to complete a batch of milk where I encountered even more undesirable results.<br /><br />To begin with, the milk screen was very difficult to remove as the handle on the bottom is so small that you have no hope in ever getting a finger underneath the handle let alone actually grabbing it to take off the cup. The milk turned out quite pulpy as the milk screen holes are quite large and it didn't grind the beans completely.<br /><br />When I cleaned my machine I found that I had to be extra cautious as the blade is very sharp. Although it is an advertised benefit, I found that having the heater in the base of the milk jug was more of a pain as when the jug has milk in it, it is quite heavy. I also found it difficult to clean because the mess from boiling over each time created a hot sticky mess all over the machine. The jug contains a lot of electrical stuff and obviously it is not made to get wet but in order to clean, it is nearly impossible and time consuming.<br /><br />I realized my hour of efforts yielded less than 1 quart of milk. I found the manual very vague and surely not helpful. I tried making "rice paste" expecting to get rice milk and let's just say, I am not even going to go there!!<br /><br />Thinking that my errors where a result of my own mistakes, I did some research online and found that I was not alone. To my relief many others have experience similar problems. I returned my machine and although discouraged about making home made milk, my continued research led me to buy the new SoyQuick Premier. I am completely amazed by the difference between the two machines. I am not going to go into details but I highly recommend the SoyQuick Premier for anyone looking to make trouble free milks. Here is the link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EUA0V4">SoyQuick Premier Milk Maker 930P</a> I have already posted a review as I am really impressed.<br /><br />To summarize; I would not recommend buying the Soyabella at all. I hope that my review and experience will save others a lot of time, effort and the extra money to ship back your Soyabella.

review/summary: Making "Milk"
review/text: I use this product to make Almond Milk and Sunflower Milk.  I am so happy because prior to this, I was peeling each almond individually.  With this product, I don't have to peel them.<br />The reason that I didn't get this product sooner, was because I thought it heated up the milk (which it does for the soy milk and other things)...but for making Almond and Sunflower milk, no heating agent is used!!  I was thrilled to be able to make milk in 1/3 of the usual time.<br />Another task that would delay me when making the milk was the straining process.  But the way the milk is made with the Soyabella, it is already strained!!<br />Overall, I couldn't be happier.

review/summary: great soymilk maker for the price
review/text: I've only tried making soymilk, and think the recipe I use may even come from an Amazon reviewer. Very simple: soak 1/3-1/2 cup of soybeans overnight in the fridge (or longer-- I've done this for up to 3 days, with a lid on), rinse and drain the beans and attach to the blade part, and fill the machine up to the top line with filtered water. It's not very hard to clean, and really the only pain in the butt is to make sure you scald your equipment with hot water (including the container in which you store your soymilk) to help keep it fresh and clean. I bought a used machine and the folks couldn't have been nicer. Recommended, especially since soymilk can be expensive over time.

review/summary: Handy But Noisy
review/text: I've been using my Soyabella for over four months, and, overall, I'm glad to have it.  It's easy and convenient to use, and it takes only about 15 minutes.  However, it's (briefly) very loud, and cleaning it isn't as easy as using it.  Although the recommendation is to clean it promptly after use, it's too hot to handle at first.  All parts must be washed by hand, and it's tricky to keep the plug-in place for the cord dry.  As for the finished product, it has a beanier flavor and is not as creamy as Silk Soymilk (which contains carrageenan), and it contains a grainy sludge that sinks to the bottom of cup or pitcher.  I was filtering out this residue at first, with cheese cloth and a fine sieve, but that procedure was slow and bothersome.  Now I'm used to this sediment (but I wouldn't serve it to company).

review/text: I've had this for almost a year - I've used it to make soymilk, almond milk, and to grind flax seeds.  It's solid, easy to use, works quite well at everything I've tried on it, and it's great to know what's in my milk & to be able to cut down on the waste involved in packaging, shipping, and processing store-bought soymilks.  There is a beanier taste to home-made soymilks that takes some getting used to, which was disappointing at first, but I've gotten used to it.

review/summary: I LOVE Erythritol
review/text: Erythritol is not nearly as popular as it should be, which is a shame. It tastes just like sugar with some differences.<br />-It sometimes has a cooling effect, like winter-green candies, but it can be countered with mixing it 1:1 with splenda.<br />-It does not have a nasty after-taste, but it is only about 75% as sweet as sugar, so splenda comes in handy for mixing here also. This mixture does double duty since erythritol counteracts the splenda after-taste. -Erythritol is heat stable so you can bake and cook with it.<br />-It does not get syrupy or sticky like sugar.<br />-It does not really caramelize like sugar.<br />-Some cookies still have that cooling effect even with the splenda mixture.<br />-It is possible to make powdered sugar by throwing it in the blender and blending for a bit.<br />-It does not dissolve as easily as sugar in cold drinks.<br /><br />Some good things to note.<br />-Does not give stomach problems like other alcohol sugars.<br />-It does not cause tooth decay.<br />-The calorie count is .2 per gram, so it is virtually calorie free and truly low carb.<br />-It does not raise blood sugar.<br />-It is not known for stalling weight loss on low carb. programs.<br /><br />BTW, Emerald forest is where I buy from. They have the best price and very reasonable shipping. I get 10 lbs. at a time. I love the stuff.

review/summary: The premier bulk sweetener
review/text: Erythritol is the bulk sweetener that the sugar free food manufacturers should be using. It has many advantages over the ones most used by the manufacturers such as maltitol, sorbitol, mannitol, lactitol and xylitol. First, Erythritol has only 5 calories per ounce while the others have between 40 and 90 calories per ounce. Also, Erythritol has a glycemic index near zero while the others can be as high as in the 50's such as maltitol syrup. A low glycemic index is highly desirable as it does not cause an insulin spike which is a problem for those of us who are prone to overeat. Also, and most importantly, Erythritol has a far better laxation threshold than the others. For the uninitiated, this means that one can eat twice (or three times) as much erythritol as the others before having to go to the bathroom. Some of the candy makers used to use Erythritol in their sugar free candy bars but they stopped and substituted maltitol. Hershey foods in particular should bow their heads in shame as they had the best product made with Erythritol and ruined it with maltitol. The new maltitol laced product has more calories and is more likely to cause the "Runs." I sometimes think the candy companies are in league with the toilet paper companies. I use erythritol to make my own sugar free candy along with a good brand of unsweetened baking chocolate (e.g. Callebaut, Valrhona) along with some fiber such as inulin or polydextrose. If you do not wish to make your own candy with this product you can find some excellent ones on the internet that use Erythritol such as choco-perfection bars or chocolite bars.

review/text: I have been using this product for a year and a half with great appreciation.  It is lovely to have sugar in my coffee, and I make low carb jam with cranberries that is dynamite:<br /><br />RECIPE [ 1 pack cranberries, 1 c. erythritol, 1 cup water, ]3 whole cloves.  I boil this until all the berries have popped.  You could make it sweeter if you like.  A slight sugar crust forms on top.]<br /><br />There is a slight cooling effect which I NEVER notice.  I NEVER have gastric bloating, cramping or gas like other products.  It is good for your teeth.  It doesn't grow yeast.  It tastes great, no bitter after-taste.<br /><br />I make folks try it and they can't believe how good it its.<br /><br />It sure helps to make pies that I can eat during the holidays.<br /><br />And I have lost 120 lbs this year (NO surgery!). Emerald Forest also sells packets of erythritol to carry with you.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KNC18E">Emerald Forest Erythritol Packets 100ct Box</a><br /><br />I buy the Emerald Forest 5 lb bags which is the best price anywhere and buy several so I get free shipping.  This product is BETTER than xylitol which can give gastric symptoms and has way more calories.

review/summary: Erythritol compared to Xylitol & Stevia
review/text: Hi, I have a son with Candida (severe yeast problem) so we have run the gamut as far as trying alternative NATURAL sweetners that are ULTRA LOW on the glycemic index. Erytritol while containing NO calories is more like 1/2 the sweetness of Xylitol, I know they say it is 1/3 less but you really, REALLY need two times as much in our experience. While it does NOT have any funny aftertaste as some stevia brands do & we LOve the fact that it is ZERO calories, we find that a home made blend of all 3 works the best. Stevia also has no calories & xylitol has 2/3 of table sugar. So if you are dieting or have blood sugar issues this is a good viable alternative with no negative effects like the UNnatural products like sucralose AKA Splenda & Nutrasweet have.., howbeit a PRICEY one!

review/summary: Delicious, but take care.
review/text: I'm giving this five stars because it does everything an alt sugar should. It tastes wonderful (I had no objections to its so-called "cooling effect.") Combined with stevia, it's an all-star method for sweetening baked goods without increasing your carb count. In fact, the stevia/erythritol combo is what you get with Truvia, only here it's without Cargill's creepy secrecy about its methods and "natural flavors."<br /><br />HOWEVER. If you have Crohn's or severe IBS, think twice before ordering erythritol. There isn't enough written out there, but you may find it triggering severe symptoms, including intestinal bleeding, as it has for me. Below a certain threshold, I don't seem to feel any effects, but even the modest amount contained in two brownies was enough to cause a night of bleeding, nausea and overall misery. I wish I'd known about the IBS connection before -- although I will say my husband tolerates this beautifully, as do most people, and if you can, it's an excellent way to mollify your sweet tooth without packing on the pounds.

review/summary: This stuff is AWESOME!!!
review/text: I've been using Erythritol for a little over a year now.  The added bonus to this particular brand is that they assure it's non-GMO!  I had been using Truvia, which is extremely expensive, especially if trying to bake with it!  I found a recipe for how to make my own Truvia with Erytritol and Stevia.  SO easy to make at a fraction of the cost of Truvia, and again, I know all my sweetner is non-GMO too.<br /><br />Not sure if everyone knows though that Erythritol does not melt like sugar.  In order to make it work in recipes, you really need to "powder" it if using in recipes.  Just put it in your coffee mill, Ninja, Vitamix....something that has a high processing speed and just blend it until it's powdered.  DO NOT open the lid until it's all settled though.  Otherwise, your kitchen will be coated in sweet white powder!!  Anyway, am posting the blend to make your own Truvia and the conversions for sugar to the homemade granular Truvia and also the powdered Truvia conversions.  Hope this helps some of you bakers out there.  It sure has been great for my own cooking/baking!<br /><br />Homemade "Truvia" Sweetener<br /><br />Makes 1/4 cup sweetener substitute<br /><br />1/8 teaspoon good tasting stevia extract (I use NuNaturals pure white stevia extract)<br />1/4 cup erythritol<br /><br />Add ingredients to plastic baggie. Shake baggie well to mix sweeteners.<br /><br />**To replace 1 cup of Truvia, mix 1/2 teaspoon of pure stevia extract with 1 cup erythritol. Enjoy!<br /><br />TRUVIA CONVERSION (spoonable)<br /><br />2 teaspoons sugar = 3/4 teaspoon Truvia (1 1/4 teaspoons powdered Truvia)<br />1/4 cup sugar = 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons Truvia (2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons Powdered Truvia)<br />1/2 cup sugar = 3 tablespoons Truvia (1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon powdered Truvia)<br />1 cup sugar = 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Truvia 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons powdered Truvia)

review/text: If you have ever bought capers then you know how crazy expensive they are. These are the cheapest I could find and they don't have any noticeable taste differences when compared to the more expensive brands. I use capers in my hummus, about half a jars worth. I also use them in spaghetti sauces and ground up in mayo for a sandwich spread. If you have never had capers don't by this! Capers have a very unusual taste and not everyone likes them. They are very salty and taste kinda like a green olive but more complex. They are juniper berries so they do have that taste to them. I don't expect everyone was raised around juniper so I will just describe it as almost metallic/bitter/earthy taste.

review/summary: Cookie review
review/text: I was a little disappointed with the product. We buy similar maple cookies at a local store for much less money. We like them so well we wanted to try a better grade and ordered Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies. The filling was excellent but the cookie itself was not very good. It tasted as if the cookies were stale. I would not recommend them at their price point. I now have 5 boxes to give as gifts.

review/summary: Didn't meet my expectation
review/text: I ordered these cookies following my exposure to similar cookies (from Canada). When I received these ones, they were soft, gooey and stale. Even my kids rejected them.

review/summary: Maple Cream Cookies
review/text: I ordered three boxes of Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies but received three boxes of Dare Brand maple cookies.  Both brands were sold by the same company.I understand now that they were out of the Maple Farms brand so switched to the Dare brand.  Why didn't they tell me they were out of the Maple Farms brand when I ordered??  Won't buy again if this is the way they do business.

review/summary: DELICIOUS BUT BROKEN
review/text: I have to agree that these cookies are truly delicious and a couple years ago they used to arrive in a cardboard box and all was well. Then they switched to shipping them just wrapped in a piece of plastic. Needless to say, when they arrived many of the cookies were broken to pieces. I would buy them again if they were to switch back to shipping them in a box.

review/summary: A real treat!
review/text: You won't find them on the shelves of most major supermarkets. Rather, you are more likely to find Maple Grove Farms fabulous Maple Cream Cookies at a locally-owned gourmet shop or at gift shops all across America.  Made with 100% pure maple syrup and shaped like maple leaves these yummy cream sandwich cookies are a taste sensation.  My wife and I don't come across them very often but when we do we thoroughly enjoy them.<br /><br />As the story goes two Vermont women began making these fine cookies as a cottage industry on a country farm (Maple Grove Farm) back in 1915.  Now nearly a century later these luscious cookies are still being made up there in Vermont using that same original recipe.  You can taste the real maple syrup in each and every bite.  So if you enjoy great maple taste as much as I do be on the lookout for Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies.  You can even find them right here on Amazon. As another reviewer has indicated these cookies can be extremely addictive. Very highly recommended!

review/text: We had these cookies in Victoria, BC; I wanted to get more for gifts from our trip to Canada but forgot about it.  When I got home Amazon had them and I was able to give them as gifts as planned.

review/summary: Best Maple Cream Cookies ever!
review/text: Maple Grove Farms Maple Cookies are delicious. I tasted maple cookies in Canada and as soon as I returned home I got on my computer to order some.  My family tasted them and before I could say "take some home" all six boxes were gone.  I plan on ordering more.  Thanks Maple Grove Farms!

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

review/summary: Dog loved it!
review/text: Purchased before at pet store (much pricier). A favorite: quality food, minimal ingredients, perfect for allergy-prone dog. However, the ingredients now include pork liver, which was not listed, that he is allergic to; my sister's dogs now love it.

review/summary: Consistent and fairly priced
review/text: It's tough to find raw pepitas without spending a fortune per pound. The Bergin brand delivered 4 1-pound packages that are well sealed to last months...which is what most households may need if you consider buying 4 pounds of raw pepitas at once.  We roast them in batches and add them to many different dishes, baked goods and even grind them into sauces for flavor and healthy protein. I'd recommend buying these if you enjoy pepitas enough that one 4 ounce bag just won't do.

review/summary: Not exactly what I was looking for
review/text: The pepita's are good and the price was right but I wish they would have disclosed that they could be from China. Not that everything Chinese is bad, I'm just not crazy about all the chem's and problems the Chinese are having within they're food industries. eg baby formula. If you can't do baby formula right what chance is getting anything else right??? 3 for bergen's effort but unfortunitely I'll be buying elsewhere and hopefully find something North American.

review/summary: all gone
review/text: 1. someone said 4pounds is a lot; well that is relative. we went thru our 4 pounds in a little over a month. we toss them in the mouth raw or roasted; they also go in about everything from omelets, salads, to ceral-oatmeal.<br /><br />what i do not like is the price. floating at 5bucks a pound for pumpkin seed just seem high when compared to other foods...nothing much is involved, grow pumpkins (they grwo fast and easy), harvest and get seeds plus pulp, then sell the shells and rind for cattle feed...so how is 5bucks justified....????<br /><br />there are cheaper seeds and nuts that are as good, so we will only buy these 'once in awhile' for variety.
