review/summary: very good coffee
review/text: I generally prefer to grind whole bean coffee but I decided to give this a try since it was on sale. I really like it. In fact I'm drinking a cup of it while writing this review. It has a definite yet subtle nutty flavor to it. Just the right amount of flavor. I would like to try the whole bean but I would certainly buy this again.

review/text: Can't get a better tasting coffee than 8'Oclock coffee.  We love the Hazelnut!  I went with the ground to save some time each morning.  Not a good choice!!  I use a perculator...THE BEST way to enjoy coffee and factory ground is too fine for that type of brew.  I have since gone back to the whole bean and grind it myself....WHOLE BEAN IS THE BEST!!

review/summary: Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/summary: Wonderful food!
review/text: My 2 dogs go crazy over this food!  I made the decision to switch them to it after reviewing all the dry dog foods out there.  My 6 year old Boxer has had a sensitive stomach all her life and many days had to be coaxed to eat.  Not any more!  She is always eager to eat and hasn't had an upset stomach since they started on this about 4 months ago.  You don't feed as much as other foods and they started gaining weight on this at first, so I have to watch that.  But they look so healthy now!  I also get the canned Merrick food, which they get a spoonful of, along with the dry.  They love all the canned foods too.  I also wish Amazon would carry this food.  But I have found one place where the price isn't too bad.  A 30 pound bag will last my 2 dogs about a month and a half.

review/summary: a great premium food-- human grade ingredients, thoughtfully chosen, with unique manufacturing process
review/text: Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a summary of the nutritional information:<br /><br />-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.<br />-One cup contains 478 calories<br />-Major ingredients:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacgterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend. My cat and I have been really happy with it.

review/summary: Outstanding Product
review/text: We too got hit with the cat food recall and our beloved Destiny didn't recover like the other three 4 legged babies did.  When she died I started researching cat food and the additives.  Cats are NOT vegetarians and the first ingredients in many foods was corn or other grains.  Blue is chicken 1st and then human grade sweet potato and blueberries.  A heathy diet for anyone, but especially for my babies.  They were on Blue exclusively for food but we (hubby) still gave them various brands of cat treats.  A few months ago we had a problem with severe itching in two cats.  I checked and the treats included processed corn (again).  We got a second flavor of the Spa Select and we now use that as "treats"...it took a couple of days before they accepted that as their treat, but no more itching. They are happy, contented, energetic and look forward to meal time and treat time.  (If we are a bit late, they remind us.)

review/summary: Great Dry Cat Food!!!
review/text: While at a petstore I was approached by a rep for BLUE cat food and after hearing what she had to say about the ingredients I decided to buy a bag.  My cat has been on this food for almost a year now and I've noticed a change in her coat- its more soft and shiny.  There are also 2 different sized kibbles, which my cat seems to like.<br /><br />What impressed me was this food is made with human grade ingredients.  Most cat foods contain a lot of fillers and aren't very nutritious.  It is worth the extra money to give my cat the very best in cat food.

review/summary: Excellent Food for Sensitive Cats
review/text: I have tried multiple organic foods for my sensitive cat. She gets dry patches on her skin from scratching excessively at what I call "phantom fleas" as she was flea infested when she went into the shelter I rescued her from. Blue Buffalo Spa Select is the first food that I have found that completely gets rid of the dry sores around her neck. It also leaves her coat softer and shinier than ever before. I would like to believe that the "LifeSource bits" are what is causing her to run around and play in the middle of the night; however, I am not completely certain about that. Nonetheless, Jemima is more active since we have fully switched her food to Blue Buffalo!

It was a fine food.<br /><br />Then I started reading about the process of making pet food and became concerned about feeding him "meat byproduct" and corn, which is an allergen to many pets.  I wanted to find the best food I could to make sure he stayed happy and healthy for many years to come.<br /><br />So, at the one year point, we decided to give Blue Buffalo a try.  Leo loves it and we are happy knowing that our baby is eating real food and just the castoffs and junk from real food.

review/summary: Good food, cat loves it
review/text: I mainly feed my cat canned food because it's generally healthier than dry, but I give him a small scoop of dry food when his wet food has spoiled and he's whining for a midnight snack or something. They gave us a bag of Science Diet with him at the shelter, which is just filled with terrible stuff (although the cat loved that too, lol) but I wanted another dry food as a supplement, but one that was healthy. Blue Buffalo is very healthy and my cat LOVES it. I still prefer to feed him the canned food, but a scoop of this is great. I foolishly tried a different type canned food one day, and although that was healthy stuff too, his stomach hadn't adjusted to it and he was meowing at me for hours in the morning in misery before I realized the problem (he had diarrhea--luckily he's litterbox trained). I gave him a small cup of dry Blue Buffalo and he ate it right up. It really settled his stomach, and no more problems since then. This really is great, healthy stuff.

Starbucks calls it "All Natural Mocha Powder" now. It works best for hot cocoa if you follow the directions. It is excellent for baking. I actually buy it specially to make my Grandmother's Chocolate zucchini muffins. The staff at Starbucks told me that it only comes available at the Christmas season. So stock UP!<br />You can order it from Starbucks for half price these people are asking.

You will never go back to inferior mass market envelopes of "cocoa" again.  Why didn't they have this stuff when I was a kid?  Child abuse!

review/summary: Nearly Guilt Free Hot Cocoa Gourmet Goodness!
review/text: This Hot Cocoa from Starbucks is up there with the best for a great hot chocolate milk. The ingredients are very simple but sometimes purely simple is simply the best. Less is more in this case for sure. I had worked my way up to a fairly expensive dark chocolate favorite, and the price was going up and up (closing in on $2 a serving). Well, even at the list price, this is a far better deal. But less or half than that list price is a steal compared to my other top favorite.<br /><br />When Hubby brought this (reusable steel or aluminum?) canister home to me (full disclosure: he found it at Costco), in the interest of saving some money on my frequent indulgence of hot chocolates, I was skeptical to say the least. How could this `way cheaper' almost simply cocoa be as good as the gourmet hot chocolate I had grown accustomed to?<br /><br />The only thing to do was a side by side blindfolded taste test to prove which was better. Of course you know that Hubby thought that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. My `old favorite' that I had come to cling to was just maybe marginally better, but this new hot cocoa was a very, very close second. Close enough. When I have this on its own (which I've been doing a lot lately), without the other (pricey) cup sitting beside this one, I forget about the other favorite almost altogether.<br /><br />The label says, `made with ethically sourced cocoa', which if true (and I truly hope it is), is another very good thing, because that is a rare thing to find these days. Who wants to use `unethically sourced' cocoa or anything? But how do we know most of the time? I had recently been told that you almost can't get cocoa that hasn't been involved in some mistreatment of people. So, if this  cocoa is `clean', I can use it guilt free... well, except for a few calories.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Hot Cocoa.<br />Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author/Artist

review/summary: Delicious, and soy-free!
review/text: I cannot eat soy for medical reasons, and had difficulty finding a product without soy in it. I never liked the hot cocoa they serve at Starbucks, but when I read the label on the beautiful tin this cocoa mix comes in, I was happy enough to discover the lack of soy that the Starbucks label could be overlooked.<br /><br />However, when I got it home and made a cup (according to directions on the tin), I was more than happy. It's a rich, full-flavor cocoa, nothing like either the Starbucks coffee shop version or the Swiss Miss (et al) grocery store types. It does require milk, not water, for mixing. Along with the lack of soy, it doesn't have milk either, so people who cannot drink milk can also enjoy, just mix it with soy milk.<br /><br />The tin is nicer than I expected, with a double-layer lid, not just a bent piece of metal. Very, very nice.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: Starbucks hot cocoa (even fresh from Starbucks) was never my favorite until this year, the Salted Caramel Hot Chococolate. When I first tried this cocoa, it tasted a bit bland in both chocolate and sugar, and I did use 2 tbsp for a cup. Added a bit of salt and it tastes even better, which sounds peculiar, but works.

It is not too sweet and very rich in dark chocolate flavor which I love.  I was unhappy when I finished off the last packet!  (And I never shared them with anyone!)  But when I found the 2.5 lb can of Starbucks Hot Chocolate on Amazon (naturally!)I reluctantly agreed to share.

review/summary: Best stuff I've ever had
review/text: I prefer hot chocolate to coffee or tea, so I've spent a lot of time trying various brands of hot chocolate mix.  The Starbucks Hot Cocoa mix, like most of the ones I prefer, requires you to make it with milk.  It makes for a fantastic cup of hot cocoa and doesn't require a lot of the mix to get a nice strong flavor.  The only thing I've had that compares to this is making hot cocoa from scratch using sugar and baking chocolate.  Although expensive, this is very much worth it for the hot chocolate connoisseur

review/summary: The BEST Chocolate - dented cans ?
review/text: Seriously ???  way higher price and dented cans ???  Unfortunately the shipment of two 2 lb. canisters came with dents in both cans and loose cocoa powder all over them and in the box - the canisters were sealed shut so contents were okay.  It seems the packing, shipping facility is not concerned with quality in handling the product.<br /><br />That said:  This is the BEST cocoa ever . . .  and due to the difficulty of finding it,  was  willing to pay the higher off season price which is 60%+ more than the seasonal winter price.  Will stock up this winter so there's enough to last the entire year at the lower price point.  Sure makes a GREAT cup of hot chocolate.

review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: This is an outstanding cocoa, to be mixed with hot milk. Excellent flavor, perfect balance of deep cocoa and sweetness.<br /><br />Simple directions: heat milk to near boiling--2-1/2 to 3 minutes in microwave, depending on amount-- and WHISK in the the cocoa.<br /><br />Much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27NU6">Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a>, which, as I say in my review there, is much too sweet: I have to cut the Ghirardelli with a premium raw dutch cocoa. In contrast, this cocoa is perfect as is. That is what makes this cocoa a better deal than the Ghirardelli: it doesn't require anything extra. For an even better deal, as other reviewers have said, get from Costco when on special at about half the price here.<br /><br />P.S. At the price currently being charged ($30), don't even think about it. Go back to Ghirardelli, and add raw cocoa to taste. Wait until Costco brings it back (next fall?).

review/summary: Not as good as I expected
review/text: I love chocolate! Dark and rich! Did I get this with this product? Kinda sorta! I was really hoping that it was totally better than the competition  (Ghirardelli or Nestles comes to mind) but I was rather disappointed in the chockiness and rather bitter cocoa flavor. Whip cream (used every time) does not help. Plus it is rather lumpy and requires addition effort to blend in with the milk. I know this review won't be popular but this is the truth for me. So instead of tossing it out I decided to do a mix between my left-over Ghirardelli Double Chocolate with a 3 to 1 ratio (Starbucks being the 3) and the taste isn't terribly bad and sometimes enjoyable depending if I get the ratio right. So it appears I enjoy a bit of sweetener with my hot cocoa. Yep! But not done overly like Nestles nor like a full 100% Ghirardelli. And forget Stevensons! I reviewed that awhile ago that it was the biggest stinker yet and ended up giving most of the cans away for Christmas presents perhaps thinking others are not as fussy as I am! I will finish the Starbucks but won't be raving about it nor will I buy it again. I am still in search for the deep rich hot cocoa flavor with just a mild sweetness type of flavoring.

review/summary: definitely POWDER--WORST cocoa I've tasted
review/text: I'm a big hot cocoa kind of person, so I jumped on this when I saw it for cheap at Costco. However, I followed the instructions on the back perfectly, and I still felt like the cocoa was waaay too powdery. It felt thick and grainy no matter what I did. I literally spit it up. Ultimately, I veered away from the instructions and put less powder in (about 1 and 1/2 tbsp). Works alright that way. I also added cold half and half after I'd made the cocoa sometimes, which was nice (of course it diluted the flavor, but I didn't mind). I tried one reviewer's suggestion of adding salt--it was actually really nice that way! It's best mixed with coffee. Definitely not worth the price, though. My boyfriend absolutely will not drink it. He says it's the worst cocoa he's ever tasted because it's too bitter and grainy.

review/summary: Best Green Tea with fruit flavor
review/text: I don't like most teas. I only drink teas with fruit flavoring. Mostly, I prefer orange flavored green teas. While shopping in the grocery store one day, I saw "Twinings Green & Cranberry" tea and decided to try it. I'm not a big fan of cranberries but it is a fruit.<br />I was amazed at how delicious it was. And it's not too strong either. It taste like fruited black tea. I have been drinking it for two years now. I hope Twinnings will continue making this flavor tea for many years to come. Unfortunately, it seems that everytime I find a tea I like. It is either discontinued or just difficult to find.<br />If you like black tea but prefer green because it is determined to be better for you and you like fruity teas, then you may like this one.

review/summary: Smells wonderful, tastes awful
review/text: I am new to the world of tea. My mother, being the thrifty person that she was, always bought huge quantities of economy tea to make her beloved iced tea. Not until I was almost 18 did I actually touch the stuff, and even then, only in small, desperate measures to drink anything but water. Only recently, after a trip abroad where the beverage choices were beer, tea, or coffee did I decide to become rightfully acquainted with the least of the three evils (and the one with the most flavor options): tea. With this in mind, understand I am not a tea connoisseur, but I know what tastes horrible and this is it.<br /><br />I found Twinings in Europe, specifically, their Green Tea and Lemon and Black Currant teas. Both were a new adventure for me, and the Green Tea and Lemon was flavored so delicately and was an enjoyment in the morning that I had to hunt it down once I came back to the US. I found the Twinings USA shop and browsed through their other teas, as I had to have a minimum order of roughly 5 packs of 20 bags of tea each. Deciding to live a little, I purchased two other teas, one of which is the Cranberry and Green Tea. I was most excited to try this one, as I LOVE cranberry...adore it, and consume it in some form every day. Once the packaged arrived, I ripped it open eagerly, boiled water, and plunked in the tea bag, and sniffed anxiously as the aromas wafted. Sweet delicate cranberry and a hint of green tea, just waiting for it to cool down was agony.<br /><br />Once cool enough, I took my first sip and shuddered. It was terrible. Nothing like the smell, nothing like what I had imagined. I figured maybe it was too hot, or maybe the aftertaste of my previous lunch--anything, that could have made it taste awful. So, the following day I braved it again. The taste was just as horrible, there is no taste of cranberry that I can discern. The taste can only be described as boiling water with fresh ashes from an ash tray in a seedy bar, no matter what temperature, water, etc. I tried. Since I purchased a whole box, I force myself to drink a little each week, all the while making faces. Yes, green tea is an acquired taste, and I used to drink it plain with no issue.<br /><br />This, Twinings, was a huge miss for flavored teas. This was very disappointing after my positive experiences with their other teas.

review/summary: Delicious, easy, affordable (slightly lemony)
review/text: Facts:<br />As of the time of this writing, this product is available for free shipping with Amazon Prime, and is available for their subscribe and save discount, which makes it very affordable. Each box yields roughly one pound of hummus after water and olive oil are added. For my area, this results in the cost being roughly 1/3 of store bought ready-made hummus, which is the main reason I will continue to buy it. I eat a lot of hummus, (about a pound a week), and it gets expensive.  The ingredient list, as shown on box:<br />Garbanzo bean flour, sesame seed powder, salt, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, citric acid, lemon juice powder, sesame oil, lemon oil, rosemary extract.<br /><br />Opinions:<br />To me, this is well worth the savings, as the end result is a cheaper, better hummus than store-bought. As-is, the hummus is quite tasty, but still a little bland and a little lemony. (But don't let some of the reviews on here scare you - the lemon taste isn't that intense. Unless your experience with lemons is limited completely to cleaning products, it in no way tastes like "furniture polish" as one person commented on a review). I prefer to modify mine to enhance the flavor. My recommendation to reduce the lemon flavor by rounding out the flavor overall is to add garlic and shallots. Finely dice and saut&eacute; (2) cloves garlic and (1) large clove of shallots and stir them into the hummus when you first prepare it. This will enhance the flavor (not enough garlic in the box to my taste), and it feels more "homemade" this way, so you can be proud of your hummus creation. I also recommend experimenting. Maybe you like spicy hummus...dice up some jalape&ntilde;o! Maybe you like sweet hummus...dice up some ginger! It's cheap enough that even if you don't like your creation, it's not that big of a loss.<br /><br />If you don't agree with me on any of this, feel free to call me out...but try a box first. I bet you won't disagree with me after all.

review/text: I bought this hoping to save my self a few bucks as I go through hummus pretty fast.  For me this has two tastes, the when you first put the food in your mouth, and then about 30 seconds after you swallow.  The first part just tasted bland, and I though I could spice it up a bit. The after taste is what got me.  The after taste tastes like furniture polish smells like.  Some of the reviews blamed this on the lemon flavoring - I bought this for the lemon flavoring, but again it tastes like furniture polish smells like - not like hummus flavored with lemon.

I don't have to plan my hummus, it can be spur of the moment.<br /><br />It's blended well and smooth every time because it comes that way. The flavor is delicious and can stand alone, although I enjoy adding this  or that like chopped onions, more garlic powder, roasted or raw red pepper, etc.<br /><br />Good in so many ways!  I enjoy eating it as a chip dip, cracker dip,  veggie dip, sandwich spread, sandwich pocket filling, any way I have stuff on hand for.  By itself is good too.<br /><br />Yes there is lemon in there, it's great! I didn't find this too salty,  at least no more salty than Sabra for example.

review/text: Wow - great Hummus, much better than one could expect from a dry-powder. Once you spice it up a bit with some red paprika, a bit of parsley and some cumin - its nearly the best Hummus I have ever had - and I had Hummus at the best places in Israel and New York City.

review/summary: That "Magical Fruit" Issue....
review/text: I felt I had to warn people about this product.  It's not that it's a bad company, or bad product per se.  Powdered hummus isn't all that great, but I do see the benefit and convenience of it.<br /><br />The problem is the effect one experiences after consuming it.  While every other form of hummus I've tried over the years hasn't caused such a problem, for some reason this company's powdered product does.  And it's bad, like, painful bad.<br /><br />So, I suggest if you haven't tried it yet, perhaps buy one box locally and try it first, before committing to a full pack.

review/summary: Excellent Hummus Mix!
review/text: I received this order in a timely fashion. I immediately made one box of the mix, the powdered mix smelled pretty strongly of concentrated lemon flavor. However, after I added the water and oil, the odor disappeared. I added 1 clove of crushed garlic and some Cayenne Pepper. The mix is very tasty, very similar to "real" Hummus. It does not have a strong and artificial lemon flavor, indeed, I added a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice. I have eaten Hummus for a very long time, I would never have guessed that this was made from a dried mix. Next time I will use 2 boxes of mix at once. It is very good and and 1 batch will not go far. I can highly recommend this to Hummus aficionados everywhere.

review/summary: Wouldn't be without it
review/text: I've been using this product for at least 20-25 years, maybe longer -- and never even noticed that it was "too" lemon-y! I just loved the blend of ALL its flavors. I now live in an  area with only two health food stores located some distance from me -- both carry this hummus but it's a long drive. A large midwest grocery chain (Meijers) that's 20 minutes away sometimes carries it but has been phasing out Fantastic in favor of Annies (who pays the store more "kickback" for greater shelf space -- bah). So, I've been without any hummus for about 4 weeks at this point and was delighted to find it on amazon. Now as blizzards, etc near, I won't have to worry about being without it again!<br /><br />Update since I wrote the above review: I ordered the 12-pack currently on sale for $28.50. I didn't look closely enough at the seller however. I assumed it was Amazon and that I'd get free shipping. But it's an outside firm. I checked their confusing shipping pop-up page, which lists cost per/item but also $4.50/shipment. From what I could tell, the $4.50 would trump the lower per/item cost so I felt it was still a good deal. At checkout, however, I discovered shipping would run about $12! That's an extra dollar/box, which no longer makes this a bargain!!! Sooooo, I'm going to be without my hummus after all. :-(<br /><br />Amazon, please start carrying this product yourself!

review/summary: product NOT as pictured or described
review/text: I ordered this item because when I've purchased it from a local store it clearly states, no alkali. This description says produced with no alkali, however when I receive the item, on the can, it says with alkali. And I can't return it because it's a grocery item. I will just be throwing this junk in the trash. The whole purpose of me coming online to buy this is because I want a pure cocoa powder that has no alkali, hence it's in it's more natural form and higher in antioxidants. I do not want to purchase things that have been altered. ridiculous. I will not make this mistake twice. I can't get this locally anymore without the alkali. I wanted the product pictured, the can with the white label that says Fat Free Wondercocoa, not this tin brown can which is the second picture. Why the two different items Amazon? the whole purpose of putting pictures and descriptions up are so the customers know exactly what they are getting when they buy from you, especially on items that can't be returned!

review/summary: Authentically Rich Cocoa
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at the full, rich taste of this cocoa. Mix in a tablespoon with a 1/2 cup low-fat or skim Ricotta cheese, crushed raspberries, and walnuts for an excellent low-fat to no fat dessert. Better than ice cream! Or add 1 tbsp of organic chunky almond butter(without sugar; Stevia, to taste, is great instead)to the Ricotta cheese, and cocoa. Also great if you're on the HCG program, phase 1, mix in 1 tsp with your coffee; or sprinkle on strawberries or oranges and mix the cocoa with the fruit's natural juice. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0G2Q8">Wonderslim Pure Fat-Free Cocoa Powder, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: NOT worth the price
review/text: Paid $33 total for this product, as I was interested in getting at little fat as possible since my wife was doing the hcg diet. But all in all, the .5g of fat you save per tbsp isn't worth the jacked up price for this cocoa. Also, the tin cans they come in are VERY messy, and for one the container swelled shut, and in the process of carefully trying to pry it open to not make a mess, the upper lid popped off, leaving a bottom lid part with a razors edge that I had to take pliers to get off, still making a mess in the process. You're better off spending $10 for a pound of organic cocoa listed elsewhere on this site.

review/summary: Chocolate lovers heaven
review/text: Eat slowly, let small bites melt on your tongue. You will get different flavors and tastes. Although expensive, you don't need to eat a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. I can take 4 days for 1 3 oz bar. Certainly as good as any Belgian or Swiss chocolates I bought in Europe from gourmet chocolate stores. Sadly, not well known in the US.  The original company was bought by Hershey a few years ago, but does not advertise Sharffen Berger as much as their other candies. Which is surprising, given that this is so much better than the Hershey bars, kisses, etc  for eating or cooking. So buy a bar, taste a bit of chocolate heaven. BTW, this is specifically for the dark chocolate, but their bittersweet is also excellent. I don't eat milk chocolate any more, but my daughter loves their milk chocolate, says its the best, and she has sampled a lot of chocolate.

review/summary: Yeah, I care . . . about a good, cheap pot o' Joe
review/text: The age of the 2-cent coffee filter is over.  The Target near me no longer stocks a pack of 200 coffee filters for $3.99.  Ditto for Walgreen's where I nearly dislocated a shoulder reaching way to the back of the shelf for the last $1.99 package of 100 filters.  The best price I could find locally was 100 filters for about five bucks.  Sorry, no deal, not gonna pay it.<br /><br />As I was reaching for a can of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R923TU">San Marzano plum tomatoes</a> I had ordered by the case from Amazon.com, I wondered: Do they have a similar deal on coffee filters?<br /><br />Boy, do they!  So what if they're a cent and a half more?  They're still a better buy than any supermarket or drug store package.  All of the packaging is recyclable, including the shipping box.  And having them come right to the door is as good as a flavor shot.  When I get down to the last box, I just order up another case.<br /><br />I couldn't really taste any difference in the coffee but I can feel the difference in my wallet.

review/summary: You'll Taste the Difference
review/text: I've always been very particular about my coffee and I'm sorry I didn't begin using these filters earlier.  With your first cup, you'll immediately notice a delightful difference. Unlike the inexpensive bulk coffee filters I bought for years, these natural filters allow the coffee to drain a little faster.  If your ear is tuned to your coffee maker, you'll notice a difference in the drip sound straight away.  The faster drain means the water does not linger and thereby pick up unpleasant oil and acid.  The verdict: Your coffee is served hotter and tastes far more mellow.<br /><br />Two things to note.  1) If you're using a cheap coffee maker that gives your coffee a metallic taste, I'm not sure how these will make a difference. (I use a Cuisinart and I love it.)  2) A medium grind works best.  If you use a fine grind, you might find a bit of it in the bottom of the pot.  Still the same, the coffee tastes so much better, it's worth the extra clean up.

review/summary: if there was such a thing as organic coffee filters this would be it
review/text: before you buy coffee filters do your research. what chemicals do they use when making the paper? what glues do they use to hold the paper together? if you care rates superior in all categories in my book. if you don't care go ahead and drink something that is just been soaking in hundred degree water with acidic coffee. I think that's crazy if you're a health-conscious long-term coffee drinker. also drink organic coffee with fair trade certification

review/summary: Good Filters
review/text: Good filters.  A carton of 12 is a lot of filters, but the price per box is very good.  I used to buy unbleached filters at my warehouse store, but I've moved and the local warehouse stores here only carry the white ones.  I will purchase these again.

review/summary: Good filters and good price
review/text: We go through alot of coffee in our household so I find it practical to stock up on these since they are a good price when purchased in bulk. We were using the Melitta filters before I bought these. I was looking for some filters that would reduce the amount of chemicals we were exposed to and still be cost effective. These filters satisfy my requirements and seem to be good quality so far. The sizing is accurate and work great in my Technivorm. I plan on purchasing more in the future providing the price is affordable.

review/summary: If you care coffee filters, the out the cafestol chemical!
review/text: Gold mesh filters, or the Melita paper filters with holes in them, release BAD heart un-healthy cafestol (raises bad cholesterol)  into the coffee (sediment also upsets my stomach!)!-<br />" Cafestol, found in coffee, "is the most potent dietary cholesterol-elevating agent known".<br /><br />Fortunately-- these paper filters remove the cafestol!<br /><br />See<br />[...]<br /><br />Ricketts ML et al.

review/summary: Stating the obvious
review/text: Used to be a very funny TV commercial for a local Chicago furniture store. A vulgar woman proudly pointing to her bronze wall decoration of sculptured leaves, and loudly declaring: "These . . . ARE LEAVES!" I am reminded of this as I submit my review. These are coffee filters. They filter coffee. I like the price, and the quantity, which means I'm unlikely to get out of bed and be surprised by being out of filters. A medical issue required me to stop using a permanent gold filter, so I'm happy to have an option using unbleached paper. However, these are shipped from Germany, so I'm really not convinced it is a huge favor to the environment to use them. I will keep buying them, however, because for now, all things considered, this seems like the way to go.
