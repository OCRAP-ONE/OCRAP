review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever.

review/text: I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!

review/summary: Almost as good as the lamb
review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

review/text: I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/summary: Stinky but my dogs love it!
review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

review/summary: Cats Love it, and it Reduces Cat Yakkage
review/text: I am the proud slave/minion of two feline evil geniuses.  I only hope that my servitude will allow me to one day be reincarnated as a cat who gets to sleep in front of the heating vent all day, only rising for food and attention.<br /><br />Royal Canin is exceptional cat food.  My older, part Siamese kitty has bad teeth that are typical of his breed.  I have fed him everything from Purina Indoor to Iams to Eukanuba.  All of these he would eat whole and yak up on the floor.  Because his nutrition sucked, his coat was dull and he would shed and shed.  So I went on a search for something better.  I found Royal Canin.<br /><br />First off, when you open this bag (and it's resealable, so it won't get stale!), expect your cat to go nuts.  It actually SMELLS better than any other dry cat food I've found.  The first time I opened it, my older cat (didn't have the little one yet) tried to climb into the bag.<br /><br />So here are the pros:<br /><br />  -It's really appetizing/appealing.  For cats anyway.<br />  -The weird flat triangle shape makes it harder to yak up on the floor.<br />  -The higher amount of protein/fats (less "filler") means that it's easier to digest and less likely to be yakked up on the floor.<br />  -Within a couple of weeks you'll notice WAY less shedding and a shinier, more lustrous coat.  Kitty feels like bunny fur, shines like a mink.<br />  -Less shedding and a higher fat/oil content means less hairballs to yak up (mine does it VERY rarely anymore...maybe once every other month.  He just digests them now.<br />  -You can actually feed less than you would the other foods because less filler means more is digested.<br />  -Also means less poop.<br />  -And that poop is less stinky/nasty.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />  -It's more expensive.<br />  -When it's feeding time, your cat WILL NOT SHUT UP until you put it in the bowl.<br />  -If you really like stepping in cat yak or kicking it across the floor in the middle of the night in your bare feet, sorry, your mooshy toe days are numbered.<br /><br />So, don't be detered by the price (which is WAY cheaper here per pound than it is at PetCo...and with free shipping!), give it a try.  It's worth it if you want to be the best minion/slave you can possibly be (and increase your chances of being a cat in your next life!*).<br /><br />*Disclaimer: Purchase of Royal Canin does not guarantee purchaser will be reincarnated as a feline in any of their following lives.  This reviewer takes no responsibility for reincarnation disappointments.

review/summary: Best hairball remedy ever
review/text: Last year one of my cats stareted developing hairballs at an alarming rate.  He would throw up several times a week.  Each incident would include 2-3 times of vomiting before the hairball would come up.  I tried all the differents pastes and several differnet foods.  One night my cat became violently ill.  Well 1000.00 dollars and a barium study later, it was discovered that a huge hairball lodged itself in my cat's intestines.  I knew I had to do something.  After some research I discovered this food.  While very pricey, I figured it was worth a shot at this point.  Well the hairball problem is solved.  Maybe one incident every two weeks now.  My other cat never gets a hairball anymore.  I am very impressed and will never change from this food.

review/text: My Ragdoll kitty, Gracie, has been having hairball problems, as well as constipation problems for a few years. I have tried other foods, (Science Diet, Iams, etc.) with no luck. I have had to bring her to the vet every three months to have her glands emptied because the vet thought that might be part of her constipation problem. Since trying this food, she has had no problems!  I don't remember the last time she hacked up a hairball, and it has been months since she has been constipated.  This food is a little expensive, but well worth it.  Her poopie doesn't smell horrible, either, like it did on some of the other foods.  I will continue to buy this despite the price.

The vendor shipped me six jars but one was without a label. It wasn't the same color as the others so I communicated with the vendor... No Problem! They sent me the correct sixth and said I could keep the oddball jar (which turned out to be Apple Cinnamon curd and very tasty it is). If you like the Sweet/Tart taste of Key Lime you can't go wrong with this product.

I can eat it! It's certified gluten free and thus not made in a factory that processes wheat, unlike a lot of the other fancy peanut butter cups. It also doesn't have the preservative TBHQ like Reese's, of which I am also intolerant.<br /><br />I'd like to make my own peanut butter cups because it's cheaper, but when a quick sweet treat is needed these are dandy.

Justin's is a firmer tasty peanut butter filling in a firm tasty chocolate shell.  It's organic, vegan so a better alternative to Reese's but still tasty.

review/summary: HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
review/text: I was so excited to find these peanut butter cups at our local market. I love peanut butter cups...they are my all time favorite chocolate choice. I had to stop getting the "Reeces" kind because of the corn syrup in the ingredients. I was also glad to see that these were organic. How much better can you get? Well...I thought they were the biggest disappoint I have ever had in a candy. The texture was fine, but the taste was almost inedible. I actually didn't even finish one of the cups and then threw the rest away. I didn't think it was even possible to make a bad peanut butter cup. I give it to Justin's brand to be making an organic, corn free alternative to our favorites, but I won't be buying these anymore. I actually found an alternative at Trader Joe's that doesn't have corn in them and while they are not organic they taste GREAT and I will be sticking with those for now.

review/text: Being able to enjoy delicious dried beans in 45 minutes is a real plus in my book.  In the past, cooking beans meant hours of soaking and boiling which meant planning ahead and watching the pot so the water didn't cook out. Canned beans are not an option here.  Convenience is only part of these beans' charm, the taste is wonderful enough to enjoy alone or in any dishes calling for pinto, kidney or navy beans.

review/text: The Anasazi lived in small spaces and knew the value of good clean air!<br /><br />These beans have a wonderful taste, need no soaking, cook fast and best of all NO OR LITTLE GAS. Add your favorite seasoning meat (salt pork, andouille sausage) salt, pepper, roasted garlic bits and a little onion. Fix a pan of cornbread and ENJOY!!!

review/text: These have to be the very best beans in the world. They are made up with protein and fibre and some carbs for the flavor. They cook in less time than other beans and with ham chips cooked in, there won't be any leftovers. Bob's Red Mill gives you receipes with your order and that is a big plus. Most suppliers want you to sent to them for the the receipes. I will be buying from them as long as they sell beans.

review/summary: Great Beans
review/text: These really are great beans. Though they say no prep is necessary for these .... I still do some. I bring them to boil, turn off the heat. Let them sit for an hour or more. I then drain them, rinse them well 2 or 3 times. Then, add whatever you add to cook them in..... and the cook very quickly.... 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />While I like these very much, I am seeking other sources as the prices on these are rising quickly. [..]<br /><br />My local natural food store is getting some, and I encourage anyone to ask their's to get some as they are available in bulk for much less. As with all bulk items, the benefits of less packaging and delivery costs are tangible.<br />[...]<br /><br />Try these beans :)

review/text: I found the Anasazi beans to be very tasty and easy to work with. They can be cooked by boiling, on the stove top, or in a slow cooker. They are delicious by themselves or in a beef stew. They require very little salt (to my taste), are smooth in texture, have soft skins, good color and they do not generate the bloated feeling that many other legumes do.

review/summary: beans for kids
review/text: I have been a vegan for about 3 years and have tried every bean I have found.  These are my favorite, and even my kids love them... they certainly don't like all beans.  To me, these beans have a pork and beans flavor, but without the pork.  The skins are fairly thin, so the beans might disintegrate more easily than other beans, which works well for bean dips or a refried bean recipe.

review/text: In my opinion, this is the most versatile, easiest-to-cook bean available.  It cooks quickly (~45 min.), adapts to almost any dish, and remains firm after hours of simmering if your recipe requires that.  The Anasazi beans have a mild, nutty flavor as well as great fiber and protein stats.  Bob's offers a consistently high quality product.

review/text: We first had anasazi beans when an aunt brought them from New Mexico as a gift. Hers were from a local place and had much better flavor but it is ridiculously expensive to get the place to mail them to us (guess they haven't found out about flat rate boxes or something) so we tried these. They are good enough but we will probably wait to get more until our aunt comes to visit again.

review/summary: I made the mistake of eating Jell-o brand Mousse first
review/text: I made the mistake of eating Jell-o brand NON sugar free first, so while this probably is awesome... after having had the Jell-o brand that is 120 calories a serving (but I make it with skim milk so it comes out somewhere less than that - maybe 100) This Sans Sucre stuff falls a little short on fullness of taste and texture.<br /><br />BUT... what I have taken to doing because I know this is so much better for me is I take a pack of this and a pack of the jell-o and I make two batches together at one time.. a double batch.  So I'm getting a little bit of the better texture and taste from the Jell-o brand but still saving a few calories.<br /><br />On it's own, the Sans Sucre is passable but really bland for me the taste is sweet but not full or rounded, because it's just hard when you're palate is used to the sugary fattening stuff.  So I recommend if your palette is NOT used to anything start out on this, then you'll save yourself a lot of calories and not know the difference.

I've tried this and the French Roast from St. Ignatius and while I like knowing it benefits the order, the coffee itself, to me, is subpar.<br /><br />The 50/50 blend was darkly roasted, but tended toward the bitter side.  There was also inconsistency from one bag to the next.  The second bag seemed to taste, well, like there was plastic.  I thought it was my coffee maker, so I brewed another brand, the tast was gone.  I brewed another pot ot 50/50 and the taste was back.

review/summary: Bloodroot Powder That I purchased from Amazon
review/text: I ordered bloodroot to use for prevention and therapeutic purposes. I have tried drinking it in tea, and also I tried to make some indian black salve in order to get rid of a really stubborn wort that I have had on my thumb for a very long time. I have used my own home-made black salve which was created from the bloodroot in several trial variations for a lot of times on the wort, but to no avail. The wort is still there. Nevertheless, I figured since I paid $40 for the lb, there must be something that I can use this herb for, so I did some google searches and found that it is simply a red version of tumeric, which is good for cooking, among other uses. The bloodroot is much more potent than its relative, yellow tumeric, so it takes much less of the red one for seasoning soups. I am still glad to have the powder, because of its reputation of curing and/or preventing tumerous cancers, among other things. I think that I will have it for a long time though.I might try using it for dye, like the American Native (Indians) used to do.

review/text: I lived in South Texas as a kid.  This stuff is a must for the King Ranch Casserole. Google it for the recipe; it is something my mom still makes for Christmas dinner.<br /><br />I used it just last week for tortilla soup.  My recipe?  Chicken stock, cut up chicken, taco seasoning, fresh veggies (whatever you have on hand is probably fine), canned beans and corn, garlic, cilantro and cut up toasted tortilla strips.  Don't forget the Rotel!  When finished, I divide some up into smaller Tupperware containers to freeze (I make a lot at once).  For the soup I serve (either fresh or thawed), I add some other stuff to the top.  It may be jalape&ntilde;o, cilantro sprigs, avocado, or grated pepper jack cheese, or some sort of combination.<br /><br />The heavily advertised recipe for Rotel is to heat some up with Velveeta.  While a little unimaginative, I'll still chow it down.

Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet).

review/summary: Straight from Jamaica
review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.
