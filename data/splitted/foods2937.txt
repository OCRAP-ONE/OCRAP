review/summary: 0 stars actual rating-do not purchase for Keurig
review/text: I thought I was purchasing a Community Coffee K-cup for my Keurig.  That was the search I did in the Amazon search line.  When I received it I found out it was filter bags of coffee.  Spent $60 on 6 boxes, big mistake on my part.  I did notice they called them pods, but I thought it was a different term for K-cup, another big mistake on my part.  It does not work at all in the Keurig.  The coffee comes out with the look of slightly dirty water and has no flavor whatsoever.  Tried many other ways of brewing it, like a used K-cup with a plastic lid made for it, wetting the bag before brewing, nothing worked, the water flowed through the "pod" like water instead of steeping like coffee.  Keurig owners save your money.

review/summary: Weak Coffee
review/text: After single serve Senseo Dark Roast Coffee pods were discontinued, I purchased these pods on a trail basis.  If you like robust dark roast coffee, these are definitely not worth it.  Coffee is too weak tasting.  I wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Bad Value
review/text: I ordered this for my Senseo just for something new. I usually use the Senseo Sumatran pods. My normal serve is two pods with the double cup serve. I thought from reading this that I could use ONE pod for a double cup. Apparently that is incorrect. Okay, that's on me. I tried a pod on a single cup. Couldn't really discern any difference from the first. Very weak. I am not a "coffee afficiando" but I thought this coffee sucked.

review/summary: The Very BEST!!
review/text: Just want to make a quick statement. If you like HOT foods.....this is what you've been looking for!! :) Is very habit forming (the broth is wonderful) It says DONT microwave....this is because it has an aluminum layer under paper lid to preserve freshness. I totally remove this paper lid, open spice package...pour over noodles. Add water to level inside of bowl (letting water dissolve the powder)...put either a paper plate or saucer over the bowl, then microwave for 3 minutes. Take out of microwave....reach in with fork and FLIP the noodles over (dont try to break up noodles yet) microwave again for 2 minutes.....now break (seperate) the noodles with the fork. Now microwave one last time for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes......now stir and let it rest with lid in place to steam for a few minutes (if you can wait) :) Now get ready for bliss :)

I toss this one in whenver I can find it in the store and my cat just eats it like well, I have to eat this, don't I? It's not his favorite but he does choke it down somehow. He doesn't leave this one so he likes it somewhat. It's ground, so that isn't his favorite but you can actually see vegetables in this one. I like that part so that's why I buy it.

review/summary: A St. Louis Original -- Best Chocolate EVER
review/text: My husband grew up in St. Louis (let me know if you want to know which High School ;-)  and the first Christmas he came to our house, he brought us a pound of the Milk Chocolate.  He certainly knew how to win over my family because our entire family practically had fist fights over this chocolate.<br /><br />It is incredibly creamy, rich, and full of flavor.  It makes Nestles taste like cardboard.  Their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZXXWF0">Bissinger's Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bark (10 Oz)</a> is also like Nirvana.<br /><br />Service from Bissinger's is excellent and they often have free shipping. Every year, I send this all over the country to all of my family members and it is always the most popular part of the holidays for many.<br /><br />I've had a LOT of chocolate in my 40+ years... this is by far the best I have ever had.

Prior to purchasing these online, we routinely made trips back to St Louis to purchase Bissinger's Chocolate.  No we aren't really crazy, but this chocolate spoils you for any other chocolate). I have used this chocolate for years to make fresh chocolate covered strawberries for friends.

It just depends on your cat - if you have one that likes ground, give this one a try!

Because I was stunned to see such customer service I contacted the seller once again to offer payment for the UPS cost, but the seller refused stating that their goal is total satisfaction and that I should not pay for the shipping.

review/text: I love chocolate.  Good chocolate.  I've tried fancy bars, local bars, hand-poured bars, organic bars, and almost everything else, and THIS is my favorite.  The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!

review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/text: My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar. We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.

But I really would like to know what it consists of so I know what he's eating.  The gravy sure looks nice and the pieces are a nice size as well - not too big so he can get it into his small mouth.

review/summary: Sorry my mistake
review/text: I recently gave a poor review of this product because my elderly cat appeared to have a reaction of pain while eating it one day and refused to eat it thereafter. I considered that there was a possibility the food may have had a "sliver of bone" or some such contamination and stated this in my review, because my two cats previously liked this food. TURNS OUT that she has an allergy to who knows what (not this product I'm sure) which has made her mouth sore. The vet said it is common even in young cats and suggested it could have been caused by grass or plants she may have eaten during her short little trips out into the yard. So I am recinding my previous poor review and suggest that you buy this product if your cat likes it.

review/summary: who needs cheese when you have chocolate
review/text: I purchased these at a "local" target for movie snacks. they are pretty good. any lover of teddy grams will enjoy these. the dry marshmallows are reminiscent of the kind in cereal. they have a tiny grove in them so you can "stack them".<br /><br />I strongly recommend them. what I don't recommend is putting them in a bowl and dumping milk on them.<br />it is a horrible idea and creates and unpleasant gritty slurry.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKERS(PACK OF 8)
review/text: A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.00, but I picked my Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Graham Goldfish Crackers (Pack Of 8) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com and shipped free to my home for an awesome price of ONLY $10.63!!! If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do! Good Luck and happy bargain shopping, ENJOY!!!

review/summary: UNCANNY! Must Buy! Must Have! With Kids or Without Kids!
review/text: Amazing! When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/summary: A little pricey
review/text: I originally purchased the 24 pack of Jell-O cook n serve when there was a deal of $25.00 off a $50.00 order (I think) but anyway, the normal price amazon is selling at is .91 cents a box.  At the grocery it retails for a little more than that so I thought with the $25.00 off thus saving another 33% it brought the price of each box down to .61 cents or so which is a great savings from the grocery store and with free shipping wow! couldn't beat that.  It wasn't 2 weeks later I went to Meijer and they had the cook n serve 2/$1.00...ugh!! But the jell-o arrived as described, not expired (unlike other foods purchased from amazon) and no mice eaten boxes (unlike other foods purchased from amazon).  So all in all it was an average deal.

review/summary: Cajun seasoning not the best
review/text: I compared this to the Creole seasoned nuts from Peanut Shop of Williamsburg (also called "Mardi Gras" flavor nuts), and the Williamsburg nuts have a much tastier seasoning. These nuts are good nuts and roasted well, but I don't find the seasoning appetizing. There's a lot of herbal flavor, possibly oregano and bay leaf, which overpower the onion and garlic flavors. There's very little heat. It's not unlike the flavors in a gumbo, which are good flavors, but not so great with peanuts, in my opinion. The salt level is high, but I like salt.

review/summary: Tasty, sprightly and delicious!
review/text: Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.<br /><br />Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states  "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India."  They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty, sensual delight!<br /><br />Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon. I prefer it with cream. On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />From The Book of Tea by Okakura:<br /><br />"There is a subtle charm in the taste of tea which makes it irresistible and capable of idealization."

review/summary: My favorite sardine
review/text: The sardines in this two-layer can are half the size of those packed in one layer (obviously) and for whatever reason, I find them a lot tastier and more tender then the larger sardines. My local grocery sells them for around $3.50/can, which is not much more than tis deal. However... I buy mine in a certain big-box store when they come in four can packs for $8, which comes to only $2/can. At that price they're a pretty good deal. But even at $3/can they're not bad.

review/text: I really love the Mocafe frappes.  We always have between 6 and 7 flavors to make lots of smoothies, with or without fruit... I really don't like the vanilla much, though.  I was surprised it doesn't really have much of a vanilla flavor.  I taste mostly the powdered milk flavor.  I think the white chocolate is better and creamier and I use that one instead of vanilla. (Honeydew is by far my favorite flavor!  And do try the white chocolate with banana and peanut butter - mmmmm good!)

review/summary: BEST DARN TRAIL MIX EVER!!!
review/text: I am forever looking for a better trail mix mostly because they're all so calorie-heavy.  The other day i was looking for a healthy option and found this.  Against what i thought would be my better judgement, i bought it.  To my delight, the calories were not outrageous and there was still enough to stave off an angry growing hunger for a good hour.  To add to the delight, it had pistachios, which i have adored the taste of since i was a small girl (who else ordered pistachio ice cream???).  It also had just the right amount of both sweet and salty!  Finally, i have been successfully participating in a popular weight loss program for about 6 months.  I found that this little gem was only 5 pts--a pretty reasonable and highly nutritious snack on a "work out day".  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  Thanks Mareblu!!

The photos also do not accurately portray the amount of sticks/stems that are in the teas. Once you get past the looks, you will still be disappointed by the taste. The 2 that I tried have a grassy/earthy taste, and do not taste like any other white tea that I have had before. I only took a few sips and threw the rest away. Please save your money and buy from somewhere else. Such as teavanna. they might be more expensive but i have been impressed with every tea that i have bought from them.

review/text: I purchased this and the organic green tea sampler to break in my Ingenuitea teapot (buy one of those now, btw). I'm not usually a big fan of white tea & bought this for my wife, but all 4 flavours are exceptionally good. I actually like the white tea sampler more than the green (which is also very good). It's amazing how many times you can infuse 3 tsp. of this tea. I've probably done it 6-7 times and the last cup was not weak at all. I probably could have done more, but wanted to try another flavour. Highly recommended.

An old friend of mine made bloody marys for me and some friends a year ago, and I've never bought any other mix since.<br /><br />Most mixes you need to add additional measurements of spices into the mixes even though they claim they don't need it, and this is the one mix I've ever gotten, (I live in Los Angeles, so trust me there are many mixes to try here), where you do not need to add ANYTHING ELSE!<br /><br />I wish it was easier to find on the shelves now a days since Ralphs has slowly faded it from their shelves. You can also buy the other varieties (original, the works, hot & spicy) if you would like to try those from peppers.com if it ever sells out on here!

review/text: I bought the garlic and the thyme with chili. I love them! I have them at work. They are the perfect after lunch snack when I have to work a late but I don't want to eat a full on meal.  They came quickly and with no problems at all! I will be buying again.

review/summary: A good idea...
review/text: Olives are GOOD for you and I was very intrigued by the packaging.  I would like to find some that NOT herbed or flavored... just nice, plain green olives... I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring.. but the olives themselves were good.  A few were extra soft, but I don't mind that.  Super convenient!

review/summary: Wish they would send them Overseas!!!
review/text: I'm a US Soldier currently deployed to Afghanistan.  I experienced these in a series of care packages from a group called Operation Gratitude.  They're the most tasty things I have ever received in a care package!  I ran around the whole camp, asking anybody else who received these if they didn't want them, so I could have them.  Now I'm trying to buy them on my own, but sadly, no business's seem to ship them to APO address's on their own.  I'm having to have my family buy them and send them to me.

review/summary: Slightly disappointing
review/text: Let me start off saying that i LOVE olives, especially green ones.  I will put away a jar of Mario's in one sitting.<br />These olives, since they are packed without the juice (just some oil on them in the pouch) just seem kinda dry, and they are really soft.  Almost mushy.  The flavor is good for sure, but i am not exactly won over by the firmness (or lack thereof)/texture, and actually i miss the juice.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to order these.  I was afraid of how they might taste.  But, I really wanted flower candy for a party.  So, I decided to give these a shot.  The pieces are a nice size, larger than a gummy bear.  And, the flavor is great.  They are rather addictive.  We used them in a dozen goody bags and still had half of the bag left.  This really is quality candy!

review/summary: Great summer themed candy
review/text: I have a candy dish at work, which I stock with a revolving supply of gummy candy.  I tried these out a few months back.  Bright colors, consistent shapes, and large size make these great theme candy I think.  they also have 5 different, distinct flavors, all of which are pretty tasty.<br /><br />The only real complaints I have about them are that all the flavors seem highly unnatural, which may not appeal to some people, and that the candy initially smelled strongly of chemicals, like some kind of industrial solvent maybe.  It didn't seem to affect the flavor of the individual candies significantly, but it was highly unnerving.

review/text: These are amazing! The best gummy candy we have tried. They are sooo soft, but let me note that these were too soft and chewy for my 4 year old, he choked a bit. So we saved these for adults and that was just fine by me. I can't distiguish all of the flavors, but my favorite is the light pink which is grapefruit. The candies are about the size of a quarter. Yum! The bag will be gone before you know it. If you are debating between these of the butterflies, these are the better choice.

review/summary: New & Next (and Wonderful)
review/text: These candies--all five pounds of them--are out of this world.  They are extremely soft, very easy to chew.  They are also the most translucent--the closest in appearance to plain water--of any gummy candy I've seen.  So the colors of these translucent candies are pale, pale aqua; pale, pale yellow; pale, faint red.  Beautiful and different from a traditional bunch of, say, gummy bears.  Another departure from the standard gummy bear, is that each of these pieces is roughly 1.5 to 2 times the size of a gummy bear--so they're nice and large, chunky, easy to pick up and hold.  The flavors are extremely pleasant, and very subtle.<br /><br />If you're ready for a change from your current gummy candy, give these a try.  I think you'll be delighted with their flavor, taste, and pretty forms.

review/summary: Yogurt Pretzels Not Worth Eating!
review/text: Have always purchased this item from WalMart. WalMart has decided to discontinue this item.  For what reason, who knows. We contacted Good Sense and they recommended various suppliers.  Amazon was one of them.  After receiving our order, we found the coating on pretzels was very light and a lot of pieces instead of full like we had been used to receiving when we bought from WalMart.  The taste was dull and not enjoyable to eat.  Either Amazon is buying seconds and not letting us know or Good Sense is sending seconds to Amazon and not letting them know.  We won't be buying these in the future from Amazon.  We'll try to find them in grocery stores or speciality stores.

review/summary: REALLY good -- almost addictive!
review/text: These are very very good -- comparable to the ones sold in my local upscale supermarket, and less expensive per pound, too.  I have to be careful and "parcel" these out into individual snack bags or I'll eat way too many!  They have a nice vanilla yogurt flavor, with just enough crunch and salt from the pretzel.<br /><br />The expiration date is far enough out (I purchased these in mid-August 2010; the expiration date is the end of June 2011) that I'll be able to finish these off before they expire, sometimes a concern when I purchase in quantity like this.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with these, and I'll likely purchase them again.

review/text: My bride likes caviar (and my home made blini) for her birthday.  Bemka's Ossetra is too expensive to eat often, but that speaks well of its quality.  But at under a hundred bucks an ounce, you can buy two ounces and eat it in big, greedy bites.<br /><br />I prepared it simply, on ice with all the usual accoutrements -- blini, cr&egrave;me fra�che, red onions, egg -- but went light on the accoutrements and heavy on the fish eggs.  And my bride's birthday-dinner-for-two was a huge success.  Ossetra has just the right combination of bite, saltiness and squishiness for a romantic dinner for two.<br /><br />Just don't forget the champagne.

review/summary: STUNNING cookies -- don't miss these!!!
review/text: These are absolutely exquisite cookies, with the richness of pure English shortbread plus the haunting spiciness of minced crystallized ginger.  The tartness of the ginger and the sweetness of the shortbread blend tantalizingly, leaving a light, captivating taste that lingers in your mouth after the last bite is gone.  Great with tea, with coffee, with an after-dinner drink, with a fruit dessert, or with your best ice cream.  I love them with milk, with a small dish of fresh berries, with after-dinner coffee and a small snifter of brandy, or alone just before bed.  Believe it or not, they even have a mild digestive effect that soothes unruly tummies.  We have them on Subscribe-and-Save but keep having to order extra each month because they disappear so fast.  Adored by guests, beloved by family members, and raved over by church group members when brought to a reception.  These are THE staple to have on hand for an elegant complement to desserts or beverages.  Twelve cookies to a package (four packages to an order), and, if you're anything like us, you'll treasure each one.

review/text: We went through at least a dozen samples of better quality dog food before we found one that our new dog would eat.  This lamb formula must be very palatable to dogs and the ingredient list is about as good as you can get.  The food is made in a family owned single plant in MN from US and New Zealand sources.  Note that Nutrisource revised their feeding guidelines and that many bags out there have the old, higher quantities.  For example, the old feeding guideline for a 50lb dog is about 3 cups, whereas the new one is 2 cups.  This further makes the food a good value, so keep that in mind when evaluating price against other brands.  The food is very nutrient-dense. Best of all, our dog loves it.

review/summary: Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers
review/text: I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was.  Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green.  Uh-oh, wrong product?  I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change.  My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend.  Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed.  Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points.  How sad.  I would have gladly paid more for my favorite.  The new blend is far inferior.  If you're a regular, have someone  brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers.  If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on "we listen to our customers" and more corporate-speak BS.

review/summary: Truly disappoiting. Product Changed. Not for the better!
review/text: We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness.  Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors.  Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.

review/text: Hard to rate considering it has NEVER SHOWED UP!  Company charged my credit card but after saying it would be here five days ago, it has not arrived and UPS ays they have not received it.  So have I been ripped off for $122 plus?

review/text: I was surprised when I found this deal.  I always have coffee in my house and it is sometimes hard to find the Caribou.  This 96 count is a great way to save on this coffee.
