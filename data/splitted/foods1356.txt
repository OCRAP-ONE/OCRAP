review/text: Light. Crunchy. Salty. I didn't like the vinegar ones AT ALL. BBQ is definitely my fave flavor. The consistency and texture is a little strange. But, all in all, I think these are a great substitute for regular potato chips.

review/text: I love these things!  Not only are they healthy, they're sooooooo good!  I love potato chips with flavor, and these have flavor that pops!  Original flavor has just the right amount of salt (and I like salt), and all the other flavors are just spot on too!  But check out the nutritional information --- compared to regular potato chips, these are like eating spinach!  And if you're like me and sometimes eat an entire bag, it's only 360 calories!

review/text: These chips are delicious and stay fresh for many days; however the problem with all low-fat potato or rice snacks is that they barely do fill you up. I'd suggest buying the 24 pack of the 0.8 ounce bags as you're paying around the same price per ounce.

review/summary: The best snack ever without the calories
review/text: I used to just buy these at the airport and Amazon has made them more affordable.  The smaller bags ensure I don't eat too much.  They are fresh and have enough of the seasoning on the chips.  The best flavors are the BBQ and Sour Cream and Onion to me.  My dad who is a potato chip fanatic loves the original and the Sour Cream and Onion.  I would suggest starting with the variety pack.  I think all of the flavors are fine but you will have a few favorites.  I figure if I can get my Dad who is always skeptical about my healthy snacks to eat it then even the most avid junk food people would like it too.<br /><br />You don't have to wonder where the seasonsings are.  Have you ever had a BBQ chip and wanted more of the flavor.  Well with these chips you won't have that problem.  They are satisfying and you cannot get a better price for these, especially if you put them on subscribe and save.

Since tasting my first Popchip I have serched everywhere trying to find them for sale.  I couldn't find them anywhere so I looked online and what do you know, I found them!  I had to order the Variety pack because the only flavors I thought they had were plain, BBQ, and Sour Cream & Onion.  Come to find out they have Chedder Cheese, Salt & Pepper,and Salt & Vinegar also.  They are all great but my favorite is the BBQ.

review/summary: Great Textures - 4 of 6 flavors are great
review/text: I've had popchips before from local delis and stores, but only ever had the BBQ and Sour Cream and Onion.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Salt and Pepper and the Cheddar flavors.  The plain flavor is exactly what is expected.  By itself it's mediocre, but with dips it's delicious.  I'm not a fan of the Sea Salt and Vinegar.  My friends enjoyed the flavor, but I didn't.  To be expected, it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />The texture of popchips are great.  They are light and crispy and a nice change from regular chips.<br /><br />Before buying the big box, I would recommend finding them locally and trying a bag to sample the flavors.  Many reviewers note the strong BBQ flavor (much like I didn't like the Salt and Vinegar).<br /><br />Packaging comes straight from popchips.  I had no issues with broken chips or crushed bags.

review/summary: BBQ Delicious!
review/text: It sound's cliche, but like most... skeptical on these chips, as far a taste goes.. and quality. Lays BBQ is a favorite, but the things are really greasy, they really don't put enough BBQ flavoring, and in general more unhealthy for you; and when I am playing Halo Reach, the last thing I need is greasy hands while playing an FPS. (snacking to avoid a meal)<br /><br />Every time I have tried a new brand/flavor of chips, it normally bites me in the ass. This one time was the exception. I took the plunge and ordered the 24 pack from amazon.<br /><br />WELL WORTH IT! No regrets. That's my tag line. Hehe.<br /><br />The bags for these chips, seem to be really high quality just like the taste. I guess it protects the chips better, so you get a bag full of whole chips, rather than crumbs, and there is no chance of stale chips?<br /><br />Well worth the money from my perspective. Of course got some family members to try them as well. All thumbs up from them. And my Diet conscious step-mom favored them for.. obvious reasons, calorie intake.<br /><br />Bottom line I loved em! My only regret really is the fact I can't buy them more often. :(

review/summary: A tasty low-fat chip
review/text: I'll admit, we like most of the baked potato "chips" in our household, though I'll also admit that few (if any) taste as good as traditional chips.  Since we eat a lot of chips, we try to alternate between the types, just to stay a little healthier.  We rate these as high as any of the reduced fat or baked types of chips.  I've tried all flavors, and would say that the only one that I didn't enjoy was the Salt & Vinegar flavor.  I LOVE this flavor in regular chips, but these do not represent the flavor well.  I don't know if it's the base ingredients in the chip, or the flavoring they use, but the result is not very pleasant.  All other flavors are great.

review/summary: Best "Chips" out there right now - but may lead to bad breath
review/text: Flavorful doesn't even begin to describe these chips; in some cases there is almost too much flavor. The BBQ flavor is my favorite, but after even eating just a few you can tell that you'll need to do some serious breath freshening before talking to anyone. These are clearly much healthier than potato chips but they are still crispy and salty enough to satisfy those cravings. We've put these out at several parties and they've been a big hit with everyone including people that didn't realize they were supposed to be a healthy alternative. Finally they are gluten free which is great since they do closely resemble a cracker and most crackers are jam packed with gluten.

review/text: Pop chips are really flavorful. I love all the flavors though barbeque, salt and vinegar, and the sour cream are the best tasting to me. These seem be similar to a very thin (and much better tasting) rice cake. Some of my friends say the original taste like Munchos brand potato chips. For the calorie content these are awesome. My only complaint about these is I wish you could mix and match instead of having to buy the 12 bags of one flavor or the 2 bags of each flavor. The price is not bad at all about what you would pay for a name brand bag of potato chips. I have bought these many times from amazon with no trouble and they package them very well.

review/text: These are by far the best tasting healthy chips I have come across.  One ounce servings are plenty because the chips have volume but are light.  Unlike certain other 'light' chips (cough-Baked Lays-cough!) there is plenty of flavoring coating each chip so you never wonder if you're eating, say, barbecue chips or plain ones.<br /><br />At current pricing, the twelve pack qualifies for free shipping, and the pricing is pretty reasonable.  These are hard to consistently find in local stores so if you want all the variety available, this is a great way to get it.

review/text: At my job we all bring in snacks and treats to share. Well, it was a bit of a pain lugging stuff in from home, on the subways and all. Someone had purchased the Popchips from a local drug store chain and we all LOVED-LOVED-LOVED them! Problem--a little pricey and they didn't carry all the varieties, and were out of stock at time. Since we are all trying to watch our weight as well, this product appealed to us very much! I said, I am going to check Amazon for that, and WA-LA!! Amazon carried it in a 12 pack of 6 assorted flavors!! It was a huge hit in the office! It arrived the day after I ordered it, and best of all--the price!! We were paying about $3/bag at the store, now it is just over $2. And if we sign up for automatic delivery we can get 15% off that! WOO-HOO!! We finished the 12 bags in record time--now the only question is--how often will we get them delivered? BTW --hands down Barbecue was the favorite flavor, though I must say I have a soft spot for the original!!

review/summary: Almost Perfect
review/text: The only reason why this isn't perfect is because they included original instead of another flavor. I personally do not see why anyone who eat non-flavored chips anymore, especially Pop Chips when all of their flavors are sooooo good. Besides that 1 grievance, these chips are light and taste great.

review/text: I cannot stay enough about Popchips! They are a great snack, low calorie & low fat but actually taste great! They are not greasy or make you feel like you've been eating junk food like other chips do. I personally enjoy the Original and Salt/Vinegar while others in the house prefer the BBQ, Sour Cream/Onion and the Cheese. On a sidenote, we have tried the Parmesan (available as a separate purchase) and were not fans AT ALL. I do wish they would offer the Jalapeno flavor online as we've purchased Jalapeno a few times at various stores.

review/summary: A little confused, and very disappointed
review/text: I purchased this product with very high hopes; a healthy, delicious snack in a variety of my favorite flavors. The reviews were absolutely astonishing, so I figured, what the heck.<br /><br />Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Every popchip I tried had a very faint taste and smell of being burnt. Most of the flavors and seasonings are so weak that they don't come close to masking the taste. The end result? They tasted like water with 1/4th as much flavoring added or coke with a tall glass full of melted ice.<br /><br />Worst of all, the taste of burnt potatoes only accumulated as I ate more chips. I could not bear many of these in one sitting, and I hate to waste.<br /><br />There is, however, 1 exception. Barbeque flavor. These had a strong enough flavor to almost completely mask the burnt taste, and actually be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, there was only 2 of those bags in this box (out of 12), so I still had 10 unbearable bags to consume.<br /><br />I sincerely wish this product was better, but there's clearly something wrong with their manufacturing process. Please don't be misguided by the shocking number of positive reviews.

review/text: This, along with at least 2-3 other flavors, depending on what's available, is now a regular purchase every 2 weeks for our office supply.  In our office of health nuts, I think everyone got sick of drinking plain old water.  Our President had the Skinny Water Crave Control Raspberry Pomegranate, and promptly came to the office the following Monday with the request to track it down and start ordering it for the entire office.  We narrowed down our flavor choices, and now order about 2-3 cases every other week because it goes by so quickly!<br /><br />The flavor is good, and it's not sugary or "candy" tasting at all.  Some of the flavors have a bit more flavor to them then I personally like, but the over-all office consensus is a positive thumbs up and seems to have earned a permanent place in our fridge!

review/text: These beans are the real deal if you're a British ex-pat like my hubby who needs a "beans on toast" or "beans, sausage and chips" fix. So much easier than begging Mum to pack a few tins in her case when she visits! However, be aware that Amazon ship these cans individually in a big box with air pillows for padding which means they roll and bang about. More than half of the dozen cans were badly dented. Still, everything's going to be happily eaten. Just would have preferred more care in the shipping. BTW, when you sign up for Amazon prime, you can get 12 tins shipped 2-day air with free shipping. (For us regulars, that's a fantastic deal!)

review/summary: A distinctly richer, cleaner taste
review/text: I just had Heinz Beans for the first time this morning, as part of a traditional "beans & fried egg on toast" breakfast, and I must say it lives up to the hype. I grew up eating Campbell's Pork & Beans, and in the grand scheme of things there isn't *that* much difference, but Heinz Beans does have a distinctly richer, cleaner taste than Campbell's. Without the extra salt and HFCS that you find in most canned beans, the tomato flavor really shines through.<br /><br />NOTE: Although I won't take away any stars for it (because a product review is supposed to be for THE PRODUCT), Amazon's shipping of this item does leave a lot to be desired: a much larger box than necessary, padded with standard pillow packing that was all popped by the time the shipment reached me. About half of the cans were dented, some quite badly.

Cook well, stirring continually until the beans lose any 'crunch'.<br />4. I like it to have more sauce than normal which is why I add the milk - it also gives the sauce a nice creamy taste.<br />5. Eat with good break - two or three slices, plain, no butter - use to dip.<br /><br />enjoy.

review/summary: I believe in a supreme bean
review/text: If you have seen Monty Python's "Party Political Broadcast", or marveled at Ann-Margret swimming in baked beans in the Rock Opera "Tommy", then you will have some idea of the importance of the baked bean in popular British culture.  It has long been a staple throughout the British Isles.  A "Full British (or Irish) Breakfast" has to include them, and beans on toast are a ubiquitous snack.<br /><br />There are many species of baked bean in tomato sauce but the undisputed supreme bean is the Heinz, as manufactured in the UK.  Here in the US, we have plenty of canned "Pork and Beans", but they are different.  They have pork fat added, for flavor, and are heavily sweetened, often with high-fructose corn syrup and/or molasses.  These Heinz beans do have some sugar but they do not have that distinctly sweet taste that their American cousins have.  Also, they are free of artificial additives.  And they certainly have no pork fat.  They are thus a healthier choice.  If you are used to the pork and excessive sweeteners, then these beans may taste somewhat bland at first but, if you persist, you will soon come to prefer the cleaner, lighter taste and will not want to go back.<br /><br />As they are imported from the UK, they tend to be more expensive than the native US canned beans.  In fact, some specialist stores stock them here, sometimes at prices slightly lower than Amazon is offering, although Super Saver Shipping and Subscribe & Save make them very competitive, and of course you have the convenience of home delivery.<br /><br />A bigger problem is packaging.  At the time of writing, Amazon has still not quite mastered the art of shipping canned goods.  They are packed too loosely and tend to knock together.  As a result, 3 of the 12 cans in my consignment had dents in them.  Small dents, to be sure, but I know that some people are reluctant to eat food from even slightly dented cans.  Hopefully, Amazon will solve this problem soon.

review/summary: Only a few cans dented
review/text: Just got my first shipment. Based on the warnings of other reviewers, before the shipment went out, I called up amazon customer support and read them the riot act concerning proper packaging. When the box arrived, the cans were NOT floating around freely in the box but rather were held tightly together with heavy duty plastic wrap and were inside a the little cardboard tray.<br /><br />When I opened the plastic I found that in spite of even this, some of the cans were still dented, only NOT as badly as some of the other british things I've ordered from amazon, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5X5S">Heinz Soup, Potato and Leek, 14.1-Ounce Can (Pack of 8)</a> soup, which has every time I've orderd it arrived dented so badly that it looked like kids had been playing kick the can with them. (On the up side, a call to Amazon customer support has resulted in them either refunding me, or sending me another shipment -- which genearlly arrived almost as badly dented as the first; I just can't seem to convince Amazon that you can't just toss canned goods that are not bound together in some way into a box with a little bubble wrap and think that the cans won't slam into each other and dent each other during shipment.<br /><br />I would say of the 12 cans of the baked beans, 5 were dented enough that I put them to the side for quicker consumption (dented cans can result in botulism -- a deadly toxin, the same stuff they make botox out of, only in this case it'll kill you, not make you look younger ---growing inside the can over time, and must be eaten quickly)<br /><br />The rest of the cans however were just fine.<br /><br />Edit: April '09, I just noticed a NEW feature on Amazon's page where you check the status of your shipments. There is now a specific link for complaining about bad packing that resulted in a damaged product. YAY! They're listening!

review/summary: I love Amazon! Where else can you find items like this online?
review/text: Having moved from Australia, where baked beans are in a tomato sauce base, my children were upset to discover that nearly every brand of baked beans on the US market had large amounts of brown sugar added. They did not like the sweet taste and this meant one less source of protein in their diets (which are terrible to begin with). I drove to every supermarket in a ten mile radius looking for Heinz baked beans and only found their "vegetarian" variety, which surprisingly, contains brown sugar (guess you gotta go with the flow?). Anyway, I'd pretty much given up on finding Heinz baked beans with the tomato sauce, until... after googling them, I found them on Amazon. Wow! I had no idea that Amazon sold groceries! Anyway, a dozen cans arrived in a tight plastic wrap, so no damage to the cans (not that it's a problem, just noted others reviews that cans were bashing around in the box). Have to say, I LOVE Amazon. I got these delivered to my door. No more wasting time trying to find them!! Awesome!

review/text: I love real (i.e., English) Heinz baked beans.  However I have to give these a low rating here becuase I just received a case of 12 cans and they were so badly packed they were rattling around in the box.  When I opened the box, 5 of the cans were so badly dented and I will have to throw them away.  One of them was leaking.  I know I could return them but that is too much trouble for $10 worth of baked beans.  I can't find anywhere else on the Amazon site for leaving this kind of feedback for the seller/packer, so I'm leaving it here.<br /><br />I will still love the other 7 undented cans.

review/summary: Heinz Beans
review/text: How come is it that the American company Heinz is unable to make these beans here in America.  I have an English wife and her family has asked me that for years.  We put men on the moon but can't make beans.  Yeah Bush's beans are good but like anything, one product does not go in all meals.  Make a shepherds pie with Bush Beans and it will be the last time you make that mistake!  Same with beans on toast, nothing but Heinz Baked Beans for those to be eatable!!!

review/text: Was very glad to find these on here, especially with the subscribe and save option. I used to have to make a special trip to a local market that sold these for a reasonable price, but it was the ONLY thing I ever needed from there. There was no damage to the cans when I received the package and the quality of the beans were outstanding. If you're on the fence about ordering this, go ahead!!

review/summary: Heinz Baked Beans
review/text: I was delighted to find these Heinz Baked Beans available on Subscribe & Save.  Having moved to the US in the last two years, I was surprised to find that Heinz Baked Beans were not readily available for purchase in supermarkets without being mixed with frankfurters (yech).  The nearest equivalent was the Heinz vegetarian beans, but the taste was not the same.  Moreover, the price in the supermarket is ridiculous.  The price on Subscribe & Save is a little high, but at least I can get the product I want

review/summary: Perfect beans - perfect packaging!
review/text: This is the first time I have ordered canned groceries from Amazon and having read some of the reviews about the less than satisfactory packaging, I was a little concerned what condition my order would arrive in.  However, the price for these beans is a little lower than our local store, shipping was free with Amazon prime and it is easier to lift a 12 pack of beans off my doorstep than in and out of my cart, then from cart to car and car to kitchen, so I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />I placed my order on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend and was promised delivery by Thursday.  I then received an email on the Monday saying my order had been shipped and updating delivery prediction to Wednesday.  So I was very happy to find my delivery on my doorstep this lunch time (Tuesday) - very impressive for a holiday weekend order!<br /><br />With a little trepidation, I opened up the package, fully expecting at least a few dented cans.  But I was very pleasantly surprised - they were packaged in a cardboard tray, then wrapped tightly in plastic and surrounded by plastic 'pillows'.  Not a single can was dented so I will definitely order again.<br /><br />Oh, and as for the beans themselves?  What can I say, I am British and was practically weaned on Heinz Baked Beans!  They are pretty much our family's only 'must-have' since we have lived in the US - a real taste of home.  We eat them on toast, with a cooked breakfast, with pies, quiches, practically anything!

review/text: This is the real deal, English baked beans.  I married a Brit so I spend a lot of time in England and became addicted to THESE beans.  USA has nothing like them. I don't know if it is the simplicity of the sauce but I love them. This is cheaper than the local grocery store, if you can find them.  I have never had a dented case.  I noticed a lot of reviews stating that was a problem but I never once had a dented can and I am on auto ship, which means... a lot of cans (tins to the Brits) of beans.

review/summary: Heinz Beans - The Best By Far
review/text: I moved to the US from the UK almost 18 years ago and for a long time went without my beans on toast; that was until British stores popped up here and there but a 40 mile each way drive was not in the cards for me, not even for beans.  I then found a place about 12 miles away, but they charged the earth for them, then I found amazon carried them.  Ever since then I have them on a standing order for a case every 6 weeks.  I love my beans and for those of you not used to these, an excellent source of fiber, cheap meal addition, versatile, etc. LOVE EM.

They are much more expensive in grocery stores (if you can find them).<br /><br />I ordered once before and the cans were loose in the box.

I would rate this product as a good buy, and the new shipping method makes this an exceptional purchase.

review/summary: every single can arrived dented - twice.
review/text: Growing up in the UK I was really excited to be able to get the original for beans on toast.  I set up a subscription assuming I'd be eating a lot!<br /><br />The first batch came, and even though the box they were packed in was undamaged, every single can was dented.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited for the second batch, as I really love these beans.  Unfortunately, it was a repeat and I have now cancelled my subscription.  A big disappointment.<br /><br />I suspect they are selling cans that can't be placed on shelves in the stores and using this as a means to clear their damaged stock.<br /><br />Edit: March 2010.  A friend convinced me to retry this purchase, and me being the fan of baked beans that I am I did.  Very pleased to report that the packaging issues have been resolved.  I'm now a regular subscriber and cans arrive in shop shelf condition.  Upgrading my original 1 star to a 4.

review/text: I searched diligently in Tucson and found a can of these British Heinz Beanz.  Although good, both my son and I agree they are VERY similar to Van Camp's Pork and Beans, available quite inexpensively (I prefer Van Camp's over Campbell's for some reason, can't remember why, though).  Heinz', of course, don't have the little dollop of pork fat in the can, but if that doesn't bother you, you might be disappointed if you order these (and receive them in heavily dented cans as many people have reported on this site).

This was wrapped well in bubble wrap and there were air pillows in the box too (one of them had popped). Three of the cans on one side of the pack each had a small dent, but I felt that the seller had done everything possible to prevent damage, and this was just unfortunate. Perhaps there could have been more pillows. The rest of the cans are in perfect condition. I will just eat the three dented ones first, no big deal. I am grateful to have found such a good deal!

This sweet beans in tomato sauce are perfect also with eggs and sausages, a slightly cooked tomato also fits very well. You can have a full english breakfast or lunch prepared in a snap with this. The taste is quite good in my opinion, but if in doubt, try to get one can from a local store and then buy them for less in amazon.

review/text: For the longest time I have searched NC for some plain canned beans.. &lt;desperation> just plain beans maaan! (or what they call Vegetarian beans over here), what I found turned out to be like the worst kind of baked beans (non-Heinz) that you might get in London - too sweet and overcooked.. but I accepted my fate and munched away.<br /><br />Then on a whim I did a search on Amazon and found these beauties, these beans *ARE* the same recipe as the ones we have in England, however the cans are slightly smaller (390g as opposed to 415g).<br /><br />They arrived quite promptly (UPS) in their own shrink-wrapped pallet (not loose), some cans have *very minor* dents such as those you find in the store but in my case at least the dent issue is only mentioned here because some others who reviewed seemed to make an overly big issue of it.<br /><br />With subscription the shipping is "free" but it still feels a little expensive for what is essentially a non-gourmet food, however Amazon seems to be offering the best price all-in-all (free shipping considered).<br /><br />No complaints so far!

review/text: Very excited to find this product.  Item was packed well, wrapped as a case inside a fitting box.  Unfortunately, 8 of the 12 cans were very dented.  There was no apparent damage to the box in which it was shipped leading me to believe it was packed that way.  Damage to the cans were random throughout the case not just the outside.  But alas, I have toast waiting...
