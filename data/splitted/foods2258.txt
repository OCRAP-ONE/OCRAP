review/summary: mmmmmm tulleys!
review/text: My favorite out of all the k-cups! We fell in love with the kuerig in our sunday school class simply for its convenience unfortunately though I honestly am a major coffee lover and somewhat of a coffee snob so when we traded our aeropress (which I recommend 100%, I just want something faster these days)I had a hard time finding a k-cup that was bold enough for me-if you like dark french roasts, you know what Im talking about, well to this day, Ive tried many different k-cups, I even have the eco cup where you can put your own coffee in and nothing matches tulleys french roast...the only one that I would drink besides it is jet fuel but its def still not numero uno like tulleys!

review/text: Tully's French Roast is a solid choice and one of my staples.  This is my favorite French Roast currently available in a K-cup.  Maybe someday Peets will come in a K-cup, sigh.  One trick if you find it isn't as rich as you normally get in your favorite bistro, is to make a smaller size portion.

review/text: I need to say I absolutely love my Kuerig brewing system. French Roast is one my favorite types of roast. I don't want to sound biased, but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast, but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong, extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

review/summary: Great Tasting and affordable
review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!

I love how it is very nutrient dense and holds me over for hours.  It is somewhat bland with a nice hint of cinnamon, but I don't like things that are overly sweet.  I just wish it came in a larger package and wasn't so expensive.  I have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup with each serving, but it didn't last me more than about 8 days =/

review/summary: Great bang for the buck, and good flavor as well!
review/text: I buy this at my local Whole Foods, and it costs just under $8 there. I've had a few raw cereals before this one, but as long as I drink water while eating this cereal(I have almond milk mixed in with the cereal, but I think it helps to drink water with it as well)  this is the only one I've had that lasts more than 3 servings for me and the flavor is better than some of the regular cereal as well!<br /><br />This cereal is still a bit more pricy than I'd like, but for 5 servings,  it's the best price I've seen so far for cereal as healthy as this that doesn't taste like cardboard. The only other thing I don't care for with this, is the fact that there isn't a zipper to keep the cereal fresher longer, and the critters away from it. Since those aren't issues that relate so much to the product as the packaging for me, I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Great for Special Diets
review/text: This cereal is a great choice for those on special diets since it is gluten-free and low sugar.  It also contains enough calories to fill me up until lunch which is rare for any cereal much less a healthy one.  It tastes well enough to repeat purchase although I suspect the flavor is much improved by vanilla almond milk.  It is relatively expensive but worth it for those of us with very limited options.  I will continue to purchase this cereal.

review/summary: Great for special diets
review/text: Great if you are on a grain-free, sweetener-free, fruit-free diet. I can use some unusual sweeteners, like yacon syrup, so I sweeten it with that. Or I just have it plain, with almond milk or some such. Plus, it's organic! Flavor is okay, pretty bland. Cinnamon is always better with a sweetener. One thing I like about it is it's crunchy! I have eaten at least six bags of it and I am buying more.

review/summary: Very excellent
review/text: Unlike most hot sauces Matouk's West Indian has a papaya base.  (Oddly enough it does not taste at all like papaya.) This makes the sauce much less acidic, and less vinegary.  However, the sauce still packs a punch of hotness.  This sauce is excellent on quiche, scrambled eggs, baked chicken, rice, fish, pork, hamburgers, or steak.  I also use it in chili; it gives the chili a nice heat and flavor without adding the acidic hot pepper taste.  We have been using this sauce in our house for over three decades and would be hard pressed to replace it with another.  If you are looking for a hot sauce that is hot, unique and has multiple uses Matouk's will do the trick.

review/text: I've been a fan of hot sauces for 35 years, I've tried a lot of sauces and enjoyed many.  Matouk's West Indian Hot Sauce was one of the first I tried, and it's still one of my top 3 favorites.  It's not as hot as some of the current, insane, extract-based nonsense, but Matouk's is plenty hot, ans tastes so much better.  The habanero in a papaya base has a bright, fruity flavor and a tasty burn.  It is great in egg salad or on grilled chicken and it's unbelievable on a ham sandwich.  I really like to add a bit to a bowl of soup, or add it to rice or pasta for a spicy side dish.

The flavour is excellent but be warned if you think Frank's Red Hot is actually hot or if your fridge doesn't contain things like Blair's Death Sauce, Dave's Insanity or El Yucatel Habanero sauce use this one sparingly until you determine your tolerance, it is hot.

If you are looking for just heat to impress your friends this is not the sauce for you - try one of the gimmicky Dave's sauces for that.  But if you want heat with a unique flavor, nobody does it better than the Trinis.

review/summary: An Excellent Mayo Alternative
review/text: In my attempt to find a vegan alternative to mayonaise, I ran across this product.  I also read about it in The Starch Solution as it was recommended by the author who is also a physician.  The ingredients are all things that I can recogonize, so that's a huge plus for me.  As far as taste goes... It's not bad, actually, it's quite good.  I'm a vegan who isn't big on soy products and tries to shy away from most of them.  When possible, I'll almost always go for the non-soy alternative.  However, that being said, I'm glad that I gave this product a go, because it is now my mayo replacement.  I'll have no problems using this as a mayo replacement in the kitchen.  The texture is smooth, just like mayo, and the smell is very mayo-like.<br /><br />There's only one issue with Nayonaise that people may not like, and that's the consistency.  It is a little bit more on the liquid state than regular mayo, not much, but a little.  I guess that can be good or bad depending on your use.  It's not a factor for me though.  At 14oz, the jar does seem a little on the small size for what you're paying, so you might want to consider buying an extra jar of it, or look at the 24oz size.

review/summary: My Cat Went BERSERK When I Opened These
review/text: Our cat is pretty picky.  He eats a raw handmade dinner at night and a high quality dry food with water in the morning.  He is an outdoor cat.  When I get something new to give him, he often will look at me partially interested and then take a sniff or a lick and want to go outside.<br /><br />When our cat is hot, he often is not very interested in food.  He flops down and complains all day when it is hot, but does not like much of anything- food included.  The day I got my package of these treats in the mail, our cat was flopping underneath some planters on the porch.  He was not overly interested in me when I came out the door, other than to give me a tiny "Mew" to let me know he was there.<br /><br />I walked over to him with the box of sealed treats and told him I had a treat for him.  He began to sniff the air.  He almost never does that- especially with a sealed bag in a box!  I opened the box and then struggled with the bag as the peel off top which leads to a zip lock back inside did not come complete off.  The cat jumped on my leg and began to help me open the bag.  Clearly he was interested.<br /><br />Then I finally managed to get the bag open, and I broke one of the thick cakes of treat in half and held it up to him.  He leaped in the air and grabbed it with his paws like hands, and forced it on the ground where he held it in place with both hands and claws.  He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.  He jumped in the air and begged until he got the cake from me.  He did things he rarely does when I offer him anything to eat.  Then he polished off that too.  When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.  I rarely see him get this excited over any food item except his homemade dinner at night.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  I am thinking these will be a regular feature at our house from this point on!

review/summary: Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?
review/text: That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions "Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients..."  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.

review/summary: 4 Out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: OK, I have to say this is an expensive doggie treat, but my dogs practically steamroll one another to get to the treats. The circular disks of freeze dried chicken are rather big- bigger than a silver dollar and more than a half inch thick. They are very light because of the nature of the treat, and the dogs practically inhale them despite their size. I have 4 dogs and one is somewhat picky, but they all love these treats.<br /><br />There are under 20 treats in the package, so for $10-13 per package and with 4 dogs, they get about 4 treats a piece per package. And since these are treats, not bones, they don't last very long. I think these might be the "Doggie Christmas Stocking" type treat for special occasions, not an everyday treat due to the expense. But nonetheless, the dogs LOVE them!<br /><br />**4 stars due to price, but product gets 5 stars!

review/summary: Strange stuff, but the finicky cat likes it.
review/text: I don't know what I was expecting with these, but I guess I was thinking the "bites" would be cat-sized, not Great Dane-sized. The "bites" are about 1.75" in diameter and look like miniature hamburger patties. They are very light weight and are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />We've got two cats, the finicky one, and the one who will eat anything.<br /><br />After breaking one piece into about 5 smaller chunks, I gave a chunk to each cat and was pleasantly surprised to see them both eating them, and actually chewing - they usually inhale smaller treats, so it's nice to see them actually put their teeth to use!<br /><br />I'll definitely continue to purchase these, as it's tough for me to find anything the finicky cat will eat, I just wish they came in a smaller size.<br /><br />I've added some images of the product so you can actually see what you are getting. This 4-ounce package contained about 18 pieces.

review/summary: Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs
review/text: Another reviewer said these looked like "hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say "Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight."  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />"Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food."<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />"Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience."<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: We have 3 cats and 2 will eat almost any treat, but one is very picky. It was around noon, so my one cat was  in the kitchen, looking for "lunch". I had just fed them an hour earlier, so there was no way I was opening another can of food.  I thought this would be a good time to try out the New Raw Boost Bites.<br />I took one of the pieces (they are quite big and look like a bite-size cookie) and broke it into smaller sizes. For dogs, I imagine you would not have to do this.<br />Well, they gobbled it right up! I had to break apart another for them right away. Then satisfied, they forget all about lunch and went to go relax. I guess these are a satisfying enough treat to tide them over until dinner.<br />Knowing these are not only tasty (at least from watching them eat them) but also good for them makes me feel good about feeding them to my cats.  You get about 18 in a pack, so I will be saving them for rewards or special treats.

review/summary: Strange treat
review/text: This was listed as a cat treat. On the package it is stated to be for cats and dogs. I got them for my cats and thought it strange that the treat itself was the size of an oreo cookie. It is kind of crumbly like a stale cookie, but filled with real ingrediants like chicken and turkey. I had to crumble it into bite size pieces for my cats. They did eat it, but were less than enthusiastic. They prefer Temptations treats apparently. This would probably work better as a treat for dogs.

review/text: I have used this brand for my cats and they have liked it (different flavors of wet food including rabbit and duck). When it comes to treats, my two cats tend to have different taste. I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.

review/summary: Our Dogs Love Them
review/text: We have two dogs, a chihuahua and a beagle.  Both of them love the Boost Bites Treats.  As soon as they see the bag, they come running for their "cookie".  The treats are shaped like little cookies and are light brown in color so they actually look like gingersnaps.<br />The nutrition data and info on the label is impressive regarding how these treats can help your dog's digestion and provide other health benefits.  That's always nice to know - that you're giving your furry babies something that they love and it's good for them as well.  The treats are pretty soft so easy to chew for both dogs although I have to break up the one that the chihuahua gets - the cookie is a bit too big for her mouth.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful product to pamper a beloved pet.

review/summary: Probably better for cats and small dogs
review/text: For those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet, these bites may something you could use for treats.<br /><br />There's nothing artificial in the ingredients. As listed on the box: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove.<br /><br />This treat is labeled for dogs and cats but I have large dogs (80+ pound Labs) and these treats were finished in less than 5 seconds. For large dogs, I think this may work out better as a training treat - they are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />There are 18 in a package, about the size of a silver dollar, and about 1/2 inch thick. They have the  consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my Labs.  All loved it but for the size of my dogs, it's an expensive treat.

review/text: I have a box of Milk Bone flavor snacks, a box of Beneful Baked Delights and one of Raw Boost Bites, lets see how they stack up with the first few ingredients.<br /><br />Milk Bone: Wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat and bone meal, poultry by-products, beef fat, wheat germ, salt---and then a list of ingredients that no one can pronounce.<br /><br />Beneful: Wheat flour, ground corn, glycerin, sugar, corn gluten, water, chicken by-product, preserved animal fat----and then to the food color dye etc...<br /><br />Raw Boost:  Chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkin seed, apples, carrots, butternut squash, flax-seed, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, vinegar, parsley, salmon oil, citric acid, rosemary, blueberries etc.  No food color, preservatives that are difficult to pronounce.  They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their "goodies"----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive freeze dried pet treats
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet
review/text: NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka "Boost Bites") provides a little treat for my cat, that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice, chicken meal, corn meal, animal fat, animal liver, malt, artificial flavors, brewers yeast, and a chemistry lab of various preservatives, and artificial colors.<br /><br /> Compare that to the RAW ingrediants of BOOST BITES: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey liver and heart, Pumpkin Seeds, Apples, Carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseed, clay (for natural vitamins), broccoli, lettuce, spinach, kelp, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, Vitamin E, Rosemary, blueberries, Alfalfa sprouts, permissons, sage, and clove.<br /><br />The BOOST BITES are a RAW FOOD. For years I've been eating a raw food diet for dinner, consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor, consisting of various raw grains, dried fruit, and unbaked seeds and nuts, soaked in soy milk. The concept behind raw foods, is that cooking destroys the enzymes in food, as well as many vitamins, which our body requires. If I'm going to eat a raw diet for my health, I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us, and i'm NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do, and our pets are healthier with them. If I didnt believe in the health benefits of raw food, I wouldnt spend the extra money for Muesli.<br /><br />Needless to say, a raw food diet means nothing to my cat. He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact, I gave him a taste test, placing a bit of BOOST BITES, next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites, and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too, when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store, but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food, my cat's recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good, and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander, that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat, is a happy cat owner.

review/summary: Three cats said Neooooooow
review/text: I sure liked the ingredients, the description and even the smell of these treats. But my three cats weren't even intrigued enough to taste them, so regretfully they have given these treats one star. The treats are really large and probably more suitable for a dog. Of course, I broke the treats up into manageable sizes for cats, still no luck. Well, cats are known to be finicky and mine are no exception. One day they love something and the next day they could not care less. I will give the remainder of these treats to my daughter who has three dogs and will update my review if, in fact, they shed a different light on Raw Boost Bites.

review/summary: A big hit with my two 3-year old felines. And a Google check okays its fat content
review/text: Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer's warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says "crude fat (min.) 34.0%"--, I went online and found a link to a National Research Council site titled "Your Cat's Nutritional Needs: A Science Based Guide for Pet Owners"  which appears to be the work of a cadre of science professors from about a dozen universities.  They say:<br /><br /> "The maximum amount of fat in the cat's diet can be reasonably high without any<br />known adverse effects. In many cat foods, 50% or more of the energy comes from<br />fat. Studies indicate that cat foods containing even higher amounts of fat are safe.<br />At a minimum, cat foods should have a fat content of about 9% of dry matter."<br /><br />Which is a relief, considering how much my two three-year-old cats, Purrcilla and B.J. Honeycatt, seem to love this stuff.<br /><br /> I think this is the first pet treat I've ever seen that is labeled as being for both dogs and cats.  The size of these dry treats--there are about a dozen and a half of them in this 4 oz. bag-inside-a-box, each about the size of a half inch high stack of silver dollars--is  more dog friendly than cat friendly, but the discs break in two easily; Once a day I crumble and split half a disc between their two bowls as a topper for their wet food...or sometimes instead, use it as a bedtime treat. So for two cats I estimate getting about a month's worth out of this package.<br /><br />I've bookmarked the site mentioned above for future reference (too bad Amazon doesn't allow us to link to outside sites in our reviews).

I try to get the best food for my pets (I pay $50 for a bag of blue buffalo for the dog) but ,to be honest ,I don't think I could justify over $40 for a pound of treats, good tasting and healthy or not.If YOU can these would be a good choice.

review/summary: Dog Liked It
review/text: What can I say?  The dog liked it - I certainly didn't taste it.  He didn't gobble it down at first since it was something new so let me describe it....<br /><br />I handed it to him and, after a few cautious and tentative sniffs he took it from my hand and took it over to his favorite spot.  He set it on the ground, licked it a few times to roll it over and sniff the other side - this went on a couple of times and humorous to watch.  From there, he was like a little kid and took a small sample bite to give it a try.  After a few tentative chews and a reluctant swallow, he looked up to see if it was ok to proceed.<br /><br />Proceed he did, as he crunched away at the remainder of the treat and, after a satisfactorily smack of the lips he ran over to beg for another (which he didn't get).  I do like the fact there is a lot of meat products vs. garbage in the Made in the USA treat!

review/summary: they don't last long....
review/text: Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.<br /><br />That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.

review/summary: Feline hits and misses...
review/text: Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats by Nature's Variety, 4-Ounce Package<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />They're oddly-shaped, greyish-beige, roughly circular pucks about the size of a modern dollar piece around and maybe half an inch thick, that look so thoroughly unappetizing that I immediately gave up all thought of trying a piece of one and reporting on the taste for the sake of art. One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />"Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes. I'll submit to your petting me while I eat it (Stay away from the neck!) and maybe, I say *maybe* afterwards if you have a supply of these and can provide me with more of them.<br /><br />[more chewing} You know, I never liked you, not really, not before, but now I see you're really not so bad a fellow after all..."<br /><br />So there it is. A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, "come when I say your name" and "hiss at someone else."<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, "Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you, but I still want to feed this to your dog."<br /><br />More about that after I get some time to screw up my courage.

But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it...

review/text: We have 2 old Indoor Tabby cats about 12 years old who will eat ANYTHING and are 20 & 22 pounds. These monsters are still a terror that is fitting for their names of Lucy & Ethel...But I have to crush these up into crumbly pieces small enough for them to sample. First time they both LOVED it. Then Lucy threw it up and she has only thrown up 1 or 2 times in 12 years. Ethel throws up a few times ever week but did fine. From that time on however, they BOTH simply refused ever trying this food treat. So off we go to the neighbors & friends at work. 2 other families had the problem that NONE of the 6 other cats we tried would even try a sample of this food. We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?

review/text: My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from "minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients."  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.

review/summary: Finicky Cat Purrs While Eating
review/text: Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken compares favorable with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OUXHO">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Salmon & Chicken Dinner for Cats, 12oz</a> which my older cat really enjoys.<br /><br />As both foods are freeze-dried, they both need reconstitution--I heat some water, place some of the food in a shallow dish and pour the water over the food.  I wait a few minutes, allowing the food to get soft, drain the water and then place in the cat dish.  Its a great "hot" food alternative for the cat who is too finicky to eat other types of raw food.<br /><br />Nature's Variety is easier to portion.  Each chunk of food comes as a disk around the size of a fifty-cent piece with about half an inch of thickness.  Once softened, I have cut this a bit with a fork, but for the most part, my cat likes it so much she moves it off her plate to attack it whole.  The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.  Nature's Variety's size makes this easier to manage and will result in less waste.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, makes for a seemingly delicious entree item for my very picky cat who purrs while she eats it.  Easy to portion out and reconstitute, it makes for a raw treat to "serve" on top of kibble or just alone.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies.

review/summary: A nice, bite sized snack
review/text: All three hounds ate these quite enthusiastically. They're made in the USA, and have a lengthy list of ingredients that all appear to be healthy, a good mix of protein fat and fiber. I lopped one star off my review, as ~$40 a pound is rather steep for a dog snack.

review/summary: Delicacy for my dogs
review/text: One of our dogs is extremely picky when it comes to food and treats. Sometimes he just sniffs and then turns away, obviously disgusted. Sometimes he'd take the treat in his mouth and then moves his head down so the treat just falls out of his open mouth on the floor. Then he walks away... He is an awesome dog but quite the character.<br />However, these treats are a big hit for both of our dogs..!! They aboslutely love this healthy delicacy. They are a bit on the pricey side but I will order them as a special treat for them once in a while. Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Treat For Dogs!  VERY EXPENSIVE!!
review/text: My dog loves these treats!  They are a good all natural product which I have no issues or concerns with giving it to my dog.  I feed my dog Wellness Core because he cannot eat grains due to skin allergies.  So to find a good quality grain free treat that my dog likes is great.  I break the treats into 4 pieces because of the cost.  Four ounces for almost 11 dollars is quite costly.  That means these treats are 44 dollars a pound!! I won't be buying much of these treat very often because of the cost.  Sorry Natural Instinct....you have a great product line but 44 dollars a pound is ridiculous!  This isn't filet mingnon people! Five stars for quality 1 star for price = 3 Stars overall.

review/summary: My dogs love it
review/text: I have two dogs at home, and my sister has another. One of my Pomeranians is extremely picky which makes it difficult to purchase treats or even foods that he isn't already familiar with, because it's more likely than not that he will reject whatever I get him. Imagine my surprise when my dog loved this treat! He always runs to the kitchen when he senses I'm getting a treat for him, and he actually jumps up and down when he sees that I have these.<br /><br />My other dog is sixteen and has no teeth, so unfortunately these are too hard for him, but I try to break of very small pieces for him so he's able to get a taste. My sister's dog will eat everything so no surprise that he likes these too.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I think that given how much the dogs love these, and the fact that I have small dogs so these can last for a little while, makes them a worthwhile purchase when I'm out.

review/summary: A hung jury amongst the kitties results in a mistrial
review/text: We have four cats.  Two of them went crazy over these treats and fought with each other to claim every last bit of the treat.  A third one tried them once and never could be induced to try them again, and the fourth refused to have anything to do with them.  Every other cat treat we have brought into the house has always been greeted with unamimous enthusiasm, so I don't really know what to think of this.  Your mileage may vary; for my part, if I am going to pay this kind of money for a cat treat, I want something I know everyone is going to like.

review/summary: A Favorite Treat
review/text: Our dog loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q7YFLQ">Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, 4-Ounce Package</a>, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is working on training their dog. The ingredients are healthy, and apparently it is quite tasty.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, because the treats are a little larger than I would like. Of course, you can just break them in pieces to make great rewards. They crumble a bit, but those crumbs still work! Our dog still hasn't got all of the commands down, but at least she looked forward to the training.

review/summary: Don't let the large size put you off.....
review/text: These were recommended as suitable for cats, but when I received them, they appeared to be far too large for my kids, so I tried them on the dogs of a few acquaintances, and they absolutely loved them(and now love me)! I realized that these are easily broken up into smaller pieces, so I tossed some bits in the kitties' dishes, and they also clamored for more, unlike most "cat treats". I'd say give them a try!

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I like that these are healthy, pure freeze-dried chicken that I can feed my dogs. My dogs go nuts for them. The treats are too big to give my dogs a whole one but that's okay because they break up very easily. I break them into fourths and give them a fourth at a time.

review/summary: Great ingredients, but cats can be finicky
review/text: What I find attractive about this product is that the right combination of protein, fat and fiber for your pet. The ingredients read like a list of actual recognizable foods such as plants and animals that you would actually buy in the supermarket rather than a long list of artificial ingredients you would never use in a recipe. Aside from one mineral and one natural preservative, the are things I'd gladly eat myself.<br /><br />The down side of the product is that my cats wouldn't eat it. In fairness, cats can be finicky, and of the three cat treats I have in my house, one cat won't eat any of them. The other likes just one. Obviously I wouldn't buy them, but it's well worth a try especially if you have dogs. If your pet does end up liking them, you can feel good knowing that they are getting real food that a chef might have come up with for their health, rather than something that a laboratory invented.

review/summary: Raw Healthy Freeze dried snack ...but so expensive
review/text: Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.<br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I've always known that cats need more protein than dogs.<br />Granted this is just a treat but I would think that is why few treats and designed<br />for dogs/cats. I was shocked to realize at the current price these treat cost over $43 per pound.<br />Why not save money and buy your pets Filet mignon or the finest wild Alaskan Salmon.<br />I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get my point. You could buy a food dehydrator<br />and make your own beef or chicken treats for your pet.

review/summary: Like the concept
review/text: I really like the concept of this brand. In fact, I was quite thrilled reading all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The biscuits are dry and a bit on the hard side, but despite being a bit older, my dog ate any that were proffered to him. The crunchy bits are probably good for cleaning his teeth. He's a 10+ year old 80lb Doberman-Weimaraner mix and not a picky eater, but he wasn't overly excited when offered the treats. Maybe he was just wary of the new food. He seemed relatively pleased after the first taste because he begged for another. However, later that night he had a bit of an upset stomach and had to go out more than once.<br /><br />I know that dogs may typically have a range of upsetting digestive reactions to new foods. I'd advise only offering one or two treats until their digestive system has a chance to adjust.<br /><br />I think I'm going to give it a few more days to see if he adjusts and still can happily enjoy the treats because I'd much rather give him these than the fake bacon garbage.

review/summary: My 3 dogs loved these
review/text: I have a bullmastiff, Rottweiler, and shih tzu who looooved these. Not many come in the bag so if you have big dogs they might not be worth it to spend money on, but I broke these into quarters for my shih tzu. Due to so many pet food and treat recalls over the last couple years I am wary about many things I feed my pets. These being made in the U.S. made me more comfortable than some things made in China. I will stock these for my small dog but at the price they are now I won't buy them for my large dogs.

review/summary: Neighbor's cat don't like it
review/text: Well, we do not have cats of our own, but our neighbor's cat frequently visits us. I thought it would be nice to feed her something wholesome, organic and healthy from time to time, so we tried the Raw Boost Bites. She didn't like it. Nibbled a bit on it and then spewed it out in disgust. We had more success with the customary tuna fish and ham diet.<br />I have to admit that the sample size of one is not really representative, so I have no idea whether this cat has a special taste, or whether this product is just not what cats want. I may need to try it myself to get a better idea about it ...

review/text: My dog likes this product.  That is most important.  It doesn't have a foul odor...  The description says you can break it in pieces... you can but it is a bit dry and pieces don't come off in the same size consistently.  Overall I would recommend.

review/text: I got the chicken flavor and my Rat Terrier loved these, but my cats wouldn't touch them.  They just sat in the cat dish until I had to throw them out. Since I got this because it was supposed to appeal equally to cats and dogs, I'll probably keep hunting for something else.

review/summary: My Dog Liked these, my Cat, not so much
review/text: My dog liked the Raw Boost Bites, eagerly eating them out of my hand.  She is a treat hound, and likes these as well as any other treat product.  My cat ignored the treats, as she does most treat products.<br /><br />The advantage to these Bites are the fact that they are freeze-dried at the factory, and retain a level of freshness until the package is opened.  It's a little difficult to open the package, but I was eventually successful without resorting to a pair of scissors, which was nice.<br /><br />The smell of the product was as one would expect, with a musky meat (Chicken) flavor that presumably is irresistible to dogs (if not cats).  Not something I'd be attracted to, but then again the product is meant to appeal to your animal friend rather than you.

review/summary: Best treats yet for cats and dogs....
review/text: This is by far one of the best treats. What is best is that they are for both cats and dogs. Usually when I give my dog or cat a treat they eat it right on the spot. When I first gave them these treats, my dog and cat ran away with these treats on hand. They left and probably savored them in private. The treats are great and they are the size of a half dollar and about a half inch to three quarters inch thick. You can probably cut these in pieces perfectly using a knife. If you do it by hand it takes a little more strength and maybe a little messier. Overall, these are great treats that you can use for your cat and dog.

review/summary: Natural pet treats
review/text: These "bites" are almost Oreo cookie sized.  As they are, they aren't the best size or shape for cats, though these are marketed for both cats and dogs.  I crumbled one of these up and dropped them in front of the kitties.  Only a few of the kitties seemed to like the crumbles.  A couple of them weren't interested after their initial sniff.  A few of them tried to give the crumbles a second chance.<br /><br />I think these would be better for dogs.  While the concept of natural and raw is awesome, the shape and texture isn't the best for cats.<br /><br />ETA - I gave these to a friend who has 2 puppies, and they LOVED it.  She has 8 cats as well, and though the cats were interested, they didn't care that much.  I had given this 3 stars for the cats, but if you have dogs, they are definitely 5 stars.  So this review is for 4 stars.
