review/summary: pretty good
review/text: This mix is pretty good, made with water.  The texture can be strange if you add extras... If you add blueberries, don't make 12 large muffins, make about 16 small ones, or they will be gooey. And you need to cook them at 375 (rather than 400) for approx. 10 minutes longer than it says.

review/summary: Taste delicious and very easy to make
review/text: This muffin mix is awesome. I am so happy to have found a mix without sugar that taste good. Because of my food allergies I just mix the batter with water, add stevia and spices and leave out the eggs and oil and it makes the house smell like I am cooking spice cake. It taste good. I end up eating almost all of the muffins the same day I make them because they are so good. I will always keep this mix on hand.

review/summary: THESE MUFFINS.
review/text: These muffins. THESE MUFFINS! Every time I lift one of these muffins to my lips, I distinctly hear a voice in my head say "I am so excited to eat this muffin." I kid you not. These are the most delicious muffins I have ever tasted, and by far the healthiest. And so tasty. Other muffins will bow down in shame when you bake these at home. Make them with apple juice and blueberries, then eat them all at a picnic in the sun held in your honor while the world slowly passes you by. That is how great these muffins are. Eat them.

review/summary: Great muffin mix for those with food allergies!
review/text: We use this mix for our child with multiple food allergies and they are gone before we know it---my husband even steals a few!  We make orange cranberry muffins: I use orange juice in place of water and add a cup of dried cranberries (I do use an egg replacer in place of eggs), and cook them a bit longer than instructed. They are best when eaten that day, but they keep in the fridge for several days and freeze well.

You definitely will want to add something into the mix to give them flavor, otherwise they taste a bit like playdough.

review/summary: Two tumbs up!
review/text: I love this product!  In fact, I've signed up for a monthly delivery of 6 packages each time.  This is the best muffin mix I've found that gives me a light, fluffy muffin without gluten.<br /><br />I always add a variety of fruits or nuts each time I make the muffins.  I've even added saut&eacute;ed breakfast sausage meat and grated cheese to the mix.  Delicious!  I always add enough add-ins to make 12 large muffins. Being this is a sugar-free mix I do add about 1/4 cup of Agave nectar if I want the muffins on the sweet side, especially if I use fresh cranberries.<br /><br />I highly recommend this mix for anyone that is gluten intolerant.  Our family loves the end result...and I do too!

review/summary: Taste like paste
review/text: Granted, I tried to doctor this mix up based upon some other reviews and my own baking experience pre-gluten-free, but I imagine if these muffins tasted as bad as they did doctored up, this is a pretty sorry mix.  It is possible that I just got a bad bag, but the expiration date was still 11 months away so no excuse.  I added orange juice and yogurt in place of water for moisture, and added 1/3C brown sugar as a sweetener.  I threw in a large dash of flax seed meal (which I add to everything I bake GF for fiber and protein).  I added butter (whirred with the brown sugar to start) in place of oil, and 1C frozen blueberries since the goal was blueberry muffins.  They were awful enough, literally like paste, that I had to spit out what I ate and so did my husband.  But the kids had fun making them and actually like them.  Good thing I made banana bread muffins from scratch the same day or I would have been really disappointed.

review/text: These are delicious - the perfect amount of sweet, tart, and dark chocolate.  They also last a long time if you content yourself with only a few at a time... although I sometimes find myself taking four... then taking three more... then four more... they're addicting!<br /><br />To be honest, their chocolate covered pomegranate are even better (and presently ship free with Prime: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R81L92">Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates 2lb Bag</a> ).  If you're between the two, get those.<br /><br />I found these at Sams Club when I went shopping with my mom, but without my own membership, I can't go back unless she's with me.  It's hard to justify dragging my mom 20 miles out of her way for a bag of chocolate covered fruit... so I'm thrilled to find them on Amazon, even if they are slightly more expensive.  They're so worth it.<br /><br />EDIT:  I would recommend waiting until the cooler season to order them - Amazon can't help the fact that chocolate melts in hot temperatures.

review/text: I bought these after trying my coworker's stash. Mine came quickly but I was disappointed with the difference in quality as compared to my coworker's bag (which she bought from a brick & mortar). The chocolate was harder in my bag and the berries were way too small. Sometimes it felt like I was eating berry-flavored chocolate instead of chocolate covered berries. Not sure if I'll purchase again in the future since it's pricey.

review/summary: Darkened Orbs of Indulgence
review/text: This is coming strictly from someone who isn't a big fan of chocolate... but these things are insanely delicious. Two pounds may seem like a lot but given the chance to sit down after opening the bag, smelling that wafting scent of dark chocolate and sweet exotic berries, man oh man it's like these things should be illegal for being so criminally delicious! I tried some of these when my wife and I were shopping at CostCo and one of the employees demoing food had these on hand and I tried some... the pomegranate flavor ones weren't that keen with me but the Acai berry? AUGH! I can't stop! I'm popping 'em down as I write this they're so good! Tart, sweet, tangy, chocolate and just god amazingly delicious-- you gotta try these for yourself to believe how good these things are.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm not by any stretch a chocolate fan-- and even more so from fruits being dipped in chocolate but these are a cosmic exception of the case.<br /><br />I promised my wife I wouldn't eat the whole bag but... it's pretty hard to resist at this point now ohhh man! I can easily say I could go without all the other chocolate treats I've tried and inludged: Reese's, M&M's of all flavors and makes, Snickers, Baby Ruth-- even my beloved Mr. Goodbar is a distant second to these things!

review/text: These are very delicious and I highly recommend them if you love chocolate covered fruit.  The description of fruit juice covered with chocolate is misleading.  Maybe that is how they are made, but when you are eating them, you think you are eating chocolate covered blueberries.  They only downside is, with all higher-quality chocolate, the melting temperature is low so if they are transported during hot weather, they are likely to be fused together.  It was very hot when I received mine and they were a semi-melted mass.  I solved the problem by putting them in the refrigerator immediately. When they had chilled for 24 hours, I whacked the bag on the counter top several times breaking them back up into individual pieces.  Overall, very tasty and a semi healthy snack.

review/summary: Great treat
review/text: At 18 calories per stick, and only a single grain source (rice), these are great treats. Dogs love them. However, please be aware these treats do not contain probiotics like the company claims. Instead they contain a PREbiotic, fructooligosaccharides, which is still beneficial. Fructooligosaccharide is a natural sweetener and helps 'feed' the flora already existing inside a dog's intestines. This is great, but the dog needs gut flora in the first place. If your dog has a damaged digestive system (for example, from antibiotic usage) then the fructooligosaccharides won't be too beneficial.<br /><br />Compared to similar products and prices, this is a great product for a great price.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: My dog is a very picky little lhasa apso. He will not chew bones, or other chew toys. He does not like most treats, he'll do the trick to pacify me, take the treat and spit it out.<br /><br />However, when I came home with this one, he sat for his treat, took it, and ran away, greedily chewing on it. I have never seen him have more pep in his step. This is the best product I've purchased for him to date. I especially like that it is low in calories and full of quality ingredients. I highly recommend this to anyone.

review/summary: Best Dental Sticks I've Used By Far !
review/text: Get Naked Gut Health is an amazing product. Low cal, low fat, high moisture and high fiber ! A perfect combo weight control and digestion. Sodium content is a bit higher than I would like but with all other things considered it will do.<br />My 2 Papillons absolutely love these things ! They recognize the bag and come running and bouncing around as soon as I have it in my hand :) They are easy to please but they have never responded to anything like these things.<br />They smell good as they contain cinnamon,ginger and peppermint. I guess they like the smell and they taste good too.<br />I was mainly looking for a healthy dental chew. My vet recommend Get Naked but didn't say they came in so many different choices. Neither of my dogs have digestive problems but my little girls is 10 going on 11 and I thought this would be a good choice for her for weight control and to keep her digestive track healthy.<br />I have been using them for about 3 months and have already seen a difference. Some say they are higher but compared to the similar sticks in the supermarket<br />they really aren't that bad since they are twice as long much much healthier and one a day is sufficient for my dogs.<br />One thing I have found over the years, the more organic the food,treats,and chews the healthier the dog. I spend much more overall on my Paps<br />but they go to the vet for shots only. They never get sick. For a 10 + year old that is saying something and I contribute a lot of that to their diet !

review/text: I like this treat for my dogs as it's human grade product. Though all treats need like this should be supervised as some dogs eat too quick and can choke, I find this is definitely  safer and MUCH better quality than greenies or anything by pedigree etc.. none of them are human grade product.

review/summary: False advertising- salt is not organic!
review/text: Organic compounds contain carbon. Salt- sodium chloride, NaCl- is inorganic.<br /><br />Even using the silly redefinition of "organic" which took over six years ago, it makes no sense to ask whether salt was "organically grown" -- it's a mineral, for pete's sake! Of course it's not genetically engineered etc. The USDA grudgingly started dealing with "organic" certifications for plants and livestock, but they won't touch claims of "organic salt." Only three organizations (one in France, one in NZ, and one in Wales) with dubious credentials have tried to buy into the "organic" craze by certifying "organic" salt.<br /><br />Nothing against this salt- I'm sure it's fine. But any other natural sea salt will be just as good. Don't pay extra for a meaningless label.

review/text: I ordered this Organic Fine Sea Salt because of the health benefits of trace minerals and have been very pleased using it for cooking. I don't know if the definition in New Zealand for fine is different than ours, but is very coarse. I like this product, but and rating it 4 only to insure you see the description is off. I will continue searching for a sea salt for table use.

review/text: Everytime I run out of sea salt I am amazed at how hard it is to find just what I want.  Right price, right size, NO additives.  This stuff fits the bill.  Because the price is reasonable and the flavor is simple, I use it in everything from pasta water to baking.<br />BE WARNED - it is NOT FINE.  I put it in my spice grinder if I need a pinch of fine.  It is at least as coarse as the big blue box of coarse kosher salt if not larger and a bit more irregular.  That said, it doesn't stop this from being my favorite.

review/summary: Tastes awesome!!!!
review/text: Super great salt, which actually tastes delicious and not like your regular chemical salt that has a disgusting bitter taste. As people have mentioned it is not fine, but rather comes in large grains, while using it in some soups would not be a problem, but if you want to load up your salad with it, it won't melt that easily. Since it does not have anti-caking agents in it, grains are stock together as if wet. It does really taste good, if you just put a pinch in your mouth, there is a huge difference. I'll be ordering their Coarse package, since Fine is not available yet, go get yours!!!!!

review/summary: great food, a bit expensive though
review/text: We have a labrador puppy, and we tried Iams puppy food when we first got her however, she lost interest in it after we stopped wetting her food at about 3 months old. I did some searching and asked for ideas from family, friends and co-workers and they all said Wellness brand is the best. So we found this food and it really is the best. The dog loves it, it is healthy food for her and really has helped her growing stage. She is now very healthy in her weight, joints, and muscles. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the price. While I think Amazon finds the cheapest price I have seen it up to $30 for a small bag and $60 for a large bag at a local pet supply chain, so it is a great food but shop around for prices. I have seen it for $25 and $50 at various online retailers, just watch that shipping. But overall a great food.

review/text: We purchased this food for our new rescue greyhound.  We transitioned her on to it as the bag suggested (over a 7 day period) and she is doing great on it.  She seems to like it and I like that the peices of kibble are larger to make her chew them a bit more.  The bag itself is nice with a ziploc type closure and it arrived on time.  We have noticed improvment in her "output" as well- less of it and of better quality.  Pleased with the food.

It is one they like, it is formulated for large breeds, it fills them up and because of the high quality there is less output in the yard.  The price is high but it seems to be higher for this food everywhere.  However, with Amazon Prime I just order it up and it is delivered right to my doorstep every other week.  No more lifting the bag into my car, out of my car, etc.  Amazon and Wellness rock!

review/text: We have a 10 weeks old labrador/pitbull mix and he loves this food. I started by feeding him Purina then realized the ingredient label hiding on the side had a bunch of "by-product" and load of fillers. This dog food isn't all meat either but at least the first ingredient on the list is chicken (not by-product). According to the label there's no preservatives and I hope it is true. This cost twice as much as the Purina and I think its well worth it for your precious pet.

review/text: We purchased this dog food for our 12 week old lab puppy, he had previously been on Diamond . For the first week we mixed the wellness into his Diamond. 2 weeks later he developed severe diarrhea onto a diet of rice then chicken for 5 days as soon as the wellness was reintroduced severe diarrhea again, back on rice and chicken. When food was reintroduced we switched to Purina one smartblend puppy for large breed puppies. Some people may disagree but he loves it and is having no problems. Last night at training class my husband was giving him little treats and through the night he developed severe diarrhea again and realized he was eating wellness treats. We would never buy another wellness product again.The dog food also gave him gas should have been warning for us.

review/summary: Wellness is Dangerous!!! Makes dogs SICK!
review/text: I have been giving Wellness to my 7 month old pitbull since he was 8 weeks old. I chose it because it is supposed to be a good and natural food. It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months, he got very sick.. throwing up and loose stools. We took him to the vet for x-rays just to be sure there was no obstruction. There was not. He got better but the gas continued.<br />About 2 weeks ago, my dog started vomiting his Wellness food a few hours after eating. It looked whole. He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- "Wellness Super5mix sick" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product! Stay away from it.. don't risk it..<br /><br />Here is just one link-<br />[...]

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I used to wait until the end of summer, buy a bushel of tomatoes and can all my spaghetti sauce at once using a similar but bulk product. It wasn't as tasty as this and had lots of MSG in it. It also required me to do all my canning at once. This year, I've been able to do a small batch of sauce every week with my own tomatoes as they ripen in about 15 minutes. I alter the instructions on the packet to use 29 ounces of fresh tomatoes lightly pureed in the food processor. Dump into a saucepan with one tablespoon balsamic vinegar and one tablespoon of oil, bring to a boil, simmer 10-15 minutes (depending on how watery the tomatoes are) or until it is the consistency you like your sauce to be. Each batch makes about the equivalent of a regular jar of spaghetti sauce (25 to 28 ounces?). I've easily got enough sauce stored away now for winter and to give away (I've been freezing but you could easily water bath process this for shelf storage). I have used for pizza sauce and pasta sauce as well as added a little to soups and used for a dip with zucchini bites etc. Doubles well - I haven't tried more than that at one use. The mix dissolves evenly without clumping. I like that the packaging is not excessive, too. Easily the most indispensable thing I have had in my kitchen this summer.

Instead of eating all 6 cookies + dinner and nothing else, I ate 4 cookies during the day, a sensible dinner (probably around 500 calories, but I wasn't really counting), and had a cereal snack bar with hot chocolate made from skim milk for my evening snack.<br /><br />I stopped with the diet cookies at Thanksgiving 2009, and ate the holiday junk all through December and January. Now (March), I am back on the cookies. I had gained back 8 of the 13 lbs I had lost, but have now lost 2 lbs in 3 days on the cookies. This time around, I am exercising too, but very carefully, since my caloric intake is so low.<br /><br />When I started with the cookies, I was very nervous about the taste. I am VERY picky about how things taste, and diet cookies just didn't sound very appealing. They really aren't bad. I mean, don't get me wrong, these aren't Oreos. If they were, I'd eat the whole bag in one meal, which would completely defeat the purpose! But they are edible. I have only been eating the blueberry and the chocolate ones (I don't like bananas or coconut, so I figured a diet cookie with those flavors would be even worse), and they actually taste like blueberries and chocolate. There are actually blueberries in the blueberry ones. The chocolate ones smell kind of funny, a lot like protein. But they taste much better than they smell. In fact, my 3 year-old daughter is always asking to "share Mommy special cookies" because she likes them so much (she gets a little bite off of one every so often).<br /><br />The cookies are kind of small, but are surprisingly filling. I can eat one cookie every 2 hours, and not be hungry in between. In fact, I can almost set my clock by my hunger pangs. As soon as I feel hungry again, I eat another cookie. The cookies are very dense, so they also take me about 10 minutes each to eat. They are a tad dry, but that probably lends to the desire to drink more water, which I do. In fact, I usually hate water, but when I eat these cookies, I crave it, so I drink probably 8 times more water eating the cookies as I do when I don't eat them, which is an added health (and diet) benefit.<br /><br />They are also great in that they help me get over my emotional eating habits. These cookies are not "comfort food"; I eat them so that I'm not hungry. Over time, they cut down on my desire to be emotionally fulfilled by food. It actually took me almost one full month to go back to my emotional eating habits when I stopped eating the cookies the last time. Since these cookies are not intended to be a forever diet, this separation of emotions from food is a very good thing. Now that I am aware of it, I will just need to be more careful once I reach my desired weight goal and go off the cookies to make sure I don't allow my old habits to once again take hold.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey for my liking, but most diet food is. And they last me a while, since I have 2 cookies left over every day.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them. They get an immediate result, which motivates me to keep going. I am working on getting sick of them, but that's a problem I have with any food I eat a whole lot of (I miss pb&j sandwiches, but I overloaded in 5th grade). I doubt many other people would have that issue.

review/summary: Oregon Raw Hazelnuts
review/text: These hazelnuts are delicious and the best!  They are packed in resealable 1 lb. vacuum bags and are really fresh, and I can't wait to use them in certain baking recipes I want to try (if I can stop myself from eating them all first) such as Jacques Pepin's chocolate brownie cake with Grand Marnier flavored whipped cream--yumm!  The nuts I've bought locally--usually imported from Turkey--have been extremely disappointing, with about 1/3 of them being rancid, and they would ruin any recipe.  When using hazelnuts in baking, roasting them first really improves their flavor.  Store them in the freezer and they will stay fresh much longer.

Instead they arrived double bagged and inside a USPS cardboard envelope (not a box) which had torn a bit.  No packing material, no packing slip.  I'll find another supplier for the next batch.

review/summary: WHERE'S THE BEEF????
review/text: I ordered this for my step MIL because online it looks like a full size gift box, and several of the other reviewers raved about how great it was so I thought I'd give it a try.  The box is a little on the small side but is decent. Once you open the shrink wrapped box to get everything out it looks VERY skimpy.  I paid almost $70 for it, and it looks like it might be worth $20 if that -- and that's only because of the box.  The "truffles" and "english tea" as well as the "angel candles" all look like they're from the dollar store.  I'm VERY disappointed with this product.

review/summary: A nice box, but a little pricey!
review/text: I purchased this as a gift for someone.  The box is a nice sized box, however, the box itself does not look like the one in the advertised photo. The paint, which is supposedly hand painted, is not as deep in color and detail as in the photo and the roses are not as defined as in the photo.  I expected this gourmet "food" gift basket to be that!  There is no food, and since it is a gift basket, I expected the items to be displayed coming out of the box as in the photo to make it attractive looking.  The items inside are packed inside with the box lid closed.  I found this gift was nice, but was a little disappointed in it.  I also thought it was a bit pricey at $60.

review/summary: Do Not Buy! picture is a lot better than the actual product
review/text: I purchased this item for my company's Mother's Day raffle based upon pictures and positive reviews. I was running out of time, had no time to shop myself and so Amazon was the solution.  The item arrived damaged, not enough padding in the box, actually there was no padding at all.  The contents arrived all closed in the box too, not nicely displayed as in the picture. The items were cheap dollar store type items, not worth 49 bucks!<br />I initially tried to return the item, only to get a response that this item is not eligible for return!!  After calling Amazon, I learned I could still get a refund, but that they would not accept the product back since it contains some food items.  I'm glad I got the credit back on my credit card, so I was able to get something else for this raffle instead.  My recommendation, go to the local gift shop and check out your purchase directly.  Do not get this item!

review/summary: Perfect!!
review/text: I bought this for my boyfriend's grandmother's 90th birthday. Shipping was Prime, so that was super easy.<br /><br />It arrived nice and protected with a little sheer bow on it too. Of course, I took it off so I could arrange the things inside nicely and put it back on later. The items were nearly identical to the picture, a few minor changes - but nothing in a negative way! (I think the note pads had a different design but the same type of tone, and the biscuits were actually Truffle Cookies.) I LOVED that it came with a little white plastic rose/flower. I thought that would definitely just be in the ad, but it was really a nice touch!<br /><br />The box is beautiful. The painting is so soft and detailed, it really just looks handcrafted and personal. The clock works and looks amazing, just threw in a battery and it was easy to set. I can't rave about this box enough. I actually wouldn't mind having one too! It has a tiny bit of a cracked/distressed look, adding to the vintage/Victorian and personal feel of the whole thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately I wasn't able to see her face when she opened it, but the boyfriend says she LOVED it and wouldn't stop talking about it :) This was such a great gift. It was perfect and I'm so glad I found it!<br /><br />I know some reviewers were worried about the price, and it is kind of a lot for a gift basket, but you have to realize that you get a ton of stuff with it and the box itself absolutely makes it worth it! It's not some cheap wicker basket. It's so personal and thoughtful and definitely going to last a long time.

review/summary: Best Vanilla Ever!!!
review/text: I received a bottle of this vanilla from a friend who purchased it in Mexico and have been carefully hoarding it for only treats where the vanilla is dominant (frostings, chocolate chip cookies, hot cocoa) so as to not run out.  I was SO excited when I hopped on Amazon in desperation to see if it was actually in the US before having to succumb to buying the far inferior grocery store vanilla.  You will not be disappointed with this vanilla!! It is literally the difference between mediocre chocolate chip cookies and ones everyone asks the recipe for.  A word of caution: use half the amount called for in recipes as it is at least double the strength of standard vanillas.  YAY!!!  Can't wait to start baking again...

review/summary: Jerky Lovers Loved This Gift - Alot!
review/text: I've been buying Buffalo Bills brand of jerky for over a year now. I wish I had known about them before - their products are always fresh and full of flavor; and their shipping is always, always on time. I do pretty much all of my gift shopping online and a few months ago I started buying this company's 6-packs coolers (they have quite a few different ones to choose from) for birthday and congrats gifts.<br /><br />I've sent this particular 1.75oz Beef Jerky Cooler to 4 different people this summer and each one really enjoyed it. If you're looking to send a gift and you're not certain what kind of jerky the person likes, then this is the one to send. It's a great assortment.<br /><br />On a personal note, their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FZ0TL0">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Honey Pepper Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYXBPW">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Teriyaki Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> are the 2 best jerkys I have ever eaten. They make 5 different flavors of Country Cut Beef Jerky but these 2 are addictive.

review/text: I ordered these for some family members and they were delicious (or at least that's what I heard). One person even told me it was the best jerky they'd ever had. I would definitely buy these again - they make such a wonderful gift for the person who has everything.

review/text: This item was purchased as a birthday gift to be sent to a son across country.<br />It arrived exactly the day they said it would, and from all accounts was a great success both in taste and quality. I will be purchasing from the vendor again.

review/summary: Tender and Delicious Jerky
review/text: I got this box of deliciousness on Friday & sorted each jerky by type.  I sorted them because I had stomach surgery & have been looking for some high protein snack that works well for me. This is a great snack for soldiers & post-op VBG folks.<br />I gave all the "spicy" ones to hubby & kept the rest for me & only had to rethink the honey pepper ones...they have a nice punch, but I'm not ready for that yet!<br />Hubby got the: Sweet n' Spicy, Black Pepper, & Cajun, Honey Pepper and Spicy.  I got the Barbecue, Mild, 2 types of the Teriyaki, Original and "Hung In The Smokehouse" Hickory Beef Jerky.I ate a pack of the Barbecue & it was SO delicious!  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great source low calorie snack of protein with low carbs & low fat. The only negatives for me is that it has Mono-sodium Glutamate & Sodium Nitrite. The sample pack works out wonderfully so I can try about 1 to 2 ounces a day of jerky & make a decision which ones work best for me.  The cooler itself is insulated & has a zipper closure.  The cooler is a plus because I can keep my snacks by my computer & my cats can't steal them!
