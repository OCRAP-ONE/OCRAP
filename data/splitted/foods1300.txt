review/summary: Excellent Cookie, Very Addicting
review/text: Before becoming a Celiac and switching to a gluten free diet, I used to love Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's. I found these on sale at the Grocery Outlet the other day and decided to give these a try. These were so much better than the Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's and significantly better than Vanilla Oreo's. Even my gluten eating friends said they were addicting. They are great dipped in hot chocolate, milk or tea but are even better on their own. Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).

review/text: We have been on Gluten Free for a few months now, and when you first start, many things are hit or miss. I don't usually like vanilla "Oreo" type cookies anyway, and worried that my boys (6 and 4 years old) would never go for them... BUT- they are so sweet, flakey, and delicious that our whole family (my husband included) couldn't get enough of them.<br />BUY THESE COOKIES, for real.

review/text: CHOCOLATE. When going GF 10 years ago, I was bummed cause there was suck a lack of store bought goodies. I once had an addiction to Keebler Fudge Shop, Fudge Sticks. I was hesitant at first to but these cause of the price, but they are worth it if you have the craving. I like them frozen/refrigerated the best. I gave them to a GF co-worker and she really liked them too. The only problem I have is once I open one box, I have trouble not finishing the whole thing. oops. I've also tried the vanilla ones, but they are not that good. Buy these!!!

review/text: I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and love my cookies!  I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!

review/text: Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other "real" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

review/summary: Really nice Chipotle flavor!
review/text: This a fabulous deal for the money.  A little goes a VERY long way, I think this will last us a long time.  For a large casserole or soup I use about 1 Tablespoon (we have 2 young kids).  It permeates the dish with that wonderful smokiness and a nice dash of heat.  Yummy!

review/summary: Very addicting!
review/text: I just recently purchased these cookies and after I ate one I had to eat like 10 more! I felt like they were the best mint cookies I've ever had!  We recently got some girl scout cookies (I don't care for the mint kind) but I ate a couple.  They were okay, but I decided to buy these grasshopper cookies for my youth group.  Literally couldn't stop eating them!  They were so awesome!  Loved them!

review/summary: Not the best, by far not the worst.
review/text: After great experiences with Ancient Harvest Quinoa pastas I decided to try another brand of quinoa based pastas...while it's not as bad as some of the rice based pastas, it's not that great. Edible at best. A test bite from the boiling water at less than 5 minutes yielded something kind of mushy on the outside and firm on the outside. I decided to drain. After letting the 'pasta' rest for a few minutes it gained a better texture, not too pasta-like, but edible. The taste? Kind of bitter. Best to mask this with some garlicy sauce.

review/text: I tried this hoping that it would be another good GF staple in my pantry. I didn't like it as well as the other brand I buy. I combined the cooked pasta with a homemade GF cheese sauce and it was by far the worst GF Mac n' Cheese I've ever made. The pasta didn't combine with the sauce at all. I am going back to my tried and true Quinoa pasta.

review/summary: Earthy flavor
review/text: I have tried a variety of gluten free pastas and this is definitely not my favorite. I thought it cooked fine. A lot of gluten free pasta's can get a little mushy and filmy. You have to be careful how long you cook them. This one wasn't bad about that, but it did taste a bit like dirt. I covered it in more sauce than I usually do and it still tasted earthy. I will not be buying this again.

review/text: OMG, I totally disagree with the 2 star giver. I made this last night, and if I didn't know it was gluten free, I'd never would have guessed. I would have thought a 'multi grain with wheat penne' at best. It was great! Nice firm texture, great flavor and the grains are very good for me; and I think I've found my favorite! No more mushy rice or corn pasta for me anymore!

review/summary: Good alternative to quiona for variety in diet
review/text: This is very good g-f pasta.  I agree with others and normally prefer quiona, however, I do not enjoy quiona in pasta salads or for cold peanut noodles - too hard when cold.  This has a nice consistency.  I also enjoy eating something other than quiona pasta occasionally and rice is just too mushy.

review/summary: Works good for me
review/text: I've eaten this pasta almost every day for the last two years, and I like it. The reason I ate it so often was because of food sensitivities...this was one of the few foods that I was able to tolerate.  It's very soothing for my stomach.  It has vitamins added, which some of the other more expensive ones do not.  I cook it for 10 minutes, which I guess you're not supposed to do, but I like it that way.  I always top it with vegetables and various sauces, for flavor, but I've always done that with all pasta. I was happy to find this pasta and the fact that it kept me going for the past couple of years.  Recently I discovered that I'm able to tolerate some of the other gluten free pastas now, so I've been trying them.  However, this one is still my mainstay because I like it and the price is right...it's the lowest priced of all the ones I've tried.

review/summary: change for the worse!!!!
review/text: The blend of this mocha java harrar has completely changed since 2007.  For Years I have drunk this blend from coffee masters, ordering usually 8 x 12oz packages at a time .  It was high in complex flavors, mellow, soft, mouth coating, low acid, with a faint background of chocolate, and low in bitterness, wonderful after taste -- Outstanding in anyone's book.<br /><br />The previous 8 packages (somewhat stale- from age?) and the most recent 4 packages I received are a completely different coffee!!!!!<br /><br />Very little flavor -single flavored/no complexity, medium to high bitterness, bright-not mellow, tinny and high acid - like columbian blends!!<br /><br />AND the cost is up 30%-50%.  Coffee Masters should apologize to coffee drinkers and explain why they would sell a different blend under the same name.

review/summary: SMOOTH AND SATISFYING
review/text: I used to buy Mocha Java coffee at Freed's here in San Francisco.  They closed their store and their mail order is too expensive.  Coffee Masters tastes like Freed's beans.  Smooth and non-acidic even when it's brewed real strong like I like it.  I know there are different coffees named mocha java, and I'm not up on what qualifies as the real stuff.  This coffee tastes like what I like in a mocha java.  I think this is a good deal.

review/summary: Subtle flavor, not too sweet, fresh taste
review/text: I'm a sucker for toast and jam. I have a toasted English muffin nearly every day and I am always looking for a new taste treat to spread on my Thomas'. I saw the Hero variety at a gourmet shop and since I love red current, I gave it a shot. When I spooned out my first serving, I discovered that it wasn't a "jelly" - meaning there were chunks of fruit in there. Should have noticed that it's a "preserve" and that usually means there are pieces of real fruit in the mix. Fortunately, there were no "pits" like there can be in raspberry preserves.<br /><br />But don't mistake surprise for disappointment. The taste is a bit subtle (reason for 4 stars) and not overly sweet. I get a nice sense of fruitiness and freshness.<br /><br />Maybe not my absolute favorite red current preserve but it's very good. Also, the Amazon price is lower than what I paid at a local high end gourmet "shoppe".<br /><br />My search for the perfect red current continues but this one will be a good fall back position until then.

review/summary: pretty good add-in to Cocoa
review/text: I use as an add-in to cocoa...specifically Diet cocoa to make it a yummier treat.  i also have used as add-in's to Frozen hot chocolate (adaptation to Hungry Girl recipe).  This one tastes pretty good, no aftertaste, but does seem to take a lot of volume to get enough of the taste.  Not available in most stores I shop at (which usually only have one or 2 of the sugar-free flavors).  I would buy again when I run out (have a large bottle), but I do think my favorite sugar-free flavor is the hazelnut one.

review/text: My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat.

review/summary: Keeps my cats happy and healthy
review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

They flavor taste as fresh as if you toasted them yourself-crunchy, fresh almond flavor-no rancidity! The foil resealing bag actually seals airtight unlike other bags that do not seal well since they are cheaply made. I will definitely purchase other Azar products. Also this product is actually cheaper than buying non-toasted sliced almonds at my local grocery stores (Food Lion and Farm Fresh). Truly a great deal on a quality item.

Now that I've found a SIX pound bag here instead of the 3.5 lb bags we have to buy every other week....we're all purrin' :)  We have an older "pet store" cat who, after 12 years of eating most any brand put in front of her has decided she's a Maine Coon, too...and will only eat the MC31.  Have to admit, it smells pretty good...... :)  Maine Coon's are notorious for gobbling smaller kibble without chewing...which can cause frequent vomitting.  This formula has the larger kibble that forces them to chew.  Much easier on their tummies.....and my carpet.

I tried to separate them... to no avail.  Surprise...Surprise!!  The Royal Canin  kitten formula did not cause the old cats bladder to flare up!  I recently went to the #31 and both cats love it.  They refuse anything else.  And old kitty is doing great.  I'll never feed anything else.

review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

review/text: I'm a big chai fan but have been disappointed in the past by at-home chai mixes and teas.  They never quite taste like what you get at the coffee shop (I find Tazo and Oregon are too sickly sweet and yet missing the creamy element, plus the texture of these tea drinks is awkward).<br /><br />That said, David Rio is the only at-home chai mix that replicates my favorite coffee shop chai lattes.  I tried both the Elephant Vanilla and Tiger Spice - love them both.  I use 3 tablespoons in a mug of soymilk, and it's just perfect!  Spicy and creamy but not too sweet.  I HIGHLY recommend David Rio chais.

My favorite "family run" coffee shop I frequent serves Elephant Vanilla Chai- and it's by far my favorite.  Using milk at home w/3 TBSP. per cup- it tastes just like the coffee shop!!!  I highly recommend this product!  Rich and creamy, but not too sweet!

review/text: I've tried other flavored powders chai and this rates low compared to them.  Elephan Chai is not very flavorful or rich and I would not buy this product again.

review/summary: I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this chai!!!
review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this chai!!! I tried many of the brands you see for chai (I drink vanilla chai only). I used to drink Pacific Chai regularly and thought it was the best then, but this chai far exceeds that and Starbucks also. I have been drinking this for at least a couple of months so far everyday and I am not sick of it yet. FYI... this is how I make it. I have the Back to Basics cappacino blender/dispenser; fill it with water to 1-3/4 cups (enough to fill my Dunkin Donuts travel mug that I use); put in about 3 tablespoons of chai; turn on the machine to mix and heat; when done I turn on the frother as I am dispensing into my cup. YUM!!

review/summary: Addicting!  Absolutely Wonderful Chai!
review/text: I absolutely love this chai.  My local coffee shop got me hooked on it and I just had to order it for myself (so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted).  I like the Tiger Spice Chai as well, but the Elephant Vanilla is just fantastic.  Very creamy and smooth.

review/summary: Loved it!
review/text: I received this as a birthday present from a fellow chai drinker and I really loved it.  I have tried many different types of chai and this is my favorite - it disolves very easily and has lots of rich flavor.  I will keep this one in the pantry for daily drinking!

review/summary: The BEST energy drink around!
review/text: This product is by far the best energy drink I have tried.  I had it in the morning and had enough energy that I didn't even have to go for that typical cup of coffee I always have.  It tasted good and lasted for what seemed like hours.  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone that wants a healthy and convenient boost.  Kudos to the makers of this product, I'm going to be a Peppod user from now on.  I give it 5 stars and am going to start spreading the word!

review/summary: It's perfect, nothing like the jittery corner store pushing Energy products
review/text: I am so not a fan of the Energy products you find on the counters of most the corner stores.  Truthfully I try not use any kind of energy supplement, as my belief is that if your body can't naturally give you the lift it needs, why trick it with crap, like the stuff in drinks like Rockstar, Redbull and Monster.  I always felt so bad after I drank one of those.  I've been a big fan of the Emergency product, but never got a lift out of it.  A friend of mine has become a huge fan of the product PepPod, so much that he's been pushing me to try it.  Reluctantly, I tried some, and O' my, it is the real deal.  I so didn't feel like a caffeine / sugar crap rush, I just felt good.  It's a clean lift up.  And from what I can tell, there's nothing in it / about it that's bad.  For now, with my limited exposure/experience, I am giving this product two thumbs way up, and am so looking forward to getting in my order/shipment.

review/summary: Energy Evolved-This drink is amazing!!
review/text: This energy drink is real energy! It's portable so I can carry it anywhere, I just drop it into a glass of water when I need a boost. No jitters or the "Extreme Sports" mentality just an honest, real and fun company with great people. I tried a free sample from their website and loved it so much I began ordering directly. Thanks again for a wonderful product!<br /><br />I am Evolved!!

review/summary: Legit.
review/text: I have never before left a review of anything before, and that sounds too good to be true, but peppod is the most legit stuff i've ever tried.  Peppod originates in colorado from what I have read, but shipped from illinois-took one less day than the estimate.<br /><br />This is honestly five hour energy on roids.  It costs about half the price, but does just as much and more.  I've tried studying with 5 hour, but I honestly didn't feel anything and actually slumped over a few times (mind you, this was over xmas break, when I was not sleep deprived and completely drained.  The very first time I took peppod was about three days ago, at 4 in the afternoon.  I studied until 12, not leaving except for dinner, and then went to bed.  To my surprise, and dismay, I couldn't fall into deep sleep the whole night.  I woke up the next day feeling woozy and had bags under my eyes.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point.  TAKE PepPod in the morning.  It is pretty much just vitamins and caffeine, but it is STRONG.  Stronger than 5 hour energy by FAR.<br /><br />The only con is the taste, and while it isn't pleasant, the smell makes it bearable.  Not a bad tradeoff for an excellent product.<br /><br />Will be ordering from them again.  Hope they add discounts for bulk orders.
