review/summary: Great Noodles
review/text: I have been looking for low-fat ramen noodles since Campbells stopped making them years ago. The Koyo Ramen Noodles have an excellent texture and the mushroom flavor is very good. They only have 1 gram of fat and 190 calories per serving (1 pkg).  I think that they taste better cooked on the stovetop.  I boil the water, add the noodles and cook them for 2 minutes, then add the flavor packet and stir and cook for another minute...and they are perfect.  Just be careful not to overcook them.  I actually prefer these to the regular ramen noodles, and don't miss the extra fat and calories. They are a little pricey, but well worth it to be able to enjoy a healthier comfort food.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I was looking for a organic Ramen and this seemed like it might fit the bill. Turns out to be fantastic! I like to "soup" mine up (pun intended) with veggies. I like fresh veggie but don't always have time to clean and chop. So I always keep on hand a organic Asian frozen bag of veggies. I use 2 cups of water, 1-2 tbs of soy sauce, couple handfuls of veggies, add the noodles and dry packet, bring to a boil, pour into bowl, add fresh chopped green onion and 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil or hot chili oil, and then serve! I can make it in 5 minutes and it's really good, the green onion helps brighten it up.

review/summary: Excellent ramen but don't overcook it
review/text: If you are looking for easy comfort food, I can recommend this ramen.  It can be dressed up with meat, vegetables or tofu but is tasty just on its own.  Good for upset stomachs or poor appetites (it recently got my family through a nasty "tummy bug").  One piece of advice - be very careful when you cook it and follow the instructions closely.  When overcooked, the noodles are limp and tasteless and not a bit appetizing.  I have found that pouring off some of the cooking water after the noodles are cooked, helps too

review/text: I've been trying different Espresso from Amazon since they have a large selection to choose from. This is brand number five, Alessi is by far the best! It's a rich tasting Espresso, not bitter but creamy with a hint of cocoa. Best Espresso on Amazon! I found this Espresso months ago while shopping to refill my stockpile, but it was not available at the time. So I added it to my wish list in hopes it would be back in stock soon. Looks like no one has discovered this Espresso! yet. I sure it won't take long for my secret to get out .............Espresso!!! Espresso!!! Espresso!!!

review/summary: The best espresso coffee out there.
review/text: When my husband and I decided to start making our own lattes, and cappacinos at home, I began trying different espresso coffees.  Allessi, by far, is a smooth strong flavored coffee that I use to buy at our local grocery store for $8.00. So not only does it taste good, this is a very reasonable price. The finer the grind, the more flavorful the coffee and I haven't seen a coffee ground quite as well as Alessi.  I also like the fact that it is vacumn sealed in a tin, not plastic. I highly recommend it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDLB9Q">Alessi Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>

I've been testing a variety of coffees including the black can Lavazza and others, but so far this is my favorite.  Excellent coffee at an excellent price from Amazon.

review/summary: Next best thing to Brach's
review/text: I'm not going to argue for or against circus peanuts as an idea; you either love them or loathe them, and I happen to adore them, though I understand why you wouldn't. They're bright orange marshmallows shaped like huge peanuts and flavored like bananas. The inventor must have been on some serious drugs to think this was a good idea.<br /><br />But there is wide variance in quality between the brands. The very best -- lovely soft texture, bright color, just enough fake banana flavor -- are made by Brach's, which are quite hard to get online unless you want to buy them by the case. These are not quite as good as Brach's, but they're pretty good -- texture mostly soft with small patches of crystal, good color, fake banana flavor almost just right.

review/text: I used these circus peanuts in goody bags for toddlers.  Our theme was "Leaving On A Jet Plane" and since airlines used to give peanuts as a snack, decided I wanted to give out circus peanuts.  Circus peanuts are difficult to find in stores.  The brand I did find was harder than a rock so I took a chance and ordered online.  These circus peanuts arrived soft and fresh.  I ate one to make sure they were soft enough for the toddlers and they actually were!  They also tasted like I remembered from my childhood.  Each individual peanut was also bigger than the brand I had looked at in the store.  If I need circus peanuts again, I'll definitely buy this brand!

review/text: Ok, ok, so maybe I wouldn't add it to ice cream or jello but when it comes to meats, fish, vegetables, this is a wonderful blend every home chef should have on hand. I can honestly say that about many of The Spice Hunters products.<br /><br />  If you like fish or are a frequent user of boneless skinless chicken breasts, as so many of us are these days in an effort to eat healthier, you need to get this blend. It is a mix of onion, dill, lemon peel, ginger, garlic & chives and your meats will thank you for sprinkling a lot of it on them. I use this on baked fish and even the time I accidentally overcooked the fish, it was still awesome due mainly to this spice blend.<br /><br />  Try this sprinkled over boiled new potatoes with a few pats of butter tossed in with it. It tastes like Springtime. Try it mixed with a little mayo and sour cream for a tasty homemade dressing for salad. Or sprinkled on Asparagus... mixed with butter and used as a topping for baked potatoes or throw a dollop onto any meats or veggies. Am I rambling? Rhapsodizing a bit? Yep... but honestly, it's worth the ramble. :-)

review/text: I have been using this spice for years. I can't always find it in stores so I order it here in bulk. I use it daily on veggies and chicken. Its also great on Fish. Add a little butter and this spice and you have a yummy sauce! My kids love it too. Also there is no Salt which is great so you can just add as much of this as you want without over-salting your dish.

review/summary: Deliciously Dill Good
review/text: This is a great product that makes scrambled eggs more exciting; fish very tasty; and cottage cheese especially yummy.  I am always running out and can not find it at any of my grocery stores.  I was delighted to find that I could order it by subscription from Amazon and guarantee that I aways have some on hand.  Now I don't have to save it for special events and can even look for new ways to use it.  Hmmm, I wonder if it would make a good dip.

review/summary: Love this spice
review/text: I had purchased one jar of Deliciously Dill Blend in Anchorage, AK. about 4 ywears ago. Now every time I get to Anchorage (it is 120 mile one way), I buy 4 or 5 jars. All my friends are now using it. I have not been able to find a store in Flordia that carries it. Finally I looked on line and found some. I don't think any kitchen should be without this spice. We use it on everything, except sweets. Eggs, meat, veggies, salad, pasta and don't forget to try it on popcorn instead of salt.

review/summary: The Best Sea Salt
review/text: Was introduced to this brand during a visit to Sicily and have been using it for years.  It has more flavor than other sea salts I tried previously.  I pour the entire container in a canister, salt shaker, etc., and use the coarse grain for salt grinders.

review/summary: The right salt
review/text: 4 things are important when it comes to salt: 1) that it is sea salt.  2) that it has been naturally processed.  3) that it is iodized (your body needs this).  4) that it is fine and not coarse ground.  This salt has all of this.  I am happy.  Container doesn't pour the best, but it's not that big of a deal.

review/summary: The cereal was great, but the cost...
review/text: I tried this Amazon Grocery as an experiment because they had a $20 off coupon for $50 in purchases.  I know the kids love the Krispies and got them some. The cereal came in a big box, the contents where okay - though dinged around the edges, and the shipping time was a little slower than I usually get for packages.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the food here - but when I compared the cost to the local grocery store I saw a huge price difference. If you can be patient, certain cereals always seems to go on sale and this is one of them. Just yesterday I saw 3 17.5oz boxes for $6.00.  Wow.<br /><br />Since the idea is to save on costs from volume purchasing, the idea failed.  Without the coupon, this food buy was not a good deal at all. One by one I saw all the products offered and all the ones I bought become sale items that were significantly less expensive - we're talking in the 45% range here.  I suppose, if you are in a remote area where the gas cost would eat the savings of finding a good price, this would be a decent service. But anyone in a suburban or urban setting will get a better deal at the Kroger's or Ralphs than this.

review/summary: Great for the kid in all of us--but not the healthiest cereal...
review/text: Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies taste great both in milk and as a snack with milk or any other beverage you like. Kids will love how the chocolate slowly turns the milk in the cereal bowl to chocolate milk, too! The cereal is reasonably priced and it comes with a good expiration date so it won't expire the minute it enters your household.  SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, this cereal is low in fat, offers no trans fats (HOORAY!), no cholesterol, and the 120 calories per serving is low, too. It's even "Certified Kosher" if that matters to you. Excellent!<br /><br />However, this cereal is not the most nutritious cereal you can buy; and for this reason I can only give it four stars. Yes, it is very low in fat, calories and cholesterol; and it doesn't have too many carbohydrates, either. Unfortunately, however, Cocoa Krispies does contain sodium and it just doesn't offer enough POW in the vitamin department. It has sugar; and sugar turns into fat if you eat enough of it. Be careful--there may be more fat than there would seem to be in this cereal!<br /><br />Overall, this breakfast cereal is understandably popular with children and it's great for the kid in all of us. It is low in fat and there is no cholesterol; there are no transfats either. The price is reasonable, too. However, it could be more nutritious. As breakfast cereals go, this one will certainly suffice. However, parents who want a highly nutritious breakfast cereal for their children will have to look further.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I'd always wanted to try real vanilla beans in my cooking, but it was crazy expensive at the grocery store. A friend told me about these beans on Amazon, and so I gave it a try. I couldn't be happier! The beans arrived quickly, and were plump and aromatic.  In fact, I put the little bag they came in on a shelf in my cabinet, and now - several months later - the cabinet still carries the delicious scent of fresh vanilla.<br /><br />The beans taste fantastic, and I've come to use them for every vanilla need.  No waste, either. After I use the seeds for cooking, I take the husk and put it in a jar of vodka to make my own extract. Once I'm done with that, I'll take the same husks to make vanilla sugar.  At about seventy cents a bean, I feel that I'm getting a great deal.<br /><br />One warning: If you've never tried vanilla from the bean before, be prepared to never go back to any other form.

review/summary: fantastic homemade vanilla extract
review/text: This is my first experience with whole vanilla beans.<br /><br />I used half of the package to make 12 ounces of vanilla extract.  The remainder of the beans in the package made my spice cabinet smell absolutely wonderful for weeks.  It may be the beans, or it may be the $35 dollar per bottle vodka I used, but I will never buy expensive ready made vanilla extract again because there is simply no comparison with my homemade version.  And all you have to do is split the beans, add them to the vodka and put the bottle in a dark place for 8 weeks or more.  How easy is that?<br /><br />I haven't tried the beans in homemade custard but hope to "get around to it" sometime because I'm sure it would be the best custard ever.  And I think they just might make the world's best homemade vanilla bean ice cream.

review/text: I just recieved my beans and I am sooo excited. For one, I opened the mailbox and could smell the beans through the ziplock they were in plus the mailing package. I was worried, because the cost was so low compared to store prices, that they would be less of a product. Well if the smell denotes the quality then Im in excellient condition. I gave it only 4 stars because I have to test it first in order to give it 5 stars. But I'm feeling confident that the extract I make will be great. Thanks much!! Iwill try to remember to give a review after 3 months, the time they say it takes to make extract, to let you know how it went.

review/summary: Wonderful Vanilla Beans!
review/text: I received my vanilla beans in the mail the other day. I just made a vanilla bean cheesecake and it is still in the oven. I can't wait. Where I live, the vanilla beans are $8-10.00 for two vanilla beans. REALLY? So I thought I would check online and glad that I did. I read the reviews for this company and the quality of the beans and neither one dissappoints. The beans came in the mail quickly, the aroma is all over my kitchen(still in package).  My husband even commented last night about the vanilla scent in the kitchen. The beans themselves are in good condition and I am so excited I got 16 for around $9.00 instead of two for $10.<br />Thanks so much! I would definately recommend these for vanilla lovers. Now I have left overs for other recipes!!!<br />Thanks for quality beans and affordable prices in todays market.

review/text: I had forgotten that I ordered these. I went to check the mail (in Alabama in July) and couldn't figure out for the life of me why I started smelling vanilla from 20 feet away from the mailbox. Obviously once I held the package in my hand I remembered. I used most of these beans to make my own vanilla extract (which was amazingly easy and SO worth it). I have also used them a little in baking and to make some vanilla bean ice cream. Every use I have found for these has been perfect. I think I have one still in the bag in the back of my cupboard but I'm unsure as to whether or not it's still good.<br />Making your own vanilla extract, buying some pretty bottles and some ribbons/labels is a great Christmas gift idea.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: These are so affordable!  Don't ever buy them from the grocery store--it'll cost more than this does and you'll only get two beans.  And these are such high quality!  I absolutely love them!<br />Let's just say I've been dissappointed by vanilla beans in the past.  Not so this time!  These were fresh and soft and easy to work with!  And they gave a wonderful flavor to my cheescakes, puddings, and even pound cake.  I used them for everything that vanilla was the predominant flavor in.  Didn't use them in anything where the flavor of vanilla would've been lost underneath chocolate, cinnamon, etc.<br />Just be sure to use them up within six months or so of buying them.  I went away for a few months when they kinda needed to be used up, and the ones that I had left dried out.  Should've stored them better.  Oh, well, now I have a way to make homemade vanilla extract.  I've had a couple soaking in a canning jar filled with vodka for about a month, so I'll bet I have some really nice homemade vanilla extract now.  So anyway, even if you accidentally let them dry out like I did, you can still put them to good use.  I think a jar of homemade vanilla extract with the bean still in there would make a great gift for one's friends who love to cook.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: After going to the grocery store in search for a couple vanilla beans, I was blown away at the price of $8 for ONE.  I was amazed when I found 16 beans for $14 on amazon.  These are REALLY good, and they smell amazing, and once again, I cant get past the price!  I will never buy from anyone else but these guys again!

review/text: I followed the recommendations from the other reviewers and I'm happy I did. I ordered the beans on a Thursday night, they shipped Friday morning, and I had them in hand Monday afternoon. They were plump and so fragrant and full of flavor. Vanilla beans are so expensive in the store, but at about a dollar a bean, these were so worth it. I'll definitely be ordering again.

review/text: I ordered these beans on a Thursday morning, within two hours of placing my order I received an email telling me they had shipped. Today is Saturday and they are already here! These beans are beautiful. An added plus, not only are they relatively inexpensive (compared to purchasing in a store), they are extremely large and fragrant. Each bean is close to seven inches long and is extremely fragrant and moist. They are so fragrant that I knew they had arrived even before opening the package. I look forward to cooking with these and will definitely order again. Beautiful!

review/summary: Excellent for cooking and home made ice cream
review/text: These are great for cooking. These beans were very robust and full of the delicious black dots that now float among the eggs and cream in my ice cream mixture. I may end up investing in a new ice cream maker. I like to  drink, and vanilla smoothies is sounding pretty good right now. I'd pay triple the price for the quality of these beans...but heck, I'm not complaining about less than a dollar a bean. Now I don't have to feel guilty about using an entire bean, hooray! I had long since been buying beans from the local farmers market, $5 for 2 beans was a super good deal to me. When I moved, my new location didn't have a farmers market supplying me with fresh beans anymore...Amazon to the rescue! I read the other reviews and didn't quite believe the hype - how different can vanilla beans be? The ones I had been getting were great, how much better can it get?

review/summary: Dont hestitate to order these vanilla beans!!!!
review/text: I wanted some vanilla beans to make my own vanilla flavoring. The price of vanilla beans was very high in my small east Texas town and they did not look that fresh. After reading reviews on Amazon of these beans I decided to purchase them. Wow! When I opened the package the smell was unbelievable and the beans were not dried out. I was very impressed and would order these again!

review/text: This is my very first experience with vanilla beans. I recieved them one day after ordering. I knew they arrived as soon as the mail lady showed up at my door, I could smell them from two rooms away. I've since used them in baking and making ice cream, and I put the used beans in my sugar jar to make vanilla sugar. I'm going to use the 20% off coupon I recieved with my order to buy Tahitian Vanilla beans to make vanilla extract.<br />They're gorgeous. I'm hooked!

review/text: These are wonderful, soft and so fragrant that my kitchen smelled like vanilla for days after I opened this package.  I found these beans after paying way too much for a sorry old vanilla bean at the organic market that was so dry, I had to break it up to put in a pot of cream.  These beans are so much nicer, very supple and easy to work with.  They made an amazing vanilla ice cream.

review/text: This company is great, they shipped super fast and the vanilla beans were plump, fragrant, and tasty. I've always seen recipes that just casually called for a vanilla bean or two and just looked at them longingly, since in the store just one will set you back seven or more bucks. I was skeptical at first because of the price but once they arrived...wow. I knew they were here because when I opened my mailbox the delicate, floral aroma of vanilla wafted out (and yes, they were well packed!) and you can even see the difference between these and those little shriveled things in vials at the grocery store. When my supply of beans runs out I will definitely do business with this company again!

review/text: So far everything I have purchased from this company has been an outstanding value. Supermarket Vanilla Beans are far too expensive for just a few bent dried beans in a small jar to use in my kitchen frequently without a tinge of feeling like I've been had. So many recipes and so few beans. Not so with J&R products: Generous amounts at a value price with fresh products of excellent quality. Shipping is prompt.These beans are long and fresh and full of moist vanilla seeds. I place the scraped husks in a jar of sugar to flavor it for other casual recipes like Cinnamon sugar on toast for the kids or flavoring coffee. What else could one ask for? Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream (without breaking the bank) anyone?
