review/summary: Solid GF protein to have on hand
review/text: My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there. We try to carry our lunch when possible, but we rely on safety net foods such as the Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Protein Bars to save us in a pinch or help us have energy to get home.

review/summary: Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!
review/text: I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.  Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as "gluten free".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well.

Finally a treat that won't harm you......unless you eat about six a day...(calories)<br />We checked quite a few places that handle this product and Amazon is by far the best price.

Since there are no "melty" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up.

I was not to fond of the super nutty one - but to each their own)<br />These in particular have an addictive quality which hurts my bank account.<br />you shouldn't be eating more than one of them in a day though, so it's honestly not that bad of a deal.<br />They just taste so darn good.

review/text: I've ordered a number of different kinds of "Kind" bars and "Kind Plus" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!

You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!

I have had one package that was a little more gooey but most of the time they are drier tasting. Personally I don't want it to be gooey. I am on a subscription of these through Amazon and I need to increase the amount. My kids haven't tried them...I am sure they are next except they are picky eaters.

review/text: I knew nothing about Kind Bars, until I saw them on QVC. Since I must be on a high fiber diet due to a colon problem, I tried them. After the first box, I was "hooked". These are the best tasting fiber bars I've ever had. The ones in the markets are good, but Kind Bars are the best. I use them as a once a day snack or desert. If I use it as a snack, I follow with 8 oz., water. I feel as satisfied as if I had a full meal. My favorite is almonds and cranberry. They are not too sweet, but just right for my taste. Another thing that I like about them is, they are moist and the nuts are easy to chew, not hard. If you like nuts, cranberries and honey, you'll love Kind Bars. MAK

review/text: I have ordered these Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants KIND bars at other sites, and have been very happy with all the flavors I can get. Because I wanted to have a box of this flavor only (not a variety pack), I ordered these bars. Great flavor and they feel "so healthy." Give tham a try. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: best ever snack or breakfast bars
review/text: These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.  They are packed with good stuff that help keep your blood sugar balanced (I am hypoglycemic with fibromyalgia and a few other mechanical issues) and your energy stays up there.  This may have me making it a major part of my daily regime. These bars keep actually full me up for a while too.  They come in a smaller size which I am going to get just to stick in my purse for those sugar drops that leave you shaking and dizzy!! and of course for fighting those hunger pangs between meals.

Just the right flavor and amazing if you like dates and almonds (I love them).<br />Sometimes I feel I could eat many but then it fills you up just right to not crave for too many.<br />I love this particular flavor and also the cranberry one they have.<br />It seems like a total value for money item and they also were prompt at shipping it.

review/text: I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.

Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar.

It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, "it tastes like lip gloss".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc.

That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.

Contain all natural ingredients, which will give you instant energy for that tennis game or other favorite sport. Not recommended as trail bars, because heat will melt the dark chocolate in the bar. Can be refrigerated. The three main ingredients are almonds, dark chocolate and cherries, in that order. They do contain some added vitamins. Recommended.

The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less.

review/summary: I've finally found "my" bar
review/text: I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!

review/summary: Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars
review/text: I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS.

review/summary: Tasty, but don't order in hot weather
review/text: I knew this was a tasty flavor of Kind bars.  They are hard to find in stores, so I ordered two boxes.  My mistake was ordering them in the SUMMER, for delivery to Virginia.  They arrived in a very melty state.  They recovered, more or less, and became bar-shaped again and don't have an off taste.  However, the chocolate is changed in texture and I have to eat these bars while leaning over the sink or a plate to catch chocolate schnitzels that fly around!<br />DON'T ORDER THESE IN SUMMERTIME!!!!

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Heaven!
review/text: I bought these bars on a whim (the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants).  I am trying to eat "clean" and was looking for a healthy snack for myself and considering actually making my own granola bars until I stumbled upon KIND.<br /><br />I just ate my first one and I am shocked how good they are.  I was skeptical, but I was wrong, they taste AMAZING.<br /><br />This is a great snack I can feel good about feeding myself and my kids and it tastes AMAZING.  Sweet, nutty and real.

review/summary: better to buy local
review/text: Unfortunately these bars taste rather stale and old...nuts do not keep forever...and I get the sense that these have been held somewhere for far too long.  Better to buy from your local store where you have some idea of the turnover..and can easily complain should the same problem arise.

review/summary: No sulphur dioxide!
review/text: These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit. The bars are not hard or crunchy but they are not chewy either.  Texture is kinda like a snickers bar.  Easy on the teeth.  Everyone in my family has loved these bars.  I thought the price was a little high but now that I've tasted them, they are completely worth it.  I used to buy Clif organic Z bars which weigh 36g and these are little bigger at 40g and much better tasting and more nutritious.<br /><br />Update:  I've downgraded my rating because I just bought the peanut butter dark chocolate + protein and it contains soy protein isolates which are difficult to digest and can cause GI distress.  I heard one of the owners of the company on a podcast (Romy Nelson) talking about the cons of this very protein and why they did not use it about a year ago.  What gives!

review/text: These bars are really the best bars in existence. How can you beat a combination of mangos plus macadamias plus coconut? You cannot.<br /><br />They are very sweet, so if you do not like that, then this product is not for you.

review/summary: So good
review/text: These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar. The whole almonds while delicious make it a little harder to chew, so if you've got fragile teeth buyer beware. I switched to these for a while from the macadamia and mango ones, which are also great, and I noticed a bigger energy boost from these, the cranberry ones. A great product. Bit pricey though, at $1.50 a bar.

review/summary: yummy!!!
review/text: I love the mango macadamia nut flavor. It's sweet with a little crunch, plus vitamin D and calcium. And great also since it's gluten and dairy free. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is that I cannot eat most flavors since I cannot eat almonds. I'm hoping someday there will be more almond-free flavors.

review/summary: My KIND of bar
review/text: If you love nuts and want something truly natural, even satisfying to the sweet tooth with quite a numerous amount of nutrients, this is it.  It's been an excellent on the go between meals snack for me.  Also, compared to my local store, the price per bar is better buying this 12 pack.

review/text: Delicious bar! I love it.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I love the crunchy pomegranates in it.  I reach for these bars ever morning for breakfast or a quick snack.  One thing I love about KIND bars is even if they have crisp rice, it's not the majority of the bar like some other bars out there.  The bar is mostly nuts and fruits as advertised.  Overall, just a great and healthy snack to keep on hand.

review/summary: These taste great
review/text: I read an interview in Inc magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try a bar at Starbucks, where they are selling them at the cash register these days. I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this product, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.<br /><br />These bars are not particularly low calorie, though, in the article I mention above, the founder says he sometimes eats two of them for lunch.  That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories.  So much better for you than a candy bar.

review/text: These bars, and particularly the cranberry & almond ones, are THE BEST DARN SNACK BARS AROUND, PERIOD!  Buy 'em by the box and pace yourself (though you will have to be careful not to expose them to much heat--body or otherwise--or they will get "gooey," and NEVER EVER let your dogs know how good they are or they won't stop begging for bits and grazing the floor below you as you enjoy one!).  Get 'em locally if you can, but GET 'EM!

review/text: At first I was thinking they were incredibly expensive, but after I thought about what is in them (whole almonds and macadamia nuts) it's probably a very fair price.  They are really really good! I figured they'd make a good breakfast bar but I've found myself eating them for dessert instead of chocolate - they're that good.

review/text: Being allergic to all other tree nuts as well as peanuts, this snack bar with macadamia nuts and mango is fantastic.  The macadamia gives it a nice crunchy texture without being too hard.  The mango makes it a little sticky, but the bar can be easily pushed out from the wrapping and eaten a bite at a time without getting your fingers sticky. I really love the taste of this bar.

review/summary: Love these bars
review/text: These are fantastic.  I recently started looking for more health conscious snacks to eat during the day at work and came across these.  After reading lots of other reviews on amazon and reading the ingredients which have zero unrefined sugar I decided to try these delicious bars.  And they didn't disappoint, they are moist, mildly sweet, nutty, and still healthy.  I've tried the cranberry almond which are also tasty but not as amazing as these.  I plan on ripping through the rest of the flavors over the next few months as they go on sale.
