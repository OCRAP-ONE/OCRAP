review/summary: Just didn't do it for our critter problems
review/text: Maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often.  Maybe.  It doesn't affect the squirrels at all.  The Deer Off spray from Havahart works better at keeping the squirrels away but even that is only temporary.<br /><br />Maybe it will work better for others.  We have what amounts to a wildlife sanctuary in our back yard.  The neighborhood is full of pecan and oak trees.  Those trees are full of squirrels.  We have bird feeders to attract birds.  The bird feeders also attract the squirrels.  The birds and squirrels attract cats.  Sometimes the cats get lucky with a bird or squirrel but mostly the cats just hang out and turn the flower beds into latrines.  The squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic.  If the cats would only eat all the squirrels and leave the birds and flower beds alone it would be welcome.  Doesn't happen.  And this stuff ain't makin' it happen either.<br /><br />This stuff doesn't work for us.  You might have better luck...if you're not living in a wildlife sanctuary like we are.

review/summary: does it work
review/text: Short of shooting them, I have looked for other methods for discouraging the squirrels. I actually bought<br />a high velocity pellet gun, but the neighbors thought it was a .22 and I decided not to further<br />test the "discharging a firearm within city limits" statute.<br /><br /> Next I tried a humane trap with a bowl and trail of cashews; voila' it worked- but not for the squirrels-<br />I caught a juvenile possum.<br /><br />So someone told me about pepper products and this came up on the Vine list. It worked for about three days.<br />Then the squirrels were back to digging up my vegetable and flower gardens like they always have.<br /><br />Disappointed to say the least.<br />Didn't work for me.

review/summary: Fun For Squirrels
review/text: I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders. I have six squirrel proof bird feeders. My squirrels, Mensa members all, have figured out how to overcome the "squirrel proofing" and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty. I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders. As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances. This is a genuinely useless product, at least as far as squirrels are concerned.

review/summary: Seems to work (for cats). Smells bad (but that's the point)
review/text: It is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working, but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas I used this. It has a peppery smell which is an irritant. This is obviously how it works. In areas that do not get rained on the odor, and presumably the effectiveness seems to last (several weeks now).  In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective. This may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates.<br /><br />The shaker container is easy to use and stays closed/sealed between applications.<br /><br />So far, so good.

review/summary: very pleased for short term use!
review/text: I just received this and quickly put it into use on my front lawn.  Sadly it has become a favorite spot for a few of the local animals and I've tried a few product to discourage use. This was the first one which when I opened had a distinct pepper smell and seemed like it might be efficient. A couple of happy users of my lawn approached today and within a few feet... turned tail and left!  I have a feeling I'll need some more as I used the whole container but I think it may not take much to train these unwanted guests to find other places to do their assorted business.

I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.<br />Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.<br />So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...<br />The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!<br />This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!

review/text: Being that I live in CT, I have a tremendous amount of squirrels and chipmunks in my yard. But not anymore due to this spectacular product. The squirrels and chipmunks sit at the edge of my property with a dirty look on their face as if an invisible fence was there. This is my second season using Critter Ridder, and I am thrilled with no more tunneling underfoot.<br />I have also used it along my property near the road, and when folks walk their dogs, the dogs lead the owners to the other side of the street.(No more worries about folks not cleaning up after their pets)<br />I have recommended this product for a year now, and will continue to do so. I am not sure how well it repels the other animals listed on the container, but as I see it, nothing is 100% guarenteed until you find what exactly works for you.<br />Go Critter Ridder!!!

review/summary: Does What It Says!!!!!
review/text: Product works exactly as described.  Used after planting garden and had no loss of plants.  Actually had coon poop a foot away from plants with no harm to the plants at all.  When I saw that I was convinced.  I wanted to write this review because some people gave this product a one star!?!?!  I have tried every product out there and this is the only one that I have used that has had a high percentage success rate.  The other liquids don't compare to the granular stuff and Havahart is a reliable brand.  The price is hard to beat too at the local store they cost over $10 for 2lb container so the Amazon price is really hard to beat with free shipping.  It may only last 30 days if it doesn't rain but if you plant and it doesn't rain for a week or two you should have absolutely no problems in my experience.  Worth its weight in gold for the protection it adds to any outdoor growing environment.

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: I obtained this product because we have cats and chipmunks that invade an area between our house and our shrubbery.<br /><br />The product is nicely packaged and easy to use.  I was concerned a bit about the warning label that suggested you contact a poison control center in case of contact with skin.  It was hard to believe it was that dangerous.  The coverage was also less than I would have thought for five pounds, but adequate for the job at hand.<br /><br />The material is granular with a not-unpleasant smell.  The smell was completely gone within a few hours of application.<br /><br />As a test, I set up a motion activated wildlife camera and recorded the area in question for about a week.  I saw cats every night (two different ones), chipmunks during the day and a few birds.  I then applied the product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have photos of the same cats and chipmunks in the same area after the product was applied.  There did seem to be fewer chipmunk visits- but the cats continued apparently unaffected.  The birds were gone, but I wasn't worried about them.<br /><br />Could be I did something wrong (or that we have strange neighborhood cats) but the product did not work for me.

review/summary: Doesn't work with our critters
review/text: I really wanted the Havahart Critter Ridder to work, but unfortunately it hasn't helped with our critter problem. We have squirrels around our house daily, and skunk and raccoon that come into our yard every week or so to dig up our ground cover looking for grubs. I have tried repellent sprays and other products before, but nothing seems to deter them. I followed the directions on the Havahart Granular Shaker, and applied it where we most often have a problem. Although we continued to have squirrels appear every day, I was hopeful about keeping the other animals away because nothing happened for about a week. However, after about seven days I awoke to find my ground cover dug up in many of the places where I had applied this repellent. Even if it did work for seven days (which is doubtful because we've gone that long before with no incidents) it would be far to expensive to apply it every week. I won't try this product again.

review/text: I found this rather expensive product to be useless.  A $16 investment will only cover 80 square feet.  So, I used it sparingly around the perimeter of my lawn.  Over the next two days, raccoons continued to dig up the lawn.  I would look for other means to deter rodents... such as leaving out rags soaked in ammonia or sprinkling cayenne pepper on your lawn and plants.  These are effective but require persistent applications.

So I bought the spray AND granules neither worked a snot.  I then took the remaining product and COMPLETELY filled the holes with Critter Ridder.  Within hours the chipmunks just pushed it aside and continued using the exact same hole.  Do NOT buy this for chipmunks it is 100% ineffective.  It would be worth the price if it worked, but it was absolutely useless for every chipmunk hole I used it on.  Save your money buy a trap.  I doubt they even tested this on chipmunks.  It may work for squirrels but they are wrong about Chip and Dale.

Raccoons, skunks, and oppossums are all attracted to this<br />area. While I've been using Critter Ridder, I've not had them get into the trash at all.<br /><br />I applied the granules to create a 1 to 2 foot wide barrier around the deck and also<br />sprinkled some under the deck around the cans. I did this roughly once a month.<br />The shaker can is easy to use and it only took a few minutes to spread the granules.

review/summary: Mildly effective pest deterrent
review/text: This product is presented as a safe and effective deterrent for a variety of animals. The active ingredients are pepper compounds, the scent of which can deter animals. However, I've found that many animals aren't really affected by the application of Critter Ridder, either because it wears off quickly or isn't active enough in the 1st place. If you use it I would recommend a solid application in the areas where you'd like to repel animals, if it's too weak then animals can easily adapt and ignore it. Also, rains neutralize it, so it's a waste to apply it during rainy season. I believe you could create your own herbal animal repellents with plant oils and extracts and get better results than using these granules. The granules may seem convenient and safe, but so far they seem low on the scale of effectiveness.  The cats, dogs, and rodents in my area don't seem that disturbed by this repellent, and applying even larger amounts in hopes of making the application stronger would make the cost excessive.

The Havahart Critter Ridder is easy to use - just pop the cap and shake onto the ground.

I didn't expect miracles, given the number of chipmunks we have around, but it did seem to help for a while. As with all products of this nature, it needs to be periodically reapplied.

review/summary: Good Repellent and Safe around Kids
review/text: This is a great Animal Repellent that uses Pepper to keep areas safe. It can last up to 30 days depending on your weather. Also any digging, watering or anything that disrupts to ground will affect the coverage and duration.<br /><br />It works by affecting the animals sense of smell and taste with hot pepper and by getting it on their skin and in their eyes. In fact, one way to use this to take some table scraps and cover them with it. Once that skunk or opossum tastes this hot pepper, it will go elsewhere for it's next meal. Also keep in mind that open sources of water and food are what draw in such animals, so if those are still present, you will get other animals coming to the location.<br /><br />This also works to keep cats from using your flower beds as a bathroom, you can shake it over your birdseed to keep squirrels out as birds can't taste hot pepper and it is a non-chemical way to protect your vegetable garden from animals eating your crops.

review/summary: Good if used as part of an overall strategy
review/text: I've tried using assorted repellents like this for a while, always with mixed success. It's mixed enough for me to somewhat suspect more of a placebo effect--I want it to work so I think I notice more effect than it has.<br /><br />However, that being the case, there is enough of a indicator it has an influence in keeping away pests. But, I've found that if I try to use this as a complete solution, I'm both disappointed and quickly run out.  For me it works best with more of a targeted approach, using it where I particularly don't want pests to be or to go through--gaps in fences, openings between brush.  I have to be careful because I likewise don't want to use this where I or my family want to be.<br /><br />Mostly, I find it's helpful to keep our yard a relatively unfriendly place--so that we don't get overrun.  I've noticed a decrease in critter activity, so for that I keep using it.

review/summary: Doesn't last long
review/text: My goal for this product was to help keep the neighbor cats out of my flower and veggie garden.  I followed the instructions on the container and I did notice a little less activity but one running of the water sprinkler seems to dissipate the strength of the granulars enough that the cats are able to ignore it.

review/summary: Slightly effective.
review/text: As I sprinkled Critter Ridder on problem areas on our property, my son commented, "Mom, I like the smell of that stuff."  Indeed, it has a not-that-bad peppery smell to it.  I just hoped the critters didn't feel that the smell was acceptable, too.  I hoped to eliminate visits from a cat who is allowed to roam the neighborhood (who, particularly on chilly nights, likes to come initiate fights with our cats through the windows of our house) and to discourage animals from chewing on the face of our lion cub statue.<br />I haven't noticed any recent damage to the statue, so maybe the culprits there have been suitably deterred.  However, the Critter Ridder has not completely prevented roaming cats from coming close to our windows.  I don't think the cats are actually willing to go to spots where they would come into physical contact with the repellent, but the stuff isn't strong enough to keep them far enough away for our furry family members to be completely satisfied.  It is easier to keep our cats from getting so horribly agitated by the roaming cats' presence that someone (whether that someone is one of our cats or a human who goes near them to try to calm things down) gets hurt, but Critter Ridder isn't strong enough that we can just sprinkle a little and keep trespassing felines away.  It would take quite a bit to cover our whole deck, and I don't know how long it would work--surely rain, snow, and/or time would do it in before too much time passed.<br />So this product isn't completely without merit, but it isn't a miracle cure-all either.

review/summary: Effectiveness is iffy...expensive for the amount provided..
review/text: This stuff sure smells spicy - black and hot pepper spicy.  It comes in a nice shaker and is considered organic.<br /><br />The issue seems to be that it has a limited effectiveness.  I shook it around our garden and under the birdfeeder where the squirrels and chipmunks congregate, but they either got used to it right away or I didn't use enough.  That's the other thing - for the price this seems to be a small amount and did not go very far.  The container is quite a bit less than I was expecting - 5 lbs is not much at all.  They indicate this is enough to cover 300 square feet but it's pretty hard to shake it out that finely or evenly so your'e really only covering perhaps 100 square feet.

review/summary: Basically, what seems to be a mixture of strong spices
review/text: I understand why many like this and many don't.  Havahart is asking you to throw down a lot of loot for what amounts to something that smells like mace (the spice) and nutmeg and cloves (or whatever) all mixed together into a small container.  While spices aren't cheap, their potencies will fade with time (compare freshly ground pepper with the pre-ground stuff), so that's why some are outcrying that the stuff only lasts a month, etc.  I found the product worked best in conjunction with other pest control measures.  We were getting an opossum or two in our crawlspace (under the bathtub) along with accompanying fleas, so I crawled under the house for several hours (not fun) and sealed up a bunch of areas with flexible latticework, patio tiles, a staple gun, Great Stuff Pestblock Insulating Foam Sealant (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PDTIZI">Dow Product 11000714 "Great Stuff" Pestblock Foam Sealant - 12 Oz Can Gray (Pack of 8)</a> and the Havahart Critter Ridder Animal Repellent.  Bottom line is that you either need to use 100 pounds of this stuff and reapply it often (after rain, perhaps) OR you need to use it in conjunction with other pest control measures.  If you want to go with the former option, dumping vinegar, bleach and/or freshly ground black (or cayenne!) pepper might be just as effective and less expensive.

review/summary: I can't believe it...
review/text: I thought the raccoon problem was never going to go away. They're smart & dexterous, and strew my trash all over the place. In desperation I skeptically sprinkled this around the trash container area and couldn't believe it when the next day I had no problems. Or the next, or the next. It said it would last about a month before re-applying, and it did.<br /><br />It worked so well that after a month, I'd almost forgotten about the problem, when it must have worn off - trash messes began reappearing and it needed a fresh dose. Reapplying kept them away again.<br /><br />I do treat the product with care, but really have no worries. Once it's been down a short while, you don't know it's there but the animals do. It sounds like it isn't cruel, either, as it simply irritates their eyes making them want to keep away.<br /><br />My area is about 8 X 8 (feet), and the perimeter is all I treat. The one container will treat my area at least four times.<br /><br />If you have animal problems, give it a try.

review/summary: Seems to be working
review/text: This product is designed to keep away pests - small pests- when they dig and ruin gardens.  I originally wanted this for use around the perimeter of my vegetable garden, but it is not for use near food plants.<br /><br />I have had only a few problems in other areas of my yard which I could test this on, but the problems are not as bothersome as they are with the vegetable garden.<br /><br />I have tested it around flowers and garbage areas (we live in a rural area) and so far nothing has touched those areas for 30 days.  We have not had a lot of rain, so I can not comment on how long it lasts during rainy seasons.<br /><br />So far, nothing seems to be bothering those two areas, but again, the real problem areas are my vegetable garden so I wish I could have tested it on those areas.  But at least I have it for the garbage area in the winter, and the other areas which seem to attract the little pests.<br /><br />I will update with any further input as I continue to use this.

review/summary: Results will vary
review/text: I don't have too many wild animals in my area, the occasional rabbit or lizard, but lots of dogs and a few cats. I have never seen a raccoon or skunk in my neighborhood, probably due to the lack of habitat in the immediate area. I love my neighbor's cat and he apparently loves me, but I can live without the dead birds he constantly brings me. I spread some of this stuff around and he hasn't "gifted" me all summer. Also people's dogs seem to lift up their heads and trot briskly away from my yard instead of nosing around with interest for a comfortable spot to squat so I would say it did work on animals with sensitive noses. The problem is we had so much frequent rain this year (2-3 times per week for about 5 or 6 weeks) and I had to reapply so often it just ran out so fast. That's not the manufacturer or the product's fault, but I may have to try the hot chili pepper and powder before I decide buy more.

I sprinkled more each day (heck, I've got 5 pounds of this stuff) and after 3 or 4 days the cats seemed to actually come around less frequently.  Partial success.  It does seem to repel rabbits and raccoons better than cats!

review/text: I put a line of this stuff around my yard (it covered the half of my yard [going down border] that I have problems with neighbor dogs).  The stuff is easy to pour and you can easily walk around and sprinkle the stuff around.  I have not seen any animals in my yard (main concern is dogs), and when I see dogs running around I do not see them coming into my yard.  My only thing to note, is that dogs seem to hate this stuff.  We put it around our yard, and dogs in a nearby fence (about 10 feet away), started growling and barking and baring there teeth as we put the stuff around.  So be careful if you do it near a dog, as they seem to get very violent toward you when you have this stuff out.<br /><br />In the end this seems to work and covers a pretty good amount of coverage, however, dogs seem to hate it so hopefully that will mean they will stay away and out of my yard!

I tried everything to stop the dog , nothing worked. Finally, i poured some of the Havahart critter ridder into the hole - it worked wonders.My dog not only stopped digging that whole, she gives the front door a wide berth. The packaging of the repellent is also well thought, it comes in a plastic container that has a pop-up dispenser which you can close by pressing down after use.It is tightly sealed, so unwanted pouring out is prevented. This definitley keeps DOGS away from unwanted places.

review/summary: As good as any animal repellent
review/text: This is a scent-based animal repellent.  Cats, raccoons and opossums come into my yard over the fence, or under it, and I sprinkled this product near their entry points.  They avoid it for about a week, but I find they tend to enter at other places; if they are coming to feed or to bother my cat, they wreak their havoc anyway.  Water, either sprinklers or rain, completely inactivates the product.<br /><br />I don't use scent-based repellents much any more.  If I were trying to protect a very small area - say, a patio - this might do, but there is no way to use this kind of product to protect a whole yard.

review/text: I used this repellant to kind of set a boundary for my dog. We have pet ducks and the dog likes to harass them or chase them sometimes when they are out of their coop.<br /><br />I poured this fairly heavily in basically a line, in a half circle and then scattered some radomly bordering the ducks' main area that they like to hang out in. It actually has worked well. My dog can smell it and he will stop almost dead in his tracks, sniff quick and look around almost like he is confused. I am sure at some point he will just jump right over it or run through it, but with it used heavily it seems to work so far.<br /><br />I haven't noticed the ducks trying to pick at it to eat it and they don't seem to be bothered by it either.<br /><br />So in my case, for this use, it seems to be a great product so far. We didn't have an issue with any other animals, so I can't really speak on much else - just our own dog.

review/text: I love that this product is really organic and will not harm anything, just keep it away.  I know some people are complaining about the smell, and while it is a bit black peppery, it does the job.  Frankly, I would rather notice the black pepper smell than to have to put up with some chemical smell and wonder if it was harming me, my dog or the environment.<br /><br />I had a problem with possum getting into the garbage cans, and tried lots of other stuff that neighbors and friends said would work.  None of them did, but so far this is working for 2 weeks straight.  I know it is working, because I have seen possum getting into other trash cans in the neighborhood, but avoiding ours.  Another neighbor has complained about raccoons and squirrels, but have not had problems with them, either.  We've had some rainfall since I put it out, but the rain was light and did not seem to wash away the powder to the extent that it quit working.  The only reason I am not yet giving it five stars is because it's only been a few weeks.

review/summary: Keeps the Cat Out of My Indoor Potted Plants, But I Need to Re-Apply Every 2 Weeks.
review/text: Citter Ridder's main ingredients are Oil of Black Pepper & Piperine (extracted from black pepper).  The product states that it is safe to use around cats, dogs & other small mammalian wildlife.<br /><br />My main purpose was to put it on my indoor potted plants to keep the cats out of the plants.  CRITTER RIDDER WORKS!  No more sleeping in the pots, chewing the leaves (pots are tall enough so the leaves do not hang down far enough for kitty to reach), or using the dirt as a kitty commode.<br /><br />The container is 5lbs, so large enough for multiple applications.  It has a good handle & the shaker is easy to use, but there really is no measuring - the product comes out of 2 large holes in the pop-up lid.  It does smell like ground pepper & may make you sneeze. But, in my opinion, a little sneeze is worth it if the cats stay away from my plants.<br /><br />I've found that I have a cat that wants in my plants no matter what, so the 30 days is too long to wait in between applications - I re-apply every 2 weeks & that seems to keep the cat at bay.  The plants are happier.

review/summary: More Like Critter Pepper
review/text: This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:<br /><br />#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.<br />#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.<br />#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.<br /><br />The other 99.3% are "other ingredients".<br /><br />When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.<br /><br />I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.<br /><br />While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.<br /><br />I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.<br /><br />But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.<br /><br />For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.

review/text: Crazy Richard's is a tremendous peanunt butter for those peanut butter lovers who enjoy a great peanut butter without salt and without hydrogenated oil added.  Initially mixing in the peanit oil which settles at the top of the jar is required.<br /><br />If the peanut butter is very fresh, mixing in the oil is easily accomplished, but as the peanut butter ages, the peanut solids become more firm, as more peanut oil separates from the peanut solids.  Regardless of the effort required to mix the peanut oil into this great peanut butter, it is worth it!!

Then you can remove and refrigerate without the separation and the peanut butter will remain firm.<br /><br />If however you prefer soft and creamy peanut butter, remove from the freezer after four hours and let sit on the counter overnight. The next morning it will be very creamy. Refrigerate and there will be no separation of oils and the peanut butter will remain soft.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!

review/summary: Nice training size
review/text: Ingredients good for dog with wheat allergies. I use them for training and the size, a small bone shape about 1" long, is good. They are soft enough to break in half, but not so soft as to make a mess or crumble easily. Training for obedience, Rally & agility means we do lots of training and need a variety of small treats that are easy to carry.... these fit the bill.

review/summary: Who knew dogs were crazy for blueberries!
review/text: I picked up a box of the blueberry treats while vacationing in DC as a treat for the dogs. I loved the tiny size because we're doing a lot of training at the moment and the dogs were putting on weight (two toy poodles and a Lab#. Who knew that all three would be crazy for the blueberry treats - all three run to the cookie dish and sit patiently until they get a couple of blueberry bones #they are small treats which allows me to give two or three treats instead of breaking one into pieces). Even the Lab, who has had weight issues for years, loves these treats. Who knew dogs liked blueberries!

The treats are small in size, but you can give several and not feel guilty about it. (Because 4 of these is equal to a normal sized treat, and because blueberries are supposed to be good for dogs.) This dog loved them, and kept begging for more!

My little long haired boy sees the box and spins until I give him one. They are soft and are manageable for the tiny dogs with tiny teeth. Sojos came out with a statement that they DO NOT USE any of the peanut butter affected by the recent recalls. So you can relax if you want to try them!

review/summary: Some liked them, some ignored them
review/text: My 6 Greyhounds received the chicken pot pie flavored treats as an early Easter surprise from their Auntie. Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new. If it were not for the tiny size of these treats, they would most likely have been a great big hit here.

This product is well known in the voice over/singing  business - as the best tea for the benefits it provides.  You do have to steep it a while before drinking & in my opinion, the tea is not very paletable.  But I am willing to drink it for the benefits it provides.  If you are a singer or voice over artist - it does exactly what it says: it coats your throat & you can sing or talk for a very long time.  It's worth a try & the Slippery Elm DOES indeed coat your throat.<br /><br />Thanks ~<br />Rose of Rose Recordings, LLC<br />rosecllc dot com

Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that. No matter if it's a sore throat from sinus drainage, a cold, or whatever else, this tea has always cleared up all the itchy, scratchy, and painful problems I've had for at least a couple of hours at a time. That's more than a lot of medicine is able to do.

review/summary: Don't let the picture of delicious ginger cubes fool you
review/text: Frontier's candy product actually comes in the form of flat, stringy ginger chips that seem freeze-dried rather than crystallized. Although the ginger is hot,sweet and spicy (and I like that), each piece was difficult to chew. Often, it felt like chewing cud (sorry, too much information I know), but I was literally left with a stringy, wet wad in my mouth after eating each piece. Couldn't even swallow...more like eating ginger gum than candies.<br /><br />I didn't even finish off the entire bag. Ginger candy is one of my favorite candies -- up there with chocolate for me. Not being able to finish off the ginger, tells you something. I only eat this stuff when I'm desperate for something to snack on, and even afterward, ick. There isn't even a calming medicinal effect I usually experience with ginger. It's more of a laxative-like effect than tummy nirvana.<br /><br />I prefer Reed's crystallized ginger and The Ginger People's crystallized ginger candies to this stuff. I wish Amazon would take the picture down. A little truth in advertising please. Put the real picture of ginger chips up to stop confusing the buyer.<br /><br />Sorry, but I will not be buying this again.

review/text: I ordered this item because the illustration shows ginger pieces resembling the best crystallized ginger I've ever purchased, from the large counter jar at Fortnum & Mason in London, perfect cubes of the tenderest most delicately flavored ginger ever. These Frontier pieces are irregularly shaped flat slices, stuck together, and have a sharp taste, much sharper than Australian crystallized ginger even. I'm guessing Frontier got its stock from China. There is no country of origin listed on the label. I suppose I'll wait for Trader Joe's to get some Australian ginger in for my next purchase. Or until I cash in my IRA for a couple pounds of Fortnum & Mason candied ginger on my next trip to London.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I bought the 16oz package after my previous supplier was back ordered. The ginger was dark, springy and had an off flavor. Maybe I am just spoiled, but I threw out the whole lot, after I received my 5lbs from previous supplier.

review/summary: Great Ginger!
review/text: I particularly like this ginger -- it is hotter than some -- much more actual ginger to it. And, it is reasonably priced! The actual pieces are flat and not cubes as shown.

review/summary: Gone Way Wrong
review/text: Product does not resemble the picture at all.  I was expecting the cubed ginger and got slices of dried-out, tasteless nothing.  The burn was there but not the taste.

review/summary: not a fan
review/text: I expected slices despite the pictures of cubes, so that wasn't a problem. The problem was the slices were super saturated in sugar and gummy/sticky to boot. I wasn't looking for candy. I was looking for ginger to aid in digestion made palatable by a coating of sugar. That is not what this product is. Ginger as an incredibly strong, pungent taste that is all but unnoticeable in this product.

review/summary: texture too "sugary"
review/text: I like my ginger with a nice strong flavor, which these consistently have.  But...the quality is just too sugary for me.  It is like eating a sugar cube. I have had others bought online that are much less crumbly in the mouth and don't have a sugary, gritty feel.  Try others before this one.  my opinion only; everyone has a preference.

review/summary: So-so, not enough ginger flavor
review/text: Wasn't spicy enough for me -- too sugary. Ginger cubes probably would've preserved more of a "ginger spice" taste, but wafters are thinner and it was more sugary than I anticipated. Still tasted good though, but I didn't feel that spicy warmth from eating these.

review/text: This crystallized ginger is excellent for and upset stomach or for dealing with bloating.  The taste takes a little getting used to, but after awhile it's rather refreshing.

review/summary: Love it.
review/text: Ok, I actually hate Marmite, but my English husband loves the stuff.  I was so happy to find Marmite on Amazon and especially in the new squeezy bottle.  Any one who has used Marmite from a jar will tell you what a pain it is to get the gooey black gold out of the bottom of the jar.  Problem solved with the new squeezy bottle.  Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious! Outstanding! Five Stars
review/text: I picked up a jar of Dickinson's Vanilla Curd (9.5 ounce) in the jams and jellies section of a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. F & E are an English company and they have a lot of British items in the store. Well, I'd never heard of Vanilla Curd but it seemed interesting and one of the instructions said it could be used as a spread in the manner of jams or jellies. Okay, into the cart it went and I had a spread of it on toast the next morning. Oh, my! It was delicious! Overwhelming! I can't believe how good this stuff is! It's smooth and creamy and has a real nice strong vanilla taste. I assumed it was something manufactured in England and imported, but in looking at the label I find it's from The Dickinson Family, Inc. (since 1897) of Oxnard, California, who manufacture English-style things. Well, I just can't imagine the real English item being any better. Outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The best pie ever!!!!
review/text: You haven't lived until you've tasted a pie made with little wild mountain blackberries.  Definitely worth every penny!  A treat for a special occasion.  Perfect with vanilla ice cream.  Mmmmmmm...good for a 4th of July treat too.  My family has lived in the Pacific Northwest since the late 1800s and these blackberries have always been prized by loggers in the region.  The patches are extremely hard to find now...don't mistake them for the big, seedy domestic blackberries that grow everywhere.  These are tart and delicious.

review/summary: A Good Base For A Meatless Chili
review/text: By itself this chili is pretty good, but one dimensional (faux meat in chili sauce):  3.75 Stars.  -But this product is great (4+ Stars) if you use it as a 'meat' and spice base for your chili:  add tomatoes, onions, peppers, beans, etc.  Be warned 10 pounds (and I did receive 10 pounds) is a lot of chili -especially if you add to it!  -One half of a three plus pound bag filled a very large pan (sans additional veggies).
