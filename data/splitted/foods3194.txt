review/summary: I Love Love Love this cappuccino
review/text: I looked in all the stores around me and couldn't find a cappuccino that i really liked or that even tasted good. I came across this cappuccino on here and it was affordable and you get a lot in the box..... so i decided to try it. It is amazing sooooo good....i actually like it better than i do the gas station cappuccinos!! So happy that i found it on here and am finding myself wanting it every day. A+ from me!!! =)

review/text: I should have trusted the other reviews and stayed away from this. Some reviewers compare this to gas station machine cappuccino but I have had way better "cappuccinos" from gas station machines than this.<br /><br />Edit (10/9/2012) : I now see a ton of 5 star reviews in the last month or two for this trash! The surprise is that all of them are "Amazon Verified Purchase" and most of them are the only review the purchaser has written. If this isn't a case of cooked up reviews, I don't know what is!!

review/summary: Great tasting and good price
review/text: First off i am not sure what people expect. This Fr Vanilla Cap has a great taste, creamy texture and needs nothing added to it.<br />But AGAIN, i read the product info and it stated (sugar/sucralose blend)<br /><br />I use SPLENDA brand sucralose anyway in my coffee. If you do not like the artificial sweetener, then do not order this product. But do not vote it down because you didn't read the info and/or sucralose leaves an after-taste.<br />I have no after-taste from it and therefore I enjoy this product very much.<br /><br />I use this in the B60 Keurig on the middle setting (8oz if i remember correctly)<br />My Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Creamy texture<br />-Tastes great<br /><br />Will buy again<br />For people with the dopey comments:<br />Let me add: IT IS MACHINE-MADE cappuccino! What do you think a cheap Keurig is? Gourmet coffee?

review/text: It tastes like a decent powdered cappuccino because that's exactly what it is. I noticed the used k-cup was very light compared to the other ones I had brewed, I opened the top and it was empty. There's no actual coffee in this, just instant. I think it's an okay value for the price, but I wouldn't purchase it again.

review/text: This might have been okay, but I have to ask: why do so many companies that make seasoning blends feel they have to add salt to the herbs??!! One can always add sea salt or regular salt to something. I like to spice up pasta sauce in different ways, most of which already has salt. In order to get the flavor of herbs I wanted from this I would be adding too much additional salt. Next time, fuggedaboudit.

review/summary: My dog loves this treat
review/text: I learned about this treat in a magazine article reviewing it. I have been looking for convenient treat, which is small, dry (so that I don't have to keep in the fridge), and irresistible to my dog, which is almost impossible since my dog is not food motivated at all. A treat my dog loves most has been roast beef from deli which I have to go to supermarket every week to resupply. Then I saw this product review and decided to give it a try. I wasn't really expecting any enthusiasm from my dog since the treat is just dried piece of something that I couldn't even smell anything out of it. But to my surprise, my dog sniffed it and gulp! And he was waiting for the next piece intently looking at me. It seems he likes it as much as bloody roast beef! The product seems a bit costly per weight, but the pieces are so small and light, actually I got more in terms of number of pieces than I thought. I think I found a right treat for my dog.

review/summary: Even better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!
review/text: I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as another reviewer noted, the addition of sugar (NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!<br /><br />P.P.S.  I have a new "best way" to make this:  take a "Working" glass  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LL83X6">Luminarc 3053195 Working Glass jar 21oz, 12 PACK.</a>, pop the contents of one packet of iced Via into it, fill with skim milk up to the top of the highest indentations in the glass (exactly 16 oz!), and stir.  Done!  I used to then plop some chocolate syrup into it but now find I no longer need even that.  Behold, in seconds a frappuchino that is bigger, non-fat (as opposed to "low fat"), and lower in sugar than the commercial bottles.  And if you need to take it away, put the matching lid on the glass (search "working glass" -- all lids fit both sizes of working glasses).  My new, 8-second method of preparing a marvelous frappuchino to start the day!!! (almost as fast as just grabbing a bottle out of the refrigerator, and both cheaper and lower in calories, too!).

review/summary: Alright but weird sweet taste
review/text: This instant coffee is decent and easy to make really quick but there are a few issues. Pouring the packet into a regular sized water bottle will result in pretty much sweet motor oil. The coffee will just be too strong and too sweet to drink. Maybe they should make smaller packets for people that dont want a huge glass/bottle of this stuff. After finding the right mixture amount this stuff is just okay. I would rather bre some coffee at night and put it in the fridge for the morning since I enjoy iced coffee.

review/summary: Makes pretty awesome iced coffee - wish it came unsweetened
review/text: I don't take sugar in my hot coffee, nor do I order cold, sweetened coffee drinks because I'd rather not drink my calories.  However, I do love an iced coffee pretty much any time of year.  So when I saw these, I had to try them.  It's pretty amazing that all you do is dump the packet into a glass, add cold water and stir, and get coffee that tastes this good.  One thing that is annoying is that one half a packet makes one serving, according to the nutritional information, but getting the coffee/water proportion right with just half the packet is a pain.  So it's a lot easier to make the whole thing.  But then that's 100 calories.  So a star off for that, and for not having an unsweetened version in the product line. But otherwise, highly recommended!

review/summary: Bought this at the store, but....
review/text: I will be buying from AMAZON, moving forward- better price!<br /><br />This is one that (I think) works best in a blender, be it a personal size or more traditional blending unit.  Super-simple, and a great taste. I like to add in a bit of waffle-cone ice-cream and ice when I blend it - really outstanding.  The coffee in this gives one the "punch" that one might expect from Starbucks, but I have been known to add a bit of expresso as well. Call me crazy!<br /><br />As for blenders, I have a big honker which probably could raise the dead (VERY LOUD), a mid level blender and a personal size - it is just a matter of how fast you want to make your drink, and the clean up factor.<br /><br />Being lazy ( my nature ) I frequently do this in the personal blender, or the mid size.  You will need to experiment a bit to get your best blend, but it is well worth the effort.<br /><br />When I have the time, or have a guest, the mid-level blender is ideal. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y1SAA2">Ninja Kitchen System Pulse Blender with Free Cookbook - Model BL205</a>  I have had the best results using this. It can take the ice and anything else, yet has a compact footprint, and the book is nice. I think the same thing without the book is also available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GYRXA0">Ninja Kitchen System Pulse Blender - Model BL204</a><br /><br />If you avoid the ice ( or have small cubes) , I would  go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EJHEPO">Hamilton Beach Single-Serve Blender with 2 Jars and 2 Lids</a> to make your Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee drinks.  The low-ish wattage is best for quick, soft blends.<br /><br />As always, I think of gifts, and this blend would be great for many on your list, be it the college types, or perhaps that senior mom and dad who might not go to Starbucks as frequently as you do.  Even without a blender , this product tastes GREAT, and might be a nice "comfort gift" to send along as a just-because gift.  I am sure it would be appreciated.

review/summary: I'm hooked
review/text: It pains me to shell out almost $8 for six packets of instant iced coffee, but then I compare it to what I'd pay at a coffee kiosk.  It makes a potent 16 oz. drink (including ice) with the classic Starbuck's flavor.  I add a pack of artificial sweetener to mine because I like a sweeter drink than what the mix alone provides. I'd give it five stars at $6 (a dollar per drink).  I must have this product when I travel.  You can get almost the same results with two of packets of their regular VIA but you'll need to heat a couple of ounces of water in the microwave to get it to dissolve.  Then you just top it off with cold water, ice and sweeetener to suit your taste.

review/summary: good purchase at a pretty good price
review/text: I bought these for my brother. With the FSSS, I get them for a bit cheaper than he can get at the local stores. And since he goes through them pretty quickly, the money adds up. The price does fluctuate, so the quality of the deal does change from time to time. However, the product (according to my brother) is awesome.

review/text: I simply can't live without this stuff. I was at Sams Club one day and saw it for sale, and I have been hooked ever since. I have been drinking the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee every day for the past year and I love it. The powder, along with 16 oz water and a handful of ice, fits nicely into a 20 oz tumbler. I use a stainless steel one to keep it super cold.

review/summary: Really good for instant
review/text: For an instant mix this stuff is awesome, and to me it tastes close enough to what you get at Starbucks.  If you haven't tried it before I would recommend picking up a 3 pack from the store before you buy them in a large quantity (that's what I did, and now I'm hooked!).<br /><br />I usually mix one packet with 16oz (or slightly more) of water in a measuring cup and then pour it over a large cup full of ice.  Doing it this way you actually get 2 full glasses which, in my opinion, is more than enough.  I think I would actually be happy if the packets only made half as much and there were twice as many in a box but I guess if you don't want two full cups you can always just use half a packet.  I don't find the need to water it down any more than it recommends (aside from whatever ice melts into the drink) and I don't find it too sweet at all.  I was happy to find these on Amazon as it saved me some money as compared to the cost at the store.  For the price you can't really go wrong with these especially if you frequently pay a hefty price for iced coffee while you're out.

review/text: I love this coffee. It's just like an iced latte at Starbucks, but the price is so much better. The flavor is great and it is so easy to make and go; just add to cold bottled water or pour over a glass of ice cubes. It couldn't be easier and it is just yummy. Totally refreshing in the Summer too, but I love it all year-round.

review/summary: strong iced coffee just like starbucks worth the $$'s
review/text: i wasn't too eager to be paying $6 to $7 for only 6 packets of instant iced coffee mix at my local safeway supermarket but i had to remember how much i spent at Starbucks just for their coffees and iced coffees and so i wanted to try these out and I'm glad I did because I loved it and realized they were definitely worth the $$'s.<br /><br />I'm not really a coffee drinker (i probably drink 1 cup of coffee once or twice a week max) and only drink coffee when I really need a pickup.  I can't drink coffee straight either and need a moderate volume of milk or half and half in it because the coffee taste is too bitter for me.  I'm ordinarily a tea drinker.  But I love iced drinks in the afternoon or night, especially iced drinks that I can instantly make without having to wait a long time to heat water and having to cool them in the refrigerator or freezer.<br /><br />Each pack contains 6 little packets of starbucks coffee mix powder. It's true as the other reviewer said that you can make 2 to 4 or 5 cups of iced coffee just with one packet so it's really worth the $$'s and really you can just use half or less of a packet to make your cup of iced coffee - the coffee is that strong!!  If it had sugar, I could barely taste it because the coffee was VERY STRONG so I had to add 3 packets of  stevia sweetener packets and 4 mini-moo half-and-half cups.<br /><br />Lately, to make it creamier, I'll take half a packet and dissolve the coffee powder into the water first along with the sweetener, then adding milk, using a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of water:milk.  Just like Starbucks, add a large dollop of whipped cream on top for a luxurious iced dessert drink.....mmmmmm......

review/summary: Great Price, good coffee
review/text: I can't stand hot coffee, or hot beverages in general. I also can't stand the price of iced coffee compared to hot coffee (at least where I used to buy my coffee.) If you follow the suggested serving size of half a packet (8oz) it's ~58� a cup. I am a gluttonous stimulant addict, so I rarely drink that little.<br /><br />Since taste is a personal opinion, I normally wouldn't write about it. However, to me, this is a wonderful taste. I've tried all kinds of coffee, with all sorts flavors, additives, and liquors. I'm sick of complicating coffee, but I can't drink it black/straight. I think this coffee has the perfect amount of sweetness.<br /><br />Also, I save and reuse 20oz water bottles, and now I do the same with the bottles that are ~16oz. The ~16oz (I think they're 16.9oz) bottles make it really easy to judge the recommended amount of water needed.

review/summary: regular is delicious, not crazy about the caramel
review/text: I absolutely love this product, especially for its portability. Its perfect for work as you dont have to worry about stocking your desk with coffee or worry about using the community coffee maker or tea pot when everyone comes down with a cold (LOL).<br /><br />I take an empty water bottle, fill it up to an inch from the top with nonfat milk, pour in the Via powder, shake, screw on the cap, and I'm ready to jump in the car or go for a walk. I notice letting it sit in the fridge for a while allows the powder to dissolve more into the milk. Its also good with water, but as I'm a huge Latte fan, I always drink this with milk only!<br /><br />The best thing about Iced Via is that though it is sweet, it has way less sugar than the frapuccinos at Starbucks. It  seems to have the perfect amount of sugar without being too sweet.<br /><br />Im also a huge Nonfat caramel macchiato fan, so I was very surprised when I didnt like the caramel flavor. With milk its way too sweet, and with water it really emphasized the caramel flavor which tasted strange.<br /><br />EDIT: Since giving up milk a week ago, I started mixing this with West Soy Unsweetened Chocolate Soy Milk and it was sooooo delicious! I'm going to try it with Blue Diamond Unsweetened Chocolate Almond Milk next. I love this product!

review/summary: Can't go back to other iced coffees
review/text: Once I got used to Starbucks via iced coffee (because it was stronger than I'm used to), the other brands just didn't taste as good and didn't have the coffee taste. That's because the other brands put a lot of creamer in their iced coffee mixes while Starbucks puts no creamer. It's basically instant coffee that dissolves in cold water or milk and sugar. I take two teaspoonfuls and mix into a tall glass of milk leaving enough room for 4 or 5 ice cubes, stir and add ice. I get a little over twelve glasses of iced coffee the way I do it. The sweetness is perfect and doesn't overwhelm, while the other brands lean more towards a dessert drink.

review/summary: Natural, Lightly Sweetend - JUST KIDDING
review/text: On the back it says "...added pure cane sugar for just the right amount of sweetness." Uhm yeah, who is Starbucks to tell me what the perfect sweetness is? Because my perfect sweetness is ZERO. I like my coffee black or at least have the option to sweeten to taste with Stevia or Agave. I hesitated buying this for a long time because of the added sugar which I hate any product does, but really needed a quick pick-me-up specific for the hot weather. I didn't find any other option for iced instant, so I reluctantly bought this at my grocery store. When I poured the contents, I could barely even see any coffee, it was sugar in practically a 4-to-1 ratio! I check the back, 11 grams of sugar for HALF the packet. Gross. Hopefully something better will come along the way soon... or I should stop slacking and make a pitcher of coffee ahead of time to bring to work, le sigh.

review/text: I know some have bashed the price on this, but I think it's a great deal. Ranch packets at the store generally cost over $1 per packet and unless you divide up the contents, its harder to control how much based on the amount of ranch dressing or dip needed.<br />I make all my own ranch dressings since pretty much every kind in the grocery store aisle is loaded w/ vegetable oils and sugar/corn syrup. I make 1-1.5 cups of mayo w/ egg yolks and olive oil, then add a 2-3Tb of this stuff and another 1-1.5 cups of milk and we have enough ranch dressing for the week.

review/summary: A fine water cracker
review/text: They are fine. I have no idea why someone would call them bland and gummy. You bought the wrong thing if you were looking for a wheat cracker. Water crackers are supposed to be bland. Best of all the price is decent. Water crackers are basic, so I do not understand why grocery stores charge $3 and $4 a box.

review/summary: Disappointing wheat cracker
review/text: I was looking for a wheat cracker that I could try rather than the Carr's,,which have sulfites in them though they are delicious. Well, these aren't the ones.  I've tried cheese, almond butter, and nothing makes these very palatable.  Really a bummer of a cracker.  I'm probably going to try to give them away.  I'm not quite sure why they are so bland and gummy.  But they are.  The package looks elegant enough,  So the taste of these crackers is a big disappointment.

In-store we paid over $4-something for one bag.  Granted we never eat a bunch of them at one time.  Usually after 4-5 of them, I'm satisfied.  I love that they're peanut free!

review/summary: Delicious natural, salty snack with ingredients you can pronounce!
review/text: I first had Somersaults when I purchased a $6 snack pack on a Delta flight. The box came with a .5 oz package of these Santa Fe Salsa Somersaults. Yum! The crunchy bites are each about the size of a nickel but thicker. They are crunchy, a little salty, and a little spicy.<br /><br />The most promenent flavor is sunflower seeds (the main ingredient) so if you don't like sunflower seeds, this isn't the snack for you. The sunflower seed flavor isn't overwhelming by any means though.<br /><br />Most impressive was the list of ingredients that you can actually pronounce. These aren't gluten free though, in case you were wondering. The first few ingredients: Sunflower seeds, wheat flour, whole wheat flour, sesame seeds, vital wheat gluten.<br /><br />Nutritional content in a .5 oz package: 70 calories, 30 are from fat. 125 mg sodium, 7 g carb, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein. So I wouldn't down a big bag and expect this to still be considered a healthy snack, but I think it's good in moderation.<br /><br />I ordered the same snack pack on the flight home just to get another pack of these Somersaults. I plan to try more of their flavors. They have a new cinnamon flavor that sounds pretty good for a sweet snack. At first, I was just going to order big bags, but then I started thinking about the temptation to finish out a bag of these in one sitting. So I may stick to the smaller packs.

review/summary: Magnificent Matcha!
review/text: I am a new tea drinker and I am certainly new to the world of Matcha tea. But oh, what a wonderful world it is! After reading all the rave reviews for Red Leaf Tea's amazing flavor assortment of Matcha teas on Steepster, I took the plunge and ordered their "2 in 1" Custom Matcha Tea. I chose Caramel and Madagascar Vanilla for my flavors and I am so glad I did! I am not sure I can adequately describe how much I love this tea and these flavors.<br /> I had been a little apprehensive prior to ordering mainly because I had never heard of it before and it was so green. Even after it arrived, I didn't dive right into it. After a couple days I decided to make some and see what all the hype was about. One taste and I am hooked. The flavor is amazing! I had it hot and then I made some cold. They were both awesome! I mixed up a tumbler full for my daughter for her morning tea at work and she absolutely loved it. She said she thought it would also taste great in cupcakes and I agree! Now my wheels are turning about all the awesome ways I can incorporate this flavorful Matcha into recipes. On Red Leaf Tea's website they have some delicious recipes for smoothies, frappes etc that I can not wait to try. I love that there are so many possibilities of ways to use this tea besides drinking it (which is awesome in itself!).<br />I have been trying to diet but have a bit of a sweet tooth. Drinking this Caramel & Madagascar Vanilla was like having a dessert. I was totally satisfied. With a bit of sweetener added to these already uniquely superb flavors, this was like drinking a high calorie fattening dessert but was actually guilt free and healthy.<br />Finally, I definitely need to comment on the amount of energy I feel after drinking this tea. It is a really good energy not like a coffee or sugar rush. My whole transition from coffee and soft drinks to tea was to reap the vast health benefits associated with tea. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the various and significant health benefits of Matcha tea. Besides the antioxidants & cancer fighting properties, it also aids in weight loss and mood enhancement!<br />Great taste, health benefits and lots of ways to use it. It doesn't get better than that!<br />I highly recommend this brand of Matcha tea.

review/text: I would like to hear from Smokehouse as to "country of origin" for the chicken they use in this product - since all the other products they sell (like regular chicken strips) are from China.  Is this basically the same Chinese-processed chicken imported and then combined with some vitamin E inside a US factory? Made in USA doesn't equate with product country of origin.<br /><br />I wouldn't be suspicious except that they are a huge importer of chicken from China.  Why would this product be any different?

review/summary: One of Two dogs accepts them, but shipping is a problem
review/text: I've been trying to find chicken jerky dog treats not made in China and these are the closest I've been able to find to this point (but I've found some made in Maine that look possible - I haven't tried them yet but intend to). These are US made, but not like what comes from China. They are hard and brittle and formed in some fashion into strips/bars. One of our dogs accepts them OK (not her favorite, but will take them), the other just turns his head away and only eats them when he realizes it's all there's going to be.<br /><br />But my last shipment from Amazon is going to be my last. I ordered several bags and they arrived with the pieces mostly in small shards. Don't know if Amazon shipped them in that condition or the shipper managed to mangle them en route (the box was not mangled in any way but it could have been dropped). But given the fact they're not ideal anyway, I'm not ordering any more.<br /><br />Not my favorite and not really recommended. Going to keep looking. The Blue Buffalo chicken treats (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ITWDKO">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken Dog Jerky Treats</a>) are good, but outrageously expensive ($10 for a 3.2 oz bag!) and mostly very small pieces, so after one bag, no more.

review/text: I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.  My dog loved them, but had a diarrhea every time she went "number two" and neither we nor our vet could figure out why.  Finally after seeing the story about chews made in China, I stopped buying them.  Within a week my dog had totally stopped her diarrhea!  She has hardly had it one time since and that was last year.  Back to topic - the bag does say USA made which is comforting, but the chews are very hard and crunchy.  I just rescued a male Shih Tzu and he ate them, but my girl wasn't impressed.  I am still searching for a USA made chew that is not hard as a rock.

If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea, check out the FDA press release stating blue 1 is "casually linked" to fatalities they investigated.<br /><br />I recently attended an event where these relish packets (and another brand - also contains blue 1) were served. Stoopidly I dumped the packet onto my food and a few hours later, like clockwork, I was in severe abdominal distress. Major GI issues. Checking around, sure enough, these packets show blue 1 in the ingredients.  Just 1 packet had me doubled over in pain.. and much worse.  I cannot even enjoy a hot dog at a baseball game without worrying some company executive decided to add a petroleum based food coloring to PACKAGED PICKLE RELISH!!<br /><br />Parents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...

review/summary: What can I say, AXE smells good.
review/text: Just as my title suggests; Axe Original smells great. If you dont feel like swiping $100 at macys for armani this would be a economical 2nd choice.<br />One concern that I have, I last used this product 5 years ago. Back then I didn't sense such an over powering smell as it sprays out as I do now. It is so concentrated that I honestly have to hold my breath for 5 seconds whilst im spraying and till the vapor beings to settle down.<br />"I do not over spray" so maybe its just because I'm getting older.<br /><br />Over all AXE, smells great, its economical, and their commercials are cool.<br />enjoy.

review/summary: Less smelly = MORE GIRLS
review/text: I loved this fragrance from AXE. Congratulations to Unilever. Unfortunately there is no longer this fragrance here in Brazil, but hopefully soon Unilever bring him back here. For those who like to be always smelling, I recommend. Maybe some fragrances will not please you. Honestly, when I wore this fragrance around the year of 2001 here in Brazil, was praised by the girls. I was 13 years old. I started using AXE Hypinotic in 1999 and I know what is the "AXE Effect". I do not know why Unilever withdraw some fragrances market without more. Please Unilever, go back to Brazil with Adrenaline. I love AXE!

review/summary: Flavorful gummi bears!
review/text: I order the Jelly Belly gummi bears often and I am always impressed with the flavor and freshness.  I appreciate this brand using kosher gelatin; which coincides with my religious preferences.  The only thing I am not too happy about is whenever I or a friend orders this, it should be 24 packs that come, but lately we have only been receiving a box of 12.  Amazon is always helpful in crediting us back half the amount, but in all actuality, I truly want the product.  Still, if you have an affinity for gummi bears, you can not beat Amazon's price and Jelly Belly's flavor!

review/summary: Gummi Bears
review/text: Jelly Belly bears is expensive, but they are worth it if you love gummi bears.  I have tried all of the other brands that produce them, but I half to say Jelly Belly Bears are one of my top two favorite of all times.  They have an amazing taste and I can (and do) eat them by the box full.  I never had any issues with the bears being faulty like some other brands.  I gave it 4 stars b/c I cant give 4.5 stars on the rating.  Its expensive thats why I gave them 4 (4.5 on my scale) stars.
