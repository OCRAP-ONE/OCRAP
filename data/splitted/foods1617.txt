review/summary: It Is What You Make Of It!
review/text: OK..I received this as my freebie from Tassimo for registering my new Bosh Tassimo TAS10 machine...Here's the deal...the discs are filed with chocolate SYRUP..Your machine pumps hot WATER through the syrup so OF COURSE you are NOT going to get the creamy hot chocolate that you are used to getting from the packets or made on the stove. What I did was use a "skinny" (non-fat) milk disc FIRST...then I put in the hot chocolate syrup after the hot milk was pumped through into my cup. The finished product was a perfectly blended hot chcolate made with non-fat milk (the non-fat disc from the Gevalia Skinny Cappuccinos). You can do it my way or simply add your own milk or half & half of your choice! The point is...if you just use the syrup disc you are only going to get watery chocolate syrup! Anyway, the chocolate is tasty, would make an excellent cafe mocha and I will purchase more when I eventually run out. I took away a star only because I think they should include milk discs with it so it wouldn't be so confusing!

review/summary: Great Hot Chocolate
review/text: The key to this hot chocolate is to stir it after you have made it and to add whipped cream!  If you stir the drink and add whipped cream the flavor is very European and very good.  The first time I drank it I did not stir it and found the drink to be very watery.  Try stirring and everything will get better.

review/summary: Tassico Suchard Hote Chocolate
review/text: This is a nice hot chocolate but dont forget to add the milk. I love the Tassimo machine but they only offer this one hot chocolate which is dissapointing. Although they do offer Milka Hot Chocolate in Europe for this machine and it is wonderful and i wish they offered it in the US also. I will be glad when they also offer a low fat version of hot chocolate and to enable this to happen go onto the Tassimo Web site and put in a request because the more requests they receive then they may just add this to there collection.

review/summary: Keep it around
review/text: One of the great things about owning a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7W4YS">Braun Tassimo TA 1400 Hot Beverage System</a> is that you do not have to brew coffee that no one will drink. Likewise Tassimo has assorted teas available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PJC1I0">Braun 01318 Tassimo Twinings Earl Grey Tea Pods, 16 Pack</a>, to Gevalia 01317 Twinings Chai Tea Latte for Tassimo Coffee and Beverage Makers to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDEGGG">Gevalia 1549 8 T-Discs Twining Green Tea for Tassimo Brewing System</a>. But it offers only one hot chocolate-Suchard.<br /><br />Fortunately it is a very good chocolate that will be sure to please your kids and even you during late night chocolate attacks. We don't use as much hot chocolate as we do coffee and tea, but it is one Tassimo product I always keep in my cupboard.

But i was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this product--so that is part of why i wanted to try it.  i think it's the perfect blend for a mocha..  here was my recipe (note that it's for 2 people) one latte milk pod: split it between two glasses, one hot chocolate syrup: split it between the two glasses, 1 espresso pod per glass.  and voila, a great mocha!

review/summary: Watery & Too sweet
review/text: The title of the review really sums this up.  This seems a little sweet and just a hair watery.<br />Not horrible, but for as infrequently as I make Hot Chocolate, I would simply opt for heating up some milk on the stove, or go with a microwave cup of hot water and an instant packet.<br /><br />When I purchased my Tassimo machine a year or 2 ago, I also purchased a wide range of discs.  These are the only discs that remain from that original batch, and I've cycled through most of the others several times.<br /><br />I recently had a young niece and nephew visit,  who are grade school age, who enjoyed this.....so if you have some spare cupboard space...you can keep some around, but overall there might be room in the market for a Latte based version of this.

review/summary: Good as "Hot Chocolate" but mediocre "Hot Cocoa"
review/text: West-coast Americans often use the terms "Hot Chocolate" and "Hot Cocoa" interchangeably, but technically (and legally) they are somewhat different products.  Depending on the recipe Hot Chocolate tends to be a thin but strongly flavored drink, whereas Hot Cocoa is typically thicker but gently milk-chocolate flavored.<br /><br />Suchard's imitates the darker flavor of old-world Hot Chocolate, rather than the popular flavor of Hot Cocoa.<br /><br />So you might be justifiably disappointed if you're expecting flavor like Carnation or Swiss Miss (popular Hot Cocoa mixes).  But you might be pleased if you want a darker, stronger flavor than your usual supermarket cocoa.<br /><br />As Hot Chocolate goes, I found Suchard's very reminiscent of dark chocolates (like Hershey's "Special Dark") but overly sweet (again, like Hershey's "Special Dark").  It blends nicely with espresso, but it's a bit cloying on its own.<br /><br />Compared to Hot Cocoa, Suchard's doesn't have the thick texture a Carnation-lover might expect.  It doesn't taste milky or creamy, although there are milk ingredients.<br /><br />Judged solely as a traditional Hot Chocolate, Suchard's T-Discs are very good but not quite excellent.  But they're a poor substitute for Carnation or Swiss Miss if you prefer Hot Cocoa.

review/text: I LOVE my Tassimo but the Suchard's hot chocolate is just not good. I use the Tassimo for hot water and add whatever hot chocolate mix I happen to have from the grocery store. They're all better than Suchard's. It's weak, watery, and has very little chocolate flavor. I'm surprised Gevalia and Tassimo lend their names to this product. I tried one pod. I'm not sure what I'll do with the ones I have left. It's so bad that I don't even want to use them up. Sorry, Suchard.

review/text: I only purchased one box of this hot chocolate at first because I was concerned that I wouldn't like it.  I tend to be a bit snobbish with hot chocolate and will go thru great lengths to make a good cup.  Unfortunately, I don't always have time to do that, so I was hoping that this would at least be an acceptable alternative and it exceeded my expectations.  I served some of this at Thanksgiving and when the night was done, so was my supply of hot chocolate.  It was a huge hit.  Great product, great taste and consistency, especially when you consider it comes from a machine!  Well worth the purchase!!

review/summary: It pleases students!
review/text: I teach college and have a tassimo for my office. I keep an assortment of coffee, tea, cappuccinos, and the Suchard hot chocolate. When a student comes by for a long conference, I offer them a hot beverage. The chocolate (I either mix it with half and half from my refrigerator or use a latte or cappuccino t-disc) is a huge hit. I have students who come back for more--one guy just could not believe it. He had never had hot chocolate that was not made with a powdered mix and he just did not know it could taste like that.  This cup is rich, sweet, and with the half and half, incredibly creamy.  If you need a "chocolate fix", this is one of the best.  It helps soothe a flunked exam, a break-up with the boyfriend, a rejection letter from the first choice law school (to name a few times it has been used.)  If you are a university adviser, never underestimate the power of--at least the offer of--a hot beverage or some candy to break the ice with a student. Many of them have never come to an office and been treated like a welcome guest--and an adult.  It works wonders! Tassimo makes this very possible for my little office. My only problem is not drinking the Suchard myself!

review/text: I bought these olive oil packets for backpacking. They generally are perfect for back country food to avoid the mess and weight of a bottle of olive oil. The down side is the packaging needs work. Five packets out of the 105 were empty. They had not leaked but were simply factory defects. Then after I had sorted through the whole box to see how many were like this the next day I found one of the packets had sprung a leak and made a mess over half the packets which made it very difficult to track down the leaking one. This also has me in doubt about the packaging durability for the high altitude pressure changes that I will be encountering.

review/summary: Healthy Dressing on the go!
review/text: One thing I can almost guarantee.  You think you're eating a healthy salad at a restaurant?  Doubtful.  Likely the dressing is high in carbohydrates, or it contains an unhealthy polyunsaturated fat such as Canola, soybean, or corn oil.  Do your body a favor and feed it some healthy monounsaturated fats.  I bring these little packets with me to restaurants along with the same size packets of balsamic vinegar for a healthy salad dressing.  Don't think for one minute this is the same as balsamic vinegarette, those store bought vinegarettes say olive oil on the package, but often, that's not even the first ingredient on the list.  Often, they have more Canola (a.k.a. rapeseed) oil than anything else.  Just think about how long humans have been eating rapeseed, soybean, and corn oil, and how long humans have been eating olive oil.  The choice is clear.

review/text: I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.

review/text: My daughter was all good eating gerber and those jars. I checked out the happybaby products because I saw some great reviews online. She was okay eating them, and yeah she will probably eat them now.....but you can tell she hates it, she was even throwing up in the middle of her meals. I have like 50 packages of 3 different meals just sitting there on my kitchen, now I think it'd be animal cruelty to give it to my dog......

review/text: This flour is the most expensive flour that I have ever seen. It is also the best quality flour that I have ever purchased.  Breads and pizza come out much better than other bread flours that I have used.  It is good for you and has no additives. It is worth the cost.

review/summary: Expensive, quality flour
review/text: Unlike most whole wheat flours that do not bake well, this one does and most recopies using all-purpose white flour will work. This is a really high quality product. It makes home-made bread even better, and healthier. it is very expensive though, but in the end it is comparable to factory-made-bread in cost with superior flavor and nutrition.

review/summary: Excellent price
review/text: This is an excellent price on a must have item.  This is my third time ordering in the last six months. You get 4 bags of flour at five pounds each.  They recommend refrigerating after opening so I like that it is small bags and I just refrigerate one at at time (in an airtight container).  I've checked around for lower prices on organic flour (bread or otherwise) and it can't be found.  I use this every week to make bread. I do add extra gluten.  Theoretically you don't need to with whole wheat bread flour but I find it rises better if I do.  I bought gluten here on Amazon as well.  I think it was 6 or 8 boxes.  I'm still using it a year later so it was definitely worth the money.<br /><br />I really like Great River.  I recently bought their oraganic all purpose whole wheat flour.  I also love their seven grain bread flour.  I add about a cup of that to every bread and roll and hamburger bun recipe. Gives a nice little texture and taste.  Great River is the only flour I've used in the last year and I make everything from scratch so I've really had the opportunity to test it out.

review/summary: Great for making wheat bread or rolls
review/text: I have been trying to convert to more organic products but price is often a sore spot in my quest.  This flour is pricey but it makes great organic bread and rolls at half the cost of buying organic rolls/bread.  I use it to make bread, hamburger/hotdog buns and dinner rolls.  I add some extra vital wheat gluten to make things a little lighter and fluffier since I use exclusively wheat flour.  My family really enjoys the finished products.  I have it one subscribe and save now which makes it less costly and now I no longer have to buy organic bread products at the supermarket.

review/summary: Bugs?
review/text: Please correct me if I am wrong, but ours was infested with bugs! I ordered the subscribe and save a few months ago and as the bag instructed, I refrigerated the contents of the bag that I opened. I left the other two bags unopened in my cupboard. I have never had any trouble with bugs in my flour or anything else (aside from ants near sugary stuff on occasion because we live near water) like it before. I just went to open a bag and the top was coated in these little tiny brown bugs. It was so disgusting. My second unopened bag had fewer bugs, but bugs nonetheless. I hope this doesn't mean that the original bag that I had opened and refrigerated had bug eggs in it or something, but I just don't know. The flour was a little strong-tasting and not worth the extra money, as well. I think I will stick with the TJ's white WW flour.

review/summary: Good
review/text: This is a surprisingly good product. I waited a few months before opening my first out of fear. The 100% whole wheat bread came out so soft in my zojirushi bread maker. I was surprised. The wheat has a bit of bitterness just like any other whole wheat bread. But thats the only hitch. Both my 7 month old and 3.5 year old at it happily as myself. I do like the company a lot better now.

review/text: This flour couldn't be better.  I usually use about one third all purpose or bread flourd with it and it makes fantasic bread and cookies.  With this flour I can make an excellent cookie without the guilt of something without the benefit of whole wheat.  It pours excellent, tastes great, and comes with the health benefits of whole wheat and being organic.  The cost is well worth it.  If you're going to put in the time to make something at home, why not use the best stuff?

review/text: I've tried this product on it's own in a bread machine and it didn't rise.  Then I've tried it with a mix of other flours and the bread rises alittle but not like what I get with king arthur bread flour. All my ingredients are fresh and work with the store brand "bread flour" so if someone knows a secret to this, please let me know. I rated this 3 stars because "It's Ok" and probably good for someone making bread by hand. I'm using a Westbend Hi-Rise. I have 3 bags left and would like to use it so feel free to email me or leave a comment. Maybe there is a simple adjustment but I don't want to waste anymore ingredients on bad loaves.

review/text: I really enjoy having a couple of bags of this pasta on hand. They are absolutely gorgeous noodles and are great in all kinds of pasta dishes but I particularly enjoy them in a pasta salad because it's only then that you can really appreciate how nice they look. When I originally bought these back in January 2012, the price was $19 with subscribe and save for a pack of 12 10-ounce bags which I thought was a very decent price. Now I've come back to order some more only to find the price has jumped up to $27 (with subscribe and save). While I really enjoy these fusilli noodles, I will be keeping an eye on them here on Amazon and wait for the price to drop. They are fabulous noodles but there's only so much I will pay for them.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you can get them at a good price.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (per 2oz):<br /><br />Calories: 190<br />Calories from Fat: 0<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />Saturated Fat: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 5mg<br />Sodium: 40mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 41g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Protein: 7g<br />Vitamin A: 0%<br />Vitamin C: 0%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 8%

review/summary: Not fragrant, but flavorful
review/text: Normally a pack of ground coffee has its own aroma.  With this pack of Zoka Tatoosh, that was not the case.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether the pack was just sitting in the Amazon Warehouse longer than it should have and the flavor was lost, or if it just isn't fragrant to begin with.  Anyhow, until brewing it there was absolutely no smell.<br /><br />After brewing, the coffee tasted pretty good.  As far as organic coffee goes, I've had better - but this is certainly a huge step up from generics and Starbucks.  Ugh, I can't believe I even mentioned Starbucks in this review... gross.<br /><br />Zoka on my list of the top 5 coffee shops in Seattle, and it is a locally owned franchise.

review/summary: Thai peppers shipped from Thailand?
review/text: This is more of a 'heads up' than a review at this time.  I ordered these the other day, free shipping - yea!!  Received the e-mail that item has been shipped, with a delivery date in about a month.  What the heck?  A little research shows me that these little Thai peppers have actually been shipped... from THAILAND.  Now, I'm not complaining.  I'm in no particular hurry to receive them, although sooner would have been better, but not a problem.  I re-read the description again, and it gives no indication of the long wait for delivery.<br /><br />I look forward to getting these, as I can't find them around here.  I'll be sure to come back and update the rating for the actual item after I receive them.  Maybe this situation is a one-off, I don't know.  Just be warned that it may take a while for this item to hit your doorstep/mailbox.<br /><br />Additional info:<br /><br />ordered 08/18/2012<br /><br />shipped 08/20/2012 via Thailandpost (pretty decent turn around considering I ordered late at night, and then there is that time difference...they show the 20th, my e-mail shows the 19th)<br /><br />delivery scheduled for 09/13/2012 - 09/27/2012<br /><br />Will post when item is received.  Who knows, it may not take so long, just have little to no experience with items actually being sent from overseas.  Heck, it may show up tomorrow for all I know.<br /><br />As of 9/9/2012...no item.  E-mailed seller even though I am still out of the 'scheduled delivery'.  The middle of the weekend - here and in Thailand - and had a response within two hours (impressive).  No update on tracking (not sure they can really even offer that), but response was quick and courteous.  AND they made me want these chiles even more...shame on them :)<br /><br />When (and I do hope this comes to pass) I order from them again, I will order more than one package.  I'm afraid of running out of these tasty little peppers.  Will have to research on growing from seed :)<br /><br />As of 9/15/2012...These little beauties arrived either 9/12 or 9/13, not sure as I don't check my mail everyday.  Well within the delivery window they stated.  While I have not cooked with them yet they appear to be excellent.  They look to have been nicely dried and smell awesome.  3.5 ounces should last me a while as it was more than I expected volume wise.  They were indeed sent from Thailand, package was complete with 'Customs Declaration'.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this seller and this product, with the caveat that it will take time for you to receive them.  If that is not an issue, DO IT!!

review/text: Purchased 2 of these about 5 years ago for my indoor mouser cat.  She loves to hunt (and has caught a couple of real mice).  This is by far her favorite toy. In fact, besides her fabric string from an old piece of clothing of mine, this is the only toy she likes. The 2 have been looking shabby for a couple years. I've sewed them back together a couple times because she does treat it like a real mouse! "breaks the neck" and all!  I can't imagine they have retained the catnip scent all this time but it obviously isn't the only attraction. They are full of teeth marks but hold up remarkably well, regardless.  I've been looking for more for a few years but didn't know the name.  At last, I have figured it out.  She is going to be so excited. I throw them up in the air, she swipes/grabs it with her paw and proceeds to annihilate.  Hard to tell which cats will like this but mine sure does.

But we also have lives to live and plastic water bottles in my home will be used when we need them when we need to stay hydrated while we work, play and enjoy our lives outside of our home.<br /><br />We use these as refillable bottles. The plastic is pretty thick and durable.  While you can bend the plastic (and I guess release some of the plastic into the water) the plastic is still firm enough that you have to deliberately push the sides of the water bottle in. These bottles are easy to clean and they've survived the dishwasher several times over. The plastic is clear which makes it easy to tell if there is any dirt or food on the bottle.  Because of how the bottles are designed, there is not a lot of places for mold or mildew to hide. They stay looking nice for several weeks or months.  They have a wide mouth which I like to drink out of rather than those pop up tops that make it difficult to get the water out of.  The silver lid is flat and has plenty of space on top for us to take a Sharpie and write our names on the top. You can keep one of these on your desk and work and it looks nice.  The kids can put these into their sports bags and they don't leak.<br /><br />Buying a case on Amazon saved me a TON of money.  No way could I get that pricing at any store in Southern CA where I live. Each bottle is usually $3 at the store, $4 for the larger size.  With subscribe and save and prime shipping, I paid just over $1 a bottle.<br /><br />These are definately better than spending $10 on a refillable bottle.  In the past when we have purchased those refillable bottles, they've never worked out.  They get lost, they leak, they get moldy after a few weeks and I can't get the mold out, the dishwasher warps the tops so they don't fit onto the bottle anymore.  They make no sense.  And stainless steel bottles are generally $20 each and they are disgusting to drink out of.  I'd rather hear nails on a chalkboard.  When you have a family of 5, it makes more sense for me financially and environmentally to buy 1, 24 case of Voss for $27 which will easily last us a year or more.  I can't justify buying a $10 or $20 water bottle for each of us because that's $50 plus tax and each bottle will only be around for a couple of months at most for one reason or another.<br /><br />As far as the taste of the water?  It's fine.  Water is water to me.

I'll just reuse this bottle over and over again (duh) and then my $2 purchase will be awesome compared to some who are spending $16 + for a water bottle every day! The bottle is glass and therefore does not contribute to plastic leaching into the water. The lid is plastic, but if stored standing up the water will never touch it!

review/summary: good
review/text: I work at CVS and whenever someone buys this water bottle, it's because of how appealing the bottle actually looks rather than the water. These come in two different types of bottle, one being glass and other being plastic. This one is a plastic bottle. Don't get me wrong, the plastic bottle still looks beautiful and is very sturdy, it's not your average poland spring bottle. Aside from the looks, the taste of the water is no different than Poland Spring or Nestle bottled water. These usually sell for $1.60 at CVS so, this price online is kind of high. If you really want to try this water, or just want the bottle for the look and future use, just go to a local drugstore or grocery and pick one up. It will be much cheaper and you will get to see and feel the bottle in person to see if it's for you. Overall, it's a good buy and offers a very appealing bottle but the taste is pretty much the same as any other bottled water. I personally bought a bottle because it is so sturdy and I can refill it for everyday use, plus the appealing presentation of the bottle doesn't hurt either.

review/summary: Highest quality coconut milk
review/text: Chaokoh is by far the highest quality coconut milk you can purchase. It is recommended in many cookbooks including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416580573">Stir-Frying to the Sky's Edge: The Ultimate Guide to Mastery, with Authentic Recipes and Stories</a>. It is also highly recommended by professional chefs.<br /><br />Unlike the other reviewers I had no issues with my cans of milk being damaged in any way. A few looked like they had dents but it was actually just a pressure difference between the inside of the can and the outside. As soon as I broke the seal with my can opener the dent popped right out. They must can these hot at the factory which causes a pressure drop as they cool.

review/summary: Dissapointed
review/text: I too had the same problem with dented cans. The problem is in the material the cans are made of. When I opened one of the cans I noticed that my can opener created little dents all the way around the can when I was done. I don't believe it is Amazon's fault that the cans arrived dented.<br /><br />The dented cans wasn't my biggest dissapointment. I have been using Thai Kitchen's coconut milk. I decided to try Chaokoh since it is supposed to be so great. Comparing the two, Thai Kitchen is, in my opinion, higher quality. It is thicker, creamier, and more oily. In contrast, Chaokoh is more wattered down and seems to lack some of the coconut oil present in Thai Kitchen. The taste isn't much different but the ingredients are. Thai Kitchen has no preservatives and is basically soaked and pressed coconut meat. Chaokoh contains citric acid and sodium metabisulfite as preservatives.<br /><br />Given the choice, I'll take the cheaper, more natural, preservative free option with a better texture.<br /><br />Oh, and I've ordered at least 5 12 pack cases of Thai Kitchen coconut milk and have yet to recieve a dented can and my can opener does not dent them either.

Great for soups or smoothies, tastes mild and normal raw; no bitterness, no sourness. Good in cereal or in chocolate milk. Yum. Yum. Yum.<br /><br />Only drawback: The cans are clearly new/fresh but must have been dented when shipped from the originating distributor because Amazon packed them well. If dented cans are what we have to put up with for this deal then we are sold. Our manual-can-opener worked just fine on all.

I really thing that the dints are a pressurization issue. This is REAL coconut milk, NOT a coconut milk "beverage"...a great source of HEALTHY fat :) ENJOY!!

review/summary: It's fine, but expensive depending on where you live
review/text: I normally use this to make Panang curry. It works and tastes fine for that purpose, so for this I have no complaints. However, if you live in an urban area with a sizable Asian population (Cali, NYC, Boston, Chicago, etc), you can get this exact brand at ethnic markets (read: Chinatown) for 99 cents a can. So, -1 star for not being the absolute best deal you can get.<br /><br />Having recently moved to a different city, I was disappointed to find coconut milk only in chain supermarkets, and for prices as high as $3.50 per can. Maybe I don't know where to look yet, but buying bulk off of Amazon at a slightly higher price is certainly better than forking over $3.50 per can.

It tastes fantastic, and can be purchased at my local Asian market for about $1 per can.  The cans are frequently dented, but this is a non-issue for me and the taste is never compromised.

review/summary: Best coconut milk you can buy in a can
review/text: I cook a LOT of Thai dishes, mostly curry and soups.  I use a LOT of coconut milk in them, usually more than a "traditional" recipe might call for.  Over the years I've experimented with different brands and this one is not only my favorite but often much cheaper than some of the competing brands.  All good quality coconut milks will cook up the same, more or less.  What makes Chaokoh my favorite is that it usually has the most solids, aka "cream", per can, which is the secret to having a rich, thicker curry without resorting to extra starch.  Be sure you store the cans the way you received them (upside down or right side up) and always open from the top of the can as that will make it much easier to get all the cream out with the liquid rather than having to try and scrape it from the bottom (or opening both ends).  Very creamy with no grit or chunks, great "real" coconut flavor.  A must for any Thai cooking at home!  Yes, I've had a few dented cans too but really, what's the problem?  Use of a good can opener always gets them open and a dent has never changed the quality of the contents in my experience.

review/text: I should have read the reviews more carefully because I would not have ordered if I knew that even though a product arrives in unusable condition there is no recourse. I just spent $30.00 between product and shipping on something that had to be discarded. I wanted this product because it was so highly recommended by cooks. Instead of bundling these cans with shrink wrap so they stay in place, all the cans are thrown in a 14X16" box, this box was put in a larger box. I am not sure what UPS does with our packages but they must have a wild time because these cans were not just dented but bent in half plus extra dents all around. After I found out they could not be returned, I discarded them. I went to Whole Foods to buy one can at a time and found another issue when I got the smooth perfect can home. I did not have any type of can opener that would work to open it at all, except the old type of beer can opener that you push down and make a small triangle cut. Neither power or hand opener could get down low enough to reach the lid. I had to make 5 cuts with the triangle opener to make a hole large enough to get the milk out. I used a small spoon to get the coconut out, a slow procedure around the skin tearing metal opening. For all the work, it would have been easier to get a fresh coconut! In the end the product was good, a lot of coconut pulp with a small amount of liquid, but I won't buy it again.

review/text: I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.  I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing.

review/summary: Good, but not as good as the last time....
review/text: My order arrived on time.  I bought this for friends at work.  It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual.  What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard.

review/text: It just doesn't have the amount of licorice flavor as the Aussie made product.  Or, for that matter, most other quality licorice products.  I am still enjoying it, just not as much as I had hoped to.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for someone who likes pineapple. I'm not a huge fan, but tried a piece. It is soooo good. Tastes just like pineapple, plus is soft and chewy, not like hard licorice at all. Highly recommend this product.

review/text: This stuff has no distinguishable flavor to it, just a stagnant sweetness.  It is just terrible.  Black cherry, my arse.  Yuck!  And, these are its good points.

review/summary: Best Licorice Ever!
review/text: I was given a sample of this licorice from a friend who bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  With so many of the standard brands having little flavor, this was an immediate standout.  I have only tried the strawberry flavor, but it has a rich taste, and is a "soft" but still good and chewy licorice.  I love it.  When it wasn't available at Bed Bath, and Beyond, I found it on Amazon, and of course, it is considerably less expensive.  The only downside is that you must buy 12 6 ounce packages at once.  For me, that's not really a problem.
