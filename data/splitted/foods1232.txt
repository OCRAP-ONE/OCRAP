review/summary: cats loved the gravy!
review/text: As my title says,my cats LOVED all of the gravy-they lapped it up before eating the pieces of chicken. However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

review/summary: My cats love this
review/text: While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: My two kitties LOVE this stuff
review/text: I have a 3yr old and 12 yr old cat.  They both love this specific brand/flavor of cat food.  I've tried other whiskas flavors, meaty bites, chunks, pate etc and also tried Friskies stuff.  But Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken is the only one they wont throw up. And it has a lot of moisture/juice which is great for my older cat who is dehydrated and needs lots of liquids.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

review/summary: Whiskas
review/text: My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

review/summary: White meat chicken with dark bits
review/text: This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.  The dark bits I guess are made out of chicken, but appear to be manufactured - like hot dogs - you know fillers and dyes.  Plenty of juice and chewy looking.  I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.

review/text: We have two cats, one of which is 16 years old and had lost quite a bit of weight.  She looked like she was ready to die any minute.  I purchased this food for her in a local store and she loved it.  She has trouble chewing and this food is easy for her to chew, plus it has juice that she licks up every drop of.  This food has made her start eating again and she has put back on some of her weight and is looking really healthy.  Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.  I now buy it on Amazon's subscribe and save program - we never run out and it saves me money.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

review/summary: Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food
review/text: We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/text: Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food my cats will eat. Obviously many cats feel the same way since the grocery stores are usually out of this selection.  There are many other flavors available; but like I said, Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food for my babies, Comanche and Lakota.  Thank you so much.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/text: The Purrfectly Chicken is the only pouch variety all the cats love. That's 5 inside spoiled rotten princes and princesses aged 6 to 13 and anywhere from 2 to 5 outside feral cats.I can deal with the inconvenience of pouches spilling chicken juice but wish I were sure they were eating a quality product. The fact that they're from Thailand bothers me. The dark pieces are always left in the bottom of the bowls.

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

review/text: My cats love this.  The meat does not look like chicken or beef to me. However the Whiskas "Cat Chefs" know what the kitty cats like.  My picky bunch love to pig down on it. I was even able to sneak in their monthly flea meds with it with no problem.  A first ! The only down side is the juice runs out on the top of the package when you open it. So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

I'd buy it again if there was no other choice. But if there is tuna, I'd go for that instead.

review/summary: Whiskas Tuna Entree for Cats
review/text: After Wal-mart discontinued the tuna packets product from Whiskas I turned to Amazon and found that I could purchase this product by the case (24).  This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

Cats are very smart and have good hearing when he heard the UPS truck and saw me bring in this big box he knew his favorite Chicken and Duck was in the box. When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean.

She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

When I began serving Wiskas Purrfectly Fish, and another Wiskas Variety Pack, the began to follow me into the Kitchen with great expectation when it was time for their Wiskas. They watch me prepare each of their dishes with great interest. They follow me as I place their dishes out for them, and then dive in with great gusto. They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that. My Cats enjoy good health, abundant energy, and a happy spirit. I am glad that I am able to serve them food that they enjoy and provides nutritional benefits they need.

review/summary: Weaned my Kittens!
review/text: Not only do my full sized cats gobble this up but this was the only food that our 5 week old kittens would eat in order to go to new homes.  We were getting down to the wire and the kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away. I tried several kittens formulas and KMR-  and they wouldn't eat anything because they preferred nursing.  However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

review/summary: My cats love this.
review/text: My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/summary: Great if your cats love variety
review/text: Unfortunately, my cats are not fans of the sardine and mackerel pack. The sardine & mackerel has actual chunks of fish, but it seems the cats prefer the flaked tuna and the tuna and whitefish. Amazon sells a tuna-only version of this item, so I decided to stick to what my cats like and keep the tuna-only dinner.<br /><br />The price is comparable to what you will find at your local Wal-Mart. With the added convenience of home delivery with Subscribe and Save, this is a good deal if your cats like the sardine/mackerel dinner.

review/summary: Two enthusiastic paws up
review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/summary: Cats love it; I hate the pouches.
review/text: Whiskas came up with a winner as far as my cats are concerned; they love all three of the "Purrfectly Chicken" varieties.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in, however, has to be a cost-saving thing because it is totally terrible. It is messy, and the only way to get all the food out is to dig it out with a spoon, and dig some more, and dig some more.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars for the food, and 1 star for the package. I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that.

review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

I was even more pleased when I found that I could adjust the schedule when I needed to order it sooner than expected.

review/text: This is my first Amazon review; I depend on others' reviews so want to return the favor.  My kids are on a no-food-chemical, thus dye-free diet so I'm happy to have found a natural decorating sugar for them, but wanted to let others know that the color is definitely NOT the deep orange pictured, but a medium-light blush/rose color.  HOWEVER, my kids (and myself) are just happy to have something to decorate their cake/cupcakes with since everything out there contains what I believe are petroleum-based dyes (red #5, yellow #6, etc), and it is a pretty sugar, just not the color I wanted (I have sons, do I did not want pink, which this basically is).  I knocked off one star for the high price ($8.88 for about 1/2 a cup!) and one star for the color inaccuracy.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: Normally, I rely heavily on amazon reviews, but for once, I'm glad I ignored them. I can't stand the taste of aspartame, so I was looking for some gum with a different sweetener. I was initially looking for something with sucralose, but stumbled onto this gum and decided to give it a try. And I'm very glad I did. I've only tried the spearmint flavor so far, but it tastes great and doesn't have the obviously artificial flavor that I've come to expect. The pieces are a tad smaller than I prefer in a gum, but are typical for the chiclet-style gum these days.<br /><br />I also did my own research and found that contrary to the other review, this gum is indeed made in the US. I buy plenty of stuff made in China, but I do get squeamish if it's something I'm going to be eating. And as opposed to the other reviewer, I got to purchase directly from amazon, so I didn't have to worry about dealing with a third-party seller if I needed to return the product.

review/text: I bought this gum about three weeks ago and have never been more disappointed in a product. When you first chew up the pieces the taste is anything but spearmint. But it gets worse as you continue to chew it; what flavor there is disappears in less than 2-3 minutes and it is just plain nasty!<br /><br />As bad as the gum is, I also tried the Xyla mints and find them to be wonderful. The flavors I like most are: Wintergreen, Coco mint, Peppermint. Licorice mint is also pretty good.

My biggest issue with this gum is that it decomposes if you stop chewing because, say, you are talking to someone. I end up finding pieces of gum between my molars when I talk to friends, yuck! I will try to find other xylytol gum after I am done with the 12 packs.

This gum does not distinguish itself in terms of flavor, but the duration of the flavor is really disappointing. A typical chicklet lasts two or maybe three minutes before losing all flavor, and after 10 minutes, it becomes hard and rubbery. Would not recommend.

Then I wait for about 15 mins. I will taste one ribbon of seaweed to make sure it has absorbed enough water. If it hasn't, I mix it and wait another minute.  Then I pour off the extra water. I then add some soy sauce and rice vinegar (to taste) and mix. Serve. Makes about 2-3 servings.<br />It is really tasty! My friends who wouldn't dream of eating just seaweed are amazed at how good it is. The first time I ever ate this was at a high end sushi place in Tokyo, since I live in the States, I was really glad when I found this!

review/summary: Delicious SF hard candy!
review/text: This candy is delicious.  It's really hard to find good quality SF stuff in the stores here, and these worked out fantastically.  They arrived faster than I expected, too, which was an extra bonus!

review/summary: NOT 15 pounds
review/text: I had ordered this candy twice, the first time they ran out of stock and canceled my order.  The second time, I got the candy, which by the way is very good for sugar free, but only one pound of it came.  I expected to find this huge box in the mail and instead I get a puny, little padded shipping envelope.  I wrote a complaint and got my money back complete with an apology and a witty comment that I rather enjoyed.  Either way, $20 (shipping included) is nowhere near worth being paid for a pound of anything shy of precious metals and gems.<br /><br />The candy is excellent...the price, and expected amount....not so much.

review/summary: Love em Bunches!!
review/text: As the other reviewers have stated, it is very hard to find this flavor locally.  For some reason the stores have stopped selling it.  We were afraid that they had stopped producing the peaches cereal and were pleasantly surprised that it was offered thru Amazon.  This is my family's favorite so we go thru it quickly.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: My new favorite cereal!
review/text: Just the right combination of cereal, clusters, and dried peaches that come to life with milk.  My whole family really likes it.  Too expensive to have all the time though, and not available locally.

review/summary: Best cereal ever!
review/text: I am a big cereal eater.  I have tried most all cereals on the market and this one is the best by far!  The pecan clusters give a sweet flavor that satisfies your cravings.  The best way to eat this cereal is with vanilla flavored almond milk!

review/summary: If you love cinnamon, try this!
review/text: This cereal is quite tasty and unlike anything else on the supermarket shelf. The bunches are sweet but not overly so. I add Almond Breeze Vanilla Almond milk and what a treat! The only negative I can add is that the flakes get soggy pretty fast. Like the other reviewer I discovered the local supermarket stopped carrying it.

review/summary: Tasty cereal
review/text: This is a family favorite cereal, but our local grocery store quit carrying it for some unfathomable reason.  So, now a monthly shipment comes to the door! I was a fan of the Honey Bunches with Almonds, but the cinnamon has a wake-up flavor--and is good for you.

review/summary: Cinnamony, not as good as the peach or strawberry ones
review/text: So I love the strawberry Honey Bunches of Oats. I'm not a big cereal eater but I love that one. I discovered the peach one last year and love that one too. So I thought I'd try this one because hey, I love pecans.<br />Nope. This one has a cinnamon flavor to it and I don't like cinnamon. Most people seem to so you may, but just know that this one has a different flavor to the cereal.

review/summary: Delicious product
review/text: Post seems to have discontinued this product much to my disappointment.  I really don't care for the other flavors of Honey Bunches of Oats so will no longer be a customer.  I simply do not understand why such a good product was shipcanned.
