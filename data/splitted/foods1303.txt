review/summary: The best for the money........
review/text: I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.

review/summary: loving the new dog food
review/text: I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts.

review/summary: Food is Great, Delivery was BAD!
review/text: I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I am a first time dog owner and wanted to ensure that my 2 Presa Canarios were fed a good dog food.  From my research Canidae dog food was one of the best listed.  In addition the "Grain Free" caught my eye, since I was contemplating going to a raw diet.  From my research the Canidae "Grain Free" formula is as close as you can get to "natural" diet without committing to raw food.  Great product and my dogs love it.. Now I must admit there will be flatulence, and it can be rough at times... (Ha!, Ha!). But the overall health and well fare of the dog is my main concern....

review/summary: Best dog food ever!
review/text: I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.

review/summary: canidae excellent!!!!!!!!
review/text: This dog food is the best!! Excellent price. Free shipping, and above all high grade quality ingedients. No fillers, no by products, no wheat, no corn. I have a puppy that started out looking like a beagle puppy, 3.lbs 6 oz when I got him at 8 wks. He turned out to be just barely 4 wks old and is now 45 pounds and growing. I think he is actually a coon hound. He has itchy skin so I wanted to find a product he could eat and my 13 yr old wonder dog (we wonder what he is)could also eat. Canidae is the perfect answer. Since I have been using Canidae my puppy is far less itchy and I still am at the 3 parts Canidae to one part of his other food, which was Pedigree for puppies.  My older dog is less stiff in his joints and his coat is softer too.  I am looking forward to a long time relationship with Canidae. thanks

review/summary: Great food!!
review/text: I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!

review/summary: Fantastic food!
review/text: My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.

review/summary: Was a little nervous trying it, but my dog does well on it
review/text: I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.<br /><br />The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.

review/summary: Affordable Premium Food
review/text: We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.  I'd love to feed them Orijen or Taste of the Wild, but they are very cost prohibitive.  I'm glad this one fits the bill without draining my bank account.

review/summary: Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half
review/text: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.

review/summary: WARNING!!!!
review/text: I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html

We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.

review/summary: Canidae Lost Another Loyal Customer!
review/text: Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???

review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.

review/summary: Great dog food.
review/text: I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.

review/summary: CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!
review/text: If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the "customer service representative" if you can call her that, simply said "if you don't like it then don't buy it." And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any "stickers" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.

review/summary: Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula
review/text: Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.

review/summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower
review/text: I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.

review/summary: Company sold out. No different from regular grocery dog food.
review/text: I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc.

review/summary: Great Food!!!!
review/text: I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.

review/summary: Convenient, but burns on and wrecks pans
review/text: Pam spray is incredibly fast and easy to use, but at temperatures above 350F, it burns on and leaves a layer of sticky orange mess which is a pain and a half to scrub off.  On a stainless or aluminum pan, steel wool or a magic eraser will remove it with considerable elbow grease.  On nonstick surfaces, you can't remove the burned-on Pam without scrubbing off the delicate nonstick layer.  The burned-on Pam will also wreck the ability of the nonstick coating to release foods.  Of course, if you use spray every time, you won't notice this until you try frying an egg without it.<br /><br />The cause of the problem is soy lecithin, which professional-grade pan sprays do not use.  I have switched over to the Bakers and Chefs (Sam's Club store brand) baking spray, and have never had a problem since.  As an additional plus, it costs half as much!

Whatever I cook doesn't end up sticking to the cooking surface.<br /><br />Add to that the factoid that fat and calories are much much lower with PAM than with butter, margarine, and some oils.<br /><br />It's simple to apply (just spray on the cooking surface).<br /><br />So, this is an important element in my kitchen.

So unless you like only a slight taste of cheese you will have to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Sinfully Delicious
review/text: I bought a 4 pack of 12.0 oz bags. Each bag contains approximately 18 fun size bars. A serving is listed as 2 bars, with 50% (10 g) of your daily saturated fat allowance. No wonder these things are so divine-tasting! Though some people might find this amount of fat too much for their taste. It leaves you feeling like you've just eaten a decadent dessert from a fancy restaurant. These little treats are so rich and smooth and chocolaty, with a wonderful balance of crispiness that melts in your mouth. I bought these with the intention of giving them out as Halloween candy, but I'm not sure they will last that long!<br /><br />The unit price was not displaying properly when I bought these, so you may want to double-check for yourself. It was listed as fifteen cents an ounce, but my calculated value was actually 50% higher. It's almost as if someone entered in that you are getting 6 bags instead of 4. Hopefully someone will catch this and fix it. Either way, it is still a great price for chocolate candy.

review/summary: Great for vegetarians/vegans looking for protein
review/text: As a vegetarian who tries to avoid dairy products, I am always looking for tasty, low calorie sources of protein. Most of the protein bars I've tried that have a high protein count also have a high calorie count AND often taste like cardboard.  The Simply Bar Lemon Coconut has 17 grams of protein with only 140 calories.  It is light, chewy and tasty. I have the protein bar with a piece of fruit in the morning for a breakfast under 300 calories. Also a good choice for those on a gluten-free diet.  The price is a little high, but I haven't been able to find the bars any cheaper anywhere else. I also tried the Simply peanut butter chocolate bars, but they were not as good as the lemon bars.

review/text: It's hard to find a good protein bar these days that isn't laden with crap!  Sure they may be high in protein but also in sugar or a bunch or artifical ingredients.  No thanks!  Not so with these bars.  And they are YUMMY!  This is my favorite flavor (Lemon Coconut) so far.  I've also tried Cocoa Coffee and Cinnamon which are both great too.  Have yet to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate.  I do love PB and chocolate but am trying to limit my intake of peanuts in general.  May have to get them anyway.  So happy to have found these AND on Amazon!  Also, on the Lemon Coconut specifically:  I originally got them for my husband (that particular flavor) because I'm not a huge lemon fan and I do not like coconut at all.  After he tried one he told me it was more lemony than anything (this is true but it's a good lemony taste not overpowering) so I tried one and loved it.  Definitely my favorite flavor!

review/summary: Great taste, good nutrition, but a bit pricey
review/text: I was looking for a meal supplement bar that is high in protein (16g) and fiber (4g). This fit the bill, and it's also (relatively) low on carbs (10) and calories (150).<br /><br />The lemon coconut flavor was a nice change from most protein bars' chocolate or peanut butter. It has the consistency something like a rice-krispie treat. It's nice that it's NOT coated in chocolate that melts and makes eating at your desk a mess.<br /><br />The only knock on these bars is the price. At about $2 per bar, it's one of the priciest on the market. I've never found a bar with higher protein and fiber at 150 calories; but I've found some that come close. The "close" ones are about half the price too. I really liked the Simply bars and I'm keeping an eye out for sales. When buying 3 boxes (45 bars) doesn't cost $100 I'll definitely buy again.

review/text: After searching high and low for a low-glycemic gluten & dairy-free protein bar to suit my dietary needs and desires I found the Simply Bar and I love them.  They have amazing nutritional content - high protein, very low sugar (especially compared to other mainstream protein bars), made with non-GMO soy and without  dairy or gluten.  After I eat one of them I am satisfied for hours - had one for breakfast today in fact!  Lemon-coconut is my favorite, with a nice natural lemon flavor and chunks of natural coconut - a winner in all respects.

What do I love about these bars? The bars are very flavorful, packed with protein (which is awesome as I don't always - ok almost never- have time to get in a good breakfast with protein), so many flavors to choose from and did I say how delicious these were. For me one of the biggest draws to these bars is that they have 16 grams of protein, are a great fiber source, don't have milk (I'm allergic and find it hard to find protein bars that don't have milk) and that they're low in sugar. All in all, I think this a really great product and my favorite one of all is the Lemon Coconut.

review/summary: Kosher! Low Sugar! Gluten-Free! Tasty!
review/text: I discoverd these by accident last night at a grocery store. I'm always looking for protein bars for my bug out bag and car emergency supplies. Most "protein" or "energy" bars are loaded with sugar, made from wheat, and/or not kosher. These bars fill the bill quite nicely. At only 3 grams of sugar with 16 grams of protein these are a healthy snack. The taste is fine; I haven't eaten wheat in so many years that things like "soy power" taste go right by me when they might be more perceptible to someone who is not used to eating wheat-free. I'm definitely buying more. Yes, they are expensive, but so is diabetes!

review/summary: The best bar around!!!!!
review/text: I simply love this bar! Just to note.. its the ONLY flavour with more fiber than sugar.. the others have 10g of sugar!!<br />These bars are DELICIOUS, they have chunks of coconut. Think of them as a slightly sweet/tangy rice crispy bar.<br />CON: Way tooo expensive. Almost $3.00 per bar... just when you try to be a good eater, as you get to the check out, you glance over at the $0.65 chocolate bars and you realize you can buy 4 for the same price as one simply bar. Ha ha ha.. ugh!<br />And to note.. not all stores carry fresh ones! Try slightly bending your bar of choice while its in the pack, if its hard,<br />dont buy it.

review/summary: Decent bar~
review/text: I had read some reviews on these bars and needed a bar with more protein in it. I was going to order the bars directly from the company, until i found out how much their shipping charges were. I decided to place an order through Amazon.com.<br />I was really excited when the bars arrived (i ordered two boxes of two different flavors).  I then discovered that they use soy protein for their source of protein. I do not digest soy very well these days and had my family eat most of the bars. i wish i would of done further research about their protein, as i would not have ordered the bars.<br />IF you do not have any issues with soy.. then these bars are decent.

review/summary: Good gluten free bread!
review/text: I have autoimmune issues, which affect my digestion and small intestine, and have recently stopped eating wheat to see if that will help to improve my condition.  This effort led me to the bakery department at the commissary to see if there were any alternatives to good old traditional bread, and I saw the Canyon Bakehouse white bread made from brown rice flour, etc.  It looked good, so I grabbed (the freshest) one and into the cart it went.<br /><br />I'm not one to let baked goods sit around and collect dust, so as soon as I got home I opened the package and took out two pieces... one for regular bread and one for toast.  The loaf is somewhat small, a little less than 3 inches tall, and I wondered if it would come out of the toaster easily or not.  (It did.)  I also noticed that the bread is pretty heavy, which speaks to its density -- which I like.<br /><br />On one piece I put a piece of turkey and some mustard, and the other got toasted.  The bread with the turkey was good, it's kind of chewy and mildly flavored, so it enhanced the flavor of the sandwich.  I really liked it!<br /><br />The toasted bread was not nearly toasted well enough at the "3" setting on our toaster.  It was barely toasted, and I'm a crunchy-toast person, so I put it back into the toaster for another go.  After it was toasted more to my liking, I added a bit of apple butter and it was also really good.<br /><br />The only downfall to this bread is the price.  I understand why these types of breads are more expensive than traditional bread, but I wanted to let the consumer know that it is expensive.<br /><br />In all, I recommend this bread to others!

review/summary: Excellent product, just watch the packing
review/text: These figs are excellent, firm and sweet.  I found the figs sold on Amazon in the smaller cans in a 6 pack rather mushy, tho no doubt it is a matter of taste and some may prefer a soft fig. Since I only eat a few at a time, I transfer the big can's contents into two smaller containers and refrigerate them.<br /><br />One thing tho, these cans are enormous and very heavy. Don't order them with anything else in the same order or they'll crush the other items - even books may be damaged.  And the cartons are really not strong enough -they usually arrive in pretty bad shape tho the cans themselves have never been damaged. But great figs tho and worth it.

review/summary: too  bland, too big
review/text: We'd done without Kadota figs for years because they were no longer to be found on grocery store shelves.  My husband's favorite dessert was Kadota figs with cream cheese, and he asked why we never have that any more (it has been at least a decade!).  So finally I looked on the net.  The normal-sized cans seem to be unavailable even there so I took a chance and got the giant can, choosing light syrup.  Big mistake.  Either these figs have been in the can too long, or I should have gone for heavy syrup.  Too late now: I have a year's worth of nearly tasteless figs in light syrup.  Don't do it, Kadota fig lovers.  No idea why the nice-size cans are no longer made, but apparently we are living off antique Kadota figs.

review/summary: pickled figs
review/text: I usually get dried figs or eat them fresh off a tree(including a Kadota tree). But I saw these canned kadotas and thought, based on the description, photo, and some of the reviews here, that they would be closer to fresh than the dried.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I cracked open the can on these rolands, that smell we all know so well from sweet and sour pickles, pepperoncinis, and some canned green beans flooded out instead of the sweet fig oder I was expecting. The pickled flavor has contaminated every bit of these figs despite the closed eyes on the bottom, so skinning them doesn't help.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, these figs are nearly inedible and certainly cannot be used in deserts or as a snack. Maybe they can be sliced up and put on hamburgers or as a substitute for hot dog relish. They really should be returnable because they are not what this site describes them as. Of course, my can may just happen to be the one bad one, but I doubt it.

review/text: [[ASIN:B000V7710O Roland Kadota Figs in Light Syrup, 6 Pound, 6-Ounce Can]<br /><br />I was looking for Oregon figs & couldn't find them anymore anywhere.  When I found a link for these from Roland, I took a chance.  I'm a happy shopper!! Small, naturally sweet, easy to cook with or pop 'em right out of the can!  Six pounds is a LOT of figs & I worried I wouldn't be able to eat them all before they spoiled, but I've been enjoying them for several weeks now & they're still as good as the day they arrived (keep refrigerated).  If you're a long-time fig connoisseur such as I, or just looking for a new fruit to add flavor & variety to your diet, I can recommend these wholeheartedly.  These are not dried so they have zero calories in fat, no cholesterol or sodium, plus Kadota figs add protein and fiber to your diet, as well as Vitamins A & C.  Great for breakfast, lunch packs (thank goodness for zipper bags), or in any one of a myriad dessert concoctions.  Hope you enjoy them as well as my grandkids and I do!  PS - the price is well within the reach of even my fixed budget!  Thanks, Roland! and Amazon.

review/summary: The product that should never be purchased on line
review/text: I had been looking for Kadota figs which my husband had enjoyed in his earlier years and thought this would be the perfect surprise for him.  The surprise ended up being on me as I received the can of figs in  a box in perfect condition, but the can had a deep dent right in the middle.  Upon opening it, the figs were a mushy mess in a brown liquid, and entirely disgusting.  My husband threw it in the trash and told me to never order on line again.  AS THE BOX WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION, BUT THE CAN SEVERLY DENTED, IT WAS PACKAGED BY SOMEONE IN THIS CONDITION, AND SHAME ON THEM.  A LESSON TO BE LEARNED, DON'T BUY FOOD ON LINE. I AM ASHAMED THAT SOMETHING COMING FROM THE AMAZON NAME WAS IN SUCH A DEPLORABLE STATE.  UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT HAVE THE PRODUCT TO RETURN.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: This appears to be the last place to sell canned figs.  The Oregon brand used to market them through super markets but quit, probably because of low demand.  However, the Roland figs are "tougher" then Oregon.  The only guess I have is that Oregon picked their figs later or processed them in a way to make them more tender.  However, if you are fan of canned figs you should buy them.  The taste is nearly the same as Oregon but the texture is more firm which may not bother other buyers.

review/summary: Caution! warning - vital info before you order, make sure you know its packaged in china and could contain lead
review/text: First let me say I LOVE how they TASTE- but<br /><br />"Warning Warning,, Dont buy canned goods manufactured in China,, there is usually LEAD in the soldering/lining of these cans,, TOXIC TOXIC"<br /><br />yes and thats not even my words, thats someone elses comment that I found when I did a search for "lead cans" and "china".<br />make sure you know what you are getting. the country of origin is clearly labeled as being from china.<br /><br />I ate these and afterwards I didnt feel so hot all day long the next day.<br />Also Its worth noting that I ordered 2 cans, and one of them came severely dented and damaged.<br />Also make sure you realize that if you try to return them , it wont let you, its not allowed to be returned under amazons return policy -it told me that when I clicked on return items. The odds of you getting a dented can seem very high. And im sure that if there is lead in the lining, that denting the can will only make it leech even more.<br /><br />its really a shame that there isnt an american company canning and selling these figs! c'mon american companies , get with the program!<br /><br />taste and texture wise they are great. They come with too much sugar syrup in the can, but if you drain them and give them a bath in pure water you can get most of the sugar to come off, so thats fixable. If there is lead leeching into the fruit though, that isnt fixable, or acceptable. I cant confirm or deny at this time that there is definatly lead, but I personally dont trust canned foods from any country outside of the usa.<br /><br />I know you can get lead toxicity from eating canned foods with lead lined cans, because I used to eat alot of canned papaya that was canned in tailand. I did a hair test a few months after eating tons of canned papaya, and the hair test showed me 23 times the normal limit of lead. Then i got a lead test kit to test the can and sure enough it was lead posative.<br /><br />im going to try to order another lead test kit and see if I can test these cans again myself, and maybe if I can get that done ill update this review with those results .<br /><br />meantime I have 2 more cans already ordered and shipped, and I guess I cant cancel or return them now and im gonna be stuck with the lead! I dont intend to eat them anytime soon, if ever. Id suggest severely limiting the amount of figs that you eat at once, if you do decide to eat them.

review/summary: Tasteless, arrived badly damaged, and long past the expiration date!
review/text: I love figs and took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to order these. I was quite disappointed when the first box has 1 dented can packed in with other products, but I opened it anyway. It was so blah I couldn't eat any after the first one and threw the rest out. When the box with just canned figs arrived, I asked DH to take them to the homeless shelter. He and the shelter cook opened the box and discovered that not only were all the cans dented and damaged, the expiration date was long past! Unfortunately, DH just threw them away in the shelter's trash or I would have returned them to Amazon and gotten my money back. If there was a rating lower than 1 star, I would give it.

review/text: I hate to say it, but lately my dogs are having problems with their bowels. This product is getting to the point I am going to go with another brand. I have been spending the bigger tag because I was believing I was doing something good for them. I have 5 Dogs. 4 of them over 50 pounds and 1 under 20. And only the little one seems to be ok on it. I am not sure what else could be complicating their diet. I assume, every dog is like every person, not all are going to have agreeable stomachs. But buyer beware, any product we buy that is pre-packaged you always run the risk of it not living up to the standard you might expect. For 40 bucks a bag, I expect my dogs to not be sick and not act like they are still starving. Hope there are more positive experiences for other people!

review/summary: RESEARCH BEFORE FEEDING IAMS TO YOUR BEST FRIEND
review/text: I am heartsick and mad at myself for feeding my dogs Iams without doing research until today.  It has low ratings.  For example, "red flag" ingredients in Iams Proactive Health Adult Minichunks are corn meal (the second ingredient listed on the label), chicken by-product meal, dried beet pulp, dried egg product and caramel.<br /><br />I've lived with healthy, long-lived dogs my entire life---large, small, strays, AKC registered.  Growing up, we always had from one to three dogs.  After leaving home, I've had two sets of dogs.  My first set of dogs were healthy until their 16th year.  I never brushed their teeth or had their teeth cleaned otherwise I'm sure they would have lived longer.  I've never feed Iams products to any dogs until my second set (present set) of dogs.  As far as them, I've regularly brushed their teeth.<br /><br />They've had a lot of health problems and they're always eating grass and wanting to lick the floor and the A/C-heating system's metal vents on the floor.  Their stomachs are often upset and it's as if they don't get enough vitamins and minerals.  Also, their coats quickly went from being shiny as youngsters to very dull.  So much of their hair turned white that by the time they were three, they both looked like senior citizens - especially their faces.  I have hundreds of photos to prove this.  They drink excessive amounts of water and I have a hard time keeping their weight down.  None of these problems have I experienced or even thought about with my previous dogs or with our family dogs when I was young.<br /><br />Tragically, on May 1, I put one of the present two "to sleep" at age 12.  That's why I've been reading dog food reviews today.  She and I spent 22 horrible and painful (and expensive) days trying to save her life, including having her gallbladder surgically removed.  My other dog has suffered from arthritis since age five, among other problems.<br /><br />After checking the reviews, I suspect their diet is the reason for most if not all of the problems stated above.  I feel guilty because I trusted the word "premium".  I feel guilty that even though I had suspicions throughout the years, I didn't look into it until it was too late.  It was just so easy to pick up their food at the grocery store.  Educating ourselves is more important than trusting that a label (such as "premium") means we're feeding them what is best for their health and well being.  I did everything in the world for my dogs---except give them a proper diet.  With the Internet at our disposal, that is unconscionable.

review/summary: Unhealthy... Look at the Ingredients
review/text: I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states "No fillers."  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is "vet-recommended" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes "Hill's Science Diet" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.  If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.

I will state right up front that I helplessly love my lushly hirsute hound pretty much all of the time since she miraculously arrived in the hut just less than a year ago but I especially dig this dog in the dark wintertime coz then she puts on an extra fantabulous fur coat to keep warm and I can barely keep from laying hands on her she feels so soft, like sable or something she is. This dog of mine, of ours I guess I should say, me and the missus, who if she had been a male example of the breed I would have been allowed to name Desmond but who instead turned out to be this thick jet black female furball so the old lady got to choose the moniker and named her Pepper right there and then, after Sgt. Pepper I do believe, that timeless Liverpudlian condiment. Late on Christmas Eve I took Pepper for a bonus walk so I could smoke me some extry smokes and she could again enjoy pretending to herd the electric deer that are surprisingly numerous this joyful season on the little front lawns hereabouts. Pepper is a Swedish Lapphund, you see, and herding reindeer seems to be the exact activity she is built for in the bulk of her nature. Obviously getting this unusually electrostatic snootful of her ancestral calling occasioned some considerable animation in the frisky meatball and she could be calmed only by soothing words from her master--avast thou black and midnight hedge-pig and so forth--followed by bits of the bickie I mentioned busting up above. To calm her further I took her to a big house on Carnation Avenue where the elaborate electric Christmas decoration includes an outdoor tree whose numerous sprouting trunks are magically enmeshed in a bright fishnet of the most brilliant neon green. There must be at least nine seperate upward shooting trunks involved here under just the one generous canopy and the overall effect I must say is one of the most splendid stupefaction. I'd been deliberately walking my dog this long way home for the last three weeks just for a chance to stop each time and take a frankly intoxicating measure of ease beneath the lurid light of this Star Trek tree. So there I was at any rate late on Christmas Eve with me doggy in tow repeatedly exhaling fragrant cheroot smoke into the serenely acid green illumination and generally digging pretty much everything that was going on more or less everywhere in the universe I guess when suddenly Pepper sez to hell with all this farking scenery and goes berserk with the leash, jumping up and down and attempting strenuously to exit simultaneously stages right AND left--her message being I imagine that this was supposed to be a walk you dopey bleeding lump and could I please get the lead out and so on with like lively exhortations. Good point I concurred eventually. I do honestly suppose that Pepper is often much smarter than I could ever hope to be. Lead on, Lassie, sez I to the lunging rapscallion. Walking a dog though out in the real world. Talk about yer magic! Plus grooming the wee beastie is emphatically the deep bonding experience noted canine scientician Cesar Romero sez it is: I can think of no greater pleasure than hanging out on my back porch with the luxurious little Lapphund in the early AM, smoking Maverick menthols and slugging down a giant cuppa Joe (from a Big Sleep mug no less! Thanx, podner) but mostly just focused on brushing Pepper's furry little pants. On account of our dog furthermore and my regular striding after her every night for ages now I have I admit often been tempted to cast the actual acquisition of said canine in military parlance, specifically Operation Fit in Pants coz as a direct result of this furry force of forward momentum I seem to be getting back into some kind of shape again. Not only am I easily fitting back into my trousers now but I am also getting some small volume of breath too on account of all this vigorous traipsing after the dashing hound. Sometimes Pepper walks me much too fast though and often I limp back to our hut with me hamstrings literally barking. Dogs, wha'? Bless 'em but they're even an excellent source of metaphor.

review/summary: Very Tasty - But contains MSG!
review/text: This seasoning is very tasty and versatile and highly concentrated, so you really don't need much to add flavor to any food.  The flavor works well with any style of food - Latin American, Italian, American, etc. - so it will be a handy seasoning to have in your cupboard.  I put some on my fried egg this morning that I prepared with tomato and fresh basil and it was delicious, but the garlic-y flavor is still lingering in my mouth. It does contain MSG, but since the flavor is concentrated, the MSG content may not be a concern for some.  One 1/4 tsp. has 60 mg of sodium, but for many foods, you will only need to sprinkle on a very small amount to enhance the flavor.  It would be a good addition to a sandwich along with mayonnaise or other sandwich spreads.  The seasoning contains dehydrated vegetables (garlic and onion), msg, spices, herbs and tricalcium phosphate (anti-caking agent). For many, this could become the perfect go-to seasoning.  You could also add it to other herbs to even further reduce the msg/sodium content.

We have now made a switch to the Blastin' Berry Cherry.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste.

I ordered 3 pounds for christmas but was sent 2 1/2 pounds of small discards, including pieces of rind, all shrink wrapped in a ton of plastic. They refuse to respond to emails and are difficult to contact or deal with if you have a problem. As a refund they refused to reimburse me the $31.78 for shipping.<br /><br />As the saying goes....Buyer Beware

review/text: I surprise myself by rating this cheese my favorite of all cheeses (and I love cheese, all kinds.) But real Parmigiano Reggiano is so delicious. I love the characteristic amino acid crunch (those little white spots are crystallized amino acids produced during the ripening process.) Even though a pound grated lasts a long time, sadly, you may discover that real parmesan can be eaten in chunks, like a good chocolate, and thus, this pound will melt away like snow. Too good.

review/text: The only real Parmigiano (Reggiano) is one of the great cheeses of the world. The best Reggiano (there are different grades of Reggiano, too) is much more than a grating cheese--it is a cheese that can be eaten by itself, before a meal or after. The best grades of Reggiano are best shaven paper-thin (use a good cheese plane) and will have a slight pineapple taste when savored slowly. This cheese is a real treat!

review/text: This is the parmigiano I remember from the neighborhood Italian market when I was a girl.<br /><br />The taste is lovely and piquant - a little goes a long way in the flavor department. There are the wonderful little crystals in the cheese.  And it is aged so that it crumbles really nicely when cut.<br /><br />It is absolutely delicious eating out-of-hand, which is the way I prefer it.  Just a little piece is so satisfying. (I am 100% Italian, first generation American, and my parents were real 'foodies', so I like to think I know my cheeses!)<br /><br />The Parmigiano was also packaged really well.  It came extremely cold in a little styrofoam container, with a cold pack and additional padding, inside a cardboard box.<br /><br />(.....)<br /><br />I would order this cheese again and I look forward to ordering with (....) again, too.

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: I ordered a Spanish cheese selection with a 1/2 pound portion of this vendor's Strevecchia (spelling?) Parmigiano Reggiano.  I was able to sample the prodects sent and they were acceptable, for the most part.  However, the Parmigiano Reggiano, at $25 a pound, was disappointing.  It was largely rind and while the edible portion of the wedge was very good, I think I deserved better for the dear price.  Suggestion: Go to Sam's club and get PR there for lots less.  Their PR is very good indeed and you can see what you're getting.  the PR I ordered was like what I used to buy in Cambridge when I lived in the UK in the late 1990s.  it is aged about three years.  The standard PR offered here is not aged nearly as long and it does make a difference.  There is no bad PR- it's all wonderful, but some is just more wonderful.  If you aren't going for the more aged PRs, you're just as well off with a less costly Grana Padano, made the same way but not aged as long, and not name controlled as is Parmigianno Reggiano.  Bon Appetit

review/text: I wish I would of read the reviews before I ordered from these scammers.  I ordered the Italian Parmigiano Reggiano 10 oz. The cheese was actually wrapped in a priority envelope from USPS (YUK!!!) and not wrapped like the picture shows.<br />I paid $30.99 in shipping alone and it cost them 4.95 shipping via another priority envelope that the cheese was wrapped in to send it to me. I asked them to justify why not expedited shipping (it took 7 days from when I ordered to receive it) but they never answered my question.They used USPS shipping envelopes as wrappers. The cheese had black dots on it and was so disqusting.<br />I wrote to their customer service but all they did was make lie excuses and not answer my questions directly and then got nasty with me.  Worse customer service I ever dealt with although I don't ever remember having this type of problem before with anyone else.  I order online all the time.  Avoid this place unless you want to waste money. Everything about this place is disqusting including the owner Jason that responded to my emails, not answering my questions directly and beating around the bush.  I hate being scammed.

review/text: Parmigiano Reggiano, mostly grated for use by most of us here in the U.S., is considered very wrong in Italy to use as a "grating" cheese. It's used as shavings for toppings to dishes or just for eating chunks. NEVER grated. The best by far is Parmigiano Reggiano Resirva Stravecchio. YUM-O!<br /><br />But I'm here in the U.S., so I do it both ways. Great to eat (wonderful, nutty flavor to me). I use it on pastas, salads, bruschettas. Top off some Artisan toasted bread with pesto and grate this cheese over it, or put a nice shaving on it and set it under the broiler...OMG! It'll make you sass your mama!

review/text: I purchased about a 4oz. wedge of Oro Antico on 1/1/09 from Central Market (cost $6) and I have to say I was very impressed. I was looking for a hard cheese to add to a cheese mixture for some bacon wrapped jalapenos and this turned out to be a great choice (I usually use parmesan, but really wanted to try something new)! I also used it as a grated cheese on a Caesar salad and the sharp flavor went great with the dressing.<br /><br />By itself, Oro Antico is a very bold cheese with a great nose and soft finish. It's great paired with both red and white wines. If you are looking for a hard cheese, whatever the reason, give Oro Antico a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
