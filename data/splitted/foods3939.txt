review/summary: Did not work...for me.
review/text: Kind of had the opposite effect on me.  A friend recommended I try 5 hour energy and use it to replace my morning cup of coffee.  If anything it actually made me tired and groggy.  I guess it has a different influence on each individual.  I would suggest trying one first, before buying in bulk.

review/summary: worst feeling ever!
review/text: I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking "Go Girls" for a while and I loved them. I wanted to try the 5 hour energy because the "Go Girls" kept me up at night.<br /><br />First of all, I understand first hand that this drink affects people differently. Like I said my Dad loves it and swears by it, myself, not so much.<br /><br />I decided to drink only half the bottle to start with, so it wouldn't be too overwhelming. But, even with half the bottle it really messed me up.<br /><br />I felt tired but my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was pounding so much, like I just ran 10 miles in record time! The rest of my body felt awful too. My arms were jittery, yet kinda numb. My legs felt like spaghetti and my stomach felt like it was in knots. Andy even though my body felt like it was all amped up I still felt exhausted and needed to keep putting my head down. I also felt like I just wanted to have a meltdown and cry. It was awful!<br /><br />Be careful if you try this. Take a little bit at a time. For the first time take it when you don't need to do anything or go anywhere. Like I said everyone reacts differently to it. My Dad has these like 2 or 3 times a week and loves it. So try it for yourself, but this was my experience.

review/summary: 5-hour Entergy Extra review
review/text: I thoroughly loved the product and got a great price through Amazon.  I have diabetes and suffer from job layoff depression.  I purchased the product for it's low calorie and promise of energy boost to combat my health conditions, and it WORKS GREAT without any 'buzz'. I was definitely about to stay focused after the drink and be more productive in the tasks I need to complete for several hours, instead of getting tired and having no energy to keep going.

review/summary: All boost, no buzz, no crash
review/text: I drive between Pittsburgh and Philly most weekends.  Usually an hour or two into the drive, I start to nod off with highway hypnosis.  When I get in the car I pop one of these down the pie hole and no nodding off.  I arrive at my destination alert and without the Red Bull and triple latte induced jitters normally experienced prior to finding this product.  Experienced none of the negative effects I saw in other reviews.  I suspect there may be secret agendas involving reputation assasination with some of those posters.

review/summary: Serious Side Effects
review/text: During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again.

review/summary: taste....
review/text: The second I tasted this product, I knew that drinking it as a shot wasn't for me; but, I also knew, just how it would work, and I don't know why it isn't written on the package somewhere.<br /><br />This is the best way to use it:<br /><br />  Take a bottle of water and pour in the amount you want to drink of the shot - half for some or the entire bottle for others.  This tastes exactly like the flavored bottled waters that you can buy.  Everyone is different, but all the flavors were good like this, to me, except the lemon or lime or whatever that one is.  As a matter of fact, the grape flavor added to water tastes identical to the flavored Dasani grape water.<br /><br />  I take a bottle of this 5 hour energy/water concoction to the gym with me.  It has helped me get back into working out.  I don't need it everyday, but some days it helps me overcome the tendency to flake out and not go, when I feel tired.  I imagine that with lots of things, the effectiveness is compromised if you use it everyday.<br /><br />  I also have A.D.D. and just finishing any task is a challenge.  This helps me with that...as well.  I know a little bit about the ingredients in this and a lot of the energy comes from the l-tyrosine, which is used by some to treat a.d.d.<br /><br />Happy living!

review/summary: A must have for Traveling! Natural energy without the crash at the end.
review/text: I loved the energy I got from the 5 hour energy. It was quick and natural and helped me feel alert, but I did not experience any jitters or shakiness that usually accompanies when I drink an energy drink. It also gave me the most energy out of any energy drink I've ever used. When the energy did wear off it didn't feel like a crash. It was a completely natural and gradual decrease as the day went on. I found I was able to get a lot more done in my day.<br /><br />I recently used the 5 Hour energy on a long trip I took with my kids. Normally a few minutes into the trip I'm struggling with alertness and usually have to drink a lot of energy drinks to stay awake. But with one 5 Hour energy I was able to drive the entire trip without any additional energy drinks. I was alert and focused and felt better than I had in a long time. At the end of our journey instead of having an energy crash and needing to go straight to bed, I didn't even notice that it was wearing off and I never felt tired until it was time to go to bed that night. This was after getting only 4 hours of sleep the night before the trip. the 5 Hour energy definitely did it's job and I will always use one before I make any future driving trips!<br /><br />I love that the 5 Hour Energy bottles are just a small dose bottle instead of a full sized soda drink that I have to chug down before I can feel any increase in energy. And even better, you don't even need the entire bottle! Just drink half for a medium amount of energy or the entire thing for a huge dose in energy. And what you don't drink stays good for up to 3 days in the fridge, so you can have one "pick me up" on day 1 and use the rest on day 3.<br /><br />Cons: I think some of the flavors can be improved. At first I didn't like the flavor at all, and in fact choked on it and literally had to gag it down. The next day I had left the 5 hour energy in the fridge and then I was able to drink it with a lot more ease. Although there was still a definite after taste similar to that of a Diet soda.<br /><br />I think I would enjoy a flavor other than Berry a lot better. Yet if you are used to diet sodas or energy drinks you probably won't notice any distaste in the flavors. I'm used to drinking just straight up caffeinated sodas so it was a bit different for me.<br /><br />Of all the energy drinks I've tried, the 5 Hour energy definitely gave me the most energy! It felt like a natural burst of energy and for me it lasted more than 5 hours.<br /><br />Will I use 5 Hour energy again? Yes! For every trip I take where I will be driving and for days when I need to focus more!

review/summary: First time trying energy drinks
review/text: I have never tried energy drinks before trying 5-Hour Energy. "I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360." One was berry and the other was pomegranate. I shared one with my co-worker. We tried them at work. She doesn't drink a lot of caffeine so she felt hers kick in right away. I have coffee every morning so mine wasn't as noticeable...until I was done with work. I usually go straight home after work because I'm too tired to do anything, but this time I felt like I had energy and I went shopping. Loved it! I had energy that I wasn't even aware of! No jitters or sugar crash. It was great. Will definitely try it again. Thank you to Smiley 360 for my free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY.

review/summary: The Energy Booster With No Sugar & Only 4 Calories
review/text: 5 Hour Energy was like a dream come true for my working spouse.  As a manager, on his feet for thirteen hours a day gets extremely exhausting so when I agreed to receiving a sample from Smiley online in exchange for my opinions, he was the first in line to try it.  I was impressed that it contained B6, B12 & B3 along with folic acid and only had a small amount of caffeine.  My husband tried the 5 Hour Energy after a full day of work in hopes of being able to stay awake and watch the baseball game.  He was surprized that did give him a few more hours of energy.  5-hour energy also complies with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act as enforced by the FDA.

review/text: I like to use 5-Hour energy from time to time to help my self get some more energy.  It can't replace a poor diet and no exercise in my mind but if you remember to eat healthy and get some exercise but sometimes just need a little something-something instead of ho-hum coffee this is a good option. A lot better than a soda too! It definitely picks you up and perks you up--I think even better than coffee. It is good for me in the late afternoon when I need to keep working but I am just kind of tired. It gives me energy to keep going. It tastes great too--not too sweet! I keep one stashed in my purse for emergencies too. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360.

review/summary: I was reluctant to try it, but PLEASANTLY surprised!!  =)
review/text: I am unable to drink caffeinated energy drinks, as I am too sensitive to large amounts of caffeine, and it makes me ill. I get jittery and get a massive headache. Additionally, sugarless items usually taste horrible to me. These are the reasons I was hesitant to try 5 hour energy. I received a sample from Smile.y.com to try, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised! The taste was great for only containing 4 calories per bottle! There was absolutely no jittery feeling, no headache, and no crash!! I'm not going to say I'll drink it everyday or completely replace my am cup of coffee, but I've used it since I've tried it, and I really feel like it gives me an extra boost when I need one! I feel like everyone could use this at one time or another. It contains B vitamins instead of a ton of caffeine so there's no jitters or crash. =)<br />"I received a free sample of 5 hour energy by Smiley360"

review/summary: 5 Hour Energy - Berry review
review/text: I liked that the 5 hour Energy gave me that little extra lift I needed, especially in the afternoon - evenings, when I needed it most.  It didn't make me feel jittery or shakey and as other products have, since I have anxiety to begin with.  It also didn't keep me from falling asleep at night. The only thing I didn't really like was the taste/after taste.  It tasted a little bit mediciney to me.  But, I just drank something else, like some tea or something after taking the 5 Hour Energy to get the taste out of my mouth.  "I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360."

review/text: I received 3 sample bottles of 5-Hour Energy from Smiley 360...and LOVED this product! I loved how the taste was pleasant and there was no strong aftertaste like most products have. It also was fast acting, gave me the energy I needed and I never experienced that 'crash' you would get with caffeine or sugar. I am not a coffee drinker, and have tried to stay away from caffeine because I always seem to feel worse off than I did before taking it. But with 5-Hour energy, I can use it as often as I need and don't have to worry about regretting it later! It also got me through most of my (BORING) day at work without making me jittery or jumpy. Thanks 5-Hour Energy! You have got a fan for life!! :-)<br /><br />(I received a free sample of 5-Hour Energy from Smiley360.com)

review/summary: BEST PICK ME UP AROUND!
review/text: Recently I returned to the work force after being a stay-at-home mom for over two years. I am not going to lie, I have been doing this work thing for almost two months now and it has not gotten any easier but rather seems to more difficult. The biggest problem I have is lack of energy. Sitting at a desk for 8 hours then having to drive to work in traffic to get home to cook and play with my little guy takes a lot of energy and I obviously don't get enough sleep because I also have to spend time with the hubby and catching up on my shows.<br /><br />I have tried several energy pick me ups over the years, especially during those late nights in college when I was cramming for a test or needed to finish a paper but have found that they all make me feel weird and I don't like the jittery, lack of concentration feeling they give you then followed with a serious crash when they wear off. So, when I was presented with the opportunity to try 5-hour ENERGY I was a little hesitant but the one day driving home from work and I had to pull off the freeway because I was falling asleep did it for me. I need to try something!!!<br /><br />5-hour ENERGY does EVERYTHING it says it is going to do! It gives you a sudden burst of energy that lasts with you and when it has filtered through your blood stream you don't experience a sudden crash. It did not feel like I had taken anything but rather made me feel like I had just woken up from a nice nap and was ready to take on the day! Plus it actually tasted good! I tried the Berry Flavor and it didn't leave an aftertaste or yucky taste like others have. The secret behind 5-hour ENERGY is that it is made from everyday key ingredients that are found in your everyday foods (which truthfully we don't get enough of) with an added bonus of caffeine but no more than what you would find in your own cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the best pick me up ANYONE can use safely and take my word for it, you will not feel any side effects.<br /><br />**I received a sample for my review from Smiley360. However these views and ideas are my own.

review/summary: THIS STUFF WORKS!
review/text: I don't like coffee, but have tried caffeine pills before, but this stuff is much better, and works quicker. The taste can be kinda bitter (I usually get grape, but have also tried orange and lemon when that was all the store had available), so I always chug it down in one gulp, and then either drink some other kind of flavored juice or chew gum to get rid of the taste. I only use it for general alertness, never as a substitute for sleep, to try to stay up late for whatever reason. It's mostly just to ward off that "blah" feeling that sometimes hits in the afternoon, so I'll drink a bottle sometime between 12-2pm. But never after 2pm, because I want to make sure that it's completely worn off by the evening, so it doesn't effect my sleep-cycle. Sometimes I'll drink one bottle first thing in the morning when I wake up. But then I make sure at least 5 hours have passed before taking another one that same day. Taken effectively, it works perfectly. TWO THUMBS UP!

review/summary: 5 hour energy
review/text: I just started a new job, which is mornings, instead of the 2nd shift I worked for over 20 years, and am also taking classes for real estate..I used 5 hour energy and was able to make it through the day and my night class, without being jittery or tired. I had plenty of energy and felt great! When I drink soda, or coffee, I have to drink numerous cups to give me the same amount of energy, and it does not last long..and it makes me feel jittery and nervous feeling. I have purchased it on numerous occasions, and will continue to do so..I have some in my fridge at this moment, for when I need the extra burst of energy!<br /><br />"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360."

review/summary: 5-hour is good stuff
review/text: I have been using 5 hour for a good while now and find it works great for me.  I get drowsy at work and this ends those sagging, dozing feelings.  I find though that if I take it and continue to sit that it works much slower.  If I get up and walk around for a while it kicks in faster.  I do not get a sudden burst of energy but find that I just am no longer sleepy.  No jitters or other ill effects.  Try it.

review/summary: How can so little work SO WELL?
review/text: I recently purchased the multi-pack of pomegranate 5 Hour Energy shots for a driving trip, because I know that after only an hour on the road, I tend to fall asleep at the wheel.  When I have eight hours of driving ahead of me, that's not the safest place to be.  Now, I knew that 5 Hour had the potential to keep me alert, because I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360 and it had worked VERY well to keep me focused on house cleaning - why not driving?  Eyes drooping, halfway to Knoxville, I grabbed a 5 Hour Energy out of my purse and downed the thing.  I'll admit - the flavor isn't the greatest, and Orange and Pomegranate are the only flavors I've tried that I can tolerate.  However, within ten minutes I was alert, wide-eyed, singing along with the radio and finally appreciating the beautiful weather as I drove through the mountains.  5 Hour, you're a life saver!

review/text: I have tried a couple flavors of this, Pomegranate is my favorite, and I think they work great! I have a busy 3 year old and work full time, so there are times I need an extra boost.  I have tried other energy drinks and always feel anxious and jittery.  I didn't get that with 5 Hour Energy.  I felt a noticeable boost in energy about 10 minutes after drinking it and it tapered off throughout the day, I never had the crash I was expecting. I wouldn't use these everyday, but for when you need the extra boost, it's perfect!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360.

review/summary: It DOES work
review/text: Yes, it is expensive to use every day.  But if you need an energy boost every day, you might need to sleep more.  But when you really do need that extra boost to get through the day, this stuff really works.  The taste is not so bad.  It has gotten better.  And it seems to start working rather quickly. Better than soda or coffee, especially if you are driving.  You don't have to drink that much to get that same boost, so less potty stops.  :) I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360. And have bought it myself since.

review/text: I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360 and being a stay at home mom to a 7 month old infant who is disabled can be very tiring. With the help of 5-hour energy drinks I was able to kick start internal engine and be alert for my child. I didn't experience any jitters or crashes. I will admit in the stores this product can be very expensive. Amazon has this product priced very reasonably. I would recommend it to others, however not all will have the same experience as I.

review/summary: 5 Hour Energy drink
review/text: The five hour energy drink has been a true blessing for my hubby, He has to be up and driving first transit busses at 5am every morning, He grabs a morning cup of coffee, But like a few hours later he gets so very tired. So I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY from Smiley360 for doing a test review. And I thought who better to test this 5 hour energy product out than my hubby who really could use some energy to be alert for driving, Because he doesn't like drinking more than one cup of coffee a day. Well, he agreed to try them out. The first day he tried them he was like. WOW, This stuff really works. So I will tell you he doesn't leave home without his 5 hour energy drink. And he has bought more of it this week, Thank you for the free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY from Smiley360, Anybody that wants something to stay alert without the side effects of coffee and soda , etc. Should try 5 hour Energy

review/summary: Great Mommy Afternoon Pick me Up!
review/text: I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360. I have never tried this product before but had seen commercials of the product on tv.  I am a busy mother of 4 daughters (ages 6, 5, 3, and 2).  I have a very full schedule and as most moms know the afternoon hours are just when I start dragging.  Maybe a nap is what I need, but no time (literally!).  So I tried a small bit of 5 hour (half a bottle) just to see how it would go when I hit that afternoon drag-- and yep it was just what I needed to complete my day.  My mood is good, my energy is still on the go, and I am not dragging just struggling to make it through dinner and bathtime and the wonderful thing is no headaches.  This is a huge help to me and I am so thankful to 5 hour for this aid to my day- and yes it has made it on my grocery list!  I hope others find it as helpful as I have!

review/summary: 5 Hour Energy
review/text: We recently recieved 2 samples of the 5-Hour Energy and my Husband and my Son inlaw used them the next morning. They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard. So in my oppinion the 5-Hour Energy is well worth the cost, and I would buy and use them again. "I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360."

review/summary: Best energy shot !
review/text: I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360. I have been restricted to 1 cup of coffee a day and have been hating it. So when I got the free sample, I decided to try it before I went to the gym in the morning. Within 10 minutes, was not tired and seemed to have a little more spring in my step than ususal. And, it kept me up and going for the full 5 hours, but no racing heart or multiple bathroom trips from coffee. So I had the second one around 2 and it got me through the rest of work, no upset as coffee would have done. I am totally happy with this product and keep a good stock in the fridge for whenever I need a pick me up ( it does taste a little better when reallllly cold!)

review/summary: 5-Hour ENERGY Review (Positive Response)
review/text: 5-Hour ENERGY is an AWESOME product.<br /><br />I take 5 college courses in a semester. While this might not be such a big deal to people however; when I explain everything else in my life you will ask yourself "how does she do it?" Wasn't there a movie out about that? I am 46 years old and completed an Associate's degree in a year and a half. I am married with two children and my husband works 6-7 days a week.<br /><br />I was drinking coffee like it was going out of style and was a bit concerned about all the sugar and caffeine in my body because let's face it, who can drink coffee without sugar? And because 5-Hour ENERGY is loaded with Vitamin-B I was able to reload and be ready for the rest of my courses after drinking it.<br /><br />My favorite is the berry flavor but, I do like grape, orange, lemon-lime and pomegranate as well. Ever since I tried it I have used 5-Hour ENERGY every day. It gives me a boost of energy to finish my homework, housework, dinner or whatever it is that is left to do for the day. Plus it doesn't give me the jitters or keep me up at night when I need to rest.<br /><br />I recommend using 5-Hour ENERGY when you need a lift. I personally prefer purchasing it rather than coffee now and always will.<br /><br />"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360."

review/summary: Converted Skeptic
review/text: I initially tried this product just to see what the buzz was about not to mention that the company spends so damn much advertising it. I assumed it was sort of like another cup of coffee to pick you up, and believed it was hyped way too much.<br />I was wrong on this one as the product must contain a different type of caffeine because it really picks you up without any side effects.<br />I like to fill my morning with exercise of some sort, but many days I just don't have the desire or energy to get started on the exertion. A half bottle of this will get me "in the mood" within minutes.<br />I just would not have believed that how much brighter my day will look with a little exercise and a half bottle of this stuff. Almost too good to be true.<br />I have read other reviews for this product and some people just don't get the same boost, so I can only suggest that you try a half bottle just to see if it does as much for you as it does for me.

review/text: I've tried several energy products, both drinks and pills, and 5-hour energy is my favorite.  It certainly gives me a kick of energy but doesn't leave me jittery or anxious at all. It is convienent to use and take with me.  I usually keep me with me, one at home, and one in the office in case I hit a mid-day slump. I don't recommend it for any type of weight loss product but if you take it before you hit the gym, you'll get a boost for your workout. I can't take it after about 3:00pm though or I can't sleep at night (around 10pm). I like the pomegranate flavor, but can't stand the Berry flavor.

review/summary: Great Price!
review/text: I used to head to my local gas station and purchase the individual bottles at almost 3 bucks a piece. A friend told me that she buys them off amazon and they come out to half price! You can't beat that! I only like to drink energy shots when I am in NEED of a quick pick me up. I dislike having to take red bull, monster and all those drinks because of their size and high sugar content. I like the 5 hour drink because at 2 ounces and 4 calories, and no sugar, I can easily and conveniently throw it back and get on with my agenda. However, it does NOT last 5 hours, not for me at least. I drink it 20 minutes before an activity and I can get through it just fine, but maybe 2 hours or so tops. I'm satisfied with it, because that's normally all I need.

review/text: I do like Rockstars, I'll admit, but I don't think you can beat these 5 hour energies.  They just do their job without jacking you up high then crash low.  I like Grape the best, the others are a bit faker tasting.  I would have given 5 starts, but truthfully the fake sugar is nasty, but it's over in a few seconds or just get a water chaser.  I'm sure they'd be super nasty without fake sugar and real sugar makes you crash - can't have it both ways.  It's nice to have a stock of these in the bottom drawer for times of need.  Beats the hell out of prices at the store.

review/text: I've started using 5-hour energy pretty regularly (2 days a week or so).  I have a newborn and a 2-year-old at home, and a job that requires mental alertness, and 5 Hour Energy really does a great job of eliminating my fatigue without making me feel overly-caffeinated.  And then 5 hours later I'm fatigued again - but no worse that I would have been without it.  As near as I can tell, it's a product with a great benefit, and discernable side effects.

review/summary: I don't recommend drinking energy drinks on a regular basis, but these are great for the times when you actually need the boost!
review/text: As a general rule, I stay clear of energy drinks and drinks with large doses of caffeine in them. However, there are occasions that I need some pep to keep me going - most often when I happen to be working a double shift or am required to work security during the night after just working that same day. In cases like those, 5-hour energy has helped me stay alert for the duration of my assignments. As the product states, there doesn't seem to be any "crash" after its effects wear off, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />In the past, I've just purchased these energy drinks at convenience stores, but since I have a lot of double shift days coming up, I opted to purchase an entire case this time around. The price is much more econimical when buying bulk, like this, and the product has a decently long shelf-life (20 months or so), so I'm not worried that I'll be letting some of it expire before I use it.<br /><br />I can't compare this to a lot of other similar products, because - as I stated above - I don't use them frequently, and this is the only energy drink I have ever used. Because it works for me, I don't see any need to try other products, such as Red Bull or Monster, etc.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8">5-Hour Energy -  Berry 1.93-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> I was extremely skeptical about this product until one bottle arrived with another order, as a promotion.  I tend to get very drowsy in the afternoon unless I'm actively engaged in an activity that requires me to move or to talk.  I love to read, but would find myself dropping off to sleep after just a few paragraphs.  This stuff actually wakes me up and gives me energy.  It contains caffeine, but no more than you'd find in a good cup of coffee.  It is NOT full of sugar, and has only 4 calories per bottle.  In addition to caffeine, the product contains a mixture of B vitamins, which have been shown to create alertness and promote overall health.  You really do begin to feel the effects in just a few seconds.  Also, I've tasted some other flavors, but the "berry" is the most palatable.

review/summary: smells toxic; effective but gradually decreases
review/text: VERY effective first time: i pulled an all-nighter and drank this to stay up in class.  I opened it and it smelled really TOXIC but i chugged it down. It only took me 3 minutes or so to become fully alert despite having had no sleep for more 30 hours.<br /><br />i've used it several times since then for all-night studying but i'm not sure why but the impact has slightly decreased every time. also, remember that it keeps you up but that doesn't mean that your attention span will be better.<br /><br />All being said, I would still use it but not very frequently--only when I need to.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

review/summary: Does NOT work...
review/text: I was at Sam's Club one day and this lady had her entire cart filled with these... Of course, I had to see why she was clearly obsessing over it. So I bought a few... I tried one later that night, when I was starting to feel tired. It sort of tasted like cough medicine. I tried one, nothing happened... I tried another, nothing happened. After waiting 1 hr. I finally went to bed. It took a little longer than usual but was easily able to fall asleep...<br /><br />IT DID NOTHING FOR ME<br /><br />I realize caffeine etc. effects people differently but I did not notice any difference. However, if I drink a can of Mt. Dew I feel the effect rather fast...

review/text: Like everything, some things work for some and some things don't. For a while it seemed to help me pretty quickly with the alertness, waking me up, and energy. I bought a few boxes and over the period of about 3 months used them on and off. To me they lost their effect quite quickly. I am not sure whether I got used them, whether it was in my head and never really worked (don't think this is the case), or whether they just stopped working...in my head. In the end I decided if it wasn't working for whatever reason, then why put it in my body.<br />  One last thing, I bought this flavor due to the lower price, but in my opinion the grape is much better tasting and not as bitter as this one.

review/text: These come in really handy when you need an extra "push" to get things moving. Average price is $2-3 per bottle. Sometimes you can get a deal on bulk, but for the money, the Dollar Tree stores carry Stacker 2's for $1/bottle and they are just as effective. Just FYI. Can get costly is you're a heavy user.

review/summary: Too Expensive (in general)
review/text: I used to take 5 hour energy shots on occasion, but the price just really made it not worth it.  It's amazing to think about how much money you spend per month/year if you're taking these on a daily basis.  Also, after doing some research, a lot of the feeling that you think you're getting from 5 hour energy is just a b-vitamin-induced rush, not anything real or long lasting, so I don't like that.<br /><br />If I was getting these for free, I'd be using them... but in terms of stuff I spend money on, I now take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, which is literally 90% cheaper than these shots.  Every since finding the Good Morning Pill, I've made it my mission to try to talk other people out of wasting their money on more expensive energy products.  In the past I've also taken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3WFFG">iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill, Tablets, 84-Count Bottle</a> which seemed to work well enough too.

review/summary: I, For One, Like The Taste.
review/text: Tried these on a whim, after seeing them at gas stations for all these years. The Berry taste took a week to get used to, but now I thoroughly enjoy them.<br /><br />It's hard to say if these specifically perk me up and get me going like a caffeine pill, but I do believe they keep me from being exhausted. I guess I'd speculate that instead of elevating you, they keep you at a constant level, whatever level you happen to be at one you drink one. If you're already tired, IDK how much these would work.<br /><br />Keep in mind the following after reading the above: I have, in my 30 years on this planet, taken far more caffeine than is recommended. I consider myself very tolerant of its affects now. My MD told me to stop taking so much caffeine because it was damaging my kidneys. This probably doesn't help, but it (hopefully) isn't as bad a straight dose of No-Doze.

review/summary: Almost Instant Energy Boost
review/text: For two nights in a row, I had gotten hardly any sleep. The family dog had to go out, someone tried to break into the house, and a major thunderstorm were the things I can remember that kept me from sleeping through the night. I was up late during the night trying to accomplish some late night writing and it all caught up with me. I had a long commute home and I was driving alone. Even with the radio up and the windows cracked blowing in the cold winter air, I didn't want to take any chances. So, when I pulled into a gas station for some gas for the car, I picked up this POMEGRANATE 5 HOUR ENERGY drink.<br /><br />I don't like energy drinks. Most of them taste awful and give me what feels like a combination of indigestion, heart burn, and acid reflux all combined. I've drunk some in the past, but only a few taste ok and seem to work. I usually try to stick with tea or cappuccino, but on this particular evening the coffee machine was on the fritz and iced tea didn't sound good in the winter weather. So, I opted for this POMEGRANATE 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK.<br /><br />I was really surprised. The drink tasted great and didn't have any sort of nasty aftertaste. There was some sweetness to the flavor. Not only that, but about 3-5 minutes after drowning the bottle in one gulp, I felt it kicked in. It was about 5pm and I didn't feel tired until just after 9pm. From now on, if I need a pick-me-up that will last, I'm going to use the 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK.

review/summary: ~Better Than Coffee~
review/text: Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the "5-hour ENERGY" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing.

review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: I used to be totally against energy drinks. I thought they were a scam to get people to placebo themselves into a state of awakeness. Then one day, walking the streets of SF, I was handed a complimentary sample of 5-Hour Energy. I threw it into my bag thinking that I'd never use it. A couple weeks later, I was having a hard day and knew I was going to have a long night, so I figured why not try the freebie, it didn't cost me anything anyway.<br /><br />Oh My Gosh it worked so well! It was amazing. I guess I'm more sensitive to it because 1/3 of the bottle kept me going for hours. So I decided it was worth it to buy a dozen so it's cheaper per unit, and I could just store it for my long days.<br /><br />I've tried Berry and Pomegranate, definitely like the Berry flavor much better.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: These are great and with subscribe n save its cheaper than buying at Sams Club
review/text: Both my girlfriend and I use these, not everyday but those days when you know you need something to help get you going or days when we work overtime. I have to say they do work, some days we split one to save a little more but I have to say they do work, I asked my doctor if they were safe and he said sure when used in moderation as with everything else. The plus side is you do get a boost of vitamins that you dont when drinking coffee. When we started buying them it was at the local convenience store but at $3-$4 each it was getting expensive. Found them in a local Sams Club for like $39.99 + local tax for a case of 24 and started buying there but that makes it $42.39 for a case. It was nice to see them on amazon Subscribe n Save auto shipment for about $38.xx so almost saving another $5. Nice thing is we have it setup where we get another case right before the previous runs out. Thanks Amazon. One thing I would like is for amazon to offer the pomegranate in the subscribe and save but thats all.

review/text: I will not say I am addicted to 5 hour energy but I have used it quite a bit this summer. I have never been a coffee drinker and don't like the energy drinks I've tried (Red Bull, Monster, etc.) I am a cabinet builder and installer and have never had a busier summer so I found myself putting in long hours. I couldn't believe the first time I tried this that I could actually feel myself "waking up" in the first 5 to 10 minutes. I have done a lot of research on any possible side affects of this stuff and found that it really is safe, if not abused of course. Amazon has the best price that I have found.<br />I prefer the pomegranate over the Orange but it's a little more expensive. The Orange isn't bad , besides I'm not drinking it for the taste!<br />I love it!!

review/summary: Better than other flavors.
review/text: I'm not sure any of these can be considered "good" tasting, but I like the Lemon-Lime better than the other flavors.  Helps to keep them cold, of course, but sometimes you just have to plug your nose and down it.  It works for me, but I don't use them on a regular basis.  I mostly just have some on-hand for those slow, dragging days when I knew I needed to get something done.  Decided buying in bulk on Amazon was better than paying gas station prices.

review/summary: Professional Driver On A Closed Course! :-)
review/text: Like most of the reviews posted here, I give this product a positive rating. For me, it does what it claims to do... and I especially appreciate the "no crash" effect after a few hours! I first found out about this product when I started racing Go-Karts this year... I hit the local Stop-N-Shop before getting to the track and decided to plunk out the $3.00, as I was a bit tired. I threw it in my cooler and then drank it just prior to my qualifying session. Almost immediately, I could feel the "boost"... and it helped out on track! I never felt the Niacin rush that some claim, but the one thing I did notice, was that my jaw was a bit tight due to the jolt of energy. I only have few suggestions: I've tried all the flavors, and I think the Orange flavor is the best; I drink the product chilled... tastes better to me that way; the flavor is a bit too sweet for me so I add it into my personal water bottle; I buy this on amazon because it's a lot cheaper than buying it at my local Stop-N-Shop!

review/summary: 5-hour energy Berry flavor
review/text: This is a really great product. I am currently in college and at times I just cant get motivated to do my school work and at times I am too tired. Regardless of exercise and a healthy diet sometimes I still need a little help. When I use this product, it works really fast and there is no after burn or crash from the product. I usually feel more alert also. I would highly recommend this product to any one who made need a little extra push to get through the day!

review/summary: A ~~MIRACLE~~ when taken at the right time
review/text: So I'm the kind of person that hates getting up in the morning. I get tired, groggy, uncomfortable, and begin to doze off again if I sit down for too long. I get pretty tired throughout my day too, especially in the afternoons. So, when I heard about Five Hour Energy I simply HAD to try it. I had never drunk a lot of caffeine before, and I wasn't too thrilled about it being in this stuff in the first place, but I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />I read online that some people need a whole bottle to feel any effects but that some people only need a teaspoon. So, I started by drinking 1/4 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. Still tired, still unhappy. So I upped it to 1/2 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. I had read somewhere that it tends to work better on an empty stomach, so I tried it first thing when I got up in the morning: NOTHING. I was really hesitant to drink a whole bottle and consume all of that caffeine, so I thought maybe it would work better for me in the afternoon. I tried a half bottle when I got home: NOTHING. I finally decided I would drink a whole bottle in the afternoon thinking all that caffeine had to do something: NOTHING. My next thought was to take a whole bottle in the morning, but after eating something as that helps lessen the chances of having a niacin flush from it: NOTHING. Disappointed, I wad down to the last resort: having it in morning AND on an empty stomach: BINGO! Within five minutes, I was awake, refreshed, and ready to start the day! It was one of the most amazing feelings I've ever experienced; being awake in the morning felt SO good.<br /><br />Needless to say, I now LOVE Five Hour Energy. I feel awake and alert in the mornings whenever I take it. However, I limit myself to 4 bottles per week, as I don't want to get hooked on caffeine or become dependent on the stuff. The only problem (and the reason this is not a 5 star rating) is because it only works in the MORNING and on an EMPTY stomach. I wish I could use it any time during the day but it just doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />If you're hesitant to try it, don't be! Go into your local drugstore and pick up a small pack and try it out. Experiment with different amounts at different times during the day. It seems to work really well for some but not at all for others, so the only way you're going to know if it works for you is by trying it yourself.<br /><br />And there is no crash like the bottle states: it wears off slowly, and if you're moving around all day anyways then you'll wake yourself up naturally by the time it truly wears off. It's great for students who need to stay up late to study, although I've never tried to use it after pulling an all-nighter. You probably need at least a couple of hours of sleep in order for it to work.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best prices for this stuff in large quantities. You can get a 12-pack here for around $1.80 a bottle, which is really good. Flavor-wise, grape is my favorite, but I've tried most of them. The grape seems to have the least bitter taste; it's pretty sweet. The Lemon-Lime is really sour/bitter and the orange has a really potent 'orange-flavored-medicine' taste. Berry is my second favorite, but I'm eager to try the pomegranate.<br /><br />So PLEASE, if you're considering trying this stuff, DO!

review/summary: Perfect for the caffine sensitive
review/text: I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc). But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert.

review/text: This product works great to give you that initial push you sometimes need to get moving without any jittery feelings or crash later.  I only use 1/2 of the bottle at a time and the no refrideration needed makes it handy to keep in the car and drink on the way home from work when you have a lot you need to accomplish at home.  Love it!

review/text: I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days.  Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the "drop" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right?

review/summary: Great gentle energy boost! And healthy!
review/text: My sister started to use this during inventory time's long shifts.  Her triglycerides were sky high before she started her half a bottle, not even every day. When she went back to her doctor, her level had dropped from over 400 to right around 200!  On no medications!  Her doctor says it's due to the niacin.  She told me about the energy boost, since I have Parkinson's Disease and between that & the medications, it was hard to keep up with work.  I love it!  And at these prices I can afford it!

review/summary: Better Than Coffee~
review/text: Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the "5-hour ENERGY" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing.

review/summary: The Gentle Wakeup Method
review/text: I'm a night owl with a 8-4 job that is preceeded by a 1-hour commute, that often gets stuck on call during the late hours simply because my supervisor knows I'll be awake. So sleep is a coveted prize.<br /><br />I originally was drinking Monster energy drinks. While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel. I tried coffee as an alternative, and that was a guarentee for a rebellious stomach, and the stuff usually took a good hour to really have effect no matter how strong I made it.<br /><br />I stumbled onto 5-hour energy when hiding in a 7-11 during a sudden downpour on my walk to the office, and figured, "Eh, why not." I'd seen a few commercials, but kinda just wrote it off - primarily because I utterly hated that their early commericals were almost entirely a smear against other alternatives. I chugged it, then headed back on my walk once it was clear.<br /><br />I was awake and alert by the time I got to the office, and I'd only downed half the bottle. I was expecting an aftershot later from my stomach (I really have a touchy one), with only a very minor reaction from it.<br /><br />Big thing that hit me, was the price they slap on them Downtown; this 12 pack was the answer to that. Especially since I will easily go through them all.<br /><br />I very definitely recommend them.

review/text: I am an Assistant Secretary/Computer TA at a Pre-K/K school and I used to be almost constantly yawning the last couple hours of the day.  I kept seeing these little 5 hour Energy Shots at the local Wal-Mart checkout counters and finally tried one.  NO MORE yawning!  One of these little bottles and I do NOT feel sleepy until the five hours are up!  Depending on when I take one, it sometimes works a little longer.  Now I keep a stash (of every flavor) in my desk drawer for emergencies and I LOVE it!  HIGHLY recommended!!

review/summary: These got me through finals!!!
review/text: This tastes great and is truly effective. I drank half a bottle every few hours everyday during finals week and was able to pound out those practice exams one after another--all day, baby! The best part is that there is no (sudden) crash like there would be after a sugar rush. The fatigue does catch up to you though, but not for a while and definitely not suddenly. I wouldn't advise drinking this first thing in the morning, though, like I did. Although you get a sudden jolt of energy, your stomach might be upset the rest of the day. It's best used to overcome that afternoon drowsiness, or to stay up late.
