review/summary: Bitter taste, roaches
review/text: The packaging had roaches, don't know if that is the seller's fault. We threw away the packaging and washed the cans. The veggies were crisp but had a slight bitter taste, like the water they were packed in had a touch of vinegar. Probably end up throwing them out.

review/text: I love this product.I use it in egg dishes,meatloaf,potato dishes and every time I use it, people exclaim "this is fantastic,what did you put in it" It is on the salty side,so adjust accordingly. The only problem is it's had to find. If you can get your hands on some I suggest you buy several. I made a lasagne with goat cheese and put it in the cheese... heavenly!

review/summary: THE BEST!!
review/text: Because of my Danish background,I use a lot of almond products.  I am unable to buy my usual store brand in my new little town, so I got online and started to read reviews.  My almond extract arrived and was put into a taste test in our almond brownies that very day.  We took these to a middle school picnic and SEVERAL people asked what that incredible flavor was in the brownies!  The extract is wonderful.  There is no bitterness at all.  The flavor is true, rich and strong.  The cost is so reasonable and it was well padded in the package.  This will be my extract from now on.  Try it, you will LOVE it!

review/text: This is exactly what I needed.  I use a lot of almond flavoring, & this bottle-size is great for me.  It is real almond extract and not imitation, which is something that I didn't care about before.  After using this extract, I probably can't use imitation flavoring anymore. This extract gives the perfect Almond taste and that little bite that I like to taste in my recipes.  I will be ordering this as long as it is available.

Push each other off the double scratching pad where I sprinkle the catnip. Two kitties vie for their dose of catnip om, or wherever they go. Munch, munch, then roll again.<br /><br />I'm such their goddess for bringing on such delight. What little to make so much happiness. Crazy Kitty Catnip! Ahhhhhh.

There were all these orange carnations that clashed with the rest of the flowers and I don't even see carnations in the picture listed. I paid $70 for the flowers with shipping and it was NOT worth it. The teddy bear in the pic looks like it has value, the one my mother received looks like it came from a claw machine. Wish I wouldn't have paid so much money for such a cruddy arrangement.

review/text: Having lost 120lb with a gastric bypass, I can no longer eat high fat, sugar ladden items.  These little bites (I wouldn't call them cookies, they are more like little confections).  Give me a sweet indulgence without sabotaging my continued efforts at weight loss.  Oddly enough before the gastric bypass, I tried the fat free but sugared ones and disliked them so much that I threw half the tub out.  These however, are well worth the effort to find.  Thirteen little bites for 35 calories and 9 carbs (6 after considering the fiber) and 4 grams of protein.  A wonderful little bite of delight.  The chocolate are just as good.

review/text: I've had meringues before and have not been that impressed with them. Miss Meringue Vanilla Chocolettes are the perfect twist on the idea. they take a well made basic vanilla meringue and drizzle stripes of chocolate on them. The chocolate stripe adds just the right boost of flavor and as the heat of your mouth melts the chocolate it also adds moisture and txeture to the meringues. These are a great treat and not bad on calories either.

review/text: Ok, these cookies are definitely not like the meringues with sugar, I agree those taste a million times better. However, when you want to snack and feel like eating a lot, these are great. 1 serving is only 40 calories, 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein. They are very chocolatey. You can eat the entire package for 80 calories and still get some protein and fiber. They do stick to your teeth, that's for sure. So, if you are really trying to limit your calories, these are good. However, if you care less about the calories and rather eat fewer cookies, go for the ones with sugar (they are delicious). I'm trying to eat less sugar and find meringues addictive so I'm happy with these.

review/summary: Great nutritional profile, tastes better than the vanilla variety
review/text: These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.  The fact there's a reasonable amount of protein in there is a bonus.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up I appreciate having a treat to bring to parties and dinners that I can both share AND eat, while staying within my daily nutritional target.  I like to bring them to church for coffee break after the service.<br /><br />I can find the chocolate ones in a grocery store 40 min from my home, but the vanilla ones nowhere.  This price beats the other online offers and you only have to buy 6 containers at a time.<br /><br />The chocolate meringues taste better by themselves than the vanilla meringues, although neither is to die for.<br /><br />Paired with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIZ9O">TAZO Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, however, the vanilla meringues are fantastic.  I haven't tried the chocolate meringues with citrus tea, but I bet they'd be good too.<br /><br />Other citrus teas would probably also work.  For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFM7U6">Numi Tea Dry Desert Lime Herbal Tessan, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O9O">Bigelow I Love Lemon Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />I wish they made other sugar free flavors, such as mint or cinnamon.

The thing to be careful of is the weather - if you are eating them in a humid area, you need to double wrap them once they are open, using an additional outer ziploc bag, or they will get kinda chewy.<br /><br />When sent from Amazon, these do break a bit in  transit, but not too badly.

Those with food sensitivites, beware, the cookies are dyed green using FD&C Yellow No. 5.<br /><br />However... meringues, being the delicate little buggers that are, probably shouldn't be shipped excessively. My 6 containers had a lot of shards and dust in the bottom, but unlike the one other reviewer mentioning this, I would say that 80% of the cookies were still intact. Still, for a gift, might be better to buy them for a bit more money at your local Sh*pR*te or Wh*le F**ds (who generally carry the larger sized mint meringues.)

review/text: These are great for people on a low sugar diet.  They are very tasty and melt in your mouth.  They contain less than five calories apiece, so you can satisfy your sweet tooth without damaging your diet.<br /><br />The sweeteners do include isomalt, so there is that problem some of us have with gas -- but since they are quite puffy, a true meringue, you wouldn't be tempted to eat the whole package, so I've not had much of a problem with embarrassing gas.<br /><br />They're free of most artificial ingredients -- isomalt is a natural food -- but do contain Splenda.<br /><br />All in all a true calorie bargain!

review/summary: Not bad, for Sugar Free
review/text: Let me say first that these aren't a bad snack food.  They have the all the sweetness and flavor you're looking for in a meringue cookie.  The problem comes in the fact that they don't "finish" well. That is, they tend to leave a gummy residue on the molars, which is easily removed by the tongue but still annoying. It does become an issue if you eat an actual "serving size" as you end up constantly removing that residue.<br /><br />I won't be ordering again.

review/text: The taste very similar to the original vanilla, which I ordered just a little while ago. The do have that nice crunchy texture to start, but then end up gummy and sticks to your teeth. Not bad if you have a craving for them, but you will want to brush your teeth and floss after eating them and for some people they will hate the clingy fee. It's not really a problem for those who eat them by putting them in their mouth and letting them dissolve, more for those who munch on them.

They are somewhat different, and remind me of a chocolate-flavored cheese doodle in consistency, although less full of air pockets. not a strong chocolate flavor, but definitely a guilt free treat.

review/summary: Great nutritional profile, tastes good with orange tea
review/text: These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.  The fact there's a reasonable amount of protein in there is a bonus.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up I appreciate having a treat to bring to parties and dinners that I can both share AND eat, while staying within my daily nutritional target.<br /><br />I can find the chocolate ones in a grocery store 40 min from my home, but the vanilla ones nowhere.  This price beats the other online offers and you only have to buy 6 containers at a time.<br /><br />The chocolate meringues taste better by themselves than the vanilla, but paired with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIZ9O">TAZO Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, the vanilla meringues are fantastic.  I bet they'd be good with other citrus teas as well.<br /><br />For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFM7U6">Numi Tea Dry Desert Lime Herbal Tessan, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O9O">Bigelow I Love Lemon Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />I wish they made other sugar free flavors, such as mint or cinnamon.

review/summary: Wonderful syrup!
review/text: I first had this syrup at a local coffee shop- their drink of the day was a "Pistachio Latte," which I had never had before.  It was so good that it became my "usual."  I realized I should try to make the same drink at home to save money- so I just recently bought a bottle.  So glad I did!<br /><br />First of all, Amoretti had the product on my doorstep faster than Amazon Prime delivered packages when I was a member!  Secondly the syrup is SO delicious; I've found 2 pumps is just the right amount for 1 latte (so one bottle should make well over 40 drinks!)  It also comes with a handy pump- I've purchased other syrup brands before and none of them came with that.  Thirdly, I had an inquiry with Amoretti over my order (a mistake on my part) and they went above and beyond to rectify the situation.  Excellent customer service- I will definitely be buying from them again.  Can't wait to try some of the other flavors!

review/text: I've tried making Indian food for years, grinding spices, closely following the directions in high end Indian cookbooks.  They just never worked.  The spices were too subtle, too refined.  The thing I love about Indian food is how it practically assaults your mouth (but in a good way).  While whinging about my failures to an Indian friend of mine, she suggested I use the seasonings that regular old Indian people actually used.  She brought me a bunch of MDH spice mixes.  My cooking world changed.  MDH spice blends are dirt cheap and absolutely delicious.  I have a few favorites, and at the top of the list is their Dal Mahkani, which, oh my god, it's amazing.  Buy it, buy it, buy it.  You will not believe how good this stuff is.  And if you go for the down and dirty, smack you in the face awesomeness that only Indian god can give you, grab a box of Chunky Chat while you're at it.  It will rock your world.

review/text: The manufacturer, Faerie's Finest, has confirmed with me, that there are "TRACE ELEMENTS" in this product that may cause an allergic reaction.  I have been using this product for some time now and really like it and I wanted to make a peanut butter flavored cake for a friend who has allergies to peanuts, so I called the manufacturer as to what the actual ingredients are.  I waited almost 2 weeks for an answer.  I finally had to call them back and had to wait for the owner to reply later in the day.  The person answering the phone read me the ingredients stating there were natural ingredients but this is NOT WHAT THE LABEL STATES. The label says ARTIFICIAL flavors. But she "assured" me it "should be fine"!!  I waited to hear from the owner/manufacturer.  When I got the call back I was informed that the ingredients were naturally derived and contained trace elements that may cause an allergic reaction!  I am SO GLAD I CALLED!  The labeling is not accurate and poses a severe health risk to those with peanut allergies.  The product should be discontinued/recalled until proper labeling can be established.  Otherwise - if you have no allergy to nuts it is a good extract.

review/text: The cookies & cream flavor is phenomenal. I've tried the chocolate ice cream flavor and I'm not very fond of it. This is by far better tasting. I'll probably try the banana cream and vanilla flavors next, however this flavor will be hard to beat. What else can be said? It tastes great, not too sweet and it fills you up enough that you're not hungry for hours.<br /><br />I am very overweight and am in the midst of a major weight loss program. After I lost my first 30 pounds, my blood tests indicated less than normal creatinine levels. This may have been an indicator that I was losing muscle mass along with the fat. My nutritionist recommended a protein supplement, along with regular exercise if I wanted to keep my muscles healthy. The 40 grams of protein in this drink is a major kick for muscle health and at only 260 calories, I can have two per day, and reduce my other meal portions to balance the total calories. This drink has relatively low fat too, which is all the better.

But after getting a case four months ago, the last two are still in my refrigerator, and I just can't bring myself to choke them down. They're just too cloyingly sweet for my taste. It's possible that my low carb regimen has made me just too sensitive to sweet taste, but I still use Adkins shakes and don't cringe when I go to consume one.<br /><br />Also, the Adkins shakes are about the same cost per ounce, but are smaller. These are pretty big (17 oz), so you better be ready for a big shake. Even when I started, I routinely threw away the last two or three ounces, so that's another mark against them compared to Adkins, which have a portion size more in my range.<br /><br />I think these work better for someone who's more on a body building regimen than a weight loss one. I do some of both, but my primarly focus has been on high protein, low carb for weight management. These didn't do the trick for me in that area. They're not terrible, but I won't get getting any more.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: The product is good for on the go cold or room temp but I'm amazed how much sodium is in there! 600mg!  The taste is decent (although I can taste all the sodium) and it has texture to feel satisfied.  Too many addititives for me.  Good for once in a while but not everyday.  I will consider my options.

review/summary: Still trying to decide if I like the flavor
review/text: I'll give these 4* for now, because I love everything except the flavor.  The protein in these shakes is very high quality.  It's a mix of 7 different components and the predominant one is whey.  Perfect for drinking after a workout.  Amazingly, they have no sugar and are pretty low in fat.<br /><br />For the Cookies & Cream, I'm still on the fence about the flavor.  I love the Vanilla and I've been drinking 4-5 of them per week for years.  The Cookies & Cream tastes as advertised when it goes down.  But the aftertaste has a kind of bite to it that's hard to describe.  I suspect I'll get used to it and keep ordering this flavor for variety.  But it won't replace my staple Vanilla.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I had seen these brownies on GMA and they supposedly were voted "America's best brownie".  I had been so excited to try a very famous brownie from a company in Chelsea Market when we were in NY a couple years ago and was horribly disappointed so I was a bit gun shy to try another media hyped brownie, but curiosity got the better of me.  These are indeed very delicious...moist and full of flavor.  I've only tasted the chocolate chunk, but the box came with caramel pecan and peanut butter as well.  I gave these 5 stars based on the chocolate chunk.  However, since they all have the same chocolate base I expect the other two will be just as yummy.  No disappointment here - - these are terrific!

review/summary: THE BEST APPLE CHIPS EVER!!!!!!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE these apple chips. My order of 12 (2.5 oz bags) came on Wednesday and they were gone by the following Saturday. I actually just placed another order today as well. I can't get enough! I'm not even a big fan of apples but there is just something so delicious about these apple chips. I've tried most of the flavors and the original and cinnamon are the best. I suggest everyone try these, but know you will probably be addicted after the first bag. Yum!

review/summary: These are fried apple slices
review/text: These apple chips have good flavor, they're just a little bit sweet, and they have a bit of a crunch.  That being said, I was a bit turned off by the product quality.  Every bag has had stem and seed fragments, and well, the apple peel is a little overwhelming.  I don't think I'll have a problem using all 12 bags up.  In fact, I have eaten a few bags in one sitting without realizing it (not great since 2.5 servings per bag) but I am not sure this will be a regular item in my pantry.  If you feel like a fried apple makes a better (i.e. healthier) snack than a fried potato, then this product is probably worth trying, but I personally prefer freeze-dried apples to these fried apples.

review/summary: Much less flaovr-nearly same calories
review/text: These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the "bla". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels.

I might add that these are cats so fussy they won't eat half of the varieties Fancy Feast offers. Now we get extra tubs of Beneful so we have enough to supplement the cats' dry food as well as for the dogs.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I've developed a love of anything with pumpkin spice in it over the past couple of years, so when I saw this tea I had to try it.  First of all, I'm a fan of Bigelow teas.  They're always full of flavor and the individual foil packages keep the tea fresh for a very long time.  This tea has become one of my favorites.  It has a great pumpkin spice flavor and I found it's the best with a little milk and sugar.  It's good without adding anything, but adding milk and sugar (or whatever sweetener you may use) makes it taste almost like pumpkin pie.<br /><br />Many pumpkin-flavored beverages out there fall flat when it comes to the pumpkin spice flavor, but this tea nailed it.  I'm glad it comes in a pack of 6 boxes because I'm sure it's going to be hard to find once winter is over.

review/text: I was a little concerned when I first opened the tea packet, because the aroma reminded me a little of bubble gum.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the taste is actually pretty well balanced, if not a little sweet.  The cinnamon component is borderline artifical, but I do not consider it off-putting.  I sweetened it with a little maple syrup (100% real syrup, that is), and found it quite drinkable this way.  I'd be intetested to see what it is like with a drop of milk, but it really doesn't need it.

review/summary: Not bad, but there is better out there
review/text: Bigelow Pumpkin Spice (Autumn tea)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 30-60mg according to box<br />Ingredients- Black Tea, natural pumpkin flavors with other natural flavors (soy lecithin), cinnamon, licorice root, clove, ginger, pumpkin flakes<br /><br />**Very important on the first steep you do not go over 4 minutes, it produces a very bitter cup<br /><br />-Smell:  In packet(2)/ Steeping (2) Has a scent somewhat reminiscent of pumpkin but falls rather  flat something else overwhelms the pumpkin I may be off but I think it's the clove (scent intensifies when over ice)<br />-Taste<br />+Unsweetened : Hot (1)/Cold (2) Flavor of tea is rather bland, I detect very little pumpkin flavor,<br />+Sweetened: Hot(3)/Cold (3)-Flavor and body of tea really improves with the sweetener. Taste is still a little bland, but there is something very slightly bitter to it (perhaps the licorice, I do not like licorice root).<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and  1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep (3.5) - On the second steep the flavors and scents finally come through and produce a more respectable cup however still on the weaker side for me.  It should be noted the 2nd steep will stand up to a longer steeping time. Tried a 3rd steep and it was too weak.<br /><br />Summary- I paid more for this than on Amazon by ordering a holiday tea collection direct from Bigelow (the single box on here was to much and I wanted variety. I love Halloween and as such pumpkin things tend to suck me in, for the price it is on here I would not discourage purchase however just know there is better out there. If you are looking for something to get you in the mood for fall, this will do. I will happily finish the box, but unless it is clearance at a store I do not plan to purchase more.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.  I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my other tea reviews this is only my 2nd so far.

review/summary: A pleasant licorice-based tea, not only for fall
review/text: This tea is excellent for licorice tea lovers, since that is its base.  The licorice gives a natural bit of sweetness without any sugar, and is delightful.  Cardiac patients or those with high blood pressure, be warned that this tea might raise BP and is possibly not for you.  Ask your physician before drinking this, OK?<br /><br />Anyway, the pumpkin flavor is noticeable and the spices complement it well.  Some others have compared this tea to chai tea (more accurately called "masala chai") but this doesn't taste enough like chai to make such a comparison, for me.<br /><br />Licorice fans, pumpkin fans, spice tea fans - go for it.  You probably won't be disappointed.
