review/summary: Amazing! Wondeful...Awesome!
review/text: I must say these coco waters are very refreshing. I have ended up chugging 2 or 3 of these on a hot day, and they do really cool you down. The electrolytes really help you recover fast from a hot day, to a rough work day, to a heavy work out. These things are awesome. Plus the LIGHT mango and peach flavor is great too!<br /><br />But these packs are actually kind of hard to open honestly. I mean some of them will open fine, but twisty caps on them aren't the best. I actually had to take a knife and cut out the piece that was holding the spout to the tetra pack on some of them. But the 11 oz packs are really awesome.<br /><br />Do give these a try. And you will never go back to Gatorade!

review/summary: Great coconut flavor, with nice mango flavor
review/text: Coconut water is supposed to be a healthier version of a sports drink- good balance of electrolytes with natural sugars.<br /><br />I like the taste and value of these (the 11 ounce ones were too small for a session at the gym).<br /><br />If they are far from their expiration date, the mango flavor almost tastes like fresh mango's. Closer to it, it still tastes fine, just not as good.<br /><br />Of all the flavors I've had (pineapple, plain, passion fruit, acai), this is my favorite. The others aren't bad, but if you like the taste of mango, and a little more bold flavor, this one is the best.

review/text: I order this product through Amazon because the price is unbeatable and it ships for free with Super Saver.  I drink coconut water everyday and the 17 ounce is two servings, is a great source of potassium and vitamin C!  As for the taste, I know coconut water doesn't appeal to everyone.  My roommate thinks they are gross but I prefer it to the taste of other sports drinks.  Peach and Mango flavor is a lot sweeter than some of the other flavors I have tried.

I tried other flavors, such as the acai pomegranate and I didn't like it very much. The tangerine isn't too bad. My favorite is peach & mango! I order that and the pineapple by the case now so I always have a cold box ready to go!! So tasty and refreshing, better than just plain ol' water! Definitely worth subscribing to monthly delivery through Amazon!!

review/summary: Best of the Flavored Coconut Waters
review/text: I have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years.  For the most part I love the natural "regular" variety, but was able to buy a variety pack through Amazon.  After tasting the different flavored varieties, I found that I liked the tangerine but LOVED the peach/mango.  So far, the boxes I have enjoyed have been very consistent in flavor, which is the only downside to coconut water that I have found to date.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about these waters was the container.  It has a small screw top that makes the container resealable and less likely to spoil and/or spill in between drinks.  At 17 ounces it is unlikely for me to finish drinking it in one sitting so I really appreciate this small innovation.  I wish they could do this on the 11 ounce containers but this product is costly enough without adding to the expense.<br /><br />I am giving this particular product 5 stars, because of the combination of great taste and the innovative packaging.  If you need to pay attention to sugar, stick with the unflavored coconut waters because this is sweet, with about twice the natural sugars of the unflavored.  Not a reason to downgrade the product, but something to make a note of if sugar is an issue in your life.<br /><br />Give it a try and enjoy!

review/summary: Quality problem, Unknown sediments
review/text: We just had 4 cases of these from amazon and these are NOT the same as 11.2 oz ones. There are numerous brown specks or particles floating in the drink if you look it closely under the light. We didn't discover this until we realized that the drink did something funny to our stomachs afterwards. The constitution is much murkier than previous 11.2 oz packages and doesn't taste the same. We think this has a different processing procedure than the 11.2 oz packages. Maybe it has to do with the factory filtration system or even a serious quality control problem. As with all other food imports, very few are actually sample tested by FSIS/DOA for safety or against the ingredients listed by the manufacturer. Any feedback to us from other reviewers is encouraged. We'd like to know what these brownish particles are and why they are there. If you find it exactly the same as 11.2 oz ones, let other readers know too. For now, we'd suggest you go test one in a local supermarket and see if it's to your liking and compare these with 11.2 oz ones.

review/text: Yeah, the pkg says the Cocoa is Fair Trade Certified and it's made in Belgium and it has no trans fat and nothing artificial but it's first ingredient on its list is sugar and it has palm and/or canola oil.  It's not as sweet as candy as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LL5DS">Nocciolata Organic Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa and Milk -- 9.52 oz</a> but it is MUCH more sweet than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JG5TVS">Justin's Nut Butter Natural Chocolate Hazelnut Blend, 16 Ounce plastic jars (Pack of 3)</a> so no, I wouldn't buy it again on a regular basis but maybe occasionally.  It's incredibly smooth and chocolatey but it's on the sweet side.  Sometimes, I may want its sweetness on my english muffin or hard shortbread-like cookie, but after tasting Justin's non-sweet, hardy nutella, it's hard for me to switch on a regular basis to a sweet nutella.

review/text: This stuff is OK, but truly it is SO not better than Nutella.  I bought a case of 3 based on the other reviews here, and I really have to say that they were all flat out wrong.  This stuff is WAY sweeter than Nutella, no way around that.  Plus, they are both made with sugar so they're equal in that ingredient, but obviously this product has more of it than Nutella.  To me, Nutella is the do all end all of hazelnut cocoa spreads -- it's really thick, it's really chocolatey, and yes, it does come in a plastic jar but at least you can recycle it, right?  I did prefer the glass jar of this one but that isn't why i buy something. If both products were equal in every way except for the glass jar, then I'd go with this.  They're not equal, so I'm going back to Nutella! Plus, Nutella comes in huge jars AND you can buy it at Costco.  How much better can it get?  Easy access, good price, fantastic flavor!  Love Nutella!

review/text: I was a Nutella fan until I saw this on the shelf at the local Whole Foods.  Thought of giving it a try (Although more expensive than Nutella), and WOW.....thank goodness I tried it.  TASTES WAY BETTER than Nutella.  Yes, it is not as sweet as Nutella but I think that's how it SHOULD taste.  Too much of sweetness in anything is sick.  It is also not as greasy(emulsion-like) as Nutella.  It tastes more hazelnutty than Nutella. And it does not have artificial anything in it unlike Nutella which contains vanillin.  Nutella is not an inferior product but surely NOT BETTER THAN THIS ONE.

review/summary: Perfect for a Harry Potter  Party!
review/text: I bought two boxes of these jelly beans as they were the closest thing you can buy (at a reasonable price) to the Harry Potter "Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans". I bought two boexes because I thought there'd only be 20 beans in a box but in fact there must have been at least 40. We had way too many left over. The kids got a huge kick out of daring eachother to try one. Shipping was fast and included in these $6/box jelly beans.

review/text: This is the best way to start your day! I eat it right out of the bag.  It has great flavor and all the ingredients are natural and good for you.  I usually keep open bags refigerated and store unopened bags in the freezer. Compared to other granolas, it is not too sweet! It fills me up and satisfies me!  After losing quite a bit of weight, it seems to be helping me keep my weight where I want it to be, and still be able to enjoy some great peanut butter taste.  You can't beat the price, and free shipping, compared to what I have found elsewhere.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Goodness for Breakfast
review/text: I'd never heard of this granola before until I found it at Big Lots.  I love peanut butter, so I had to give it a try.<br /><br />Texture: Crunchy but not at all too hard.  Doesn't need to soak in milk in order to eat.  Crunchy peanut pieces and halves found throughout.<br /><br />Flavor: Must love peanut flavors!  I was afraid it would taste like plain peanuts more than actual peanut butter, but I was wrong.  Both flavors are present.  The larger clusters of granola are held together with peanut butter and have the best flavor.  You could even add chocolate chips to it to make it even more indulgent!<br /><br />Ingredients: I like that the ingredients are all natural.  No artificial flavors or preservatives, no coloring agents added, and no high fructose corn syrup.  It's made with whole grains, making it a great choice for breakfast.<br /><br />Satisfaction:  When I ate this in the morning before work, it kept me full for hours before I even thought about needing a snack.  That was great.<br /><br />Recommendations: I recommend this granola to anyone who enjoys peanut/peanut butter flavors.  It tastes great, fills you up, and keeps you energized for hours.

review/summary: I love it, but
review/text: This granola is great. Perhaps what I appreciate most about it is that it's not overly sweetened--just enough to get the granola to stick together well. The peanut butter flavor is subtle but adds a wonderful richness to the granola, making it an excellent snack food any time. The only problem is that I bit into one of the clusters and it had so much sea salt it literally tasted as if I had bitten into crystallized brine. Luckily, it only happened once. It's not anything I would say is regular, for sure, but if you find a big honkin' chunk of granola in your bag...give it a little nibble before you pop it in your mouth.

review/summary: WOW, what a price hike!!!
review/text: I used to LIVE off this stuff.  I've probably purchased 10-15 boxes of it over the past few months.  But I just logged on to order another two boxes and I see that Amazon has jacked the price up from $19 to $28!?  Give me a break!  Unless they put the price back to where it was before, I've placed my last order.<br /><br />Update 2/7/12: Well the prices has come down SOME now...enough for me to buy a couple more boxes.  A few weeks ago I found what looked like a large fingernail clipping sticking out of one of the granola clumps.  Upon further examination it was "only" a thin white sliver of plastic, thank God.  I let that slide.  Now today I find ANOTHER similar piece of plastic in a different package from a different order--and this time it made it into my mouth before I discovered it.  Has anyone else experienced this???  There are a lot worse things that could be in one's food, but still!<br /><br />Another thing--lately I've been biting into huge chunks of salt in this stuff!  Apparently Erin needs to stir this stuff better!  Lastly, as someone who's bought a ton of this stuff over the years, I can say that this is a very inconsistent product.  Some batches are TO DIE FOR, others are completely blah.  Some are beyond dry, while others are like eating soft peanut butter cookies.  You just never know which batch you're gonna get!

It's a bit on the heavy side...sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it's truly enjoyable.  I would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so I wouldn't suggest daily intake of it.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it too.

review/text: I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/text: Cook's Illustrated (begrudgingly) gave their thumbs-up to boxed Pomi, as the box avoids Bisphenol A (BPA). Anyway I am no expert. I use the product for sauces generally in the winter when farmer's market tomatoes are just glimmers in the farmers' eyes.<br /><br />Finding Pomi isn't always easy or affordable compared to hot house and imported tomatoes where we live. It's hard to beat the price here. We bought on Amazon via Peters Select and were much satisfied.

review/summary: Some Education About Vegan Cats
review/text: Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know "garbage in, garbage out!"<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix.

review/summary: Kitties go crazy for veggie cat food!
review/text: The two little darlings at my home have been eating this particular cat food since we got them from the local shelter at the ripe young age of 6 months.  We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!

review/summary: The best cat food anywhere
review/text: Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans, my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store-bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them.  On this food for years, my cats are shiny, never gassy, never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder, and their poop ain't sweet but seems less foul than when on other food. Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it's not in any stores.  It's not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ($90 including shipping) lasts me about 12 weeks, so under $4 a week per cat, maybe $2 more than Purina, $1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro.

review/summary: Evolution vegan cat food is the way to go!
review/text: My 9-month-old cat has been eating Evolution for most of his life now; I transitioned him shortly after I adopted him. He's doing extremely well; he eats Evolution every day and loves it. His coat is glossy and he has crazy kitten energy.<br /><br />I very recently rescued an adult cat, and I'm slowly transitioning her from conventional cat food to this. (When I first brought her home, she wouldn't eat for two days and was extremely skinny.) I also was taking care of a friend's cat for a week, and when I saw she wasn't eating her own food, I brought a baggie of the Evolution kibble, which she was interested in, and then ate.<br /><br />Most of all, I want my cats to eat this food because it's healthier for them; it doesn't contain the waste animals, beaks, hair, and ear tags that all pet foods (even premium) can contain--and is nutritionally complete, with the protein and amino acids they need. As a plus, it's a tasty food they like; when water is added--which it should be, to prevent dehydration--it's economical, too.<br /><br />It's a great deal all around!

review/summary: 4 years of success with this food
review/text: We started using this food in April 2007 after a recommenation from a person who raises and breads AKC dogs that compete in prestigious dog shows.  I had told her how my cat developed allergies to most foods and really wasn't doing well with the Hill's Low-Allergen z/d Prescription Diet food.  Mine you, we always fed our cat premium cat foods.<br /><br />So, after ordering a $19.95 intro pack from Evolution Diet, we were thrilled to see our cat immediately embrace the dry vegan food.  Our vet had some concerns, telling us to make sure there is taurine in the food (which it does).<br /><br />Flash forward to his most recent vet visit which was last summer.  He had to be put under anesthesia for a tooth cleaning and while he was under, the vet gave him a complete physical.  When he was picked up, the vet wanted us to confirm his age.  15 years old was the reply.  She couldn't understand where we got that estimate from, surely it must have been wrong.  She estimate the age at about 6 or 7 years.  Well, we adopted him at a Humane Society as a baby so we knew for sure he was 15 (now 16).  All I can say is that the food must have had a huge influence on his "real age" vs. "physical age."  He has a shiny coat, he is healthy, he is active, and he still loves his food.  The only concern he has is a recent cracking of his bones of his back sometimes when he is stretching.  Luckily, he is not in pain and he still goes on his regular daily gallop/sprint, which sounds like a pack of elephants stamping around the house (this is one of his trademarks, he has always done this).<br /><br />In terms of moisture concerns or urinary issues, we have not had any.  We do not moisten his food.  He doesn't like it that way.  But he eats a lot of fruits and vegetables.  I didn't even know that cats liked fruits/vegetables before 1995, but this one aggressively stands firm on his love for them.  In fact, he has to have cantaloupe daily, it's non-negotiable.  It has been one of those things where he has demanded it for years.  Secondly, he loves bananas, so he gets a couple of pieces per week.  And, during the summer months, he gets asparagus spears, which happen to be his #2 favorite thing on earth, next to cantaloupe.  He has also been known to steal brocolli off of our plates and run away and eat it too.  He is really good at swiftly stealing food, even at 16.<br /><br />I give this food a 5/5 review because in my experience, it has been like a fountain of youth for my cat, who I adore.  I am so happy we were told about this food four years ago, and I will continue to feed it to my cat without reservations.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY THE BEST DOG AND CAT FOOD BAR NONE!
review/text: Evolution Diet food is by far the healthiest dog and cat food anywhere! I say this because I am living proof this product reversed diabetes in one of my cats caused by the commercial pet food I thought it was "wholesome". Evolution Diet is the alternative dog and cat food to the commercial poison food sold by all commercial pet foods.<br /><br />I have been using Evolution Diet for over 17 years now and it reverses and prevents diseases while maintaining strong and healthy immune systems.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Just make sure you transit the food slowly and make sure you ad water to the kibble 1-1 ratio as recommended and directed on the package. It is not recommended to feed dry kibble to cats as some cats, particularly males are predisposed to urinary blockages. Always ad filtered water 1-1 ratio to the dry food. This also keeps your cat hydrated which is very important for maintaining good health.<br /><br />That's it...........your cat will thank you and will live a healthy, long life, as it should be......<br /><br />You can also go to Evolution Diet's website: [...]

review/text: I have been feeding my two cats this food for most of their 12 years. Although it took some getting used to when first changing over, they are and always have been in excellent health with good eyesight, teeth and energy. It costs more than other foods but what it saves me in vet bills and the knowledge that my cats are not eating the horrible stuff that is in regular cat food is well worth the price.

review/summary: Evolution Diet Cat & Dog Food is the Best
review/text: My pets (1 Dog and 2 Cats) have been on Evolution Diet for years. Both my cats love the food and have been on it since they were 4 months old. My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.

review/text: Although the price initially seems a bit more than other cat foods, if you add water to it like the instructions say, you end up saving a lot of money...possibly up to the thousands in vet's bills (I recently spent $3,200 because my cat got sick from contaminated food...watch out for Nutro dry cat food. Many pet owners have has sick/dead pets becasue of it). My boys like the taste, especially when mixed with Evolution Moist Food. I tried it (something I'd never do with ordinary, sick-animal by product totally gross food) and it's quite tasty! We are now an Evolution family for life. It's an ethical, small company, and I like what they stand for and what they produce.

review/text: this is a great pet food - both the cat and dog varieties. AND it contains only vegan ingredients - very hard to come by, and you know if you've been looking!  my animals love the evolution diet pet foods - and actually gobble it up faster than their old pet food! it is a bit pricey, so unfortunately had to switch my dogs to a different vegan brand, though my cats still enjoy this food every day.  my cats tend not to like it with water added, just as a tip.

review/text: This is a great sassafras concentrate.  When I can get the root, I actually prefer it over the concentrate, but it's certainly a really good "substitute".<br /><br />As I'm writing my review, I'm seeing a price which is over double what I paid when I purchased through Amazon.com perhaps a month ago.  Currently it's not being offered by Amazon directly, but through a third party.  Personally I wouldn't pay the high prices and will wait to see if Amazon offers it again, so I can get the free shipping also.

review/text: I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  I started looking for it in grocery stores and online.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked how they made the tea.  I was told it was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked for it online and ordered it from Amazon.com.  It tastes like flat rootbeer to me.<br /><br />Some reviews I've read claim this product isn't like the real drink brewed from the Sassafras root.  I've never had the "real" drink; but, I do like this product.  I have ordered the pack of 6 12oz bottles three times in the last month.  Twice for me and once for our son as a Christmas gift.  He loves to try different teas.  He's had the "real" thing before when he was camping with the Boy Scouts so I'm curious to know what he thinks of the Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.<br /><br />I also ordered a box of sassafras teabags for him to try as well.  I didn't like mine; but, he may think the teabags taste more like the "real" thing.  If he likes the teabags he'll get the other 19 bags from my box, too.

review/summary: So Glad to Find An Old Friend!
review/text: I never had sassafras tea as a child, but used to chew small twigs and loved the flavor. I'm always on the lookout for a caffeine- and sugar-free beverage, so I was an instant fan when I discovered Pappy's Sassafras Tea many years ago. I used to get it in the summers from a small grocery store in the Adirondack Park. The bottles were always covered with dust, so I was disappointed but not surprised when the summer arrived when it was no longer stocked. Not really expecting to find it, I did a search on Google and found it at Amazon (should have known)! It makes a wonderful iced tea, really quick and easy to make up because the boiling, brewing, and cooling process has already been done and all I have to do is add cold water and Equal. I don't have to worry about how much I drink or drinking it before bedtime, because it's caffeine-free. And I don't even have to lug it home, the mailman does it for me!

The sweetener that you use will make a big difference taste.

review/text: When searching for a dog food, I read many articles about the importance of not having corn or meat byproducts in a dog's food due to the sensitive nature of a dog's stomach. Some of these articles would come from dog food websites where the ingredient list would have corn as the first ingredient. We originally bought the Wellness brand Puppy food, but shortly after we got our dog, we realized that we were going to need food for a large breed puppy. Luckily, Wellness makes that food. It contains no corn and we have a happy, energetic puppy with a shiny coat and clear eyes. She never leaves a bite in her dish!

Within 12 hours of starting her on this food her stools firmed up and has been normal ever since, and she seems to be growing well on it also. The Vet said she was in perfect shape for her age, but we only feed about 3/4 of what the bag recommends. Like the Vet said they are selling dog food, and most brands recommend to much food on their bag.

I decided on Wellness for it's quality ingredients and precise analysis. Well the first time I feed my puppy, he gobbles up over half their daily recommended feeding, after having fed him this morning a large canned food breakfast. I had never seen him gobble up dry food like that. As the day wore on I noticed an increased energy level in my puppy and he gladly had a second helping at night. I am already very happy and have high hopes for this food.

review/summary: Great for our husky-german shepherd mix
review/text: Wellness for large breed pups was recommended to us by our vet, and we have been loyal to it.  We have been feeding it to our husky/ German Shepherd mix for almost 6 months, and she the healthy weight and lean body that you want for a large breed at her age.<br /><br />She had some diarrhea and digestive issues with other foods, but Wellness fixed that problem.  Though this food has some sweet potato in it (a bad ingredient for her), it is low enough. Whenever our pup starts to have digestive problems from a new snack, we back off and feed her only her Wellness chow, and the problem goes away in a day or so.<br /><br />We can even use this doggy food as a treat for training because she is extremely food-driven.  I also love that it is a dry food that is easy to carry around in my pocket as a treat, or on trips where we bring her a meal.  I highly recommend it to owners who care very much about feeding their pets quality food.

review/summary: Great quality food
review/text: I have a bouvier des flandres who I fed this food to until he was about a year old.  My dog's breeder recommended Iams and Eukanuba, but Wellness is such a far superior product.  I no longer order on Amazon though because Petflow.com is cheaper.

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food
review/text: I feed this to my two 6 month old golden retrievers.  I tried numerous other foods that they were just not interested in (eukanuba most recently). In addition to not liking the others - one dog was experiencing repeated ear infections at only 4 months. That is when I switched.  I mix the dry with 3 ounces of canned Wellness Puppy. They love it; ears are perfect, and no digestive issues at all.  highly recommend.

review/summary: Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed Puppy Food Better Than Science Diet Large Breed Puppy Food?
review/text: I have two golden retriever puppies, Darcy (6.5 months) and Eli (4 months). I have been feeding them Science Diet Large Breed Puppy Dog Food. The issue that I am continually having which has caused me to change their dog food to the Wellness SuperMixLarge Breed Puppy food is ... 1. Allergies (Darcy has continual eye tearing and needs Benedryl to stop ... IMO kind of ridiculous that a 6 mo old dog has to take allergen medication) -- Grain in the Science Diet likely the cause. 2. The amount of food needed to give the puppy is HIGHER for the same weight range and age. The second point leads to faster use of food, more fillers instead of nutrition in the food and larger amounts of waste. I have noticed a deterioration in waste from both puppies over time. They have diaherrea more frequently as each of them have got older.<br /><br />After totally switching foods yesterday, I have seen an improvement already in Darcy's tearing. I didn't use the Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed puppy food yet but another highly recommended dog food from samples at local pet stores. I just wanted to get them off Science Diet Large Breed Puppy food as I have heard through multiple sources that this food is terrible. Veternarians tend to recommend Science Diet because the company gives paybacks to veternarians from what I have heard though organizations and people around me.<br /><br />I will be trying the Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed Puppy food due to hearing from muliple sources that the Wellness dog food is a good choice especially the Wellness Core for adults.<br /><br />Two Week Update -- Darcy's eye issue from allergies has almost been resolved in two weeks of using this food. Also, Eli had developed stomach growling after every meal on Science Diet. This no longer occurs with him either. I am very happy with the Wellness Super5Mix Puppy food for Large Breeds. I would definitely recommend over Science Diet Puppy Food for Large Breeds. As far as waste, there is less and as I stated before I feed them less too. This food does not have the fillers like Science Diet does in their puppy food.

review/summary: Great for our GSD pups
review/text: After reading extensively about the horrors of normal dog food, my wife an I wanted a high quality food for our two German Shepherd pups.  We had a 5 year old mix that was getting chronic ear infections and always itching; changing her food to a good quality food (4 Heath in tractor supply) made a huge difference.  With our pups we didn't want to make any mistakes, and research took me to Wellness.  The calcium content is right for large breed pups and my dogs love it.  They look great and are developing well.  The ingredients listed are enough to know this food fits the bill.  Our pups took less than a week to switch over (at 7 weeks...breeder had them on Pedigree which is total crap) and had some runny stools at first, then they firmed up.  If you are reading htis and are on the fence, you should probably search some on what is in normal dog food...it will shock you.

review/text: I was using Royal Canin puppy food at first but then decided to give Wellness a try (for my husband's doberman puppy).  He loves it and its really put weight on him.  He is 7 months old and a little over 95lbs.  His skin no longer looks dry or flaky (as if he had dandruff)... his coat is very shiny and smooth. He has a sensitive stomach but does well on this food.

review/summary: Worth the extra money
review/text: Considering that you can spend a bit less and get some mediocre puppy food, the extra money is worth knowing that I'm feeding my little guy quality food that will help him to grow up big and strong. =)<br /><br />It was important to me that I feed my pup quality ingredients, not animal-by-products and filler.  If I wouldn't want to eat chicken heads, why should he?  On most dog food you will find the first couple ingredients to be by-products, and even "animal-by-products"! You can't even be specific with which animal??  In addition to that there is a bunch of rice and filler.  Wellness has the good stuff - all natural and healthy ingredients that don't just fill your dog up, but provide nutritional content.

review/summary: Human grade
review/text: After losing our beloved dog last year to a host of allergic related diseases, we have settled upon the Wellness line of products. Wellness has been recommended by persons who have extensively researched their ingredients. To our horror, we discovered that most dog foods (including some that come highly recommended by veternarians) can contain ANYTHING due to the lack of inspection by any type of government agency. Euthanized animals and their parts, leashes, collars, microchips, etc. can be processed in their food. Since we have discovered this information, our dogs are healthier, happier, and disease free. It may cost a little more than some of the other brands but the peace of mind that comes with it, knowing we are not helping to kill our animals in the process of feeding them, makes the effort worth it.

review/summary: Great psychological as well as physical deterrent.
review/text: I have two dogs who loved digging up my garden and loved digging under the fence.<br /><br />My in-laws got me a Fido-Shock and I set it up.  During install I decided to test it out, so I held the wire and waited for a zap... nothing.  I double checked the wiring, held it again, and... nothing.<br /><br />As I stood there with the wire in my hand, perplexed, my dog jumped on me.  ZAP!<br /><br />Aagh!<br /><br />Yelp!<br /><br />I had failed to take into considerationt he fact that my rubber shoes didn't gound me.  When the dog jumped on me she grounded us both, and we both got zapped.<br /><br />Getting shocked is unpleasant, more in an unnatural way than in a painful way.<br /><br />The fence was immediatly effective.  I think they each got shocked one more time and learned their lesson quick.  After three days I unplugged the Fido-Shock unit but kept the fence up.  The fence was a psychological deterrent and worked for years.<br /><br />Eventually my wife took the fence down and six month later the dogs were back to their old tricks.  My wife didn't let me set the fence back up, as she preferred dead plants to "prison wire" around the garden.<br /><br />Maybe 5 years later I set up a new garden in the back yard that the dogs loved to tromp around in.  I set the fence up and the dogs immediatly began ignoring it.  I don't think they ever got shocked.<br /><br />I left it plugged in for three days anyway (just in case) and have had it off ever since.<br /><br />Fido-Shock works great.  The disadvantages are that you can see the "prison wire" and stakes, and you might accidently shock yourself.

review/summary: Raccoon detractor... works great!
review/text: Had a raccoon that would visit our deck, and rob the bird feeder.  Not that big of deal to us, in fact we liked it, but often would muddy up the deck, make a mess, and then started taking a big dump right in front of our deck door as big thank you before he/she left for the night.  (Raccoon droppings are very dangerous, and we were afraid our dog would eat it.)  Hooked the unit up to the bird feeder, and the second night we heard for the first time in our life an authentic scream of a raccoon.  (they really can scream)  So far has not returned, and we have not had any more presents left by the bandit!  (Tested it myself after I set up, and gives you a jolt, but no pain or damage.)  Would recommend for raccoons or other pests.  Very affordable, and easy to install.  I may take a picture of my setup and post later.

review/summary: Works as advertized
review/text: We love backyard habitat, but marauding Raccoons (cute, but don't want them to use our yard as a latrine), a gang of angry squirrels and crafty giant Norweigan rats finally got to me.  Being completely ignorant of zappers, it's all new, but this unit works fine.  I test it by touching the wires, to make sure it's on; the shock is not serious, but not something you'd voluntarily repeat, so it's not going to harm animals, pets, neighbors or yourself.<br /><br />There are two modes: grounded and two-wire.  For fence work, the two-wire seems best; the intruders have to touch both wires, so it doesn't bother birds (who only land on one wire).<br /><br />For ground use, you want to ground one wire into the ground, and string the other wire as the "fence".  The intruder only has to touch one wire and be standing on the ground.<br /><br />I had it in two-wire mode, with one wire accidentally touching a branch of a tree; the current went up the branch (!) and created a shock several feet up the branch.<br /><br />It's branded Havahart, which is a good name; it does what it's supposed to.<br /><br />Get the aluminum wire, it's easy to cut and splice, and you need some plastic standoffs; if you get the yellow stubby ones, you will have a problem mounting them since they require a post sticking up.  I nailed them directly into a wooden fence or the eave of the house, it's a lot easier than trying to affix them to a large nail stuck into the wood.<br /><br />For ground use, 10" wire sticks are great; the stubby standoffs do actually affix to the 1/8 wire, and you can adjust the height.<br /><br />Raccoons are members of the cat family, and their stool CAN (does not always) contain brain-worm larvae or eggs.  The life-cycle of these worms starts in the intestines of cats who ingest an infected mouse; for two weeks, they excrete virulent eggs of the brain worms.  The eggs are capable of surviving in salt water or your backyard for up to a year; if someone accidently touches the stool and then food, they get infested.  Moreover, wind-blown dust can contain the eggs.  When a human or a mouse gets infested, the brain-worm eggs hatch; the small worms go right through intestine walls, and settle in nearby cells, exploding them and multiplying to other cells, causing a mild but discernable reaction.<br /><br />The body immune system usually wins, and drives them into encapsulated form, in the brain tissue, but has to continually keep attacking them to stop them from spreading again and destroying the body, cell by cell.<br /><br />Alarmingly, 22% of the people in the US are infested with brain worms; there is no cure, the worms exist in the brain until death, just waiting for the immune system to weaken and let them continue destroying the body.<br /><br />The eggs pass right through sewage systems, which is probably how so meny people get infected, because cities like San Diego have a waiver from normal treatment requirements and dump primary sewage into the Ocean.  The eggs remain a danger for months.  This is also why the Sea Otters are dying in Monterey Bay, because they eat shellfish which are infected by nearby sewage operations where people dump cat litter down the toilet, or else when raccoon droppings get washed into the Ocean.<br /><br />So getting rid of cat and raccoon droppings is a matter of survival, and this is one way to discourage them.  Raccoons like to create "latrines" in one area, and the whole Raccoon gang uses it.  Don't let it be your yard, especially if you have kids.
