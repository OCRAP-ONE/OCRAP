review/summary: Love Love Love Sweet Potato Chips with Sea Salt
review/text: My husband and I just love the Terra Sweet Potato Chips with Sea Salt. Our local stored stopped selling these and now only carry the Sweet Potato Chips with no salt added which we do not like as much. I'm really glad to have found these chips available on Amazon to help satisfy our craving.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I just recently found Terra Chips and have sampled quite a few.  I really like these chips because they seem to be more textured than some of the others.  I also like the more natural flavor, I can actually tell if it's a beet or a sweet potato.  I find them very satisfying and appreciate the lack of added flavors.  They are crispy, crunchy and slightly sweet... yummy!  I also got a better deal here at Amazon than if I'd bought the same amount at a local grocery store (that is if I can find them).  Enjoy!

review/summary: Terra Sweet Potato Chips
review/text: These chips are amazing. I was not sure before I ordered if they were the pressed chip type  or real potatoes.  They are real sweets and so good.  No salt or added seasoning great just the way they are.  The small size l.2 oZ bag is just right for me because I'd never be able stop eatting them with a bigger bag in front of me.

review/text: I was introduced to this product by one of my friend.  I agree with Husseini, the chips look burned. They do not look like the picture on the package at all. They were cooked way too long and the natural tastes were ruined.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: Just a Tad Greasier Than I Would prefer
review/text: The Terra Sweet Potato chips are a delicious all-natural snack.<br /><br />No surprises on the ingredient list, and not only do I enjoy the taste, my family does as well.<br /><br />The only thing that I could fault the chips for are that they are greasier than I would prefer. If they had a "baked" option for these chips that had similar flavor, I'd probably go for those.<br /><br />All in all, priced right, taste great. If you don't mind some light grease, awesome. In the case of these chips, I don't mind all that much.

review/text: I like these a lot, I've never liked or eaten sweet potatoes in my life so that says a lot. I wish they were organic, or had better "oils" in them, but they are at least healthier than potato chips. I like these second best to their sweet potato ones mixed with other vegetable ones.

review/summary: The spiced is very tasty, and a long lasting chip, very satisfying
review/text: Hard to call this a potato chip it is so different from the average chip. Different in very good ways. First the spiced variety tastes great. They are thick, satsifying, spices work very well with the sweet potato flavor, and the taste combination makes it seem like it was just made and fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />They also stay fresh...forever. I had an open bag at work without a bag clip and the chips were still good after a couple of weeks. Satisfying probably a lot more good stuff for you than regular potato chips. Great break from potato chips, very highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty But "TERRA-RISES" Those With Food Sensitivities!!
review/text: I got a great deal on these but it was clearly too good to be true. The taste is terrific -- very zingy but I had a strong negative allergic reaction to something in the chips. And that's where the mystery begins. Either it's the presence of canola oil (probably GMO) or some undocumented MSG -- or both. I would hope by now that the large corporate organic food companies would find a healthier oil and leave out anything that could cause health problems. I also have celiac disease so it may be some kind of wheat variant not listed on the package. Clearly this product could be a real winner but it only made me hyperventilate (even overnight), needlessly so. Maybe Terra should take a look at Kettle's old black bean tortilla chip recipe (which was phenomenal and so healthy) and then develop something along those lines. I would buy that in a nanosecond. The verdict? Savvy consumers should avoid this product -- I would recommend Plocky's chips instead!

review/text: I realized that when I bought a bag of Terra chips at the store, I was always picking out the sweet potato chips to eat. I was very happy to find the snack size Sweet Potato chips on Amazon. The smaller size helps me with portion control as well. The taste is mildly sweet and a better alternative to regular chips although there is 13 grams of fat. Keep in mind that the sodium is only 15 grams. I just hope the kids don't try them or they'll be gone even quicker. Great buy!

review/summary: Unique flavor/smell; Explosive packaging
review/text: I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.<br /><br />As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags.

review/text: We buy a ton of the Terra brand veggie chips. The Sweet Potato Spicy flavor is great. It adds a lot to the sweet potato chip that the plain ones are missing.  We won't even buy the plain ones anymore.  It is super nice to have a whole pack of 12 lying around to munch on. They came fresh and as described. I think the pricing is similar to what you can get in the grocery stores, if you can find the flavor you like.

review/summary: ALWAYS A FAVORITE WITH US!
review/text: I especially have always loved these. I always bought the larger bags at the store before.  It was too easy to eat one bag in one sitting that way. There are 3 of us plus our dogs, 1 parrot and 1 cockatiel who get one now and then too. I found out that sweet potato chewies are best and safest for dogs and birds and are sold at the Dr. Harvey's pet food site. I am ordering those for my animals now as I think they may be safer- less likely to cause choking. I am ordering some more of these , the small bags, for us now and it has been only 2 weeks.  We went through 24 bags.  Gotta have em! Oh and I was very impressed at the way these were packaged for shipping. They were insulated so well not one broken chip from shipping I guarantee! We use Amazon Prime shipping which is quick and free too.

review/summary: I fell in love.....
review/text: When I went to visit my boyfriend in Boston and he had a few large assorted bags of Terra Chips left over from a function at work. I have always liked the mixed Terra Chips but when I grabbed the bag of these it was love at first bite!<br /><br />I was not aware that these are not salted until I had eaten half of the bag and decided to check out the ingredients. I am a salt fan and on a high salt diet so I was especially shocked to realize that I had not noticed the missing salt.<br /><br />Within 24 hours the bag was gone and he had no opportunity to sample even one chip! He also hates beets but will eat them in this form. So, I figure a fried beet beats no beet at all!!<br /><br />I also love that I don't feel guilty indulging in these as some of the other snack foods I eat are questionable in nature. So I keep these on hand and the other snacks drop by the wayside. These are my 'go to' snack now. The price here is also excellent as I'd pay a great deal more at the store per bag. They always arrive fresh and in very good condition.<br /><br />Thanks Terra and Amazon!

review/summary: Open Bags on arrival !! Check every one!
review/text: 7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...<br /><br />This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.<br /><br />I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online.

review/summary: Too Much Cumin
review/text: I thought I tried something different rather than just plain old potato chips.  The cumin flavor was very strong in one bag while another bag was light in cumin (and better for my taste buds).  The flavor was just too overwhelming for me.  I would not buy this product again.

review/summary: Usually good but not happy with this deal
review/text: I buy these in the store and they are usually delicious. I was looking for an economic alternative to purchasing this product. This would be a good deal if the bags did not expire next month and in the two bags that have been opened so far, the chips are over cooked. They are still okay, but not as good as I have had in the past. So overal I am disappointed with this purchase.

review/text: Fantastic taste, great price, and a healthy snack that even your kids will enjoy!<br />We have tried both the Krinkle Cut chips and the Sweets & Beets, and the Krinkle Cut seem to have a better taste.  We like to sprinkle a generous amount of mineral-rich Celtic sea salt in the bag and shake it up - what a delicious treat!<br />Our local health food store sells these chips for nearly double what Amazon charges for the Subscribe & Save price, so this is a great deal!

review/summary: Disorienting, but tasty!
review/text: I've had sweet potato fries before, and they really are delicious where I had them, so I wanted to give these a shot. From the first bite I'm pretty sure I got a hilarious look of astonishment on my face. It's like nothing I ever tasted before--weird, but quite good, which is about how I felt when I first bit into a properly ripe mango. Definitely the spices are unique when balanced with the sweet potato flavor. I think I tasted some garlic, but I know there's a very faint smidgeon of cayenne, and the cilantro was noticeable as well, but no one flavor or spice overwhelms the others, which is good.<br /><br />If you like any sort of spiced potato chips, like mesquite barbecue or jalapeno or the buffalo ranch doritos, I'd give these babies a try. They're healthy and you might find a nice occasional alternative to the not-so-healthy stuff. Hey, if it tastes good, why not? One thing these chips prove is that not all "health food" has to taste bland or nasty. Sort of like spelt bread and Newman's ginger cookies, and Izze's luscious pear soda. Terra's spiced sweet potato chips have a surprising flavor and are probably not for everyone, but if you like the spicy kind of regular chips, pick up a bag of these somewhere--they'll probably be just your sort of thing.

review/summary: Still the best!
review/text: I think this product has been in existence since time began, or so it seems.  But, when you get it right and even improve the product like Kraft has done here with the addition of Romano cheese, well, if you don't buy it, you're missing out.  I use this cheese in particular with a garlic/cheese roll recipe that is outstanding, but it's also superb on everyday pasta recipes.  The clumping is minimal, it's ALWAYS real cheese (not so in the store-brand varieties), and it's made by Kraft.  Great stuff, been using this one for years, highly recommend!

review/summary: Watch out for price gouging
review/text: What can I say? Unless you want to hand grate your own Parmesan, this is the best product out there. But I wouldn't spend more than about $8 on it (that's about the grocery store price), and then only through Amazon Prime. On grocery items in particular, Amazon Marketplace vendors wait for the Prime supplies to run out and then become the featured vendor on the product page. But their prices are typically grossly inflated. So if you want to avoid the gouging, hold out for an Amazon Prime purchase only.

review/summary: Great flavor and 100% real cheese.
review/text: I bought this because the price was so cheap here at Amazon and the "100% Real Cheese" claim. I wasn't sure what the difference would be in the flavor with the addition of the Romano. Luckily, it still tastes great and I can't really tell a difference from just regular Parmesan. I have had no complaints from the kids/teens or the hubby.<br /><br />These are nice larger size containers too, so they last longer in my family of 5. The price here at Amazon is really great too! Parmesan is pretty pricey at the grocery store for such a little container of condiment. Here, I get 2 containers for the price of one AND it's delivered to me free. Can't beat that!

A rep quickly responded with an e-mailed apology and said Amazon would credit my credit card for the purchase price. (Foodstuffs cannot be returned for health reasons, of course.)

If organic and good tasting are what you are looking for, this cereal may be a good one to try.<br /><br />  As for me, I am going to try soaking oats with whey.

review/summary: Good product, poor packaging
review/text: I have been using the San Marzano tomatoes for many, many years; usually purchased from a specialty grocery store.  When I saw them offered on Amazon, I ordered them immediately. They came very quickly, but 3 cans were badly damaged so I notified Amazon.  They sent another box of 6 and again 3 were dented, 1 very badly.  I sent back all 6 damaged cans and kept 6.  Of the 6 that I kept, 4 are dented, slightly.  I complained about the poor packaging, but they when they mailed the replacement package, they used the same flimsy packaging.

review/summary: UNSAVORY SELECTION
review/text: BASED ON an Amazon customer's valid comment today, I'm AMENDING THIS REVIEW to encourage readers to consider that it has been a long time since I wrote the review and that it could have merely been a bad batch for that month.  I'll place an order with every confidence that the tomatoes will be of high quality.  Indeed, it was never my intention to be unfair to the manufacturer.<br />____________________<br /><br />Briefly put, the tomatoes that should have a sweet, mellow taste instead have a "tin-can" taste.  Was mine an isolated case? The company alone will have to answer that question.  I'm only advising potential buyers to exercise caution.  The product is produced in Italy, by the way, with home-grown tomatoes, so they should have tasted wonderful.

review/summary: Good, but NOT San Marzano Tomatoes
review/text: Just got these in this week and made a fantastic ragu out of these puppies.  As I said in the title, they are very good italian plum tomatoes (says on the label), but the are San Marzano "BRAND" Tomatoes.  They cleverly put the words "brand" in a blue font, so it will blend in with the blue background and not be noticeable.  They're actually good enough for me to want to buy them again, but just wanted everyone to know so you don't feel like you've been duped.  Hope this helps. BTW, giving them 3 stars just for trying to pull a fast one, but would have rate 4-5 based on taste of the product alone.

review/summary: Not As Sweet
review/text: These tomatoes are very good for the price. They are not as sweet as some Marzanos I've tried, but were firm with good flavor. Also, the container was packed full and the sauce is thicker than most.<br />  You absolutely get your money's worth with these tomatoes, and I will buy them again as they are good and within my budget. You don't realize the difference in canned tomatoes until you try something much better than you're used to using  (like these).  If you use canned tomatoes in your recipes, give these a try!

review/text: Two of the six cans I received were dented - from the inside, not the packaging, so they were evidently packed that way. But, there was no problem with the tomatoes inside them.<br /><br />I tasted every can and did not detect any "tinny" flavor. They tasted great and made excellent marinara and bolognese sauces.<br /><br />It's a great price for San Marzanos delivered to your door. I rated it a 4 because of the dented cans - cosmetics. Otherwise they are a good value and I'll reorder soon.

review/text: These little hard candies are quickly becomming my all time favorite.  The flavor of ginger is strong and it packs a punch.  Perfect after dinner mint which is how I discovered them. They are given away at a very popular Italian Restaraunt in Downtown Miami.  The KC Candy website says they are made from natural ginger so I'm assuming it's the same way I make ginger syrup at home.

review/summary: Pink salt!
review/text: We know the whole pink salt story.  If you don't, just google it.  We are using it mainly because it's supposed to be better for you health-wise.  We both like salt and this seemed like a reasonable deal.  There isn't much difference in the taste... cleaner and you have to use less I'd say.  The salt isn't quite as fine as we expected... a bit many grained size, but they all come out of the salt shaker well.  We found out that our local upscale grocery store carries it in bulk, but it's "rock salt" size.  We've bought a Bodum grinder that grinds both pepper and salt for when the salt we have now runs out.  The Bodum is great and they sell it on Amazon...<br />P.S.  Fairie's Finest had the best prices for both the pink salt and Red Hawaiian sea salt...

review/text: I bought this mix because it looked really good on the box. I am a huge baker and I wanted to try something new. I waited for Valentine's Day to make it for my family and I do not think they are going to want to eat it. I followed the directions and it looked nothing like the picture. I ended up frosting it with chocolate frosting to see if it would help. It was ok but I will never buy this mix again and do not recommend it. I might just have to bake something else for my family for Valentine's day.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: I have baked MANY cakes over the years. I've never had a problem until now. This cake definitely did not live up to expectations. I followed the directions exactly for baking in a bundt pan. I waited the recommended time to remove from the bundt pan. When I lifted the pan off, the cake had broken into many pieces. It was a mess. Maybe if baked in a regular pan, where it didn't need to be removed until serving, it would be OK. But, it definitely was not OK using a bundt pan. It was such a mess I had to throw the cake away.

review/text: My wife wanted me to bake her birthday cake this year.  I've done it successfully before.  The cake was moist and yet had a delicate texture.  The problem was the taste.  It wasn't sweet and it didn't taste like chocolate at all.  My wife looked at me and said, "does the cake taste funny to you".  No one came back for seconds and it's the first time I threw a cake out.  I won't try this again--unfortunately I have one box left.  I'd give it to the Food Bank if I thought I was doing them a favor.

review/summary: Great Cake Mix....Not sure why so many negative reviews
review/text: I'm not a professional baker or anything so I guess my perspective is a little different but I love this cake mix. I was attracted to the package (naturally) and decided to try it. I have never enjoyed a cake out of a box so much....especially when its re-heated in the microwave and eaten in a cup with vanilla ice cream. Made it for a couple of parties and thanksgiving and people couldn't stop asking for seconds. It takes longer to bake than it says on the directions and I used a regular 8 or 9 inch circular pan....I did notice that it didn't rise as much as I would have expected. I thought it odd the first time but then I tasted it and couldn't stay angry at the cake for long :). My advice: try it....its only a dollar or so more than the $.99 options and you just might like it.

review/summary: A great cake mix
review/text: I have baked cakes quite a few times, but this was the first one which has a separate real fudge and chunks mix too. I am quite surprised at the reviews given by others. I am pretty sure its just because they could not end up mixing it properly. I have followed every instruction with exact time to mix and cook. My friends have loved the cake and it was finished in no time. So, if you are good at baking cakes (even otherwise, follow the instructions exactly and your effort will not be wasted), definitely try this one. Also, you need not wait for the entire cake to become solid hard inside the oven. I did not bake it for more than 35minutes, watching it every 5minutes after the first 20minutes. I turned the oven off when the cake seemed a little soft and left it out for 20minutes (you can leave it inside the oven after turning it off) and it came out so soft and tasty!

review/summary: Don't waste your time, oil, eggs or money!!!
review/text: Typically, if I leave a negative review for any product, I still recommend others trying it, since they may like it, and I always state so, in my review.  However, NOT this time!<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer, my cake stuck horribly to the pan, and I used a flat, round pan.  I not only oiled my pan, but floured it thoroughly, as well.  Any other time I bake a cake, I always, always use this method:  Oil & flour.  The cakes always pop right out of the pan, with no problem.  NOT this time!  This was a complete mess!<br /><br />Even edging with a knife didn't help!  So, I would actually not recommend this at all.  If this is a new product, I guarantee in one year, it will be a forgotten, discontinued product, because that's what you will want to do, once you try this:  Forget it, and never use it again!<br /><br />But, because I like to be fair, I do love Duncan Hines.  They do have some great products, just not this one.  This was a miss.  Additionally, I figured that even though the cake stuck horribly to the pan, maybe it would taste good and that would suffice.  Not this time!  This cake, on a scale from 1-5, taste wise, would honestly be a 3, if that.  It's just ok.<br /><br />So, my take is:  Don't waste your time.  Like myself and the previous reviewer, you will most likely find yourself in the same situation:  A stuck mess, that is worthy of file 13 - the trash!!!<br /><br />And, by the way, the picture on the box, looks nothing at all, like what you end up with.  The picture has glaze on the top.  Not so with this recipe, unless you buy it, or make it!  That, in and of itself, is misleading.  They don't include a glaze packet, therefore, they should not represent such, on their packaging!<br /><br />Beth

review/text: Considering that many of the Terra chips are healthier versions of snack foods, it was surprising that these chips were so oily. They have more oil listed on the package than what Amazon actually stated when I bought them. I was disappointed in the overall crunch of these chips. They are a bit too thick to be a true kettle chip and though crunchy, it isn't quite what I expected. They aren't bad, just not really as advertised. Those who like a thick, nearly unsalted chip will enjoy these.

review/text: I really like these chips! They are nice and crunchy. They are not oversalted (to my taste, anyhow). I think that the taste is richer than standard potato chips. Take a look at the "nutrition facts" on the back. One is not overdosing on salt here (one serving=5% of daily value). Saturated fat is 5%. Compare with Wise's standard potato chips: 7% salt and 15% saturated fat.<br /><br />All in all, a rich taste and perhaps a bit better fotr you than other standard brands.
