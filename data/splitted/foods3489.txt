review/summary: Made in the US and my picky eater love them
review/text: I purchased these as an alternative to chicken jerky that is not made in the US. These are which is important to me for food safety reasons.<br /><br />My very selective eater loves them just as much as chicken jerky and they are less expensive. I can easily break them into smaller pieces.<br /><br />Overall a great healthy and apparently delicious dog treat.

I will not order these again.

Ribena is also very good mixed in ginger ale, tequila or champagne. I've also had a gelatin desert made with this, yummy!  I used to know a Pastor of a tea totaling church  who used this as in place of wine for communion and  other people tell me that it has also been used in place of blood in some rituals and magick work. I prefer to drink it myself  This was a classic British nursery treat which may account for the suggestion that it is "better with" the British form of Mayonnaise perhaps the worst suggested pairing on Amazon.com

review/summary: Not the same as back home (UK)
review/text: I was so excited to see Ribena on Amazon and ordered the pack of 6, but upon opening the first bottle and pouring some out to dilute it, I could see that it was weak and more watery than it should be.  Although this is made in Britain, I have a feeling they dilute it to ship to the US.  Cadbury's and Nestle's do the same thing with their chocolate...we get the waxy stuff over here, meanwhile the UK gets the creamy, good stuff!  Unless it was a fluke, my 6 bottles were much weaker than normal.  I won't order this again-I only gave it 4 stars because real Ribena is excellent and this does have the flavor.

review/summary: This is the good stuff
review/text: My wife and I make and go through a 2-lb. batch of hummus a week (we pack it for lunch every day) - we have been doing this for 3 years.  I just used the Al-Wadi tahini I got via Amazon and it made the best batch of hummus I have ever had.  Until now I have been using tahini I bought at the nearby supermarket, and I always thought that the bitterness I tasted was just a natural part of the tahini.  The Al-Wadi has nothing but pure nutty creaminess and no bitterness.  I also noticed that it is runnier than what I usually get, indicating that it has a higher oil content and also that it was in fresher condition than what I had been buying.  It had not had time to settle out and clump up at the bottom - so it's easier to use.  Buying it this way is also much cheaper than what I have been getting at the store.  So I think I have found my Secret Key Ingredient for great hummus and will stick with this from now on.

review/summary: Hummus gets raves!
review/text: I have avoided making real hummus for years.  I made a white bean/olive oil variation because I couldn't make hummus that tasted as good as what I bought in stores.  I believe this product will save on my grocery bill considering a tub of hummus averages $5.  I found and tweaked a recipe online and now people request I bring hummus to gathering.  Many don't believe I made it until I give them the recipe.  I use three tablespoons of the Al Wadi Tahina to one can of garbanzo beans, among other ingredients.  The product comes in a plastic container with a wide mouth making it easy to stir.

review/summary: Delicous but THIN
review/text: I always buy tahini at the supermarket and I'm used to it being the consistency of peanut butter, with a thin layer of oil at the top that must be stirred in.  This was my first experience with Al Wadi Tahina.  The Amazon price is fantastic, coming out at about a third of what I pay at the supermarket ounce per ounce.  It has a rich sesame flavor and tastes very good.  I was very surprised at the thin consistency.  It's like a sauce, not a spread.  It is so thin that I can put a long spoon in the bottle and stir it around without running into anything resembling peanut butter.  It pours out of the jar like sauce. I tipped the second jar and could see that it was just as thin, so it wasn't a fluke. I feel like there's a very high oil to solid ratio. I was still able to measure it to the same amount I normally use in my hummus and the flavor came through just fine.<br /><br />Also, the lids were on tightly and the plastic seal was intact, but oil had still seeped out of both jars and made them slippery.  I don't believe that air entered the bottles, it was probably more of a vacuum effect during packaging and I feel it is safe to eat.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I'm sure I'll order again because it's a great value.

review/text: For Over 15 years, Ive been using the Tahini that comes in a can. Always trying to scrape the hard stuff off the bottom, and mix in the oils from the top... This Tahini is SO Delicious. Super creamy and fresh tasting without being bitter at all. Made a batch of Hummus with this today, and its better than any hummus Ive ever made, even though Ive been using the same recipe my entire life. This Tahini comes in a plastic jar, and when I received it, The outer jar seemed a little bit oily. Its all sealed up, so I just washed it off with  little soap and water, and was good to go!

review/summary: Definitely worth the purchase
review/text: I don't want to reiterate much of what has already been said, so I'll simply summarize:<br /><br />* It arrived in a state requiring much less mixing than I'm used to.<br />* It was creamier than I'm used to, yet the nutty flavor was quite prevalent.<br />* No bitterness.<br />* Cost effective relative to purchasing at your local market.<br /><br />It's not as strong of a flavor of other products I've used, but it's appropriate. Given the amount of hummus and ganoush we eat, it satisfies both the palate and the wallet. With the local market price of garbanzo beans at $1 / pound + the price of this tahini + lemons on sale right now...this is perfect. I made 12 pounds of hummus from this order and froze most of it (yes it freezes well). Compared to market prices for pre-made hummus (e.g.), the end result is about 1/10th of the cost.<br /><br />I'm not fond of a plastic container, but I imagine metal or glass would jack up the price. I just make everything right away and freeze it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is certainly a worthwhile purchase. We will definitely purchase again and again. Spread it on bread and love it!

review/text: I adore hummus which is ridiculously expensive in the stores. This product is creamy and has a great flavor. It's also a treat to mix it with honey (2 parts tahini to 1 part honey, or to taste) and slather it on a thick piece of bread or hot toast. I've also used it in sauces for fish and in salad dressing. When I make hummus, I often spread it on flax bread for a quick snack.

review/summary: Great Tahini
review/text: As others have noted, it has a low viscosity.<br /><br />I am unsure of how to measure this absolutely as the brand I used before this was thicker, but this and the other have the exact same ingredients (sesame seeds) with no additives and they taste the same. I conclude that the viscosity among tahini preparations varies and therefore I cannot set a standard. If I had used this one before trying the other, I may have concluded the other was more viscous.<br /><br />Either way, they have the same ingredients, same taste, but different prices and availability. Al Wadi Tahini bought off Amazon costs me less, is more convenient, and the container is better than what I was buying in the store. It has a wide neck making it easier to scoop tahini. Its viscosity is actually a plus and it is much easier to use (for sandwiches primarily, hummus secondarily).

review/summary: The best tahini I've had!
review/text: I've tried a variety of tahini brands and this is far better and fresher tasting than even the organic brands.<br /><br />If you are curious about consistency, well, this tahini/tahina is about the same consistency as cashew butter or sunflower butter. Very oily and you definitely want to manually stir it really well before you refrigerate it. Once you have stirred it and refrigerated it, the texture remains consistent.<br />-<br /><br />Even though it is not stated anywhere on the label, I am guessing this tahini is lightly toasted because it is not as bitter as the raw tahini that I have eaten. There is still a teensy bitterness but mostly buttery, nutty flavor comes through. The high oil content [to me] means quality, because, frankly I don't want a thick paste that I can't work with, I like having enough oil content so that once stirred and refrigerated, is not thick and pasty, but, rather thin and more like a thick oil.<br /><br />I love spreading this on my rye crackers with a few pinches of pink sea salt. Because this is a thin tahini, I can portion control this much easier than I can with thick-as-mortar tahini.<br /><br />Sesame oil is so good for you too! Google it! :)

review/text: This has a nice nutty flavor without the bitterness of some tahinis. Homemade hummus is much better than the expensive premade varieties. A little of this imparts a lot of flavor. Since garbanzos are cheap, hummus becomes a very economical snack. I also use the tahina in place of peanut butter. Nice to be able to order from Amazon since the nearest store that carries it is 70 miles away.

review/summary: Best I've had!
review/text: I make hummous twice a week (we eat a lot of it in our house!). I've bought every kind you can imagine. This one not only has a wonderful flavor and no additives, but it stays smooth when refrigerated. And, you can't beat the price! (Most tahini runs about $10ish for 16 ounces). Love it!

review/summary: makes best hummus ever!!!
review/text: I make hummus often and love it but always felt mine was never as good as the restaurant.  I was always looking for that "missing ingredient".  I have tried other tahinis and they would leave a bad aftertaste.  This tahini along with fresh lemon juice and a great lebanese recipe has made the best hummus ever.  The first batch I made with this tahini was amazing, as good as the restaurant.  It is different than others I have purchased, thinner, easier to mix and has a better overall smell.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves hummus.

review/text: While this is somewhat thinner than other brands I've used, I'd consider that a plus.  Easy to stir, nice consistency, no dry bits stuck irretrievably to the bottom of the jar, and great flavor to boot!  Arrived well packaged, no leaks, and sooner than expected ... and the price is WAY below what I've been able to find in my area.  Will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Excellent authentic Lebanese tahini
review/text: I have been making hummos for years and alwasy used local Arabic store brand. One day they were out and I bought this brand. Hummos turned out amazing. Tahini consistency is great as well. Then I saw this on Amazon with prime shipping at even cheaper price than Arabic store, it was no brainer.

review/summary: Hummus baby! Hummus!
review/text: When I first opened the product, i noticed that it separated. It took a bit of mixing to get it back to the right consistency which is still more on the liquid side than other tahini. Not a problem; the extra oil is perfect for hummus.<br /><br />Three cups of chick peas, assorted spices and oils, and two tablespoons of this stuff...bam! Hummus baby!<br /><br />So how much hummus do I get with this glorious two-pack?<br />By my calculation using my famous 2 tablespoon recipe above, I should get to enjoy over twenty scrumptious batches of hummus (26 to be exact).<br /><br />Should I bother or can I just go to the store and buy some hummus?<br />Seriously? I can't believe you even asked me that. Lets break this down two ways 1)cost and 2)goodness:<br /><br />1) Cost - So remember that recipe above? 3 cups is a ton of hummus. Basically, your closer to the largest container you could buy (17oz-20oz). How much did it set me back? About $1.70! Compare that to $5+ bucks you'll pay if your lazy self buys it in the store.<br />2) Goodness - I made a jalapeno version because some like it hot. I was amazing. Don't believe me? Just try to find a morsel of it left! You wont; so buy this and make your own.

review/summary: Just what I expected
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. I am a huge hummus lover but I've always bought them from my Sam's Club store in the big tub. I love the roasted red pepper flavor. Anyway if you love hummus then you know it can be a pretty expensive habit. I bought this so that I can start making my own at home and maybe even make other exciting flavors. Well this did the job. It gave my hummus that special taste it needed. My hummus came out delicious. Not quite like that famous store brand but it comes close. The price was great and was delivered in two days. It was packaged properly too. I would definitely buy this again compared to having to spend a lot of money buying already made hummus from the store. Now I can say I know how to make my own hummus. I have no complaints on this. I would buy again and again.

review/summary: Best Tahini I have ever had !!!
review/text: I'm a tahini lover and where I currently live, it is hard to find. So, I turned to Amazon and decided to try this brand knowing it came from Lebanon . . Tahini Country !! It is not only, the best tahini I have ever had, the price for TWO of these large size jars is simply amazing !! And for the people who cry about it being too thin . . . STIR IT UP . . That's what you are supposed to do with tahini. It is great to drizzle on salads and over falafel. I keep my opened jar in the refrigerator and it thickens by the time I get to the bottom. I just love the nutty taste . . Simply delicious. That's why I gave it 5 stars. Far exceeded my expectations !!!Yes, three whopping tablespoons to a can of chickpees, along with seasoning of choice (my secret is a good sprinkle of cumin), a splash of olive oil, and lemon juice till the right consistency, makes Hummus to die for !! Happy Eating !!

review/summary: Looks diluted but works great
review/text: I had my doubts when I first opened the jar and noticed the thickness (or lack of it).  However, to my surprise, this tahini works great in recipes.  It's flavor is very good and the oil and solids don't get separated in the fridge.  I don't know how they do it.  I've been always told that if it's natural, oil will separate and you'll have to mix it before each use (like a natural peanut butter).  Based on the ingredients list on the label, it's supposed to be all natural.  Unless there is a secret ingredient in this tahini, they must have developed a process to prevent separation.

review/text: I've never tasted tahini before, but I wanted to try making hummus. After reading some reviews, I chose this one. Now I don't really know what to think. It's extremely bitter and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth for a long time. So did I just get a bad jar, or is the bitterness normal? The expiration date is 2014, so I assume it's not old. I've not tried to make hummus with it yet, not sure if I should.

Anyway, for now I will use it.

review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: sadly cats (not fussy eaters either!) won't eat it
review/text: My 3 cats are not at all picky about what they eat.  They'll happily gobble everything from Meow Mix/Friskies through Royal Canin and Iams.  But this food - no way - they will not touch it.  Sad.

review/summary: The Goodlife Indoors!
review/text: I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

review/text: My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any "throw up" with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the "throw up queens" but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend.

review/text: I have tried numerous dry cat foods, but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!

review/text: I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

review/text: Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again.

review/summary: A staple item in our pantry
review/text: My husband and I both enjoy this hearty soup.  It makes a perfect lunch or sometimes we will pair it with a sandwich for an easy dinner.  The texture is thick and creamy with a lot of flavor for a "healthy" soup, yet you don't feel like you are eating green pea mush.  The vegetables are all still recognizable - firm chunks of potatoes, carrots, celery, and whole peas, and nice bites of lean ham throughout.  It is really good (though not so healthy!) with Ritz crackers.  We always keep this soup on hand, I have it set up through Subscribe and Save to get a case a month.  As for the price, you could probably find it a bit cheaper at your grocery store but not much, and who can beat the delivered-right-to-your-door aspect of heavy items like canned goods!  If you like split pea soup, it's a simple decision.

review/text: I've been eating Healthy Choice soup for several years, but it's getting harder to find in markets now.  They only seem to stock soups from this company in those microwaveable bowls, which I don't need.  Those bowls also cost more than the cans.  My 2 favorite flavors are the Split Pea & Ham and the Bean & Ham.  I'm thrilled that I can buy them by the case from Amazon.  These soups are very hearty & relatively low in sodium which I have to be careful of.  They taste as good as homemade which is almost unheard of in a canned soup.  I highly recommend this flavor and the Bean & Ham.

review/text: I cook at home most of the time, and don't usually like most processed soups.  This soup is an exception:  creamy and flavorful.  Though the salt was reduced, the soup's flavor didn't suffer.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I love this soup. I have tried other brands of Split Pea soup but keep coming back to this brand. The only thing that would be nice - if they could decrease the amount of sodium which is 470mg per cup which means if you eat an entire can it comes to 940mg - That is close to half a days worth of sodium. But, take a look at almost every other type of canned soup and they are all way too high in sodium. Therefore, not something I eat on a regular basis. Having said all that, I still love this soup - every so often. The other problem I've run into was trying to find it in the stores but was very happy to see Amazon carried it.

review/summary: The best pea soup in a can
review/text: I have been purchasing this soup for a number of years.  Ready to eat, simply pour into a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes.  It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and ham with a thick pea soup base.  One can will serve one person with a large portion.  It has become difficult to find it in my local super markets so I now order it from Amazon.

review/summary: REFORMULATED IN 2010 - NOW TASTELESS
review/text: In early 2010, I noticed the product's Healthy Choice Label had been updated with a revised product photo, showing bigger chunks of ham and vegetables. Unfortunately, the soup was also reformulated to include huge pieces of tasteless ham and way too many big chunks of potatoes as the main vegetable.<br /><br />I confirmed with the manufacturer, ConAgra, that the soup had been, indeed, reformulated. I told them how disappointed I was with their "improvement." They sent me a coupon for more of this rubbish.

review/summary: Great for canned soup!
review/text: We eat mostly homemade food but this is one exception. The soup is a nice, thick consistency and has chunks of veggies. My son is not a veggie fan but loves this soup. Also, it has no dairy or egg and is therefore good for someone with those allergies. Is not an everyday food since it's processed but really hits the spot once a week or so. My only disappointment is the price. I paid $17 on amazon for this same item in December and the price has now nearly doubled to about $30 with subscribe and save.
