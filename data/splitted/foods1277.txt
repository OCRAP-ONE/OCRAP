review/summary: Great Coffee for a Flavored Coffee
review/text: This is a medium roasted coffee, those that call it a light roast must be used to a heavier tasting cup of coffee. When first brewed, it has a very pleasant nutty aroma that fills the room and gets your expectations going. I have the Keurig with 3 cup sizes, if you brew it on the smallest setting, it's like a little shot of nutty espresso (on the milder side)...on the second setting it's a more intense flavor that Starbucks people could probably relate to...on the largest setting it is ready for you to add what you desire and still get a very good, subtle nutty tasting, rich coffee. I add a bit of sugar while drinking it black and it's a delight...when you are in the mood for something different. I find I don't like it as much as my first cup of the day...but every once in a while I like a cup in the afternoon and this is where I find it stands out. Not a heavy, burnt tasting roast...milder than that heavy stuff and flavorful WITHOUT knocking you out with an added fake flavor that doesn't belong there...it seems to really go together, pecan & coffee. Let's just say it's a nice cup of coffee with a bit of a nutty tone...PS: I'm not a real lover of flavored coffees but this one is done right...on the lines of Island Coconut, who would think that coconut & coffee flavors would go pleasantly together?...but they do!

review/summary: The best flavored k cup of decaf coffe I've tried so far!
review/text: I really wanted to pick up a box of decaf k cups for those times when you come home late after a long day and want a cup of coffee but don't want the jolt of caffeine keeping you up all night. I tried a few of the options in a sample box we got with our Keurig machine, but they all either tasted rancid or flavorless. I did my research online and read a bunch of reviews for Van Houtte's decaf hazelnut option and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Those reviews didn't lie or exaggerate: this stuff is awesome.<br /><br />Even standing alone as a flavored cup of coffee, this blend is delicious. Add to the fact it is decaffeinated and that is even more impressive. This has a bold, full body to it and is quite enjoyable. Definitely satisfies my craving on colder evenings.<br /><br />Sure, unless it's quite late in the day, I'll probably choose another blend over this one every time, but it's nice to know you have a decaf blend on hand that you don't feel like you just have to settle for when you're faced with the prospect of brewing it.<br /><br />If you need a decaf blend on hand, this is your best bet!

review/text: Was in the Bahamas this past fall on a cruise. While in Nassau we saw a man taking something out of a shell while docked on his fishing boat. He was removing the conch and making a salad with onions, tomatoes and citrus fruits. He said "you'll never need a little blue pill again". He was right. Got back to the states and went looking for conch and found it here. Not quite as potent from a can but still works as an aphrodisiac.

review/summary: Great for "catkins" diet
review/text: We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a "catkins" diet. Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved. The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better. They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey. We mix in some Wysong "Call of the Wild" into the meat.<br /><br />Chicken is their least favorite fowl.  They most prefer quail, and like turkey better than chicken.  (It's odd, because they loved Friskies Chicken flavored stuff, and hated Friskies Turkey flavor).  They don't really like the BG chicken at all... something about the texture, I think.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild.  Chicken should be as well.  I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' turkey, but you never know!

review/summary: RANCID!
review/text: Any whole grains that are cracked open can go rancid easily, as they contain higher fat content than their processed versions.  That's why it is recommened you store whole grain flour in a freezer, only up to several months.  I don't know if it is the manufacturer or Amazon who did not warehouse these cans properly, but they are BAD!  I usually read many reviews before I make purchase decisions, but as I did not have any problem with one can of this multigrain before, I did not bother to check this time.<br /><br />Well, after a week of consuming this, my baby got sick.  As we were expermenting with variety of solid food, we weren't sure what was giving him diarrhea.  We removed almost everything from his diet over the course of that week, until we were left with this cereal and his formula.  Only then, it dawned on me that it could be this cereal, again, with which he didn't have any problem before.  As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.  The trouble we went through warrants more than a refund - my baby developed a severe diaper rash due to constant bowl movement, and we ended up seeing a pediatrian to get a prescription for his open-blistered bottom.  This was his first diaper rash ever, and no diaper rash cream would help as he was going too frequently.  I feel terrible for not checking when I first opened this box.  Please learn from my mistake and DON'T BUY THIS!

Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time.

My guess is that I received a bum batch however, I am not willing to try it again when there are other organic cereals I have been happy with.<br /><br />I will say I was extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service. Although this item was non-returnable, they still issued a refund to me promptly.

review/summary: probably good, just not for my baby
review/text: My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley breastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non-gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this brand because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation/gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.

review/text: I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.  I have to say I was a bit concerned about the number of negative reviews that were posted on the oatmeal cereal.  I bought it many years ago for my oldest child when she was a baby and we loved it, now we are buying it for my youngest child and she too is a big fan.  All of the negative reviews that I saw were 2010-2011 (back when I wasn't buying the product).  I don't know if things were changed, but my newest addition is enjoying the oatmeal just as much...if not more than my older one did.  I am really happy with the quality, quantity for the price and healthiness of the product.  We use the cereal as just plan cereal for the little one, but also got some great recipes off of the Happy Baby website and have made some other great snacks for the older one as well. It is a definite buy again and hope that Happy Baby continues to make such great, healthy products.

If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae.  Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane.  Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid.  I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.

review/summary: Love the mix of grains
review/text: I mostly use Earth's best organic cereal for my boys (it's more economical than HappyBellies), but I throw this multigrain into the mix because it makes for a nice change. The oats, quinoa and amaranth are a nice mix.

review/text: I'm a health food nut, I eat clean, fresh and as much organic as my wallet allows.  I nurse my 6 mo old and make his baby food.  I wanted a cereal that I felt was as clean as his organic baby food I was making and as my milk is...I LOVE this cereal...he digests it easily, it never constipated him...I think thats due to the additives this particular cereal has.  I will never try another cereal.  I am excited to try the oatmeal though!

review/summary: THE BEST BABY CEREAL EVER!!!!
review/text: I would give it more stars if I could.  Our first baby absolutely loved it when he was younger, and it is extremely good for the baby with all of the different nutrients that the baby needs.  We got our first can from a friend of mine and then proceeded to buy more of it from amazon.com and ended up buying other kinds as well made by the same company.  The price is great, too.  I can't say enough good words about it.  We will have to wait and see what our second baby thinks of it.  We are definitely planning to buy it for him as well.

review/summary: DHA contamination a concern
review/text: I fed this to my baby, but now regret it in light of Cornucopia research report showing the crap DHA supplementation added to this product. Now that we have our second, I'm going to seek out an iron-fortified rice cereal that DOES NOT have DHA crap added in. We're breastfeeding, so why jam in more synthetically-derived, solvent-extracted DHA? The manufacturer has been suspiciously silent on this issue, so I'm not convinced they are "above board" on their product's purity.

The only disadvantage to this cereal is it needs something else added to it. If I didn't add fruit my baby would not eat it. Some of the other baby cereals I've bought she would eat without any fruit in it. But not this one. It had to have fruit.

review/text: I absolutely love this cereal.  Smells soooo good!  Almost has a banana-y smell to it in my opinion.  I mix it into whatever food my son is eating just for some added health benefits. I also really like the packaging.  A canister is so much better than a non-sealable box like another organic brand (and non-organic brands) comes in.  I've tried the rice and multi-grain cereals too but prefer the consistency of the oatmeal better than the multi-grain (which is a good cereal too but was more flakey and "soft".  Will continue to buy this product for some time.

review/summary: Great product, fast delivery
review/text: I am very passionate about food quality and wary of what I feed my baby.  This is a great basic product that I am using to start my baby on solids.  I like that it is brown rice and that it is fortified.  I have mixed it with breastmilk as well as to thicken food purees.<br /><br />To be honest I have not done a lot of price comparison but I feel that at a little over $3 per 7-oz cans (with subscribe and save I got 6 7-oz cans for $20), there are plenty of frivolous things I have spent $3 on so I think it's worth it to feed my baby a high quality food.<br /><br />I was running low and had forgotten to order a can, but even without expediting shipping, my order came faster than anticipated.  It was shipped via USPS.

I started my baby on this at 5 months and he loves it. I mix it with Breast Milk and once he starts veggies and fruit I will add that in as well. This does not constipate him either and I love that it is Organic and enriched with Probiotcs and DHA.<br />If you are looking for a great first food for your baby with quality ingredients this is it and you can't beat the price for organic.

review/text: Baby's getting to that solid food stage, so we tried the Dr. Sears recommended HappyBellies line.  Our girl likes their stuff--she's more partial to the rice cereal--and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated.  Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus.  If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6-canister purchase, like this one.  Btw, it's tasty enough that Mommy and Papa don't mind getting this cereal in their mouths when cajoling their stubborn baby to eat.

I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this brand online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this brand of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic.

review/summary: Poor Quality Product - Recall should be issued!
review/text: After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!

review/summary: Read the Amazing List of Ingredients!
review/text: I showed this to my son's pediatrician and he was impressed with (and supported!) the list of items added to the cereal!<br /><br />This was the first solids I added to my child's bottle when we started to transition away from milk only. The cereal is really finely milled and melts away easily into the liquid. At first I was worried that it would thicken up too much that it would clog the milk from flowing through, but happy to report it did not happen. I usually add one tablespoon of cereal to 6oz of milk. I noticed that once I started to do that, the bottle will sustain my son for longer periods of time especially at night. Now, I use this with every bottle of milk I make for him. Sometimes I also use this to thicken some of the fruits or veggie puree that are too watery. This makes the puree thicker and easier for baby to eat from the spoon. When the puree is too thin, it will dribble out of baby's mouth easily - after all they are just starting to get the hang of gumming,tasting and swallowing something this is not completely liquid.<br /><br />Amazon prices are much cheaper ($19.29 for pack of 6 or $3.22 per canister) compared to what the local Whole Foods would charge(about $5 including tax for ONE). I hesitated for a moment since this is after all SIX canisters, but after looking at how much I use this on a daily basis, I am sure we will deplete this in no time!

My kids are 10 months. They now prefer this to Earth's Best cereal. They'll eat them mixed together, but they won't eat the other by itself. Admittedly, Happy Bellies smells more appetizing to me too. Not that the other smells bad.  But this smells more tasty.

review/summary: Mixes well, versatile and not glue-like~
review/text: I am very happy with this cereal. I am confident feeding it to my infant because it's organic and it has probiotics. My son needed to be on a powder probiotic supplement that was VERY expensive. It's nice to make the transition and have it included in his food at this price point.<br /><br />When I first tried the cereal, I made a small amount (1 tsp cereal and 4 tsp breast milk) and made it runny (easy to do, as there is nothing glue-like about this cereal). He wasn't too fond of the experience - but that's not a reflection on this product at all. He's 5 months old now so I mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 1 oz of breast milk and drop in one cube of frozen veggies (I make my own food and freeze it in ice cube trays). I heat it all up, mix it well and he's in HEAVEN! He prefers carrots & cereal, and butternut squash & cereal... and his favorite is bananas & rice cereal. I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined, it's tasty. It's not sweet, just like a mellow oatmeal. This cereal also retains it's consistency throughout the feeding and also holds onto its warmth - which is great for a son like mine who will only eat warm/hot food!<br /><br />Also, there's been no constipation/diarrhea side effects like most first foods will have on your baby - a welcomed relief!

(There are conflicting studies on this, but I figured it can't hurt.)  There is some controversy about Martek's DHA in organic products.  But overall it's a great cereal.  My son does well with it.  I only gave 4 stars because it's not the greatest value out there.

review/text: I love the fact that this cereal has probiotics in it and that it's organic.  My daughter has a very sensitive digestive track (although she will eat about anything we have made so far) and I think the added probiotics really help.  It sure keeps her regular that for sure!  I also like all the unique grains this particular cereal has, such as Amaranth.  At first I didn't like the fact that I had to buy 6 can of the stuff, but I am glad I did.  It's been about a month and I only have one left.

review/summary: My Daughter Loves It
review/text: I am picky about what I feed my daughter. Her health is in my hands and I intend on caring for it to the best of my ability. This is an amazing product. Probiotics are essential for human beings and babies are not an exception to that fact. We have the multigrain and oatmeal variety of this product. My daughter loves to eat both. I believe breakfast is one of her favorite meals of the day and it because she loves this product so much.

review/summary: Cereal my baby loves
review/text: This cereal has a nice texture and taste (yep, I tried it!), and doesn't make my baby constipated, the way rice cereals do.  It's very easy to mix up - use formula, breast milk, or water.  I also add other fruit or vegetable purees or mashes.  The baby gobbles it up, and I love knowing that it's organic.

review/summary: Quinoa and Amaranth in Baby Cereal?? AMAZING!
review/text: My 7 month old LOVES to eat this cereal! I found that he prefers it plain than mixed with food! He likes the natural sweetness of it! I love the fact that it has quinoa and amaranth which is highly nutritious not to mention delicious. I also love the fact that it has probiotics because my baby has not had any digestion problems. The fact that it's all organic makes it all even better.

review/summary: Cereal is good
review/text: We liked this cereal a lot especially because of the nutritious mix of multi-grains.  The only thing we found is that the cereal had a weird after taste in one of the cans we used.  It could be a totally random issue.<br /><br />I am not personally a big fan of artificial sources of DHA, such as algae.  For mothers who are breastfeeding, breast milk is the best source of DHA and benefits of external sources of DHA are disputed.  However, we do like the fact that cereal has probiotics.<br /><br />We recommend this cereal to parents who are looking for a healthy organic option.

review/summary: She loves her Happy Bellies oatmeal
review/text: Our 7 month old was exclusively breastfed until 6 months when we started slowly introducing solids.  Her food is about 50% homemade purees and 50% jarred/pouched baby food (Earth's Best, Happy Babies, and Plum Organics).  We tried sweet potato as her first food but it didn't go over well, so we decided to try something bland and smooth but didn't want to give her a processed white rice cereal.  We picked up the Happy Bellies oatmeal and it was a hit!  Now when introducing a new food I'll mix up a bit of the oatmeal and blend it with the fruit or veggie puree to help her adjust to the new flavor.<br /><br />Plum Organics has an oatmeal that also has probiotics and my parents have purchased it to keep at their house (we go for dinner once a week). I much prefer the packaging, texture, and ease of mixing/smoothness of the Happy Bellies oatmeal.  Happy Bellies also has DHA, which Plum Organics does not.

review/summary: If you have gotten a bad can, read this!
review/text: I contacted Happy Bellies after purchasing what appeared to be a bad can at my local target. They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />"I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a "positive release" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son."<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers. Hopefully they will resolve these issues soon, but knowing that the product is safe is most important to me--even if the color is off.

review/summary: Be careful! May be dangerous.
review/text: I bought one of the oatmeal from wholefood and fed it to my baby right away. I was happy about it because she loved it. But after a couple of weeks, one day when my Mom fixed the cereal, she asked me why it has the bad smell. I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the "Earth's best" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi-grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could.<br />BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it. I just hope everyone smell the oat before you give it to your baby.

review/summary: Thought the grayish color was normal...
review/text: I've been buying Happy Bellies for the past 6 months (though I didn't use it exclusively... I also tried other brands). I'd say I've bought probably 5 or 6 cans so far. Unlike most of the reviewers here who opened a seemingly bad can, most of my cans have been grayish/greenish color! I thought it was a bit weird that the color/consistency/smell is different from the other brands, but since the "quality" I got has been consistent (consistently bad...), I didn't think too much of it. And then one day I finally got one that looks "normal"... I did some search on the internet and realized that I've been giving my baby bad oatmeal!!!! I feel so bad. I hope the company does something about it, and that FDA investigates on this issue. Has anyone reported this yet?

review/summary: Yep, They Changed the Formula...
review/text: This cereal has changed for the gross.  I didn't buy my latest can on Amaon, rather Target, so it's obviously a Happy Bellies issue & not Amazon.  The color of the cereal is a nasty grey/green and it smells awful.  I was wondering why my babies weren't really that enthusiastic about eating.  I like the added DHA & probiotics, but looks like I'll be going back to Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal.  Another company trying to skimp out on high quality ingredients, just to make a quick buck.

Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the brand again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition.

review/summary: Buyer beware
review/text: We used to love this product feeding it to our son twice a day for several months.  About 3 months ago, we opened a can and there was definitely something wrong with it.  The consistency was clumpy instead of the normal light, fluffy flakes.  The color was off as well.  The most notable change was the terrible smell.  I did contact the company and they responded to me right away.  The answer made some sense and it has been quoted by others here in this forum.  My problem now is that it just makes no sense!  How on earth is there no recall or some other investigation of this product by the FDA?  It was very noticeable that it all but disappeared off of store shelves and online stores for a few weeks.  The price here on Amazon has gone way up.  I was still buying it but will no longer.  I was still opening cans that were rancid and others that are not.  It is not cheap so I can't afford to keep playing the guessing game on my dime.

review/summary: Super Cereal!
review/text: Our son loves this cereal! I've compared and tried many brands, but I think this one gives us the most bang for our buck nutrition-wise. We started with the HappyBellies Rice about a year ago, and then graduated to the Multigrain as soon as the munchkin was eating more solid foods. Now, at 16 months, he's eating a thicker version mixed with fruits, veggies, yogurt, or even a protein; he likes it so much that I can basically get him to try anything that's mixed into his cereal.<br /><br />The easy-on-the-system nature and probiotics have been especially helpful when our son's been ill and had diarrhea due to a nasty virus and teething.<br /><br />Because this formula is more "concentrated" nutritionally than many other organic cereals, I think it's a good value, and it's certainly easier to take smaller servings (e.g. 3 Tablespoons vs. 5 for other brands) on the road. The cans pack and travel well, too.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sticking with this cereal because it seems to fill my hungry kid up, provide very good nutrition and is super easy to mix with stuff, even though he could technically eat adult oatmeal or whatever.

review/text: My son has a medical condition that affects his GI tract.  He digests slowly and was fussy.  He's a year old and we mixed this cereal with his formula and it was like magic.  He's not gassy, eats his entire bottle in 5-10 minutes, has regular BMs and is much more happy.  I've never been into organic stuff before but a friend recommended this and I would never use anything else.  I really believe the probiotics have had a positive result on my son.  He really has a Happy Belly now!  We tried everything else out there and this stuff is fantastic.  It's worth the extra money!!!

review/summary: Overpriced, incorrect portions
review/text: I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand.

review/summary: foul odor
review/text: I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish-tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color - this time it was brownish-green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container - same brownish-green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.  I have contacted the company, but have had no reply yet.  I would not recommend feeding this to your baby.

review/summary: My baby's favorite
review/text: My 9 month old gobbles this up.  We've tried Earth's Best which she didn't like and Gerber which she didn't mind, but she absolutely loves this oatmeal cereal.  She eats it more than she eats any other "solid". She's been eating it for 3 months now.

review/summary: Smells weird...
review/text: We got the 6 pack of brown rice and it smell very strange, almost like rancid nuts. I did TONS of research to find out this was normal or if the cereal really was rancid. I opened several cans and they all smell the same. Other people had the same experience, and apparently the smell is normal. My 7 month old daughter seems to like it and her poos have gotten softer, constipation had been an issue before :(<br />Three stars because it smells and tastes very strong.
