review/summary: Superior Formula Product
review/text: This is absolutely the best powdered (or any type) formula I have found to date. It is the ONLY one I have seen that doesn't have corn syrup as the second ingredient on the package. My son had a hard time adapting to formula because of a lactose sensitivity in other brands. We tried Similac and the only kind he could digest was the Similac Sensitive. Even then, however, spit-up and gas were regular issues. Switching to Earth's Best eliminated both completely, and I feel so much better giving my child an organic product. The family Naturopath I go to also said the nutrition balance was excellent, and we only supplement with a small dose of Vitamin D.  This 4-pack, although a big chunk of money at once, is really an incredible deal, especially if you purchase via Amazon's Subscribe and Save program to obtain an additional discount.

review/summary: Works for us!
review/text: Prior to this formula, we tried Similac Advance, Similac Sensitive, Enfamil Gentle Ease, and Up & Up Gentle Ease (Target's brand). All of these formulas gave my son painful gas and caused him to be constipated for as many as 5 days. In fact, we were starting to use suppositories because it was making him so miserable. Then, we tried Earth's Best, and instantly he went from passing a pasty stool a couple times per week to a more normal looking stool 3-5 times per day! As a result he is much happier. He still has gas but it's not as bad as it was. Now he's 6 months and he has one good poop per day! This formula works for us, and you don't have to worry about all the crap that's in many other formulas. I like knowing that my baby is not consuming genetically modified organics, chemical pesticides, and high fructose corn syrup - all of which are found in most non-organic formulas. I definitely recommend this formula!

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I started my daughter on this formula when she was 7 months old as a supplement to breast milk because my supply was weakening.  I  wanted to give her organic if she couldn't have breast milk and we never tried anything else.  She had only had breast milk up to that point and she didn't hesitate to drink it up!  We haven't had any issues with her spitting it up as long as we make sure that she burps after she drinks more than 2 ounces.  She never really spit up with breast milk( only on a few occasions), but I noticed that if she didn't burp with the formula, she would sometimes spit up after drinking it.  She is 10 months old now and drinking this exclusively and she loves it.  I would totally recommend this product to others and their customer service line is great if you have any questions or concerns.

review/summary: Not perfect, but very close
review/text: We used this formula for our first two babies, and they both loved it.  Neither had gas issues with it, although I know each baby is different.<br /><br />We ordered this formula through the subscribe and save program, and it was wonderful.  It saved us about $5-8 per can and we never had to make a last-minute run to the store.  I wish we could have ordered more than 3 cans per month through the subscription program though.  We often had to adjust our subscription order before the month was over.  It would have been nice to order 4 cans per month automatically.  Fortunately, we never received any dented cans like other reviewers had and we usually received the order within a few days (at the latest).<br /><br />The only negative things I will say is that we cut our fingers/hands on the edges of these cans at first, and we quickly learned to be more careful.  It would have been better if the manufacturer designed the can a little differently.  Also, sometimes the scoop was buried in the formula, so it would have been more convenient if they had the scoop attach to the lid like some other manufacturers do.  This was not a big deal because we always had the scoop from the previous can.<br /><br />Separately, my oldest (around 3 years old) just started to get repulsed by the smell of her baby sister's formula recently, only if they are sitting VERY closely together.  I don't know if it is just this brand or all baby formulas.  Fortunately, if they are sitting at the breakfast table (a couple of feet away), it is not a problem.  It is also not a problem when they are both in the back of the car.

review/summary: Excellent Formula
review/text: For our fourth child, we had to begin the formula adventure.  Never before did we need this, but adopting a 5 month old changes things!  Looking at the label on the formula he was on when he came, we were utterly shocked and dismayed that the first ingredient was ~42% corn-sugar solids.  In a baby formula!!<br /><br />Having a holistic approach to health and a strong emphasis on sustainable, organic agricultural production, we have long been fans of Earth's Best other children products.  This formula continues their tradition of quality produce.<br /><br />Opening the other cans, the smell was certainly less than pleasant.  Peeling back the lid on the Earth's Best formula, it actually smells like something I would enjoy consuming - it smells like food for people!<br /><br />Certainly, formula isn't cheap, but in the foundational years of infancy, every ounce of nourishment is important.  Thanks to Amazon & the subscribe and save option, the price for this wonderful formula is on par or cheaper than the alternatives at the local stores (walmart & the like).<br /><br />As far as formula goes, it certainly shouldn't be the first choice if the option to breast feed exists.  If that isn't a possibility, this should be at the top of your list as the next best thing.

review/summary: So far, so good
review/text: We started using this product after we learned that Organic Similac contained sugar and was in the process of being banned in the EU. I believe that this product uses lactose as the sugar needed to break down the milk-based protein. We knew that we wanted an organic milk-based product to supplement breast feeding when necessary and this one seemed to have the best ingredients. So far our babies seem to tolerate it quite well. No excessive gas or allergies that we can tell after about 8 weeks of using this brand. Also the color is more like my milk and it doesn't stain or have an off-putting smell like other formulas we've seen.

review/summary: Awesome Formula, Great Price
review/text: This was recommended to us as the next best thing to breast feeding, when those weren't available for one reason or another.  In our case, this was used primarily when daughter and daddy (me) were together without mommy.<br /><br />Objectively, it's got the good stuff per the label:  Organic, DHA, and iron fortified.  Given what you hear about harmful agents in food, it gave my wife and I peace of mind knowing that this is organic.<br /><br />Subjectively, our daughter loved it and didn't give any pause when gulping it down.  In fact, she seemed to dig it, usually sucking the bottle dry in short order.  I've heard that some babies can be finicky when it comes to formula, but we had no such experience with this product.  Indeed, we tried others that didn't seem as satisfying.  My much more mature taste buds also gave this a thumb's up, finding it tasty and smooth, though admittedly I had only cow's milk to compare.  On the practical side, this mixed up quickly and completely with water; it was smooth and creamy, with no un-disolved clumps or grittiness.  I used to pre-measure some in bottles when we went out so I could just add water and shake it up and that worked great.<br /><br />The best testimonial I can give, other than saying that it pleased our daughter's discerning palate, is that this is the only formula I will use for our next child.

review/summary: Positive Reviewers Are Too Easily Impressed
review/text: The only positive thing I have to say about this formula is that it has Organic Milk in it, and that's pretty sad because that part is a given.  Here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Dissolves horribly.  I have to prepare bottles ahead of time, refrigerate them, then warm them to use it.  My baby would take a bottle at room temperature, but if I did that there would be clumps of formula left behind.<br />- Has corn syrup in it (listed as Organic Glucose Syrup Solids).  Ok, so it isn't GMO corn syrup, but who cares?  There is no reason to include this except to save money.  It is a cheaper carbohydrate source than lactose, so they can use less lactose (lactose being something that actually has nutrional value).<br />-Has Palm Olein Oil in it.  Again, it is organic, but so what?  Another cheap ingredient (this time a fat source).  Palm Olein oil has been shown to block absorption of calcium in the body.  Oh good, because the first year of life isn't a crucial time for bone development or anything.  Even Similac won't use it.  Here is a link to study by the American Acadamy of Pediatrics from 2002(!) showing infants fed formula with palm olein oil had lower bone density than those without, and yet Hain doesn't care enough to stop using it: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/111/5/1017<br />-Has Martec DHA/AHA in it.  This is a genetically modified product and the fact that it has been allowed in organic food is just an example of how powerful lobbyists are.  If they have to use chemical neurotoxins to get the DHA/AHA, I'd rather just do without, thanks.  I know of no studies that show the level of DHA/AHA in baby formulas do anything positive for a baby's brain development.  There have also been reports of babies experiencing stomach upset from DHA/AHA in formulas.  It is hard to get this feedback though since almost every formula has Martec's DHA/AHA in them now.<br />-It smells like death and when my baby burps in my face I gag a little.<br /><br />I never planned on even trying this formula, but Baby's Only constipated my baby like no tomorrow.  Even with the arsenic ridiculousness, I'd still use Baby's Only if the Brown Rice Syrup didn't make him scream every time he had a bowel movement.  And Similac Organic has no lactose and is filled with table sugar.  Organic formula options in this country are horrible.  (I am unable to exclusively breastfeed due to medication)

review/summary: One pro, lots of cons...
review/text: I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better "communicate" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula. We'll continue with our Gerber Good Start, and as much breast milk as possible.

We decided to keep trying the formula until we finished and supplement him with apple juice and apple and pear purees to help him digest. Four days later and he was still terribly constipated, and he struggled. We decided to change to Baby's One and within a a day he was having some normal looking bowel movements. I was really disappointed that this formula was so harsh for his stomach. I think the intentions were good but it obviously isn't a complete trade off and I have read that they extra fortify the milk-base formula with more lactose which makes it difficult for children to digest. My son is taking really well with Baby's only and we will continue with this formula since its better than non-organic.

review/text: While I know it is good for my baby, I cannot stand the awful looks of disgust when my baby eats this formula. Organic is important to my family, but I decided to do a taste test of several different brands to try and find a non-fishy tasting formula. This brand has the most pungent flavor of fishiness, yuck! Similac is a bit better, and Enfamil also is better but still fishy. The only brand I found that doesn't taste fishy is Baby's Only Formula. I believe it is because it does not have the DHA, which I know is good for brain development, but my son gets this in his vitamin.

review/summary: Poor taste, Poor mixing
review/text: We have now gone through 4 formulas, and here are our conclusions.<br /><br />Similac (non-organic): They use cows which have been given growth hormones.  Seriously, even most non-organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones.  Our baby spent his first four months off the growth-charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this.<br /><br />Similac Organic: Our baby liked this one, but then a NYT article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it.<br /><br />Earth's Best: We really struggled with the transition from Similac to Earth's Best.  We went through a 2 week transition of 3/4 Similac, 1/4 Earth's Best...with a slow increase in the Earth's Best.  Even to our adult taste senses, it had a fishy odor and taste (likely the DHA, which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand).  And it NEVER WENT INTO SOLUTION.  We would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby, he would suck and suck -- even when no milk was coming out.  Our baby developed eczema - I am not convinced the formula caused the problem.  Babies get eczema.  But after trying everything else (detergents, lotions, soaps, etc) and reading some reviews questioning whether Earth's Best caused eczema, we decided to try one more formula switch.<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic: "Now here is something I can add to my coffee when we run out of milk," says my husband.  It has a wonderful smell of oatmeal.  No transition needed, our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting.  It goes into solution better than both the Similac and the Earth's Best.  No GI distress or constipation when we made the switch.  I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small, but scoop for scoop, it is less expensive than Earth's Best.  Just waiting for Amazon to have a "subscription" discount.  I highly recommend Baby's Only!

review/summary: Doesn't disolve well
review/text: Some of my friends were using Earth's Best formula and were raving about it so we decided to switch from Enfamil Infant Premium to the Earth's Best organic infant formula since it was available on Amazon subscription and was a little cheaper. I have to say that I was very disappointed with this product. It does not disolve well at all and leaves chunks of formula in the bottle regardless how well you mix it and whether you use warm or cold water to dilute it with. The baby does not seem to like it any more or less, so we will be going back to Enfamil Infant Premium, which has all the same vitamns and completely disolves within seconds.<br />After mentioning about the chunks to a friend, I was told that it is a common problem with this brand of formula.

review/summary: not as pleased as expected
review/text: This is a great food brand, and I also like their diapers, but this formula does NOT dissolve well, and my 2 month old baby does not like it!!  He is mostly breastfed, but I supplement with Similac Organic with good results (no fussiness).  I gave Earth's Best a try, and my 10 week old baby cried and cried, and was having obvious gas pain, until I switched back to Similac.  I would much prefer to use this brand, so I tried again a few weeks later, and I got the same reaction from my baby.  I would definitely us caution when choosing this formula, although I realize all babies are different.  I will continue to use Earth's Best's other products, but not this formula.

review/summary: It's not Mother's milk, but it's great formula!
review/text: After going back to work full-time, I really struggled with keeping up with nursing my baby full-time. I just could not meet the quota that baby wanted to consume through pumping, no matter how often I pumped, what supplements I took, what diet I had, etc. I started using the Enfamil samples they sent me in the mail before I had my baby. First of all, I was kinda disgusted with how yucky it smelled. Baby didn't seem to like it either and spit up most of it after drinking it. We went to try their formula for babies who are gassy and as I was waiting for it to warm up I read the ingredient label and was shocked to see that the very first ingredient was corn syrup solids. Really??? In infant formula? I know it needs to contain sugar but come on!<br />So that started me on a research binge and I found that all formulas have to have some sort of sugar in them, but the kind of sugar is what matters. Moms make lactose and glucose (although in smaller amounts than lactose) and there is also fructose and sucrose. Fructose is what they make from corn (AKA HFCS), and sucrose is what they use in artificial sweeteners. I voted primarily for lactose and glucose, but found that a lot of formulas focused on fructose and sucrose, and if they had glucose it was from brown rice (this was during the scare that rice had arsenic in it).<br />FINALLY I found Earth's Best. I was impressed that not only did it have lactose and glucose but glucose was the 4TH ingredient instead of the first or second. This was the most important point to me in purchasing, but even more important -was baby going to like it? When I mixed it the first time it didn't have a sour odor to it, and it smelled like milk (granted, as all formula, it smells after it sits for a while). It even looked like milk (hooray) AND baby gobbled it right up. ALL OF IT. She loves the stuff! Best part is there are no problems with transitioning from breast to bottle, so now she is supplemented with the formula after her fill of breast-milk when I'm home. She even gets excited to drink it!<br />I think there's something everyone needs to keep in mind. We don't live in a `clean' society any more. Everything has toxins and chemicals, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Everything is bad in excess: sunshine can give you cancer, tap water can give you cavities and diseases and raw fruits and veggies can give you pesticides. Even air is bad for you, depending on where you live. So I say, do the best with what you have and don't let yourself get too carried away with all the hype about harmful stuff. In the end, I feel I made the right choice for my baby and chose the next best thing to breast-milk that I could find that was relatively affordable and easy to obtain.

I tried emailing someone from the "Contact Us" button on the returns page and no one has responded. I will not feed my baby a can that has been dented with a broken seal, this is dangerous. The can cost me $24 if I don't get a replacement the savings I get for ordering from Amazon sets me back a few months. I love ordering many items from Amazon and having my formula and diapers shipped on a regular basis but the damaged goods policy needs to be revised when it comes to food items.

review/summary: More milk than sugar + Organic + Subscribe & Save = Satisfied
review/text: All formulas put in a sweetener.  I've seen some where corn syrup is the first ingredient. Earth's Best is not only organic but the first two ingredients are whey (from milk) and milk, followed by lactose (from milk - it's a low-level sweetener) and then coming in at ingredient #4 is glucose (sugar).<br />Baby likes it and we haven't noticed any gas issues<br />But, of course, organic isn't cheap - so I buy it via subscribe & save.  At $22 it's still more expensive than non-organic but within a reasonable range.  We now get 5 canisters automatically at the beginning of each month.  We use it to supplement breast milk (otherwise we'd need more canisters) and, more recently, breast milk and solid foods.

Between the ingredients on the can and the baby's reaction, we didn't go very far with this.  The Earth's Best rice cereal is a hit. I guess it's a matter of baby preference. Seems like he threw up more than usual while we tried to transition.  Pay close attention to the ingredients also.

A nice little compact box that fits the four canisters tightly is nestled inside a great big cardboard box almost twice the size and padded in there with a bunch of plastic air pockets. It's totally, uselessly, unnecessarily wasteful! Why not just ship the little bitty box on its own? Amazon should do better, considering how much crap...er, stuff it ships out.

review/summary: My son loves it, i'm pretty sure I do too..
review/text: I order this from Amazon and a hugely discounted price. In my area it is $29.99 for a 23.2l one can, which is nuts. When I first subscribed I was only paying $74.97 for 4 cans.  That's around 45 dollars in savings, I got 3 shipments at that discounted price, and that's $135 in savings. Now I pay around $86 which is still a lot cheaper than going to the store. Plus only Toy r' us sells it where we live, and that's not exactly close to me. So that's why this product gets 4 stars.<br /><br />I would have given it only 3 but the savings are great. To start off my son does love this formula over any other. We ran out once before the next shipment, and Toys r' us was closed so we had to get another brand, my son wouldn't even drink it. Now some of you are gonna say that's because it's not what he is used to.  Well we actually started him off on Enfamil, but due to corn syrup being the first ingredient in the formula we switched (not because it's corn syrup, but because I don't want my son's primary diet to be based off of any sugar).  Well when we switched that time he didn't even care. Also this kid eats a lot. He is a big boy, lol... The doctor says he is a healthy weight so whatevsky.<br /><br />The reasons I don't care for the formula.  First of all it seems like his bowel movements aren't as regular.  Also as soon as we switched his BM's turned more solid and smell inhuman. His stomach does get really tight and it seems like he has a hard time pushing his poopies out because it's so solid.  Before his stomach would get really tight but then it would just gush out, oh the joys of parenthood.  After talking to the doctor there apparently is nothing to concern ourselves about.  Secondly I wish they would offer this in a 6 pack, as 4 will not last the entire month anymore.  We end up having to buy 1 can locally towards the end of the month which at 86 dollars a shipment basically means the money we saved just goes towards 1 can. Other than that I think this formula is fine, and our son loves it very much. He would rate it a 5 and write "MMM" 20 times in the review. :)

review/summary: My son screamed in discomfort every time I gave it to him
review/text: I bought this formula thinking I'm buying the best for my 8 month old. Even though this wasn't available in the smaller 8oz size which I would have prefered to ensure that my son liked it, I went ahead and bought it since he's not a fussy baby and easily took Similac and Enfamil earlier.<br /><br />I used formula only to supplement breastfeeding and gave about 2-4oz of this daily to my son for 4-5 days. During this time, we noticed that he was very cranky and didn't slepe well, would scream even in his sleep and keep curling up and rolling in bed, sort of banging his face and head on the mattress. I attributed this to teething or constipation. But when over the weekend I did not supplement at all, he was completely fine. Then to test, I gave it to him again after he had been fine for a couple of days and had also pooped well. Even after just 2 oz in the afternoon, he started doing the same thing...screaming, rolling in bed, unable to sleep well.<br /><br />I also read that there is an issue with the way the DHA is obtained, using some toxic chemical, when researching this formula to find if other mom's had seen the same issue with their children. I give it a 2 rating as I don't know if it just didn't suit my child or if there is something not good in the formula.

That said, if money was tight Enfamil woudl serve just as well.

But she likes it, it doesn't upset her tummy, and I like that it's organic and one of the best formulas out there that are readily available and "reasonably" priced - especially with Amazon's Subscribe & Save.  Enough said.

review/text: My daughter has been on this formula since she was born. She has had no issues with it whatsoever and lights up every time she sees the bottle. I feel better knowing she is getting an all organic formula. And I love that Amazon sells this 4 pack at the best price I've seen anywhere.

review/summary: If there was a better option for the price, I'd take it.
review/text: I should start by saying I only give my baby 4-8 oz of formula a day, otherwise she's breastfed, so the issues I have with this product minimally effect us.<br /><br />It is important to me to give my baby organic food whenever possible, so that is the main reason I picked this product to begin with, also when I purchased the price was better than other organic formulas and it doesn't have corn syrup in it.<br /><br />The downsides:<br /><br />It is difficult to mix, you must use warm/hot water in order to get the lumps out.  And it gets ridiculously frothy when shaken up, like the entire bottle is foam.  What I do now is make a bottle at least a few hours ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, by the time I need to use it, the air bubbles are gone.<br /><br />My baby is not a picky eater at all, so I can't comment on the taste of it.<br /><br />Update:  My baby is now 7 months and takes about 16-18 oz of formula a day.  We noticed that she had been spitting up a lot since increasing her feedings, she would spit up without fail after a feeding, not matter how well she was burped and she would spit up again, sometimes 3 more times in the next hour.  When I happened to run out of this brand and had to use some similac, the spitting up nearly disappeared.  If I had to guess it's due to all the foam in the bottle, but perhaps it's one of the ingredients?  As I mentioned in the above review, the amount of shaking that has to be done to dissolve the formula is ridiculous.  Even with very warm water and a lot of shaking we'll have lumps of undissolved formula in the bottom of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because the price is right and it's one of only 2 options of organic formula that isn't full of arsenic.  Unfortunately a new shipment of 4 of these canisters arrived after realizing this, so we're stuck with it.  But I think I will mix it with another formula to minimize the spitting up.

review/summary: mostly good, wondering about DHA
review/text: My milk production is low so I supplement. Glad to have an organic option, but I wonder about the source of the DHA & ARA - it does not seem like a very organic process. However there are not a lot of choices, so this seems the best out there. Plus baby seems to like it and tolerates it well.<br />Lately I'm having a harder time getting the product to dissolve when I mix it up in the bottle. Not sure if this is due to weather changes? It seemed to dissolve better in the summer.

review/summary: We love it and so does our baby
review/text: We started our 7 month old on the samples we were given by the pediatrician, the standard Enfamil Infant or Newborn formula, but once we realized supplementing would be an every day occurrence and that we needed to buy, we wanted to go organic and we tried this first.  It smells better than the other stuff, she adjusted to it just fine when mixed with breastmilk, and her gassiness disappeared.  It is sometimes hard to get it all to dissolve easily, but room temp water and very vigorous shaking seems to remedy that.  Now that she is full time on the formula, the 4-pack on subscribe and save can't be beat!<br /><br />While we initially had the same powder explosion problem another reviewer commented on, we learned that because we live where it's hot and the package either sits on a hot truck and/or on our hot porch until we get it, if you just let it sit until it's down to room temp, it won't explode on you!

review/summary: great formula for my kids
review/text: I have been using this formula for my kids and they absolutely love it. My baby boy does get constipated sometimes from this, but I don't know if that's the formula or the solid foods or just his system because it works great for my daughter. I have tried Similac Organic prior to this and that was VERY constipating! This is much better and not as grainy as Similac. The cheapest way to buy this is through Amazon on their subscribe and save program. I have been addicted to Going the Amazon route for all my baby supplies. Of course conventional formula is cheaper, but I don't want to compromise my infant's health by giving her formula that can have pestisides, hormones, and genetically modified ingredients! I would definitely recommend this product for anyone using formula.

review/text: In addition to breast feeding, we had to supplement with formula.  We tried similac, enfamil, and good start.  All of them gave my daughter constipation and gas that would cause her to scream in pain.  We tried everything.  Her gas was smelling like sulfur.  We researched everything and came across this formula.  We tried one can from BRU and the change was instant.  My daughter actually smiled when eating and the change was so wonderful we looked for the subscribe and save and never looked back.  She stopped spitting up and got excited with each bottle she had.  She is growing very well and is happy each time she eats.  We also use Earth's Best food and diapers and wipes.  I am an organic believer!  Nothing is too good for my daughter when it comes to her health.

review/summary: Best I Could Find
review/text: Compared to the several other baby formulas we've tried, this is the best one. My son has reflux issues, even at 10 months old. This formula is thick enough that he doesn't spit up as often. It helped him maintain his weight when the reflux was worse.<br /><br />Organic is mandatory for my son's food. What I don't like is one of the ingredients. They use corn syrup solids to meet the necessary carbohydrate requirements. When I asked why they used corn syrup as opposed to something healthier, I received several automated responses stating that the number I gave them was incorrect. I had never given them a contact number, and my reply was to the first email they sent that stated the corn syrup solids were for carbohydrate requirements.<br /><br />Beyond that I haven't come across a better formula. This package of 4 is the best price I can find, as I live in HI and can not receive certain items or discounts via subscription and Amazon Mom.

review/summary: Great deal on the best formula so far ( besides breastmilk )
review/text: We already had been using Earths Best when I bought this case. Earths best is by far the best formula out of all the ones we tried Babys Only is second we agree. All of my family and friends use it and their kids seem really healthy and smart. Our 2 1/2 month old boy has had no problems with it and just loves it and he is always in a chipper mood. He was constipated with your basic cheap mass produced Similac & Enfamil And although I personally dont buy organic for myself due to price, our baby is worth being picky about organic.<br /><br /> I was skeptical as to how old these cans were gonna be but to my shock the expiration date showed the cans were fresher than the ones I have been picking up from all the stores they sell this at and it still is in the manufacturers case. I feel like I am cutting out the middlemen and transportation lag and just getting it direct and quick after packaging.<br /><br />Great deal and you will save tremendously more than buying 1 or 2 cans at a time.

review/summary: Toxic Hexane in Formula???
review/text: To be honest, I have never written a review, not matter how good or bad a product I received was. I never had the time and never bothered. Today, I write my very first review of a product that I have been feeding my precious son since birth. He is now 2 years 4 months. I could never breastfeed him exclusively due to bone density loss and I did massive amounts of research and tried out tons of different brands before deciding on this organic formula from Earth's Best and since then, even though he is now a toddler, I still use the Earth's Best infant formula and supplement with other child vitamins.<br /><br />I was trying to re-order again in bulk from Amazon when I noticed for the first time the controversy over DHA/ARA extraction by the use of toxic hexane of which Hain Celestial which manufactures Earth's Best is guilty of. To understand my utter complete fury, you must know that I live in Singapore and I quite literally pay international shipping for every can of this formula (and wade through customs declarations, tests and tax levies) to bring this milk to my son. In Singapore, this can of milk is also available but in highly limited quantities and even more princely prices (yes, even after the tax, customs and shipping, it still costs less than US$68 which is the going price per can here). Calls to Hain Celestial customer service drove me further up the wall when first, a lady said the hexane was only in trace amounts and less than what the FDA approved. Then, reaching another lady an hour later, the story was different. She said that the hexane solvent method was the only method approved by the FDA to extract the DHA/ARA from non-toxic algae and soil fungus. A third occasion and Hain's customer service informed me that there should be no hexane detected in the product but on further probing admitted that she was not aware if the formula had undergone independent third party tests.<br /><br />To me, this is crazy. The formula was marketed as a pure organic product and we pay premium prices (especially me!) for a premium product. To find that that they have taken such short cuts is completely unacceptable and the worst thing is that, it turns out that most of the other organic formula companies do this exact irresponsible thing and keep quiet about it. The only company that does not is Baby's Only - it uses a water based process to extract their DHA/ARA from eggs(compare this to Hain's claim that the hexane method is the only one approved by FDA and one wonders why Baby's Only hasn't been hauled up by the FDA yet). My son is going on that pronto once I can get a shipment to Singapore. Unfortunately, Baby's Only is not available in Singapore (not even at princely prices) and my son is going to have to continue ingesting his Earth's Best formula in the interim.

review/summary: Best AFFORDABLE Organic Formula on the Market
review/text: Although any mom would prefer to feed their baby breast milk, there are circumstances that do not allow everyone to do so. I am stuck in that boat. So, I went on a quest to find the next best thing, organic formula. My son has been on Earth's Best formula since he was one week old and has no problems at all.<br /><br />Here is what I LIKE about Earth's Best:<br /><br />ORGANIC.  I am very conscious about what I put in my own body so I wouldn't not have it any other way for my son. The use of pesticides and genetically modified ingredients is a terrifying concept to me. EB contains no growth hormones, antibiotics, steroids or potentially harmful pesticides or herbicides.<br /><br />EASY TO DIGEST. My son has no fussiness or issues with this formula. He's happy and content and has had no issues with gas or spitting up due to the formula. My son was a very colicky baby but we had tested out a few formulas before concluding that it was definitely not the EB causing his fussiness.<br /><br />AFFORDBILITY. Due to the recent recall of Similac organic formula, Earth's Best became the only affordable organic formula on the market that I could find readably available. The only other option available on the market besides Earth's Best is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJM9SU">Babys Only Organic Toddler Formula, Dairy Iron Fortified, 12.7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> and at nearly $30 for 3 cans of 12.7 oz of formula was out of our means. With Amazon subscribe and save, this formula is nearly the same price as non-organic formula. How could I even consider feeding my son anything else?<br /><br />These are the ISSUES I have with the formula:<br /><br />SYRUP SOLIDS. Sugar in formula? Excuse me! This is really disappointing but I believe the organic element of the formula far outweighs switching to a non-organic formula. As I said earlier, Baby Only is too expensive to even be an option for us. Plus, I believe the use of pesticides in formula ingredients is a far more dangerous concept than sugar!<br /><br />DHA/ARA. I am not a fan of the synthetically derived DHA/ARA found in EB formula. However, there are no affordable formulas on the market that have naturally derived DHA/ARA. Therefore, its hard to judge EB alone. The formula industry should be required to find a NATURAL way to derive DHA/ARA if it should be allowed to market their product as organic.<br /><br />CLUMPS. The formula can be hard to mix properly without getting clumps. It takes an extra amount of patience and time to mix this formula. The best solution I have found is to mix the formula in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I481LM">Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher</a>or use a handheld formula mixer such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K4Q9BG">Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer</a> when making one bottle at a time. This way I do not get the bubbles that form from vigorous shaking.<br /><br />Although the EB formula is not perfect, it is the most affordable organic formula made on the market. However, if it is within your means, you may want to do a little bit of research on Baby Only formula.

review/text: Our baby has been on this formula and breast milk for a few months now.  She doesn't have much gas from it.  It does take some vigorous shaking to totally dissolve the formula.  I let it settle a bit prior to giving it to her so that there are less bubbles in the formula which in turn is less air in her belly.  I love the larger can, more bang for your buck and am hoping that Amazon puts this on Subscribe and Save soon.  I purchased it for 86...it was in the Friday sale section one week.  So look there a couple of weeks if you are not in a hurry to get.<br /><br />4/14/11 It is cheaper to get get the smaller can on subscribe and save rather than this one!<br />25.75oz can with subscribe & save is 0.772/ounce (4 can pack) at 79.57/case (on subscribe and save)<br />31.75oz can is 0.858/ounce (4 can pack) at 109/case

review/summary: We thought we were doing our best
review/text: My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.  We switched from Similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula....after a 10 day half and half schedule we noticed less pooping and violent screaming after eating.  Since this is our first two kids (twins) we can't say if it's the formula but something didn't seem right.  Then a friend emailed about the controversy of the synthetic additives in this formula...do your own research, but we have since switched to Baby's Only (too early to tell if it's cured the issues) and we feel better we have steered clear of the fact we might be doing more harm than good.  So frustrating!  Here is some info to help in your research.<br /><br />Seems are some issues with DHA/ ARA additives.<br /> EB's Ingredient List below...  have you looked at Baby's Only?<br /><br />Earth's Best:  Earth's Best &lt;[...]>  is the leading organic baby food manufacturer.  The company is owned by Horizon (which is owned by Dean Foods ) and offers both dairy and soy based organic infant formulas. Earth's Best uses organic lactose from cows, so if you are concerned about your baby having problems with lactose intolerance, this formula might not be the best option.<br /><br />Baby's Only: Baby's Only from Nature's One &lt;[...]>  comes as both dairy, lactose free, and soy organic formulas.  Baby's Only uses brown rice syrup, a higher quality and more complex carbohydrate, when compared to lactose.  It's also less likely to cause an blood sugar spikes or problems with food allergies.<br /><br />Earth's Best - Organic Infant Formula with DHA & ARA -  Ingredients<br />Organic Reduced Minerals Whey, Organic Vegetable Oils (Palm Or Palm Olein, High Oleic (Safflower Or Sunflower),Coconut, Soy), Organic Nonfat Milk, Organic Lactose, And Less Than 1%: Crypthecodinium Cohnii Oil (Docosahexaenoic Acid), Mortierella Alpina Oil (Arachidonic Acid), Soy Lecithin, Minerals: (Calcium Chloride, Calcium Hydroxide, Cupric Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Potassium Bicarbonate, Potassium Chloride, Potassium Hydroxide, Potassium Iodide, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Selenite, Zinc Sulfate), Taurine, Vitamins: Ascorbic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beta-Carotene, Biotin, Calcium Pantothenate, Choline Chloride, Cyanocobalamin, Folic Acid, Inositol, Mixed Tocopherol Concentrate, Niacinamide, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Thiamin Hydrochloride, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol), Vitamin E (Dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), Vitamin K (Phytonadione), Nucleotides: Adenosine-5'-Monophosphate, Cytidine-5'-Monophosphate, Disodium Guanosine-5'-Monophosphate, Disodium Inosine-5'-Monophosphate, Disodium Uridine-5'-Monophosphate.<br /><br />Baby's Only Lactose free - Ingredients<br />Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Milk Protein Concentrate, Organic High Oleic Sunflower Oil, Organic Soybean Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Monopotassium Phosphate, Calcium Phosphate, Potassium Citrate, Organic Soy Lecithin, Organic Vanilla, Dimagnesium Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Calcium Ascorbate (Vit.

With the exception of some prescription formulas, available with approval from pediatricians, only one over-the-counter formula is available without synthetic DHA/ARA, Baby,s Only, an organic product manufactured by Nature,s One in Columbus, Ohio.<br /><br />After today,s official announcement by the USDA, all other organic formula manufacturers will need to remove Martek,s oils from their products, Cornucopia,s Vallaeys stated.<br /><br />In the meantime, The Cornucopia Institute also has filed petitions with the FDA requesting that their Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation for the Martek oils be revoked.<br /><br />When Martek,s additives were originally granted GRAS status, it was with extreme reservations on the part of the FDA review panel because of adverse reactions to these oils said Valleys. When we reviewed FOIA documents, we were astonished to find that none of the infant formula manufacturers had complied with the FDA,s request to monitor adverse reactions and perform post-market surveillance of these materials.<br /><br />The manufacturing process for Martek,s oils likely includes genetically engineered organisms and neurotoxic synthetic solvents, which are both explicitly banned in organic production. According documents submitted by Martek to the FDA, the process to make their oils includes growing algae and fungus in a medium that is made primarily of dextrose derived from corn, yeast extract or a hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which is usually derived from soybeans. Given that the vast majority of corn and soybean products in the food supply are produced through genetic engineering, the likelihood that Martek,s DHA and ARA oils are grown in a medium of genetically engineered organisms is almost certain. The use of genetic engineering is, of course, strictly prohibited in organics.<br /><br />UPDATE - Ok we are 10 days in and our twins are much much happier.  We did 3 days of half and half and decided to fully switch to Baby's Only.  The intense screaming after eating has stopped and now both our girls are more regular. They go once every one to two days vs every 5 to 6.  Much less fussy and happier overall.  Was it the formula change or just a stage they went through?  Maybe a little bit of both, but there is no doubt I'd never use Earth's Best again....nothing worse than seeing both your daughters screaming after eating especially when you thought you were buying something good for them....they need to remove that crap from this product.

review/summary: DO NOT ues this formula, use Baby's Only
review/text: Please do the research before choosing a formula. When my daughter was first born I used Earth's Best. Not being able to breastfeed I wanted to ensure she was getting the best formula possible. Imagine my surprise and horror after discovering the methods they use to extract this supposed healthy DHA and ARA. Hexane is highly toxic. It's a gimmick used to move product. Once I switched I knew I made the right choice, and my daughter did much better with this on top of it.

review/summary: different formula
review/text: They changed the formula last summer and kept the brand and package unchanged. I bought two cans from different places and noticed the ingredients list are different. I called their customer service and was told the formula has been changed. My baby loves the old formula which doesn't smell much different from breast milk. The new formula smells much stronger, and he doesn't like it. But I do know other babies who like the new formula. I guess you will have to let your baby to try it first to know whether he likes it or not.

review/text: I recommend that you call the company and ask them yourself. This formula is 100% safe! I have been giving it to my 6 month old for the last 6 months and he loves it! If you call your product organic, it has to pass a lot of tests and regulations. Earth's Best will guarantee its purity. Call them and find out for yourself. The phone number is 1-800-434-4246.

review/summary: Great Product, Great deal, but not in the summer
review/text: This has been a great product for our daughter and we will continue to have her use it. Amazons price through subscribe in save is near impossible to beat. There are 2 problems. 1. We live in Tucson and the formula arrives very hot. The product explains that it should never be exposed to extreme temperatures. It gets so hot in the UPS truck that when you pop the lid it sprays out powder. That amount of heat is likely not good for some of the ingredients. 2. Amazons warehouse does a poor job packaging the cans. They put the cans to one edge of the box with bubble plastic on the other end. The cans get dented and Ive read where they have arrived opened. The product itself is fantastic.

review/summary: Soo mmm good
review/text: When my daughter was born she was on similac since I was not able to fully breast feed her, so in the following weeks we used it and it was fine until she developed baby acne and spit it up a lot, then we heard about Earth's Best. We decided to try it out and it's been a great decision ever since. She no longer spits it up (as much..) and no baby acne. We are definitely recommend this product. The shipping has been impeccable every time I order it. There are no complaints here...

review/summary: Earth's Best Organic Formula
review/text: Baby loves it! We went from Enfamil to Similac and she did not like either. We had problems with her spitting it up, so moving along the line of formulas to try we tried Earth's Best Organic and she loved it! No more spitting up. She's now moving up to rice cereal and pureed fruits. This formula foams up a little when first mixed, but let it sit a minute or so and it goes away. Now I buy it by the case here on Amazon.

review/summary: Love this formula
review/text: I was only able to breastfeed for the first month after our daughter was born.  We had to use a formula and we started with what the hospital provided us which was Similac.  Our daughter was very colicky and kept spitting up the formula.  My husband and I decided to go with an organic formula and since we have used Earth's Best for other things, we decided on this formula.  Once we switched her to this formula, she no longer had the stomach problems she was having with Similac.  She seemed to digest it much better.  We were sold...  This is a great product.  We have tried the Soy formula as well (we ran out and the store only carried the Soy formula).  It was terrific as well.  We find the soy formula tends to be more soluble than the dairy formula, but both have been great to our daughter!

review/summary: feel good about it
review/text: I believe in buying organic, since our children deserve the best, so this product was right for me. As far as, being better that other formulas - i simply cannot say. It worked well for my baby, who previously was very colicky, and we've tried Emfamil Newborn and SImilac Advance, Goodstart Protect and Good start Gentle. In comparison with Good Start, it does have just slightly less percentages on some of the ingredients; that might be the reason it is gentler on the stomach.  I got it at a great price, just about the price of the other formulas, so it was well worth it.

review/summary: BEST formula--too bad not offered as a subscribe and save!!!
review/text: When I stopped breast feeding, I did a lot of research on what formula is best for my baby....and I found EB!!!  I appreciate it not only being organic but also free of genetically modified ingredients!  I just wish Amazon offered the "bonus 20% more cans" as a subscribe and save item.  They (the pack of 4 bonus cans) are cheaper than the single, regular cans (which ARE eligible for subscribe and save) so I just have to remind myself to re-order when getting low.  Worth the savings, though!!!

review/summary: Great formula, bad size
review/text: My baby was entirely breastfed for the first 6 months. Then I needed to supplement with a formula. But he refused to drink anything except BF, he even lost weight. I tried Similac, Enfamil and Good start (Gerber). Nothing worked except for this one. This doesn't have the smell that the other formulas have and must taste good, or at least "closest to breast milk" (as they claim). My baby simply loves it.<br /><br />Only bad thing about this product is the size. They should have a smaller size available. Especially for those who wants to try it. Also, I'll be travelling with my baby soon, and wish they had a smaller size available for the flight.

review/summary: Earth's Best Infant Formula
review/text: I normally buy Earth's Best Soy Formula for my baby since she is somewhat sensitive to lactose, but I purchased the milk-based formula because Amazon sold it in the 20% More 4-pack.  I have not noticed any difference in my child since switching, and she couldn't seem to tell the difference either.  I use formula as a supplement to breast-feeding, so she only gets 1-2 bottles a day.  I'm willing to spend the extra money to buy organic formula from a company I can actually trust, especially when I can buy it in bulk, and she already drinks so little of it.

review/text: We have been very satisfied with this product. Initially we started with a different brand of formula and our baby struggled with constipation. However, she has not had problems with this formula. Ideally our baby would only get breastmilk, however she gets a mixture of breastmilk and formula. We feel alot better about giving her organic formula. The only complaint we have is it takes more muscle to mix-- using warm water helps alot! This is the best price we have found too! Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Really good formula for baby
review/text: I have been using it for 9 months on my baby girl and she has been doing very well with all aspects. Normal growth (a little bit ahead of chart) and no digestion problem or rash. The ingredients are not much different from other organic formulas but my baby just likes this one. We tried Baby's Only and Similac but my baby had problems digesting those (or light rash).<br /><br />This packaging of Earth's best is probably the most cost-effective organic formula out there and 2-day shipping is always free. This packaging is much cheaper compared with local Whole Foods store.<br /><br />The only thing we have to do a little extra is the powder doesn't dissolve fast, one has to stir it a little bit. And we don't mind doing that.
