review/summary: Like fruit juice without the sugar
review/text: I originally bought this tea from a well known retailer and loved it, but they are very expensive. This is a great price. I make the tea by the gallon and serve it iced. It tastes as good as fruit juice when I sweeten it with a little stevia, but is a much more healthy alternative to fruit juices which naturally contain lots of sugar. My husband even loves it and he is not much of a tea drinker like me, and recently my 3 year old started drinking it instead of juice. This tea is a staple in our house. I have purchased from culinary teas twice now and been very satisfied both times.

review/text: I really like this tea. I use it to brew for parties or dinners and it tends to give a nice flavor to the meal. Great for an afternoon ice cold glass of tea as well. I do drink it unsweetened as well as sweetened - tastes better sweetened (of course), but I like to skip the calories and the peach flavor makes it taste sweeter than it is - especially if you pour it over a lot of ice.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: If you like peach...and tea...this is a must-have!  I boiled water and steeped the tea for time recommended on box.  The whole house smelled like peach.  Made a simple syrup instead of adding straight sugar.  Poured tea into a sun tea jar~added simple syrup to taste~and ice.  Simply delicious!  Can set in sun and see what happens but this is flavorful as is.  Great unsweetened too.

review/summary: Yucky taste
review/text: The leaf in the bag and the overall packaging quality is good but no one in our family and group of friends likes the taste.<br /><br />Since it has all the other positive reviews, I've been subjecting people to it off and on since my July purchase trying to find at least one person to say it tastes good - with no luck.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like peaches to us; it has an off taste that makes our gang say yuck.  We like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea (usually decaf and usually made as sun tea). Some of us add sweetener; some of us don't. We like peaches both fresh and canned. For these reasons, I can't blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea.  Maybe the passion fruit in it someone else mentioned "isn't our cup of tea"?

review/text: This tea has a lovely flavor. Some green teas have an off flavor - not sure how to describe it, maybe a little bitter - but this one is nicely complemented by the peach and passion fruit.  The fruit flavor doesn't taste artificial and is not overwhelming. Almost reminds me of a Paradise passion fruit black tea I used to buy. I will definitely be ordering this again.

Plato, thank you for making such great products.

review/summary: Healthy and delicious!
review/text: My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic. This is low in protein and fat, so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike. My dogs go crazy over these. They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth. Amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price. Specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as Amazon does, so I suggest you buy them from Amazon. If you want a healthy treat, this is the way to go. :)

review/text: My dog refuses all vegetables, but he likes these treats.  Because the vegetables have been cooked and are dehydrated he should be able to get some nutrients out of them.  Dogs lack the enzymes to break down plants cell walls normally.  At first he hesitated to eat one, but I broke off a bit,and he decided they were good.  I also crumble two into his food each meal.  His fussy, meat-loving poodle pal also enjoys them--and no stomach upset.  Nice product.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Treats had mold on them
review/text: I have stocked our dogs' treat pantry with Plato's Farmers Market products for about a year. My dogs love their Salmon and Salmon with Vegetable treats. I recently purchased their Sweet Potato treats, which have a "Best by" date of 9-22-10. Shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white & blue mold. Unacceptable & disgusting. The bag's sticker has "X00133D6P" on it. I have bought Plato products many times previously and have been pleased, however, these are supposed to be safe and quality treats. I absolve the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet, of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue. However, I do firmly assert that Plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of Sweet Potato treats.

review/text: My two dogs love these.  I bought them along with the regular Plato chicken treats when I saw they were USA made.  The only reason I gave these four stars instead of five is that they are somewhat crumbly when you get them out of the bag. I assume it's due to the vegetable content so I'm not really complaining. It's great to find products that are not only good tasting, but good for them as well.

review/text: I have a dog with all kinds of allergies. She loves sweet potato treats and I love giving them to her because they're so healthy (the more I read about all the dangers of processed treats found in pet stores, the more resolute I am in my decision to never, ever feed her that garbage).<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is that they contain eggs and salt in addition to the natural sweet potato and probiotics. Eggs are a big no-no for any dog with food allergies, and salt is just something you shouldn't really be feeding your dog anyway. At least not in excessive quantities. These treats are a thousand times better than regular dog treats, but they didn't work for my dog.<br /><br />I've decided to stick to Snook's sweet potato treats. They're 100% dried sweet potato and nothing else - also made in the USA and my dog absolutely loves them.

review/summary: Natural Treats made in the USA
review/text: I will no longer buy anything made in China for my dogs. I searched for a treat for them and even the ones in places like Petco were made in China. I finally found a link to Plato's Farmer's Market and then to them being sold on Amazon. They are made here in the USA and all natural. My vet told me to feed my dogs sweet potatoes or pumpkin and these treats fit the bill. So I ordered them through Amazon. My dogs beg for these. I have now ordered them three times and will continue to do so.

review/text: Raisin Bran primarily is a snack to satisfy my sweet tooth and get more fiber in my diet. This is the best tasting raisin bran with nice big flakes that don't go soggy quickly and turn to mush. I wish there were more raisins and they were a little plumper. I still eat junk food, just not as much when I have reasonably priced organics as an option. I purchased this at a reduced price not sure I'd buy this at full price though even with the convenience of home delivery.

The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because it is made from wheat, which many people cannot eat.  I'm still looking for someone to come out with an organic raisin oat bran cereal.

review/text: I have eaten Raisin Bran 3 out of 4 days for the past 30 years. Yes, most people think I am boring. This is the only Raisin Bran I will eat these days. It has excellent taste. I order a case every two weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE (1/2009): it has been about a year since I have eaten this cereal on a weekly basis and I disenchanted with how hard the raisins are in many cases. I purchase organic raisins from Trader Joe's which I add in and the TJ raisins are noticeably software. I don't know if it is a factor of freshness of the raisins but that is my perception. I have canceled my subscriptions and will revisit them in the future.<br /><br />I would, if Amazon would let me, take away a star or two based on the raisins.

It doesn't take much, in as little as one innocent looking bag, your addiction can be formed. You'll find yourself in the middle of the day, thinking about the wonderful taste of the jerky and wishing you had more. The next thing you know, you'll be buying it and hiding it in your home, so family members don't invade your stash.  Once you start - you can never turn back! So use caution when making this purchase. So why am I here? To buy more of course!!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Texas Best or any of its partners. However, I am severely addicted to this product, so if they wish to send me compensation for this endorsement via payment with Texas Best Original Beef Jerky, I would be most appreciative!<br /><br />(And to my family members - I was only joking in regards to hiding jerky in the house. That would be a really silly thing to do...right?  So please don't look in the cupboard above the dishes.)

review/summary: best rice bound chicken kibble
review/text: this is the highest animal protein % rice bound kibble on the market.  It's low dust 3/8" round shape will work perfectly in any mechanical food dispenser.  I would argue that for cat consumption, whole grains is pointless for rice, and organic is pointless with chicken.  Diamond Naturals Dry gives your cat honest well balanced nutrition and cat health specific additives without all the high priced human diet marketing gimmicks and fancy packaging.  it arrived intact from Amazon in a non resealable thick mil plastic bag with a 9 month good till use date, so figure on needing a gallon volume container for every 3 pounds of this kibble.  Update: I just learned the budget well praised Chicken & Rice kibble that Costco sells under the Kirkland brand is also made by Diamond and is very similar to this food but with 30% protein instead of the 40% found here.  So for young to middle age active cats this 40% kibble may be worth the premium price - just try to keep them lean and muscular by not over feeding.

They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores, and each unit of four six-bar packages is sealed in heavy-duty plastic.  Delivery is prompt as well.  I agree with the "Leading consumer magazine" that rated these to be the best of all granola bars.  They have no cheap, unhealthy ingredients -- just stuff that tastes great and is good for us, barring allergies.

review/summary: Shockingly good - even if you're not a fan of granola bars
review/text: I discovered this bar quite by accident in the vending machine at work. Since it was a new addition, I knew it would be fresh (our machine vendor sometimes forgets packages have expiration dates!), and I gave it a whirl. I am not a fan of chocolate, or even sweets - but there are a few exceptions. I LOVE marzipan - so anything sweet with almonds is something I'm willing to try once. I will be having these again, let me tell you. These are thin and crunchy bars - and unlike many granola bars I've had over the years, it isn't overly flaky (ie, you are not wearing more of it than you eat of it) and it's neither bland or overly sweet... it's just right - and it tastes very fresh. I've had some other brands in which the texture is off-putting, or even though it's sealed and the date is current - there is something akin to a 'dusty' aftertaste. Not with this brand and flavor. I wouldn't say this is quite as awesome as marzipan, but for a granola bar, I've got to say it's the best one I've ever had in my life. Nature Valley - you have a new customer!

review/text: The whole family likes these the best of all the Nature Valley Granola Bars.  The roasted almond flavor tastes kind of like those almond cookies that you can get in Chinese restaurants.  Only drawback is that you need to buy 12 boxes at a time (that's a lot of granola bars)!

review/summary: some good  some bad
review/text: People who order this product directly from the manufacturer should know that the jars will be delivered wrapped in a mountain of bubble wrap; each jar individually and then some extra.  Here you are trying to be green and avoiding bisphenol and you get, of all things, bubble wrap in the era of water soluble puffed corn.  Even Amazon has figured out to use recyclable packing materials.  Next it took me 1/2 hour to pop all of them so they could fit into my trash and then break down the box.  And despite all of the wrapping precautions, one of the five jars delivered, opened in transit with sauce spilling out.  Come on Eden!  You can and should be doing better than this.<br />The good news is the sauce is tasty and probably really BPA free.

They are crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These rolls are somewhat thinner than the average submarine roll, but they work just fine for most sandwiches I would make.  I used these for some delicious lobster rolls!<br /><br />PRICE<br />For gluten-free bread, these rolls are not even outrageously priced!

review/summary: excellent baguettes
review/text: Bar none, these baguettes are the best and the sub buns.  They taste normal and I attribute it to the tiny bit of sourdough in the ingredients - this is not found in their other breads which I don't care for as much.  The sourdough makes all the difference.  You have to finish baking these in the oven for 5 minutes and it's worth it.  I use these for hot subs, cold subs, garlic bread, bruscetta, french dips, philly cheese steak etc.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Picky Papillons Love It
review/text: My Papillons (ages 8 and 9) have been the pickiest damn dogs I have ever met.  You know when the vet says "they will eat eventually, they won't starve"?  Well, no.  These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price. I mean, it's dog food, they all look the same. But. it's. awesome. I started off by mixing in a spoon full of it into their regular food, and for the first time ever my dogs were cleaning their plates. its got chunks of real vegetables in it, and in combination with the dried food (also Halo, I mix the salmon with the lamb) my dogs are eating like kings and queens: 3 types of meat, 15 types of veggies & fruits...wow.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this brand. I have switched over EVERYTHING, their treats, their dry food and their wet food.if halo comes out with a flavored water supplement for dogs, I'll probably buy that too. its just a great brand, reliable, and with a conscience.

review/summary: Only dog food I will use
review/text: After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions.

review/text: I wanted this wonderful food to work for Sheldon, but even a teaspoon added to his lamb and rice kibble gave us not so good results.  I wonder if he is just too little to try it...he is 4 months old.  Anyway, we may try it again when he is older because it seems like such a good quality food and that is what we strive to feed him.  I do have to say I was surprised when I opened the can.  I was expecting a chunky stew type food but it isn't.  It is a course puree with chunks of vegetable in it and that was fine with me too.  Also, he loved it!  If only it would have loved him back.

review/summary: Great Sweetener but learn about the product
review/text: I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.

review/summary: This is a great product - (Dog owners be careful)
review/text: Great product, great company.  High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone...".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).  Wow.<br /><br />I'm sticking with NOW Foods at this point.
