review/summary: Pretty Hot, Only For The Experienced.
review/text: I've been a fan of Dave's Insanity sauce for several years and decided to try the salsa.<br /><br />It does have a consistency more of a taco sauce than salsa.<br /><br />If you've had Dave's Insanity Sauce or Ghost Pepper Sauce, you know the heat level you're in for. Insane +++. If you aren't familiar with Dave's Gourmet products than I would advise working your way up so you can at least eat habanero peppers without issue, as this is several steps up from those.... or at least get the sauce and try a half-teaspoon at a time/per dish until your mind is acclimated.<br /><br />Very good. Great flavor. Tastes like they put 3/4 salsa in it and 1/4 DIS.<br /><br />Highly recommended, although your first try at it I'd recommend on a day where you have the next day off (IE intestinal turbulence + horrid gas).<br /><br />I love it but anticipate it'll take a few months to go through a jar.

review/summary: This stuff in awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I am a person who loves her "Hot" hot sauce!!! And let me tell you, I respect this salsa!!!!! You only need a couple of drops of this stuff and you get that wonderful burn on anything you put it on. You can add it to hot wing sauce and get a smokin' hot flavor. Just add about a half of a teaspoon to a jar of Hooters sauce and you got the best hot wings around. If you put too much on something, it will burn the tastebuds off and then you can't taste nothing but hot. I love this salsa!!!! It's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Hot? Yes... Tasty? Yes... Insane? No
review/text: I received this salsa today. Based on the reviews, I was hoping for something I could barely eat (i am a heat freak, what can I say). This salsa is good, it has great flavor and packs some good heat but to call it insane is a bit of an over statement. Another reviewer mentioned it would take a few months to eat a whole 12oz jar, I bet I go through this stuff in less the 2 weeks. Don't get me wrong this stuff is hot, if you are not used too hot stuff this will probably send you running for the hills. However for someone like me its just hot, not super hot and certainly not "insane". I have had some ghost pepper chili that made me almost hallucinate (im not kidding). That is what I was expecting from this salsa. I ate 6-8 tortilla chips that were fully coated with this salsa and sucked em down without even something to drink. Again, I dont want to come down on this salsa because it is good, I just want those true chili heads out there to know that its not insane compared to our standards.<br /><br />Enjoy it, its tasty, just not insane.

review/text: Remember the days when gum tasted good and wasn't full of flavoring that tasted like medicine, the flavor was long lasting, it didn't get hard as a rock to chew, and was the best ever to crack on the back of your teeth.... then you must buy Black Jack! This summer my neighborhood Walgreen's was selling this gum along with Clove and Beemans (two other nostalgic flavors). I kept buying pack after pack of Black Jack, which was getting expensive. Then, I wondered if I could find more than one pack at a price that was economical. I searched the web and Amazon has the best price so far. So now I am buying the 20 pack. Black Jack is the only gum I chew. Now if only someone started manufacturing Chum Gum again, I would be in gum heaven.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Not too long ago I picked up a 20-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature whole dried blueberries at my local warehouse club store. I like to have things of this kind around the house. They make an excellent healthy snack and I can carry little packets of them with my lunch. Plus, I like to take them along on camping trips where fresh fruit is hard to maintain. Also, these come in a resealable packet to help keep insects out between uses.<br /><br />These dried blueberries are excellent. They're somewhat chewy and granular and the experience of eating is much the same as eating raisons. However, the flavor is that of delicious nicely-ripened blueberries. In fact, the flavor is stronger than the flavor of fresh blueberries, which I also sometimes buy. It must be that the drying out process concentrates both the flavor and the sweetness, although I notice  sugar on the list of ingredients. In any case, they're quite an excellent dried fruit and provide a good antioxidant and fiber content. Yum! The cost is somewhat high, but have you ever checked out the cost of fresh blueberries?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I thought I was getting a bargain compared to Whole Foods or my local grocery store's over-priced tiny packages.<br />They did not seem dried so much as "preserved". Almost full sized and plump as opposed to the almost currant-like dried blueberries I am used to. the texture was weird, flavor almost non existent and sugar content seemed very high. My second reaction after eating some on the way home was "never again". Kirkland also seemed very free with whatever oil they used to keep them from "clumping".<br />Order any other brand on line, put up with a few days delay, Costco doesnt "cut it".

review/summary: The dog seems to love it
review/text: I have a dog who is a very picky eater. I'd been giving her homecooked meals for about three weeks, but the vet said that I should get her something more nutritionally balanced and more geared towards canines. I got this one because it looked like it had good ingredients (i.e. the first ingredient isn't corn meal) and it was a reasonable price. Normally, my dog won't eat dry food for nearly two days (no joke) after she's had homecooked and/or wet food. To my pleasant surprise, she started eating the food within 24 hours. She's been on it for a couple of weeks now and she doesn't seem tired of it.

review/summary: Cured the runs!
review/text: My 8 year old female Beagle has always had off-and-on runny stools for the six months or so that I had her. She was on Iams, but even that didn't help her digestion. I saw this stuff on Amazon for a reasonable price, and bought a 50 pound bag. I packaged the 50 pounds into gallon zipper bags so that it would stay fresh, and kept some in an airtight plastic container to scoop out of.<br /><br />Although it's recommended to slowly ease your dog from their old food to this stuff over the course of ten days, I discovered that it only took five days for my dog.....it would have probably been less but I was determined to follow try to the rules and dilute this with her old food. I suspect I could have just switched her over without a transition period, because as soon as she was getting just this food, her runny stools stopped. Since then, she's been very regular and the results have been firm, never runny. (I'd still follow the guidelines for your own dog)<br /><br />I can't attest that this food has made her coat shinier, or trimmed her weight very much (not that she needs it; she's a healthy weight for an 8 year old, spayed, female Beagle), but it definitely helped her digestion a lot.

review/text: Product:  I have purchased three bags of this product for my 3-year-old Cane Corso (Adopted).  He loves the food; I love its nutritional value and the result on his coat and energy level.<br /><br />Shipping:  Until last month, the product was received in perfect condition.  Then, last month it was quite the opposite.  The outer box and the bag of food, itself, were broken and torn.  Most of the food was spilled over the inside of the box.  It was a mess.  I could not find where to advise the sender (although I sent a quiry to Amzazon) of the problem. . . . .Nonetheless I am ordering another bag this month -- which is a high tribute to the product.  If the package is broken again, it will be my last order. . . . .It's just not a nuisance to me; it's a possible safety hazard to my dog.

review/text: Wheat-free, baby, and so much cheaper than my local pet store's wheat-free kibbles! The kibble's usually the "boring" staple, but this one my dogs dance for when I'm filling their bowls! I get the large-size bites now, but before Castor made the difference sizes, this worked fine. The vegetables are visible, it's actually pretty kibble, go figure! I still give them fresh veggies, especially carrots to keep the cataracts away (my dogs are getting old), but I like knowing they're getting veggies when I'm out of carrots and broccoli. Very digestible, easy pick-up after.

review/summary: Dog Seems Healthier, Happier
review/text: I recently switched my two-year-old 55-lb beagle/lab mutt to Ultramix from Blue Buffalo, which he had been eating for the last year. He didn't necessarily have a problem with the BB food, but every now and then he had an upset stomach, would throw up, etc. for no apparent reason, so I decided to try something new. After about a month since switching to the Ultramix, I truly believe he looks and acts healthier. His coat seems much more sleek and shiny, he hasn't thrown up once and he cut his poop schedule down to 2 a day from 3, which i've read means he's getting more nutritional value out of his food. Also, while he's always excited to eat anything, you'd think I was giving him a t-bone steak whenever we feed him the Ultramix - he really goes nuts for it. The little fruit pieces seem kind of gimmicky - but overall I feel like this is a great quality food that has truly made a difference in my dog. When I originally went to buy him new food a year ago, I went in with castor and pollux in mind after reading some great reviews about it online but the saleswoman in the petco convinced me to try blue buffalo -- wish I had gone with my original plan the whole time!

Not only does she love it, but it has been the only dog food that she has been able to eat without having some sort of reaction to it. She was fine while she was eating puppy food, but once we started gradually moving her up to adult food, she started having all sorts of reactions. Even with tests from our vet, the process of finding her a good dog food that she could eat became a horrible trial and error process. We went to every extreme and started losing hope and then we found this product!!! Once it became obvious that she could eat it without any sort of reaction, we switched our little dog over to it too, and she's crazy about the banana chips and little dried peas.<br /><br />And I love that I can subscribe and save with this because it's a good deal and saves me the hassle of getting out to the pet store and hoping that they have a deal running while I'm there!

After trying many (even more expensive,) organic brands, I'm quite satisfied with Castor & Pollux' Ultramix Adult Canine Formula; and my two miniature dachshunds like it.  The mix comes with banana chips and dried carrots, and mi dogs enjoy the veggies for the most part, except that one of the them separates the carrots from his food all the time.  Just like any kid, he doesn't like carrots!  But sometimes I add a sauce or something else to the food and voila! problem solved!  I used to buy it at Whole Foods but found it $10 less at Amazon.  So, it's a win, win for me.

review/summary: Wish we could love this food.
review/text: I have three dogs a ten year old Mini Dachshund, a 1.5 year old boxer, and a one year old hound mix.  I wanted to LOVE this food because of all the great reviews and how healthy it seemed.  I loved that it had bits and pieces of peas, carrots, bananas.  My dogs seemed to really enjoy the food and ate a lot of it, BUT... my boxer developed TERRIBLE smelling gas.  I mean, enough to clear the room.  Some nights I had to sleep in my daughter's room because it was so bad it would wake me up from a dead sleep.  My dachshund started to develop really bad breath, which can be common in small dogs as they get older, but her breath had no smell before being on this food.  My hound mix's hair started to thin and fall out around the base of her tail.  It just seemed too coincidental to start having problems with all three of my dogs after starting this food.<br /><br />So we switched back to Eukanuba Adult dog food after trying out the C&P Ultramix for about three or for months and ALL of the problems have disappeared.  Well, the dachshund's breath is still a little funny but NO WHERE near as bad as it was.  The boxer still has gas, but it is back to the point to where I only hear it... I don't smell it.  And my hound mix's hair looks good again.<br /><br />Do I think this food is terrible?  No, it seems to work for a lot of people and their dogs.  It just didn't work for us.  I wish it did.  The auto delivery option was so convenient, great service.  It just wasn't for my dogs, I guess.

When not one, not two, but all 3 of my dogs turned their noses up at the first bag ordered through Amazon.com. I almost cancelled the auto-order. Thinking it may have been a single stale bag or similar, I didn't stop the second auto order. I will begin feeding them from that bag this evening. Review to follow.

review/summary: Great tasting protein snack? Impossible!
review/text: I'm on a diet plan that encourages me to "keep the furnace burning", so I end up snacking twice a day between my three meals. These cookies really taste great, and they also hold me over until my next meal.<br /><br />If there was anything I can compare them to, they're kinda like...sophisticated capt'n crunch. They're light and crispy, with a sort of almond butter in the middle. It's not a formal cookie shape. It's more like eating a large handful of cereal for a snack. The Honey-flavored variety tastes much better though.<br /><br />As a bonus, you don't get that nasty protein aftertaste, or the weird chewy textures.<br /><br />I am stoked to find this snack on amazon. FYI, Kay's Naturals also have "protein chips" that are quite good as well. If you're on a diet, and crave Doritos, aim for the chili flavors. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E243R0">Kay's Naturals Protein Chips, Chili Nacho Cheese, 1.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />UPDATE: THE BATCH I RECEIVED WAS STALE, AND BROKEN IN PIECES. I've had "good batches" of this cookie before, so it still is a great snack. I've emailed the distributor to inform them of the bad batch. It could be that Kay's decided to package up the "bottom of the barrel" so to speak, and that's what I ended up with.

review/summary: Jelly Belly Overload!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Jelly Belly jelly beans, so I really enjoyed this gift box of 50 different kinds!  My favorite is definitely tangerine - but it's always a treat to try new and different flavors.  This box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which, so you can avoid the ones you dislike (for me - peanut butter jelly beans.. gag!).  It's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price - Jelly Bellies have never been cheap!  It's well worth the cost though, and a GREAT gift this year for Christmas!

review/text: I bought both the 50 Flavor Gift Box and the Bean Blast Basket for corporate Christmas gifts. The Basket was much more expensive and didn't have nearly the wow value of this 50 Flavor Gift Box. It's shaped like a Monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift. It's also reasonably priced at around $15. Of course, the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves.<br /><br />This is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself.

review/summary: Jelly Belly is the BEST out there!
review/text: Jelly Belly really does have true-to-life flavors! EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR in that box tastes exactly like what it should. A little pamphlet comes inside the Jelly Belly box, which tells you what different jelly beans you can mix to create a certain food. For example, 2 peanut butter jelly beans + 1 jam jelly bean = peanut butter jelly sandwich. It has a lot of fun combinations and surprisingly, they all taste like the foods that they should!<br /><br />This is really a great gift. Everyone I've given it to can't stop talking about how real these flavors taste, and the kids have lots of fun looking at the pamphlet and mixing the jelly beans to create foods!

review/text: This Jelly Belly box is a fun twist on the theme, and makes a great gift.  My father enjoyed following "recipes" on the back to make new flavors (e.g. blueberry + butter = blueberry muffin). Since each flavor is sorted into its own compartment, it's easy to figure out which you like the most.  This is not a large volume of beans, but it's a well designed package.

I do not like black licorice so that got thrown out. I have to order more, but did bribed my grandchildren with this treat.  Liquor is quicker but candy is sweeter.  The downside is that I lost a large portion of my old filling. But will order more and maybe sugar-free.

review/summary: Good Stuff but...
review/text: We rececived our 50 flavor jelly bellies this week and boy do they taste good. The reason for this has to be because they use natural ingredients to create the flavors. My favorite is Tutti Fruiti (tastes like bazooka bubble gum - go figure). My wife's favorite is root beer. The soda pop flavors are good. My only complaint is the beans arrived all mixed up... is this the shipper's fault - I don't know.<br /><br />So when I saw the flavors scattered across the bins instead of being in each individual compartment I groaned. I even attempted to sort the beans - but gave up after 20 minutes. However, my wife who is much more patient than me spent over an hour to sort the beans and came up with every flavor in the correct compartment except for Jalopeno and Green Apple - which have the same coloring. So watch out when you grab a Green Apple. Otherwise this is a good buy.<br /><br />In conclusion - This comes with a menu for mixing flavors and the kids love them too...

review/text: The box was packaged nicely, not mixed up like other people have commented, and I was really excited for this. I watched the package's tracking info like a hawk. Anyway when i opened it up it looked normal but they were all stale, so I gave them to my little cousins who usually love jelly beans, but they threw them at me in disgust. How do I complain to amazon? Everyone has tasted jelly bellies and knows they are great. Its not a matter of quality, I think i just got a bad box. Do i return it? Probably not because tons of jelly beans are missing, the box had been opened, and its a "food". What do i do because i am not happy.

review/summary: Jelly Bellies don't knock my socks off
review/text: The best thing about jelly bellies is that they seem to be using higher quality ingredients than other American manufacturers but I remember when jelly beans didn't have to be gourmet to taste good.  I bought a 7 oz. bag of 30 flavors from Target and I find that bag to be too much for me but I would have bought the full 50 flavor assortment if Target had sold it because of the organization and identification of flavors.  I wasn't supposed to get cantaloup in my 30 flavor bag but I did get one and that flavor was so much better than tangerine.  I also liked the root beer.  The popcorn flavor was interestingly reminiscent of artificially fragrant movie theatre popcorn.  The jelly belly flavors are interesting but I prefer the lightly flavored pastel jelly beans available during Easter.  I believe they are manufacturered by Brachs.  They are gentler tasting than jelly bellies.

review/text: Proper marmalade the way it used to be - this it the type of preserves you'd make yourself if you had access to bitter oranges and about 6 hours' time. Not too cloyingly sweet like most American marmalade, and not bitter, just right, with interesting shreds of orange in it. Bliss spread on thick handmade Italian bread with fresh sweet butter, but also a good glaze for a pork roast, dabbed on wholegrain crackers with goat cheese, and a superb addition to cranberries in a cranberry-orange relish. (And a secret ingredient in Cosmos- use 1/4 teaspoon!)

The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!
