review/summary: Not natural, sweetened with Splenda(Sucralose)
review/text: I liked it -- You can't really make out that there is any honey in this product taste wise (flavor) -- Whole foods and even Walmart have Stevia sweetened drinks that taste pretty good and are all natural, I prefer those as a koolaid substitute for my kids.  Definitely reminds you of KoolAid.  Its extremely sweet, but does have a tart pom feel to it.  But I have to admit, I like and and it gets me to drink more fluids.  I think you could ideally mix with 24 oz and not 16 oz as recommended on the package since its pretty sweet.  Has a lot of coloring but seems like natural color.

review/summary: One of the best I've tasted!
review/text: When I saw the flavor Mango Pineapple, I had to try this. These are the small packages that you can take on the go and mix in water bottles; the 16-ounce bottles of water is what is recommended. I'm on a plan that was set up by my Nutritionist and in this plan, sugar is a big no-no. This drink is perfect because it has an artificial sweetner in, that's close to splenda, and there's no aftertaste. For a drink with artificial sweetner, the taste is great! This is a real good sweet tea substitute and I'm glad that I decided to try it.

review/text: This sugar-free berry-flavored ice tea has a refreshing taste.  With separate powder packages intended for single servings, this is a product that's perfect for use at the office or on travel.  My only complaint is that the amount of power seems excessive for a sincle serving, making it difficult to dissolve the entire packet even in a pint-sized glass and leaving unwanted residue in the glass.

review/summary: Reasonable alternative to sugary drinks
review/text: This is not the ideal or the most nutritious of drinks, but if it stops you from drinking sugary drinks, then it is definitely an alternative to consider.<br /><br />The taste is mostly strawberryish in a Kool Aid kind of way. I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.<br /><br />Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink. If you find it too rich, you can always increase the amount of water or use one packet to make drinks for multiple people.<br /><br />One packet has 10 calories, all sugars. There is no other nutritional value on the label.<br /><br />If you are cautious about artificial sweeteners, this one has sucralose.<br /><br />The green tea is decaf, and indeed I did not feel a caffeine kick.<br /><br />The outside box is nice and colorful, but the drink definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />The bottom of the outside box and the individual packets show an expiration date, but it is not written in a straightforward fashion from a consumer's perspective.<br /><br />The overall rating is closer to 3.5 stars out of five, but closer to a 4 than a 3. It gets bonus points for reasonable taste and convenience, but sucralose brings it down.

review/summary: Beware Advertising!
review/text: I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product.

review/summary: Terrible! Chemical sweetener, not just honey.
review/text: Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state "Artificial Sweetener" and or "Diet" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?

review/summary: Could be OK if not for the artificial sweetener and flavors
review/text: The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says "Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors." I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is.

review/summary: Very artificial
review/text: I was so excited to get this through the Vine program as it sounded delicious.  I love nearly all drinks that contain blackberry or pomegranate so I thought this would be a home run.  What a disappointment!  I cannot even describe the taste aside from to say it is very artificial.  The clean crisp natural taste that was expected never occurred throughout the two packages that I drank.  The smell was even artificial.  In fact when I first smelled it, I nearly dumped it down the drain.  It also took some time and a lot of shaking for all of the particles to dissolve into the water.  I did not enjoy this product and will probably not buy or even finish the remaining in the package that I have.

I personally do not like consuming artificial sweeteners and I think it is ridiculous that this company is trying to mislead consumers.

By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.

review/text: The predominant flavor of this drink mix is blackberry with a hint of pomegranate.  I enjoyed this drink mix.  But I would have to say that the mango pineapple version of this is slightly better.  The sticks/packets are  also very convenient.  Each packet is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  These are good for quick, on-the- go drinks.

review/summary: real sugar AND fake sugar - the worst of both worlds
review/text: Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise.

review/text: I liked the flavor of this product.  It was fruity and a bit tart.  It doesn't really taste like "iced tea".  I know the green tea flavor is more mild, so if you are looking for an iced tea tasting beverage this isn't it.<br /><br />The serving size is half a packet to 8 ounces of water, so really what you are looking at is one packet to a normal sized water bottle (16.9 ounces) which puts it at 10 calories vs. 5.<br /><br />The product boasts "No aspartame" but it does contain sucralose, so it still has that artificial sweetner taste.  That doesn't bother me at all, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I found it dissolved quickly in the water and I wasn't dealing with undiluted chunks.<br /><br />This won't become my new beverage of choice or anything, but it's tasty and easy.

review/summary: Refreshing and Tasty
review/text: I've had a number of instant drink packet mixes in the past from various vendors.  This, Lipton Iced Green Tea mix, is similar in the fact that it comes in a box of 10 packets, each ready to mix into a 16.9 oz. bottle of water or a like-sized glass of water.  I used it in a glass, stirring with a spoon, and it dissolved quickly for me.  I found it to be quite strong even with added ice, and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste. I thought the flavor was good.  I could taste the honey, blackberry, and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet, and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie. Still, I enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, a serving is only 8 ounces, though you mix each packet in a 16~oz. bottle of water.  I can't imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is, other than to qualify the "5 calories per serving" claim on the front of the box.  Would 10 calories a serving be a deal breaker for most people?<br /><br />There are no other noted nutrition values besides 1 gram of sugar and 10 mg of caffeine per serving.  It states that each 8 ounce serving contains 60 milligrams of flavonoids, which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice.  From an internet reference, "Flavonoids have antioxidant activity. Flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects. Tea flavonoids have many health benefits. Tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides."<br /><br />To summarize, I enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again.  It is convenient, tasty, and provides a few health benefits.

review/summary: Convenient packaging and good flavor
review/text: I'm an iced tea lover, and I enjoy most varieties, including green tea.  I tend to prefer plain/lemon teas to other fruit types, however, but I still decided to give this product a try, as I liked the idea that the tea is sweetened only with honey (i.e., no artificial sweeteners).  According to the packaging, each 8 oz. serving has 5 calories and 10 m.g. of caffeine.<br /><br />I really love the convenience of the little individual packets!  They are easy to tear open, and you could toss one in your bag/purse or bring them to work (which is what I did).  The dry crystals dissolve nicely in water.  For my own tastes, the tea was a bit too fruity--although it didn't taste like fruit punch (which is what I don't like about some fruit-flavored teas), you can definitely taste both the berry and pomegranate flavors.  However, I could also discern a tea taste as well as a touch of honey.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product, and I would definitely recommended it to those who enjoy fruit teas.

review/summary: Sweet Strawberry drink without all the calories and sugar
review/text: I tried this Strawberry Acai Decaf Green Tea Mix along with my two daughters ages 10 & 12. My 10 year old didn't care for it, on the other hand, my 12 year old liked it and said it tastes like liquid strawberry jello. A serving size is 1/2 a packet and 8 oz of water, only 5 calories, and 1 gram of sugar. It is sweetened with honey and also sucralose. It is perfect for the 16.9 oz water bottles which would be double the serving if you are counting calories but still only 10 calories and 2 g of sugar. It does say it's Decaf Iced Green Tea, strawberry acai flavored. I don't taste any iced tea at all, if you like strawberry flavored drinks then you'd probably like it, because strawberry is definitely the only flavor you taste. It's great drink for kids being so low calorie and so low in sugar as compared to the usual juices for kids and the packets are also very easy to open. I only gave it 3 stars because for me it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for, I wanted to be able to taste the iced tea. I would try a different flavor or maybe just the plain iced tea.

review/summary: Delicious flavor, contains sucralose
review/text: I was curious to try this, as the "Honey" part caught my eye. I have tried the previous edition that had the aspartame, and it had a strange aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. I like to have little packets like this to keep in my purse or in the car though, and the flavor sounded pretty good.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I read the box. I wanted to see what the ingredient list was. And so I must say, if you're looking for something with no artificial sweetener at all - BEWARE. This does not have aspartame, but it DOES have sucralose (otherwise known as SPLENDA). I was a bit disappointed when I read that, as I was hoping it was just honey as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I went ahead and made some - I even measured out the 16.9oz so that my initial taste-test could be as accurate as possible. I smelled the packet when I first opened and could definitely smell the mango. The pineapple was less pronounced. Then I the water in a glass container with a lid (I wanted to see how well it dissolved). One good shake and I could still see some bits (probably the honey) floating around. Two more really good shakes and other than a small bit in the bottom, it was all dissolved. I opened the lid of the container and took another smell - again, very strong mango, with a bit of pineapple. It smelled really good. As for the taste - it lives up to the smell. I really like it. I don't get any aftertaste from the sucralose, and the fruit flavors are not too strong. It's not overly sweet, though that is individual taste and can be easily fixed by adding a bit more water.<br /><br />Overall, despite my disappointment with the addition of sucralose (which is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5), I would happily buy this. It tastes delicious, can be adjusted for taste, dissolves easily, and is convenient to carry around.

review/summary: Don't be fooled
review/text: There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises "Iced Green Tea" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got "no aspartame"--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this "tea mix," a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness ("natural flavors," "made with real ingredients," "tea & honey," "real fruit flavors") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: "sweetened with honey." Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as "Honey granules (sugar, honey)," which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton.

review/summary: Not only sweetened with honey
review/text: If you are thinking this ice tea is sweetened with honey only don't buy it.  Yes, it has honey as a sweetener but it's "honey granules (sugar, honey.)" As well, other sweeteners are sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt.  These ingredients are not disclosed in the description but they are on the package.  I have no idea how it tastes because I didn't taste it; my preference is not to ingest chemical sweeteners or sugar.  In addition, one 8-ounce serving has 10 mg caffeine; one packet is two servings.<br /><br />I'm only giving this product 1-star because of  lack of disclosure.  When I read the description in the Vine Newsletter I was under the impression this product was sweetened with honey only. This is not the case.  If you don't mind sugar or chemical sweeteners then I suggest you read other reviews about flavor.

review/text: Ok, so I don't normally use strong language but after receiving a free sample of Lipton Mango Pineapple Iced Green Tea Mix I couldn't spit far enough.  Sweetened with honey?  Right. Read the fine print. This is a cocktail of artificial and "natural flavor", stuff that should never be in a fine brew. It leaves an after taste that just won't go away and to put it nicely, well . . I can't put it nicely. Awful awful stuff! This one doesn't deserve a rating.

review/text: I got this on a gold box deal.  The deal was twelve boxes with ten mixes in each box. That adds up to 120 mixes for the whole order.  The directions say to mix one individual packet to a one liter bottle of water.  I found that it was too sweet for my taste.  I mix one packet in an empty one quart power drink bottle and I find this palletable to my tastes.I enjoy the flavor so I mix several quart bottles and partially freeze them and have plenty of water bottles to drink while I work outdoors in this heat and keep me hydrated all day long. They also had a coupon for $3.00 off the order.  I ended up paying $12.00 that makes me 120 quarts of this drink mix.  To me, that is a bargain.  I hope others got this incredible bargain.

review/summary: Convenient way to add variety
review/text: I bought the "Black Currant Raspberry Black Tea" flavor and like it. The primary flavor is the fruit, but you can also taste the black tea under it. I saw some people complaining about not enough tea flavor in the green tea based flavors, but I think the problem is just that green tea naturally has a light flavor. Since this one uses a black tea, it is not a problem.<br />I also tried the "Blackberry Pomegranate Green Tea." I don't mind the flavor, but it is much more like Koolaid, with a very strong sweet pomegranate flavor and little tea flavor.

review/summary: Taste so good! (Pineapple Mango Review)
review/text: I love the Mango Pineapple Stix! It's a great balance between a sweet tea and juice (tastes great with vodka too). I was suprised by how many were here too! There is a ton of these little stix. The taste is refreshing, my new favorite summer drink.<br /><br />Only complaints that do not give this a 5 star (not the taste, but the packaging:<br />1) There are literally 12 packs of 10 stix, lots of cardboard and wasted packaging. You'd think they'd be a bit more efficient and have them all in once box.<br />2) The tear to open each stix sometimes rips all the way down the packaging, getting powder everywhere. The first time I opened these, powder got everywhere. Crystal Light packets open across the top horizontally. These have the slit vertically, it's not good. Beware.<br /><br />Even with the horrible packaging, I love these and will be buying more!

review/summary: Lipton To Go Tastes Great and Is Convenient
review/text: I got a sample of the Mango/Pineapple flavored tea and really liked it a lot so I now buy this product regularly in the grocery store.  I am on the go a lot and like to keep a cooler of ice with bottled water in it in the back seat. Plain old water is just boring after a while. I do carry a bottle of home brewed iced tea with me but still I like to use the little to-go stix of all sorts from different companies and this is a very nice addition to my options.  I really liked the Mango one so I tried the blackberry/pomegranate one and liked it less. My favorites are the mango, peach, and strawberry ones.<br /><br />As a diabetic, I like to watch the calories and carbs and this is a refreshing way to flavor water without a lot of sugar. It is quite convenient to carry along to flavor water and tastes fruity. If you are avoiding sugary drinks , this is a good choice. Kids also love this and it is nice if you are having a fast food lunch with kids to carry along a cooler of ice with bottles of water and add their choice of Lipton To Go Stix to the water instead of buying tooth-rotting sugary sodas at restaurants. There is only one gram of carbs and it has 10% of your Vitamin A requirements (at least the Mango Pineapple one does). It is made with real green tea leaves instead of just artificial flavoring and green tea has health benefits.<br /><br />I recommend this product.

review/text: While attempting to avoid aspartame flavored drinks I found the Lipton Tea with Honey in the Blackberry Pomegrante flavor.  It tastes good, although it can be a bit too sweet.  Instead of adding one package to 8 ounces of water I add it to 16 which makes it better.  The first ingredient is Honey Granules which is a combination of honey and sugar, and several ingredients later is Sucralose.  While I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners all together I do not mind Sucralose (generic for Splenda) as much as I dislike aspartame.<br /><br />It also has 60 mg of flavanoids per serving.  All in all I would recommend this product.

review/summary: + � *: OK Overall
review/text: As someone who drinks green tea every day at work, I thought this would be a good selection. It seemed to have everything I like: green tea, mango, honey. It does, but unfortunately, it also includes some non-desirables. For me, Sucralose is an unproven benefit and I generally avoid it if possible.<br /><br />It is too bad Lipton adds it to this tea. It over-sweetens the tea and adds the undesirable ingredient. I am used to the slightly bitter green tea taste and think covering it up takes away from the overall appeal. I would prefer a little more honey instead, but even then, I think unsweetened green tea is sellable as is. The mango flavor is about right, while I did not detect much, if any, pineapple flavor.<br /><br />Half a sachet is sufficient flavoring for a pint of water. Adding the entire sachet is excessive for my taste.

review/text: Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.<br /><br />If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:<br /><br />1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.<br /><br />2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?<br /><br />I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.<br /><br />Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real.

review/summary: Almost as Delicious as a Mango Margarita, with a Bit of a Tart Taste
review/text: Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple offers a fresh-tasting sweet tea that registers only five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product comes in a small box, packed in ten handy flutes.  It is, the manufacturer states, made from real tea leaves and contains 60 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with honey, and real fruit flavors.  It is, as well, easy to prepare.  You can add a packet to one bottle (16.9 fl. oz. of water), or half a packet to an eight ounce glass of water: just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  It's obviously a handy thing to keep on hand for the office, the gym, the backpack, or anywhere you are on the go.  I've found it a handy pick-me-up when I am hot, thirsty, and tired.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love mango Margaritas, figure somebody snuck that recipe out of paradise.  The pineapple taste here does add a bit of tartness, too.  However, in the list of ingredients I find sucralose and corn maltodextrin as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  (Of course, I've no idea what might be in the mango margarita mix that bars use, so..)  I'm not a dietitian, just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.

review/text: "Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai" is a pretty good low calorie drink. It has a very strong strawberry taste. I do not notice any hint of honey or green tea though. The strawberry flavor pretty much overpowers everything else. Although the strawberry flavoring is natural, it does taste similar to artificial flavored drinks such as Kool-Ade. It also does have a moderate aftertaste. It's not as bad as some other sugar free soft drinks, but it is noticeable. I also find the drink tastes better if you add more than the recommended amount of water. If you like drinking sugar free soft drinks such as Diet Snapple, etc., you'll probably like "Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai". If you're not a fan of diet drinks, you probably won't due to its aftertaste.

review/summary: Mango Pineapple Honey Green Tea
review/text: I usually drink Crystal Light and my favorites tend to be the simple flavors. This was neither and that was good.<br /><br />First off, it is 10 calories per packet - it says 5 calories per 8oz serving size but there are 2 servings per packet and it is intended for a regular 16.9 fluid oz bottle of water and I really dislike when marketing tries to get all tricky like that.<br /><br />Adding the dry contents of the packet to my bottle of water I was initially worried because it was taking longer to dissolve than I was used to with the Crystal Light packets and I was worried I was going to have little gritty stuff at the bottom of my bottle - Didn't happen.  All the "grit" dissolved perfectly - it just took a minute longer.<br /><br />The taste initially was too sweet and I got immediately the taste of pineapple and mango (I had just sipped the plain water though and almost anything after plain water is too sweet).  My second and third sips were much more to my liking.  I still got the mango and pineapple sweetness right away but the taste after that was more mellow with the hints of honey and green tea.  I normally don't like green tea but the sweetness of the pineapple and mango and honey really lessened the bitter taste I sometimes get with green tea.<br /><br />All in all I really liked the smooth taste of it.

review/text: If you're a fan of Green Tea flavored with Honey, then you'll love the new single serving Lipton To Go Stix mixes.  I sampled the Blackberry Pomegranate variety and found it very pleasing.  The Blackberry flavoring comes through as the "top note", but then quickly yields to the iced tea and honey "bottom note".  The effect is refreshing and stimulating.  I appreciated the fact that it is low calorie (5 per serving), and the idea that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than aspartame (the latter sometimes gives me a slight headache).  Overall, I much prefer fresh-brewed iced tea to the instant variety, but when you're on the run and want a convenient and tasty alternative, this is a great choice.  Highly Recommended.

review/summary: Liked...
review/text: Mixed it up and had a glass. Liked the flavor as did some of my family members, but I'm really not fond of the sucralose in it, hence the reason for only 4 stars. I was under the impression that it was sweetened with honey and that turned out to be only partially true.

review/summary: Great taste, very sweet, but hard to dissolve
review/text: This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating. I don't like getting chunks of the powder through my straw as its a bit shocking!

review/summary: Tastey fruit flavoring
review/text: I liked the blackberry and pomegranate flavoring which was sweet and strong with no bad aftertaste. I didn't taste much tea which seemed to be overpowered by the fruit flavors and the honey. Using it as directed, one packet to one 16.9 oz bottle of water, produced a very intense flavor. Using a little less than one packet, or a larger water bottle, provided a better taste for me. If one likes very sweet, use the whole stick. The powder mixes quickly after shaking vigorously for about 30 seconds. I liked it enough to get it again. It's one of the better water enhancers I've tried.

review/summary: Great taste, but I would recommend bulk packaging
review/text: I like experimenting with different drinks, and I found these ready to make ice tea mixes to my taste.  They really have the mango flavor, without a significant aftertaste. The powder itself dissolves without buildup. So overall it's a good ice tea product.<br /><br />(Be sure to have good water ratio, though. For example I like it stronger, thus I use less water than the recommended amount).<br /><br />However, buying this separately is not a good option, especially when amazon offers good discounts when you buy in bulk with the "subscribe and save" program. For example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NVBI">Pack of 4</a>, or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBIHPM">good old canister based mixes</a> -- though the second one is not the same exact flavor.

review/summary: Good, but could be better
review/text: I like the ease with which you can use this item.  It has a good taste, but I would have perfered a little more honey and a little less acai flavoring.  It was slightly bitter and did give me heartburn.  But other than that it had a good taste and I would recommend it to a friend.

review/text: Disclaimer: I am reviewing a package that I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />Well, it's OK. I probably wouldn't buy it, but I don't usually buy instant iced tea mixes anyway.<br />The fruit flavor is OK. I can't comment on the naturalness vs unnaturalness of the ingredients etc like other reviewers.<br /><br />I'd probably just brew my own fresh green tea and chill it in the fridge...

review/summary: I would buy it again!
review/text: Lipton To Go Green Tea & Honey Mango Pineapple was a nice new discovery. I usually buy Crystal Light products, but I may very well buy Lipton products from now on. My friend described this drink as "green tea with a bit of mango," but my description would be a bit different. While I do love green tea, it can be slightly bitter at times. This had none of the bitterness. Actually, the green tea flavor was very subtle. To me, it tasted more like a tropical fruit punch, with mango as the dominant flavor. With only 5 calories, you really can't go wrong. All in all, I was really impressed with this product, and I will most likely be buying it again in the future.

review/summary: Just What the Doctor Ordered
review/text: I am a fan of Lipton Iced Green Tea so when I say the new Lipton Tea and Honey Decaf Iced Green Tea on Vine I had to give it a try.  The flavor is great and it fits the bill for anyone does not want artificial sweetener in their drink.  There is a trade off.  While the original Iced Green Tea had no calories, The Tea and Honey has 5 calories per serving.  Another plus is that while there is soy lecithin in the The Iced Green Tea there is none in Tea and Honey.  While some people say that soy in lecithin form does not bother people who are sensitive  to soy not having to worry about soy is nice.  I got the Strawberry Acai flavor and found it mild and enjoyable.  I did notice that it took longer for the Tea and Honey mix to dissolve but that was a minor problem.  I will be switching to the Tea and Honey now that it is available.

review/summary: A refreshing, low-calorie, diet drink
review/text: First off, buyers be warned that it's a low-calorie drink, which means it has that "diet taste."  If you've had any diet drinks, like Diet Coke, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I know some people hate it, so if you're one of those, I doubt this will change your mind.  Also, I know some people like unsweetened iced tea, so take note that this is (artificially) sweetened.<br /><br />That said, my wife and I really like it!  The one we tried was the mango-pineapple flavor, which was really refreshing.  The box comes with ten packets, with each packet for one 16-oz. bottle of water.  As one reviewer pointed out, one bottle of water wasn't enough, and it was a little too sweet for our taste, too, but when we used more water (about an extra 8 oz.) and put in some ice cubes it was perfect!  The mango taste is stronger than the pineapple, but it has a great tropical iced-tea taste to it.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, so with spring and summer around the corner, I'm glad to have come across this on Vine.  It is a great, refreshing drink for a hot day and I like that my wife and I can each have a decent serving size from the single packet and just think--now we're getting half the calories of an already low-cal drink!  Of course, your mileage may vary, but if you drink diet sodas or juices, give this a try!

review/summary: My second flavor to try and it's good too. SO SO HEALTHY
review/text: Blackberry and Pomegranate flavor was already a hit with me. My opinion is exactly the same with Mango Pineapple. Good strong Lipton flavors, very sweet for the sweet tea lovers, but I like mine less so, thus, here's what I do.<br /><br />I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. The flavor was fruity, as good as I expected after trying another flavor earlier. I've tried lots of flavored teas from other makers and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton. This is different, it's good.<br /><br />IT'S HEALTHY, BUT IT CAN BE MADE EVEN BETTER (IF NEEDED.)<br />FOR 8 OZ (that's half a packet, as the packet makes over 16 oz.) you get ZERO Fat & Sodium. Sugar's only 1g (per 8 oz.), calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me.<br />After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. By doing this you cut the nutrituion facts in half (per 8 oz serving). WOW. Even better. Now the bold Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate and or mango Pineapple flavor is still there, but less sweet. I enjoy the drink's fizz from the soda. Remember equal club soda/water mixed with the same amount of Lipton mixed as directed has a serving size (8oz) calorie cut to 2 �, sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br />I'm sold, 2 flavor attempts and both very satisfying to me. Now, which flavor should I try next?<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and "Bob's your Uncle".

review/text: Lipton Tea and Honey is delicious. I enjoyed it very much. It is very sweet and refreshing. There are only 5 calories but it is so rich in flavor. The fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are strong and delightful. I also like that is has real sugar and not aspartame. I would say it is almost addictive; I enjoyed it so much. I would recommend it to all. The packets are snipped for easy opening. You just add one packet to a 16 oz bottle of water and stir. It takes a minute to dissolve and then you can drink.

review/text: Every single week I buy a new box of water flavoring for my family. We have a hard time finding ones that don't have artificial flavoring and colorings, and usually when we DO find one they taste awful. But this new Lipton product has made my whole family so happy! It tastes AMAZING without any nasty after taste, it's low in calories, but I feel great knowing that it's got all-natural sweeteners and colors in it. I will never buy a different kind of water flavoring again!

review/summary: Oh Yeah!
review/text: I usually drink regular iced tea--unsweetened and usually decaf if I can get it--but I decided to give it a try.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea.  The sweetness from the honey and blackberry disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />I should probably note I haven't really used the product how it says to.  Instead of putting one packet in a bottle of water, I dumped seven packets into about 2-3 quarts of water.  Maybe that makes the taste stronger than in a single bottle.  Myself I don't really have a need for a single 16.9-oz bottle of tea, but other people might.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Extremely good tasting, low calorie way to hydrate
review/text: I drink a ton of water every day, but I like to mix it up.  I've tried a few of the Mio drinks, but they can be quite expensive.  Green tea is an excellent antioxidant, so I like to drink it as much as possible.  The strawberry-acai flavor is really nice, bright and sweet, but because of the use of honey/mix of sweeeteners, it tastes quite different than a product using white sugar.  It's 10 calories per full packet (serving size, as listed on the package, is half a packet or 5 calories), but a whole packet will make at least 16 oz. of flavored water- more if you're like me, since I tend to prefer it watered down a bit more.  Overall, this is a great way to add variety to one's daily water intake.  I'll be adding it to my pantry on a regular basis.<br /><br />Update 4/4/12: It was brought to my attention that this contains artificial sweeteners.  If you do not want that in your diet, please avoid this product.  If you're like me, and don't mind artificial sweeteners and use them sparingly, this drink will be in your wheel house.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.<br /><br />The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.<br /><br />This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it.

review/summary: Mostly fruity, little green tea flavor
review/text: I love these convenient little packets that you can add to water anywhere to create a tasty drink. This particular Lipton product is great if you want to get the benefits of green tea but you're not that fond of the flavor of green tea. What you get is mostly the tropical mango pineapple flavor and barely a hint of green tea. Although the tea is primarily sweetened by sucralose, the hint of honey makes this taste less artificial and more natural.

review/summary: Lipton to Go Goes...Somewhere
review/text: Well, this one is simple.  The tea sticks are easy to pour and easy to drink.  I recommend a 24 oz glass and lots of ice.  Pour in the mix and stir.  Does take some extra mixing, but ice tea it is.  I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor however.  There was a tea undertone, but the basic taste was honey, which also overwhelmed the mango & pineapple, which was negligible.  I drank it all over 1/2 hour.  Iced tea more or less it is, but the honey flavor is king.  Of course, it is not "sticky" like real honey.<br /><br />I don't know.  I prefer others to this.  Maybe if the flavors were more balanced i would enjoy it.  I still prefer to make my own...

review/text: The Tea & Honey iced green tea with mango/pineapple flavor, with 5 calories, has an interesting taste, with a slight after taste that means artificial sweetener. The flavor itself tastes more pineapple than mango, both fruits that I like fresh, but nothing like the real fruit flavor, and frankly I prefer plain tea with lemon. I do like the ease of adding the packets to 16.9 fl. oz. of bottled water (cold from the fridge) and drinking the flavored bottle water later. Btw, be sure to shake it well so it all dissolves.

review/summary: Goodness Gracious, this is a Tasty Brew! :)
review/text: 87 degrees? In March? IN CHICAGO??????? Yeah, that's what we've been suffering through (some might say 'enjoying') these past two weeks in March 2012. Rather than lovely 50 degree weather and watching the tulips and magnolias SLOWLY begin to open up their buds, we're having SPRING ON STEROIDS, instead! So, break out the grill, the flip flops and the Iced Tea!!!<br /><br />My family and I go through copious amounts of tea. Being British, everything in life goes better with tea, either hot or iced. This Lipton product was a nice addition to our life-style and I hope they come out with different flavours to carry with you on hot days. We gave this a trial on a long hike in the dunes off of Lake Michigan. Had our supply of water bottles and the wee packets to add to them. Of 6 adults and 2 teens, this tea received a 4-5 star rating, over all. We enjoyed that it was actually sweetened with honey, rather than nasty fake sweetener. And we really enjoyed that you could taste that tart tea taste that we enjoy so much; it wasn't overshadowed by the fruit flavour.<br /><br />Normally, I don't enjoy products added to water as they turn out too sweet or just too "too"...meaning TOO fruity, sweet, or whatever. This product nailed the perfect blend of turning water into something pleasant to drink, rather than needing plain water to WASH the taste of an added product off of your taste buds.<br /><br />Good Job, Lipton!!! Now, make a Honey and Mint version and I'll be a Happy Camper! :)

review/text: I normaly do not reach for the decf items, and when this product arrived...I thought, oh gee...then, I thought how bad can it taste?  The taste was great.  Not overly sweet and  with a hint of honey. Just the right blend<br /><br />The packet that the power is contained, very easy to open,  unlike some of the other brands. The powder mixes well, unlike other brands.<br /><br />I recently had purchased the SodaStream soda maker, and use a liquid flavoring, I prepaired the carbonation in the bottle and poured in the Lipton packet ..... Oh boy!  It started to fizz and bubble and the color was a bright red like a strawberry! What a mess .... however, when it settled down the carbonation disapated and<br />I found that the ice tea had a rich light taste. Tip:  if your try this tea  carbonated  a light carbonation is advised ...Also, if you want a drink like a light water, just use less from the packet.  Refreshing and half the cost of flavored waters.<br /><br />The only down fall for this powdered tea is the color!  Scarlet Red, it stains if you spittle.. (bg).  Other than that, I will looking forward to our grocery store<br />has the new Lipton Ice Tea.<br />Diffently recommend this product.

I am tempted to try the other flavors like peach apricot or blackberry pomegranate. What I like best is that it doesn't contain aspartame like most of the flavor packets on the market today. With only 5 calories per serving, what's not to like? It is sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves, and real fruit flavors.

review/summary: Naturally (and artificially) refreshing
review/text: In an ongoing effort to avoid diet soda during the day, I have turned more and more to liquid and powdered water enhancers.  They are often hit or miss in terms of taste, but I'm pleased to say that Lipton's "Tea & Honey" Strawberry Acai is a pretty solid product.  That said, be aware that this sweet drink tastes far more like a strawberry punch than it does tea.<br /><br />Obviously, for marketing purposes, Lipton is playing up the "all-natural" use of honey.  A quick glance at the ingredients, however, shows that while there is granulated honey on the list, there's also plain old sugar and, perhaps to add sweetness yet keep the calories down, the artificial sweetener Sucralose.  As a result, this is a very sweet-tasting drink.  It does, however, have a pleasant strawberry taste, and I'm primarily concerned about the taste.  One might argue, however, why a person should avoid diet soda if they are going to use a powdered mix that contains artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Another marketing ploy I noticed was that the "5 calories per serving" is actually two per packet, which cannot be resealed.  Essentially, you are supposed to pour the entire packet into a standard bottle of water and then, I guess, drink half (for a single serving).  I don't know anyone that would actually do this, so Lipton would be better off labeling this as "10 calories per serving," which is far more accurate.  Lastly, the box warns that these drinks need to be shaken at length to dissolve the tea.  That's very true.  It took several minutes of solid shaking to make all those little tea granules disappear.  Don't shake and drink quickly unless you want grit in your mouth!<br /><br />These things aside, I did enjoy this sample and plan to use the entire box -- probably faster than anyone would recommend.  While not addictively delicious, it's more refreshing than bottled water and probably better for me than diet soda.  Give it a try!

Each packet is die-cut making it very easy to open, too (no spilling).<br /><br />Bottom line, this a full-flavored drink mix that makes a 16-oz bottle of water taste great.<br /><br />Mar 31, 2012 UPDATE:  Since reviewing the Mango Pineapple, we picked up the Blackberry Pomegranate and the Strawberry Acai Decaf varieties, as well.  All are absolutely tasty!

review/summary: Sweet & Sugar-free Strawberry Acai
review/text: This stuff is delicious... and strawberry-flavored! As a diabetic I always want something to expand my options and this Strawberry Acai iced tea will do fine.  Low calorie (5), low carb (1g) and sweetened with both honey and Sucralose- an infinitely better alternative to Aspertame- this is something I'm gonna enjoy having around. And did I mention it's strawberry-flavored? :)

review/summary: Better than Kool-Aid
review/text: First, I had a hard time opening it. Then, the mix came out in a cloud or lumps. I admit that I tried this after having a packet in my car for while but then it is made to travel, right?<br /><br />The taste is OK but nothing exciting. If I thought about it, I could taste the tea and honey but mostly I tasted the sweet Kool-Aid type taste.<br /><br />I was excited to find this as I cannot tolerate artificial sweetner. The sweetner (besides honey) is made from sugar but is low cal. I'm not sure how that is going to work for me.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not exciting.

review/summary: refreshing and easy to make
review/text: This is some outstanding, easy to mix and enjoy decaf iced green tea! It couldn't be easier to make--just add to a glass of some cool or chilled water and stir. The honey, mango-pineapple flavor is very refreshing and I really agree with people who write that it's even better than soda on a hot day--and we'll be getting hot days here in New York for the next several months so this couldn't have come to me at a better time!<br /><br />It's the taste that really wows me. It's smooth and not too sweet as others say; and the packets are small enough that I can easily carry a bunch with me and then buy (or bring with me) bottled cold water to mix it with. If you're on the run, I think mixing the powder into the water using a small swizzle stick should work.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product. It's a mere five calories so unless you're drinking huge amounts of it you certainly won't gain any weight--this is very good tea!

review/summary: Loved It Even Though It's Sweetened!
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back.  I drink about three gallons of unsweetened tea every week.  Normally I prefer unsweetened tea but when I was offered this product I noticed that it said it was slightly sweetened.  I couldn't wait to make my first drink.  You take a bottle of cold water, tear open the packet and pour it into the bottle.  Replace the cap and shake.  This tea does take a little longer to mix so you have to give it quite a few shakes but that isn't a problem.  The taste is lovely.  It takes like tea and fruit.  Honey is used as the sweetener and there is just a little bit added so it isn't too sweet.  It's just perfect.  I guzzled that first drink down and now I'm working on a second... I'm going to put some packets in my purse so I can make tea when I'm out and about.

review/text: I really like this.  Just FYI though, the directions say to add one packet of mix per quart of water.  That's really more like half a pitcher.  BUT, that seemed like a high ratio to me, so I just used one packet in my 2 qt pitcher, and it was plenty sweet.  In fact, I really can't imagine wanting to add any more mix.  So, double the water/half the mix, and it'll be great.

review/text: This is really great stuff, tasting much like a fruit punch. If you're using it with a cup or glass, rather than a bottle of water, I strongly suggest having an inch or so of water in the bottom before you pour the packet in to avoid wheezy clouds of powder; not having a full cup also seems to facilitate mixing the powder, then you can fill the cup up. VERY tasty stuff!!

I am totally addicted to it and have cut back my soda intake and am drinking way more water. The packets are convenient enough that I can carry them with me in my purse and I can even stretch one packet to two bottles of water without really sacrificing taste. I warn you though that these are addicting!  The flavor is sweet and rich, but not overpowering.  The best part is they are only 5 calories which is nothing compared to my usual can of soda.

review/summary: Love Those Summer Berries, Sweet and Flavorful
review/text: Lipton Green Tea to Go, blackberry/pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  Of course, I'm not a dietitian, I just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.

review/text: This decaf iced tea was really good!  I like the fact that you put your ice and water in a glass and pour the packet of Stawberry iced tea in and stir.  It isn't overly sweet.  It tasted good and was a great alternative to soda.  I like it better than the soda stream we have and is a lot less work to make.  If you like decaf iced tea and want a different taste other than black or green tea then this is a buy!  THIS IS AN UPDATE AS OF 6/18/12.  I purchased a case of Strawberry and a case of Blackberry/Pomegrante.  I love this drink and so easy to mix!  I have also put 2 of each in my purse so when we eat out I can drink this instead of soda pop.  I make sure I have a plastic spoon in my purse.  Hope those of you who would like to try it like it as much as I do.  My husband thinks it is a really smart idea, he likes it also.  We are saving money when we eat out!

review/text: I'm trying to drink less soda and more water, but most of the time, a plain glass of water is not that appealing, so I am always on the lookout for ideas to flavor it. This mango pineapple has a great taste, not too sweet. It has a slightly tropical taste but is not overpowering, even when mixed with a smaller bottle of water than what the directions specify. I took a couple of sips to allow shaking room, then add the powder. The packet is easy to open without spills, yet sturdy enough not to tear open in a handbag or pocket. It does take quite a bit of shaking to completely dissolve the powder, but nothing too difficult.<br />I will buy more of these. They sure help with my water intake without adding too many extra calories.

review/text: By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable.

review/text: This makes me think Kool-aid for grownups. It is  that deep red color and pretty sweet tasting. I was pretty impressed since I am not a huge powdered drink fan. And, I normally am all about plain water. But we had a week or so without juice in the house and this gave me a sort of juice-fix. I mostly drank it in a glass, so not all the little powder bits mixed in as well as they would have in a bottle of water.<br /><br />The way the little packets rip open is really nice, they are already sort of halfway torn for you, and at an angle, so the powder falls pretty neatly into the drink.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to someone who enjoyed falvoring their water.

review/summary: A tangy water enhancer but hardly tea
review/text: We drink a multitude of beverages in our house.  Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered "On-The-Go" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea.

review/text: Decided to try this on the Vine.<br />It tastes like weak strawberry flavored koolaid.  It would even be better if mixed with soda water to give it some kind of soft drink appeal.  I tried serving it to the rest of my family including kids and not a single glass was more than half consumed.  Save your money and try another kind/flavor.  I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.  This is so disappointing in comparison.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect green tea to taste strong like black tea, but the tea in this drink is virtually flavorless.<br /><br />Bottom line:  wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: They forgot to mention the Sucralose
review/text: They keep saying "naturally sweetened with honey", but it is like sweetener overkill with sucralose.  Way too sweet, overwhelms any berry flavor that is there, and no green tea flavor is discernable.  Diluting it makes the oversweetened taste become obvious as the berry flavor recedes in the distance, with still too much sweetener.  (Though if you like things extra sweet, you may enjoy this).<br /><br />Too bad.  Try the True Lemon family of unsweetened dehydrated citrus juice packets instead.

review/summary: Too Sweet, wish they left out the Sucralose
review/text: The box proclaims "Sweetened with Honey", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.  For now I stick to True Lemon unsweetened, and the other unsweetened flavor products from that company.<br /><br />If you like drinks to taste sweet, with a sweetness that lingers in your mouth for many minutes after taking just a sip, you'll probably like this product.

review/summary: Why Lipton why, sure it tastes fine, but artificial sweetner?
review/text: I don't like to drink sodas because they really aren't good for you.  Water can get boring, so I thought this might be good.  I saw what was printed on the box, "blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that "although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural."  That kind of ruins this drink mix for me.  If a company (Lipton) wants to put Natural all over its packaging, then be natural all the way, not just a few ingredients.

review/summary: Lipton's Sucralose Sweetened "To Go" Stix - Not A Fan...
review/text: I LOVE tea!  I love Lipton tea! I do not love Lipton To Go Stix tea...  Lipton's new "To Go" Stix are a great idea for travel and the flavor of the tea and fruits together are great. However, the sweetener used in this product is not so great.  I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, especially sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose IS an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar),twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame and BOY does it show.  I tried mixing this in different quantities of water and just did not enjoy it one bit.<br /><br />If the product was REALLY sweetened with honey, I would certainly enjoy it more. These packets are ACTAULLY 10 calories as opposed to the stated 5 as each stick is labelled for 8 oz instead of 16 oz.  There is also a problem in the dissolving properties of the sucralose.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk...

review/summary: Tastes artificial and is
review/text: This decaf iced-tea mix reminds me of Kool-Aid.  In order to make it taste like something, it tastes like a drink mix--too sweet and not very much like tea.  It's one of those products that people buy because of clever marketing -- green tea, decaf, low calorie, honey and Acai-- what could be better?  Actually none of it is good.  Lots of artificial sweeteners, no real honey to speak of, and an overly sweet taste.  Not healthy.  Not that great.

review/summary: Good taste and only 5 calories
review/text: Tried this tea because it was in an isle (not on a shelf) in the grocery store.<br />After trying the tea was sold on the taste and being only 5 calories I was again sold.<br />Just as good as a cola and trying to lose a few pounds, can't be better.<br />Diet cola can't stand the after taste. No after taste with the tea and the taste is delicious.
