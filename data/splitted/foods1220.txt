review/summary: Best cookies ever!
review/text: I love these cookies and they are difficult to find in most groceries stores. I was so thrilled when I discovered that I could order eight bags at a time through Amazon.com. They arrived quickly and in good shape! None were crushed. Now I can have my cookies and eat them whenever. I often give a bag as a thank you gift to friends. Then they become addicted too.

review/text: I actually was in San Francisco when I first tried these wafers. I fell in love with them instantly. When I got home I tried hopelessly  to find them in my area, with no luck at all. Thank goodness for AMAZON I now can enjoy them without having to drive almost 5 hours to San Francisco. And if I may add very reasonally priced. They are not overpowering with the amount of sugar other wafers have but yet are so delicious. I can't wait to try them once again.

review/text: i grew up in italy and loved these wafer cookies... i had almost forgot how good they were. then i decided to order some just to refresh my memories and ended up eating 4 out of the 8 bags in less than a 24 hour period (i did have some help). everybody that tried them asked me where i got them.i bought the hazelnut ones and i think that hazelnut is such a better choice to combine with chocolate and cookies than peanuts like they do here in the states. i wanted my friends to try different flavors so i ordered tiramisu, vanilla and lemon.....i see they have an option to deliver them ever month or two but i think they should deliver them weekly. lol.

review/summary: Loacker Quadratini Hazelnut Wafers
review/text: I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a "slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.

review/text: I had every intention of giving this product a glowing five star review--the chocolate is great, whether you're using it for baking like I do, or just snacking on it like my wife and daughter like to do. If you're adept enough in the kitchen to know why you want couverture chocolate for much of your baking, you'll appreciate this product.<br /><br />However, I was shocked to see that the product has shot up by almost $10 since I bought it. It was a bargain at $16 for the two boxes, but I don't think I'd buy it again at $27. Either wait for a price decrease, or look elsewhere for your baking chocolate needs.

review/text: I've heard a lot about E. Guittard by reading baking blogs and cook books. Since I usually just buy Ghirardelli or even *gasp* Nestle chips, I wasn't sure how much better these would really be. The answer - these wafers shoot them out of the water. They are perfectly silky, and have a much deeper chocolate taste. And, if you're looking for a smooth, quick melting chocolate, these are definitely for you. I can ignore the higher price; I won't be going back to store bought. I'm already through a pound, having made fantastic English toffee and hot fudge with them, and I will be buying more. :)

I figured you can get Constant Comment at the store and it's delicious.  This should be even better.<br /><br />It wasn't.  The orange flavor was completely undetectable.  There were a scant few shriveled bits of orange peel, but it wasn't enough to give this tea any discernible orange flavor.  And spices?  Hah!  No spice taste at all.  The tea itself is fine, black tea.  Just not orange spice.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: In general I love using erythritol -- it is a great sweetener and a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sugar substitutes.  But when I received my order of erythritol from this company, it had a very strange smell.  Too nasty for me to use the product, so I called for instructions on how to get a refund.  When I asked where they got the substance, they said from China.  This had me worried.  I was not sure where the rest of their products came from, but they did confirm this particular item ( and all the derived products like candies, etc.) came from China.<br /><br />They were very rude and negative on the phone when I asked for a refund.  I would not order from them again, especially since NOW foods has a better product and wonderful customer service.  I would pay more for the customer service as well as erythritol that smells normal.

It tastes amazing both by itself or as a mixer, if you want to add alcohol to make yourself a drink for just the calories of your alcohol + 5 for the Crystal Light.<br /><br />For an extra treat freeze the drink in mini ice cube trays for a really pretty look in a nice glass. The Pomtini is really red and it just looks fancy to me, like an extra special treat. There is just something about drinking out of a nice crystal glass that kicks it up a notch, and this drink is definitely worth putting in the glass.

review/text: I enjoyed the bars but probably won't ever buy them again.  I was looking for an organic chocolate bar with rice crisp.  This is more like a candy bar, very soft and more processed if that is the right word.  Organic rice crisp chocolate bars are not easy to find, alas.

I take at least two tbls. of this throughout the day and I use it on every food that I eat instead of butter. This is one of the top natural cures that you can buy and it is simply a FOOD!!

review/text: I have been using Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil since December.  I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home, however after receiving the great deal on Amazon I will continue to buy it here.  Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over.  I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily.  I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot.  For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do.  I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight.  I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever.  Thank you.

review/text: I have been using Nutiva coconut oil for over a year now and I love this product, the texture, the taste.. Wonderful and light and delicious ... I have tried other brands but they have a funny after taste. I substitute coconut oil for all my cooking and baking if I can.. I use half and half with butter to cut down the cholesterol but still get a buttery taste, I float a teaspoon on my hot chocolate for quick morning energy (divine) .. I pop the pop corn in my "whirly pop" machine... YUMMY.

review/text: I probably have every skin care product ever made.. I am huge with natural skin care and I have been using honey as a face mask (which I love), but it is just too messy and sticky. I research constantly for new things for natural skin care and I came across coconut oil; I just have to say I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this product! I don't break out a lot, just a few on my chin every now and then, but it is usually painful cystic acne and after applying this at night the next morning I woke up and my face was glowing, I couldn't believe it! I don't have wrinkles, but I was getting a few fine lines under my eyes and they have disappeared after only four days of using this at night before bed and in the morning after my shower. I am absolutely amazed, this is a miracle product! I also use it as a moisturizer and hair mask. I have my mom and sister-in-law using this now and they said the same thing! I recommend this product to anyone! Also, I got the 15 oz jar which will probably last months because you only need a tiny tinyyy bit for your face

review/summary: Pure Coconut Oil with nice flavor and good price
review/text: I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)

review/summary: Good value conitioner/moisturizer
review/text: I read about the miracles of coconut oil. Though it is not what I would call miraculous I would say it does a nice job. I have sensitive skin, and this seems to work as well or better than most moisturizers I have tried, plus you can eat it. It has a coconut flavor to it. Subtle, and not sweet like a Peter Paul Mounds bar. I believe it helps a little as a laxative, but that might be me wishing it to do so. Anyway, just a small amount goes a long way, and my skin feels less sensitive and cooler. I'm a guy, and not looking for silky smooth skin, but this does that also.<br />This stays a solid until it touches your hand, then it melts quickly. This summer I may need to refridgerate so it stays solid, or knowing me, I'll spill it all over the place. Large jar for low cost. I'd give it a go.

I use it as an overnight treatment for my hair & started to notice improvements right away. Smells amazing! I take a chunk in my hand, rub my hands together so it liquifies & apply it to my hair. You get a huge container for a great price. You won't regret this purchase! On a side note if you don't like the smell of coconut, you won't like this product. It's pure coconut oil so of course it smells like coconut. It seems silly to write it but you wouldn't believe how many reviews I've seen where people actually complain that the coconut oil smells like coconut!

review/summary: I love, love, LOVE it!
review/text: I am glad that I chose this production as my introduction to coconut oil.  I love it.  Yes, it has a soft coconut fragrance but the fragrance dissapates during the cooking process.  I have replaced 90% of the oil and butter in my house and I don't even miss that other stuff.  I add a nickel-size drop to my lotion after bathing and it knocks the ashyness right out of those ankles and elbows!  It also works great on my coarse straight black hair. After having issues with shedding, my hair stylist complimented me on taking great care of my hair.  "Keep on doing what you're doing," she said.  Ha!  I love that.<br /><br />As for cooking, I am in awe everytime I use it.  I recenty made omelettes for Saturday brunch.  Oh...My...Goodness!  They were absolutely amazing with tons of flavor in every bite.  That alone, sold me on this product.  I could have opened a restaurant on those omelettes alone.  (Patting myself on the back.)  Talapia works great with coconut oil as well since it is a delicate fish and one of my favorites.  I was very impressed with my cooking recently and I know it has to be the oil because that is the only thing that I've been doing differently.  I could cook before but now my food has reached another level and I feel more empowered when I cook.  The large 54-ounce jar will be a staple in my house so I won't have to worry about running out.<br /><br />Try it and see how you like it.  You may want to start with the smaller size if you are not sure about this product, or your can just jump in feet first like I did.

review/text: I use this for cooking and for my skin as well. It has a very pleasant light coconut smell. In cooking I have never noticed a transfer of any coconut flavor to the foods I cook, which is a good thing. Basically you can use it to pan fry various food items without worrying about flavor conflicts.<br /><br />It works nicely as a skin moisturizer too. It's a little greasy (it's oil), but absorbs well, and again smells good (unless you don't like coconut).<br /><br />Tried it as a hair conditioner but that didn't work out too well. It is very easy to apply too much and end up with hair that looks like it has to be washed again. Maybe it takes practice. :)

review/text: I started buying this coconut oil about 2 years ago and now use it dually as a cooking oil and lotion. It's excellent for eggs, curry dishes...really almost any meal where you would use another type of oil. As for use as a lotion, it's amazing. Any and all skin issues I have ever had, have disappeared. When I first started using it on my face there was a bit of a transitional period (some breakouts) but after that, I have year- round clear, healthy looking skin. Yes, I am a bit fanatical about my love of this oil but I really don't care because everyone should be in the know.

review/text: Yeah, I use this both for eating and for moisturizing.  It's great on my skin.  I do a head-to-toe with it nightly and it keeps my skin all creamy-soft.  It has a nice sweet smell and stays solid at room temperature.  I'm turning thirty and hopefully it'll keep my face totally free of crows feet for a good long time to come.  No expensive anti-wrinkle creams here.  Also, it's fantastic for cooking Thai and Indian food.  Really high heat tolerance.  Takes forever to go rancid, so the shelf life is awesome.  It also clears up the allergic skin rash I get when I use latex gloves.  That stuff makes my knuckles crack and bleed, and the coconut oil is incredibly soothing.  This stuff is a great deal!

review/summary: Great Oil - Great Price
review/text: There's been a lot said recently about the benefits of Coconut oil.  But it's difficult to find quality oil for a good price.  Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil from Amazon.com makes it affordable.  Coconut oil is the best oil to saute with as it doesn't turn into a carcinogen at the regular temp we cook at.  We also add it to our green smoothies, and often use it with a drop of essential oil as an overall skin conditioner in conjunction with our chosen safe skin care line that is much more natural and effective than other things available on the market.  I'm always looking for better ways to help our family be as healthy as possible.  This is a great product to help with that goal.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic EV Coconut Oil
review/text: I LOVE this stuff.  It arrived fairly quickly, but had leaked a bit inside it's box (I suppose that's to be expected with trying to ship an oil in the middle of summer).  I've had it for a month or so and it's only just starting to solidify in the cupboard.<br /><br />The oil smells wonderful, a yummy coconut smell, and when it's heated in a pan it just smells that much better. I use it every time I pan fry anything (eggs, fish, chicken, etc) and it always works wonderfully.  I haven't noticed it adding any coconut flavor to anything really, except perhaps eggs which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />I have used it in baking a couple of times and have had only one issue.  Because it's a 'solid' oil (depending on temperature) when I added cold eggs to the oil and didn't mix fast enough it started to chunk up so things didn't mix very smoothly.<br /><br />I should also add that my son has exzema and has since he was born.  I haven't found anything better then coconut oil to use as an after bath moisturizer for him, and he smells sooooo good when we are done.

review/summary: Great alternative cooking oil
review/text: I first read about the benefits of coconut oil while reading an article in Oxygen Magazine.  I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils.

review/text: Found this same product for about $5 less at the Vitamin Shoppe website and bought it there.<br /><br />Even with their lowest price shipping, the Nutiva Coconut oil arrived quickly.  However, it opened during transit and leaked everywhere.  Called the customer service number and the gentleman who answered immediately wrote an order to send another shipment to replace my shipped spilled one and the replacement arrived quicker than the quoted time frame for the discount shipping.  This time, it was packed much better and didn't spill.  Seems I'm at least the second person to complain about how Vitamin Shoppe ships their coconut oil - hoping they'll ship it better next time so that they have more profit and I have more instant gratification.<br /><br />On to the product itself and the 5 stars it earns:<br /><br />Nutiva's extra virgin coconut oil has just a faint coconut smell and no taste.  It's liquid at 77�F and great inside and outside the human body.  Can't wait to saute veggies in it tomorrow!  Very psyched Nutiva markets this superfood and The Vitamin Shoppe sells it.

review/summary: Good Deal - Good Oil
review/text: I've been using coconut oil for years.  I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008. Now, I use coconut oil on weekends as my "weekend treat" in homemade popcorn.  (Not eating sugar really made me lose weight:  1#/week for 30 weeks, where I've remained for months.)<br /><br />This Nutiva jar is easy to open.  It's probably good to keep smaller amounts in another container to keep the big jar less contaminated . . . but I don't always do that.<br /><br />There was a slight coconut scent at first but that disappeared.  When I lick off the spoon when I make popcorn, I can taste a little bit of coconut, but not much.  I'd highly recommend this brand unless you really wanted that coconut scent.  the lack of scent does make it extremely versatile and much easier to substitute as a butter spread (hot vegetables, toast, etc.)

review/text: This brand is the best tasting to me. I've tried others, and don't like them, (except for Garden of Eden brand). This smells and taste like coconut. I toast sprouted bread, spread this on it, add a little salt, and maybe some nutritional yeast. Or I use some agave nectar instead of the yeast for a sweet fix. I bought a gallon of another brand, and I don't like it. I will be buying more of this brand.

review/summary: I use it for everything!
review/text: This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread. This is a great value, and a fabulous product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too.

review/summary: Nothing Compares
review/text: This oil is wonderful, I have nothing but good things to say about it.<br /><br />Taste is fresh.<br />Quality is unsurpassed.<br /><br />As a raw foodie I'm always looking for the truly and minimally processed fractured foods such as this oil, I've looked in to Nutiva's process for making this and it appears it truly is raw and as minimally processed as coconut oil can get.<br /><br />The way I use it most often is to make a raw custard smoothie in the blender as follows..<br /><br />3 raw eggs<br />1 cup or more of raw 100% grass fed organic Milk<br />1 Teaspoon raw unheated honey<br />1-3 Tbsp Raw Nutiva Coconut Oil<br /><br />It makes the creamiest most wonderful and incredibly healthy smoothie. I make between 1 and 3 of these each day so I use this oil very fast.<br /><br />I also use it with a little raw milk and raw honey to make one of the creamiest, tastiest cups of coffee you can imagine!<br /><br />The above smoothie can be turned in to a banana smoothie by adding half a banana and subtracting the eggs and honey.<br /><br />Can also be used externally in hair and on skin.<br /><br />This coconut oil should be a staple source of raw fat for every family, especially if you don't have ready access to fresh coconut!

In other foods, the taste disappears completely.

review/text: I can only compare this Nutiva coconut oil to one other that I had tried bearing the Spectrum label.  Perhaps the Spectrum oil is exactly as good for you, but it had no flavor whatsoever.  This Nutiva coconut oil, on the other hand, actually has a delicious coconut flavor.  Well, I think it's delicious.  If you don't like coconut flavor, you'd better try a different brand.

review/summary: Best oil for hair
review/text: According the research online, the coconut oil work great on hair. It is the only oil reported to penetrate the hair shaft and leaves hair soft/moistened. I use the oil as a pre-conditioner for 30 min or longer no heat. Then followed by shampoo. After shampoo I apply again the coconut oil other oils to seal the oil in the hair. The product is cost effective, natural, and most importantly does the work.

review/summary: Nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil
review/text: I would not live without this product. I Have read and done some research on the benifits of using<br />coconut oil. Its uses and benifits are endless. I actually have a small jar I refill for keeping in<br />the bathroom. It has become my lotion after showering. I use this only in the pm due to the initial slipery<br />feeling till it soaks into the skin. My skin is supple, no more dryness, more elasticity, and the best of all is it is antibacterial, antifungus and a great disenfectant. I put it on everything. It dries it up. I eat 3 tablespoons of it a day, I cook with it, put it on anything I would normally use butter for. Its great for high heat. I have read it is good for the gums and digestion as well. The body synthesises it well and is beneficial. I would encourge anyone to read about this and try it. there are cookbooks and how to use this on amazon. Thanks to Nutiva and Amazon for carrying it.!!!<br />Its flavor is lightly nutty and love that coconut flavor.

review/summary: Amazing on the face, body, and on food!
review/text: I adore this coconut oil.  It smells incredible, tastes delicious, and adds a lovely sheen to your skin.  I put this on my face before washing it to clean off makeup and regularly use this as a body lotion after showering and to remove eye makeup.  It makes your skin wonderfully soft and yummy-smelling and doesn't have any difficult to pronounce ingredients like regular body lotions do.<br />Also, I use this as a topping for air-popped popcorn (since it's oil, it doesn't have water and doesn't make popcorn soggy - butter does this), and I put it on bread in place of butter since it melts faster and is tasty, and I use it in the pan to cook stir-fry, eggs, and anything else I want to cook!  All in all, this stuff is awesome!  I just wish it came in a better container, but as soon as I run out I'll buy another jug of Nutiva coconut oil (this is my second one).

review/text: This is soooo delicious. Some reviewed the taste as too coconut, I guess you should complain if you purchased Vegetable oil or Olive oil. But it is COCONUT oil, hence the flavor. I use it on toasted bagels, potatoes, to stir fry string beans/ almond slivers. I've used it in my lotions, and hair conditioner (in its liquid form, I mixed it into the products). When my son was a baby, we used it for his delicate skin instead of baby lotions, a great massage oil for adults as well.

review/text: Based on reviews and information I found online I decided to try putting coconut oil on my poodle's dry itchy skin..she was getting yellow flakey areas and pimple/pustules and was itching and licking all the time. In a matter of hours I started to notice a difference (hardly any licking) and by the next day the color of her skin started to normalize. Overnight the redness seemed to return a bit so I'm going to continue applying it. She likes to have it as a treat on her food as well!<br /><br />I'm SO pleased, and incredibly relieved that I've found something natural that seems to relieve her itching a bit.

The smell is incredible and a little goes a long way... I am moisturized all day long.  The downside is I can't apply it to my curly thick hair as a moisturizer because it will get frizzy, and also when I put a little bit on my face I tend to break out...so I only use this as a body lotion and I LOVE it. I live on a island so the smell of the coconut oil keeps all the bugs away...just how I like it : )  Bought this jar in april and still have TONS of it left...

review/summary: Simply THE best tasting!
review/text: I've tried other organic coconut oils, but this is by far, the best tasting one yet!<br /><br />We use this for baking, cooking, as a spread (or mixed in spreads) and even in our huskies' homemade diets.<br /><br />There is a calm scent of coconut when you open the jar... not overbearing at all, while also not bland...and the taste is even better than it smells. It's so good in place (or mixed with) butter and/or olive oil.  I've even used this on orange roughy (and other white fish) and the taste is dreamy...and made a much loved meal even more loved.  --After that meal, my husband even said "when this gets down to 1/3, we will reorder"... he never says this about any "oils".  I don't stop with just fish... this oil gets used (either alone or mixed with other oils) with just about everything that needs oil.<br /><br />I've used this on my skin (and as oil treatment for hair) as well, and love it!  I have very sensitive and prone to dry skin, and this helps.  I'll definitely be using this in my skincare as well.<br /><br />It's a little more expensive than several other brands, but it is so worth it.

review/summary: Great coconut oil!
review/text: This is great coconut oil that we've been using for a year now.  We love using it for high temperature cooking (when olive oil and other oils are not appropriate to use) and also especially on our popcorn.  Coconut oil is so good for you and tastes delicious!  This product is wonderful too because it is organic, extra virgin, and very consistent in quality.<br /><br />We're really pleased with the pricing here at Amazon AND the customer care; when one container arrived to our house punctured and broken, Amazon immediately sent out a new container.<br /><br />We will definitely order Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil again.

review/summary: We use this for everything!
review/text: I buy this every two months. We have a family of 3 and use it for cooking, skincare, and my massage business. The only thing that would make this better is having an option to subscribe and save on it, I would be the first to click.
