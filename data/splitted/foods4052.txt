review/summary: Good food!
review/text: My dog is quite finicky on the food she will eat.  She won't really eat dry food but seems to like her wet food.  This was a very good deal for 24 cans of Pedigree.  Love the fact that I could choose the kind I wanted to buy for her. Would recommended ordering this item and from this company. Item came well packaged for shipping and for storage. Item arrived on time as well.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: These are wonderful candies. I'm glad that this seller is giving us people living in the USA opportunity to eat this great Italian product (for the record, I was born in Italy).<br /><br />Note: like many Italian candies, these are targeted at adults (there are candies with espresso coffee, liquor and the likes). These are just mints, but kids or people with taste for super-sugary stuff should refrain from trying them. In fact, they are fairly strong mints (there are stronger ones). If you like mint and liquorice, and if you like a fair strong taste (not super strong like fisherman's friend, but stronger than altoids), you will love this product.<br /><br />Thanks, Supermarketitaly!

review/summary: Makes your second childhood all the sweeter
review/text: I grew up on the Jolly Rancher Stix where the longer you worked on them, the more like knife blades they looked and sometimes felt when you poked yourself in the cheek in your enthusiasm to enjoy them!<br /><br />These lollypops are phenomenal because they are generously sized, have three of my four favorite flavors, including the nowhere else to be found pink lemonade flavor.<br /><br />If you like true to life flavors that don't give you an aftertaste that is less than pleasant, and you've never tried Jolly Ranchers, you need to get a small bag of the original mix and pop in a watermelon  favorite of all time  then try the green apple  second favorite of all time  to give you an idea of what a treat these lollypops are.<br /><br />The flavors are clean, clear and intense, true to life without tasting artificial in any way, and the pink lemonade tastes like a glass of pink lemonade, delicious and refreshing.<br /><br />Finding these pops in a double pack is just awesome and whenever I have them out for people to enjoy, they disappear like magic.<br /><br />Clearly, I am not the only person who enjoys their second childhood with a Jolly Rancher Lollypop in hand!

review/summary: Taste Testers Have Damaged Taste Buds!!!
review/text: First off, Im a BIG Reese's fan. Its my favorite chocolate of all time. I also love Chips Ahoy, esp. the Chunky variety. So I was expecting that if you combine Reese's and Chips Ahoy together, it will create a Heavenly taste that only angels used to know about.<br /><br />Man, I was wrong! I CANNOT taste the Reese's one bit if combined with the Chips Ahoy cookie! Only way to taste it is to get the small pieces of Reese's(which isnt even a lot per cookie) and eat it by itself. The cookie itself is the Chewy variety, which Im not really fond of - too soft. Maybe they should have opt for the Chunky one, eh?<br /><br />It is not gross or yucky, its just that I rather eat them separately, cuz this is a total rip-off! I give it 1 star cuz I'm reviewing a food item that is supposed to combine separate ones into one delicious product, sadly, they weren't able to pull it off.

If the other three packages are also "crumby," I will definitely discontinue this subscription.

review/text: Here's the thing: I like Reese's. I like Chip's Ahoy. I like Peanut Butter. Some years back, Chips Ahoy has a peanut butter flavor that did not include Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. They were so addicting, I could eat through a whole tin of them.<br /><br />Then they introduced Reese's into them. The taste was all right, but not the flavor I had grown to love in the past. Instead of a mouthwatering taste in every bite, now it's only good if you get a peanut butter chunk in a bite. Still, it's certainly tasty enough to buy here and there, I just wouldn't go out of my way to get some.<br /><br />Nabisco, bring back the old style!

Sprinkle with fresh lemon juice, maybe some chives, and serve before it warms up and starts to "melt."<br /><br />Admittedly, the idea of "beef jello" takes some getting used to, so I'd suggest a small serving size the first time you try it. BTW, eating it involves a certain amount of slurping, since it slides around on the spoon.

review/summary: SAVED OUR SANITY ON A 4-HOUR PLANE RIDE!
review/text: (Because we tried all three, I wanted to post these on each pouch page.)<br /><br />YUM! Our 17 month old daughter loves them. When we heard about these new pouches, they were a _must try_. We couldnt decide on a fruit combination, so we ordered a case of each. This worked out well, because the order qualified for amazons free shipping. They arrived very quickly in easy to open cases.<br /><br />We consolidated them to a box in the pantry so we could get to them faster and because those pouches can kind of slide around. :) Our daughter is all about choices right now and so we let her decide which one she'd like to try first. She looked carefully at each of them then said "NANA! ARN! BUH-NEE! HOP! HOP!" and so chose the Mango, Banana and Orange...and it remains her favorite of the three (although, she would never give up the others if offered).<br /><br />Now, the plane ride...we recently took a trip to visit grandma from San Jose to Austin - a 4+ hour airflight that we were somewhat nervous about. We packed our fruit pouches and other goodies. It became a special treat as we rolled out to the tarmac and then took off into the sky. She happily ate and when she was done, sat quietly and contently looking at the pouch...pointing at the bunny and the orange and the banana, (we told/showed her there was a mango too).<br /><br />When we ran out of pouches, we went to the whole foods - but they were not yet available there. They did have another brand, which we reluctantly purchased because unlike the peter rabbit pouches - the cap was so tiny, it could be a serious choking hazzard should it get into the hands (or mouth) of our little lady. The combination was also different and she didnt really care for the other kind as much.<br /><br />Though she cant say alot of words, she does sign quite a few and she runs to the pantry, points and signs "more, please...more please!! please!!" Which is pretty funny to see.<br /><br />We took some video the day they arrived, I'll have to see if I can find it and post as part of the review.<br /><br />All the best!

review/text: I'm not sure of the intended age range of this product, but I've seen similar products marketed as baby food and figured that this product, having no added sugars, was essentially the same thing. I gave some to my infant (who has been eating solids for about 3 months now and was formerly introduced to all ingredients individually) and he was loving it and I was also enjoying the convience of the product until I noticed him starting to drool blood! I quickly took the package away and saw that he had some pretty good cuts on his tongue from the sharp edges on the packaging. Ouch!<br /><br />I think this is a great idea for a nutricious convience snack but something definately needs to be done about the sharp edges. Who want's 'paper cuts' on their tongue?

Later, my children kept asking me to buy more so I went online to find out where I could purchase them. I found that Amazon.com sold them and in other flavors. I bought 1 box of each flavor. My niece also purchased them from Amazon. Peter Rabbit Organics 100% Pure Fruit Snack is great for everyone! I would recommend you buy it for your children and try it yourself.

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: This is ingenious and one of those products where it just makes so much sense. These are so handy to be able to toss into a bag without having t worr about it leaking. It works for babies still on puree or even a toddler snack. Ive even caught my husband snacking on this before, too.<br /><br />My boys really enjoy the apple grape flavor and refer to it as their choice of applesauce. It's perfect for on the go, on a drive or on a plane ride for a healthy snack that is easy to use without having to bring your own utensils or making a mess.

review/text: We first saw these at Starbucks, and picked them up as a special treat.  I love that they are 100% organic and they're in neat little no-mess pouches.  My 8 y/o loves them in his lunch!  He also eats a banana mix pouch on the way to his sports practices (he used to eat a jar of banana baby food, but that was getting too embarrassing for him -- and for some reason, bananas on the counter manage to turn brown before they're eaten -- guess banana in the peel is not as attractive as banana in a pouch).  I've read some people ranting about the sugar content, but there is no added sugar.  It's only the sugar from the fruit itself -- if you're that concerned about sugar, don't eat fruit.  We love them!!

review/summary: Great, but not an equal distribution
review/text: This is really a great way to have breakfast at your office or practically anywhere.  However, they don't give you an equal distribution of the various cereals.  Here is the breakdown (from the side of the box):<br /><br />16: 2.1oz Frosted Flakes<br /><br />8 : 1.5oz Froot Loops<br /><br />12: 2.8oz Rasin Bran Crunch<br /><br />10: 1.5oz Apple Jacks<br /><br />10: 1.5oz Corn Pops<br /><br />4(!): Cocoa Rice Krispies<br /><br />The main reason I got this over using regular boxes was that I wanted a variety of different cereals.  However, there are way too many Frosted Flakes and far too few Rice Krispies.  Kind of takes the "variety" out of variety pack.

And they're not too bad for you either. Considering they're all the "sugary" cereals your Mom complained about when you were a kid. In fact the one with the highest calorie count (280) is the Rasin Bran, and that's something that would actually be considered "healthy". All the rest fall into the 160-220 range.

review/summary: NEW assortment
review/text: EDIT: I edited my original review today because the contents in the assortment have changed. I just got a new box and inside there were:<br />13 - Frosted Flakes<br />10 - Apple Jacks<br />9 - Cocoa Krispies<br />8 - Froot Loops<br />8 - Raisin Bran Crunch<br />6 - Corn Pops<br />6 - Frosted Mini Wheats<br /><br />I don't know why they don't make the distribution of each type more equal (8 or 9), but they don't. I imagine some must be cheaper to make or something. Still, at least the ones with the most (Frosted Flakes and Apple Jacks) aren't my family's least liked ones and it is a little more evenly distributed than it used to be. We used to always have leftover Raisin Bran Crunch and with each new shipment, the backlog of those got bigger and bigger. At least the upped the Cocoa Krispies allotment!<br /><br />Warning: boring review follows! ha ha: I was interested in buying these individual servings of cereal for my family and wondered if the cups, bowls or little boxes were cheapest per ounce.  The cups hold more than the bowls and boxes(usually about twice as much based on cereal type). I mean we would have eaten 2 bowls if it was really cheaper that way.<br /><br />I went to the kelloggs site to compare how much cereal was in the cups versus how much in the individual bowls or the little boxes.  The bowls, cups and boxes all seem to end up costing fractions of pennies of one another ounce per ounce.  I didn't add up all the kinds per variey pack and see which grand total costed pennies more or less based on ounce (I am not THAT frugal), but picked corn pops and frosted flakes to compare.  The prices for all the kinds are very comparable, so if your wondering which type to buy, it doesn't really add up to much difference. I do check these things because sometimes the big "value" sizes are actually more expensive per ounce/gram than the little sizes.  Those marketing people are tricky!<br /><br />Therefore, if you want to have more little bowls or you pick the cups (that have more in each), you can make your choice and know you won't be spending way more either way.  I skipped choosing the boxes because I liked the convenience of the bowls, but honestly the carboard boxes are probably better for the planet (but anyway, I will save some energy, water, and soap by not washing bowls!)  Now all they need to do is sell a cute little dispenser for my counter and I will never go back to boxes!

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's cereals contain genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in Kellogg's this products. YUK!!!! They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that they use GMO corn, soy, sugar and canola in their products. Frosted Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT and neither are any of Kellogg's other products. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled. Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries. We are boycotting all Kellogg's products. Join GMO Free USA, a grassroots consumer email initiative that is contacting Kellogg en masse with emails to tell them to Just Label It or remove it. Americans have the right to know what's in their food! [...]

review/text: First the good:<br /><br />Great value - about $1 for each small container. At a convenience store or cafeteria you'd pay double that.<br /><br />Handy - The container serves as a bowl so all you have to do is find some milk & a spoon & your good to go.<br /><br />Taste - The cereals that this "assortment" pack offers are pretty tasty. All of them are popular items so you aren't left with a bunch of cereal containers that no one wants to eat.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />Unhealthy - Unfortunately all the cerals are tasty but loaded with sugar. All cereal containers range from 160 calories (Apple Jacks) to 240 calories (Rainsin bran w/ granola).<br /><br />Bottom line: If you need a quick breakfast at a good price that everyone will like but is not too nutricious --this is the option for you!

review/text: lets see here;<br /><br />Frosted Flakes: Frosted flakes are great, that frosting on the flakes never really leaves when you add milk, but i don't find myself getting them that often, but when I see them in the drawer, I'm happy.<br /><br />Corn pops: Corn pops are not the type of cereal you'd buy. If there was nothing else to eat at your home, and then you saw some pops on the shelves, you'd be happy, but they have a weird taste....and come in a different bag compared to the others, so they're never on my shelves.<br /><br />Froot loops: froot loops are good, but after one bowl of 'em, you'd wish you had eaten some other cereal. Unless its that time when they have marshmallows in them, they're nothing special, just colorful.<br /><br />Raisin Bran: Why are these in the pack? I'm reviewing kids' cereals in detail! you think I've ever eaten raisin bran? whatever, they are just corn flakes with raisins.<br /><br />Cocoa krispies: Very good. In the beginning all those moist chocolate bits are good, but after you eat 30% of the bowl, the pieces become soggy and you don't get a satisfying crunch or taste, even if you are lucky enough to get a spoonful.<br /><br />Apple Jacks: These are pretty good, they smell good, and some of them are green! although i must say, the new advertising campaign is lame. The old "they don't taste like apples" commercials were great because it made you wonder why they were called apple jacks, and made you buy 'em. the new "cinnamon is the winna, mon" campaign is lame, why are you all of a sudden advertising its cinnamon taste, these aren't cinnamon toast crunches, they're apple jacks! ever since the new commercials, I've gotten this cereal less.<br /><br />So, 3 winners, 1 ok one, 1 not-so-good one, and one black sheep that I can't comment on, enjoy and don't forget the milk!

review/summary: Great Sugar Cereal
review/text: I bought this cereal assortment instead of the "Wellness Assortment" to try something different. The "Wellness Assortment" is alot better, however totally different cereals.<br /><br />There are very few "Fruit Loops" but plenty of "Frosted Flakes" in this assortment. None of the cereals have any protein or fiber, ok maybe 1 gram. I was hungry an hour later after eating this stuff. Although, Pops, Fruit Loops, and Apple Jacks taste awesome. They're a great replacement to greasy potato chips or fatty ice cream.<br /><br />The "Wellness Assortment" has alot more protein and fiber, and also tastes great. On the other hand it has a lot of Special K cereal, some have "red berries" (stawberries) though.<br /><br />Leave this sugar cereal to the kids (or keep as a snack) and get the "Wellness Assortment" for yourself. It may cost a little more but it's worth it.

review/summary: Good variety
review/text: I have read in other reviews that the variety was not great. I did not have that problem. I did not receive equal amounts of each cereal, but it was very close. I received 6 Cocoa Krispies and 11 Frosted Flakes, that is the smallest and the largest number of one variety.  The rest were fairly evenly distributed.  The packaging is convenient; there are only two of us in the house and we do not eat cereal regularly, so boxes of cereal end up going stale and being thrown out.  With the single serve cups we can have cereal when we want and not worry about wasting half of a box.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes the types of cereal in the variety that is looking for something quick and convenient.

review/summary: Who packs these boxes?
review/text: This is the first review I have ever written about a product, and I have bought over 300 to 500 items from amazon. I just wonder who packs these boxes? When you advertise a variety pack of 60 with 7 different cereals, one thing that does not come to my mind, is somebody packing the box with what you feel like giving them. Not everybody's favorite cereal is frosted flakes in my case, and or raisin bran for somebody else buying this product. When you spend $56.00 for 7 different kinds of cereal, that's what you think your getting, not what they have more on hand of at the time. There should be an equal distribution of each kind, and if they can not do this please specify this in the product details so consumers are not mislead. Because if I wanted frosted flakes I would go buy a box at the store. The Variety idea is great, but the spending $56.00 for a mystery box of cereal is not. Thanks.

review/summary: Good purchase, but beware of broken seals.
review/text: I ordered the Kellogg's Cereal Variety Pack because I figured I might be able to save a few bucks compared to buying regular boxes of cereal that typically end up going stale when there's enough left for 3-4 bowls.<br /><br />The big box arrived (trust me, it's huge), and one of the first things I noticed when I picked it up was the sound of cereal rattling around inside.  Immediately I suspected that one of the cereal cups may have broke, but I never expected to find that 15 of the cups had broken seals - because of this, a lot of cereal was spilled inside the shipping box, plus I ended up throwing away the bad cups which meant my pack of 60 turned into a pack of 45.<br /><br />So buyer beware - while this is a decent bargain if you're looking to save some money, you might get a box that contains cups with broken seals.

review/text: Product comes with a large selection of cereals.  Price was reasonable especially since I had a coupon.  Not something I would buy everyday as a box of cereal is cheaper.  The raisin bran crunch was absolutely awesome.  I never would have bought it without trying it first and now it is one of my favorite cereals.  This product would be great for a daycare or babysitters with young children for breakfast.  Easy to clean up and easy to prepare, no extra dishes needed except a spoon.  Plus the container is recyclable.

review/summary: Hubby likes these when he's plowing
review/text: We were buying these at the grocery store last year for $1/each but we can't find them this year.  I bought a case of these for my husband.  He likes them when he's out plowing all night.  He just brings milk in a plastic cup with a lid.<br /><br />I wish you could pick the # of each that you want.  We don't like the raisin crunch one and hate that we give them away or just eat them.<br /><br />Nothing healthy here so don't buy this if you're trying to lose weight or watch your fiber intake.  It's also alot of cereal, I could have used half of it.  But it serves it's purpose for my husband & it's worth getting them for him.

review/summary: Needs more variety
review/text: This is a fairly decent package with an uneven distribution. Instead of receiving 10 cups of each product as one might anticipate, the box has twice the number of cups of Frosted Flakes and about six cups of Cocoa Puffs. Unfortunately, the Raisin Bran Crunch is the spoiler in this package. The raisins are tough, difficult to chew, and lay on the bottom of the cup so don't expect to find any raisins until the cereal is just about gone.

review/text: I used to be a dedicated customer of Kellogg's...then I started educating myself in nutrition, agriculture, and health. Why doesn't Kellogg's USA properly label their plethora of "food" products as containing genetically engineered ingredients? They have no problem manufacturing non-GMO cereals for other countries, and label appropriately those which do contain it. I own a small food manufacturing company, myself, and I am proud to be able to label ALL of my ingredients as non-GMO and organic. (It doesn't cost a dime!) I am a diligent label reader, and I vote with my dollars! My friends and family do the same. We can win this, folks! Peace.

review/summary: House blend perfection, excellent 'small bags' packaging
review/text: The house blend has a well-balanced taste that goes well with the frothed milk in the cappuccino and makes quite enjoyable espressos too. This is actually pretty competitive in price with the 32-ounce bags that you can find at some of the big discount stores and it has the advantage that, having 3 bags, the coffee can be kept fresher. The combined 36 ounces should be enough for some 30+ Venti equivalent, only stronger.<br /><br />Briefly:<br /><br />- one month or so of daily cappuccinos or double-espressos or daily Venti-size coffees<br />- coffee stays fresher as when compared to the big discount stores 32-ounce bags because it comes in THREE sealed bags<br />- the house blend happens to be my favorite<br />- price is only slightly higher than what you can get in a discount store but the 3-bag packaging makes up for it<br /><br />As of June 30, 2009, it was not available as a subscription item. I would subscribe without hesitation if it was.

review/text: To say that this coffee was a disappointment is an understatement.  I purchased what was supposed to be a medium blend but upon opening the bag it was very apparent that it had been over-roasted.  It was dark for sure - too the point of almost being burnt.  I made a cup to try it just in case that's the way it is and found it typical of a cup of coffee you get at the local Starbucks store, burnt.  Now I need to get that taste out of my mouth with a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: The flavor that lasts for minutes--five minutes
review/text: I had this gum for the first time yesterday, and I was so disappointed. The gum tastes great It has a pleasant fruity flavor to it. It's too bad the flavor lasts for less than ten minutes.<br />As a test, I had another whole piece today, and again, in a few short minutes, no more flavor. Then, I took another piece and this time bit it in half, and the flavor lasts for half the time (which never happens with other gum like Trident).<br />When I bite on it, there is a tiny gooey center which, after chewing, blends in with the rest of the gum. But after five minutes, the flavor is gone. There's a faint taste, but it isn't enjoyable.<br />Until you plan on wasting your money and spitting out and chewing more gum every five minutes, stay away from these Mentos Gum. If you want fruity flavor, try something with a much longer-lasting flavor such as Trident or Orbit.

review/summary: Slightly variations from the Mint Flavor
review/text: I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points. The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing. Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring. Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part. The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor. Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable. I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes. Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.<br /><br />Now in regards to this particular flavor of red fruit lime, I find that the flavor lasts slightly longer as compared to the mint flavor.  Still not long enough, but just a smidgeon longer.  Additionally, the packaging is deceptive, because the core of the gum is most certainly not green colored.

Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Delicious, BUT it contains MSG!
review/text: If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! "You can't eat just one!"<br />It contains MSG and other "stuff." - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though...

review/summary: jerky is yummy
review/text: I can't always get to the store on my bicycle, so it is quite handy to use Amazon & order something I hanker for.  The beef jerky, high in protein & low in calories, fat & carbs, absolutely hit the spot when it arrived nice & quickly!

review/summary: Too pricy
review/text: 28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.99, aybe 7 or 8 dollars, but not 28 for one pack..  I know is easy to buy online, but buying this, is just playing lazy!

review/summary: Good, healthy and protein filled snack.
review/text: I only have one major issue. Because of the texture of jerky in general it really gets stuck in your teeth and becomes a bit of a chore to eat.
