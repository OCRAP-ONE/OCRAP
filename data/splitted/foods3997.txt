review/summary: Way, way, way too sweet
review/text: It's my fault. I should've read the nutrition facts and saw how much sugar is in this jerky. It was an expensive mistake. I now have $40 worth of beef jerky that tastes like candy. At first I thought they sent me teriyaki by mistake, but no, it's the original recipe. To me, if the organic beef is so great, you don't need to cover it up with a bunch of sweetness. I want to taste the meat, not the evaporated cane juice. I hate to give this product a bad review as it's just my personal taste. It's not a bad product--it's completely organic with no nitrites. It's tender. It just tastes like a meat lollipop.

review/summary: Good Quality... When it's not moldy
review/text: First shipment was great. This product is priced really well and tastes great. However, when opening one of the bags I saw that the jerky had some mold on it. When I looked inside all of the meat was covered in mold. The date on the packaging for expiration was mid December 2012, no where near the date. Good thing I didn't eat a piece!

review/summary: PERFECT JERKEY
review/text: When Trader Joe's stop selling organic peppered jerky I was very disappointed but thanks to Amazon I'm back in Jerky Heaven! The peppered beef Jerky is awesome, a little sweet on the first bite but then the pepper kicks in and its explodes with a good old jerky flavor and a hot bite thats leaves you wanting more. This is quality Jerky that is cheaper than buying in the stores if you sign up for the delivery plan.

review/summary: Great jerky, not too sweet
review/text: I really like jerky, and I love this stuff.  It is expensive, but it also doesn't have a huge list of chemicals like the non-organic brands.  It is a bit more tender than I am used to, but it really is good (and I have been buying the convenience store jerky my whole life).  Some reviews say it is too sweet.  It is a touch sweet, but I really don't think it is "too sweet."<br /><br />I just bought my second batch of 8 pouches, this new order is for Teriyaki.

review/summary: decent, not great
review/text: This jerky is very moist, so moist in fact that I might not even call it jerky. It has the texture kind of like those beef-flavored dog treats you get. Flavor is OK, but nothing special. I could almost go so far as to call it "bland", but that would only be in comparison to other jerkies I have eaten. I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again.

review/text: A friend got me hooked on this beef jerkey- gluten free, cheaper than Trader Joe's and organic. I get the "ORIGINAL" TYPE - it is not too spicy, not too sweet and not too salty! And no MSG! Also, it isn't too chewy which can be a problem since my husband had jaw surgery. We take this on flights, car trips and snowboarding and it travels wonderfully. When you order it, it will arrive immediately....I am always shocked how fast it gets to my house.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This is by far one of the worst beef jerky I've EVER tried. I bought this because of all the positive reviews but remarkably, the other one star review is most accurate. It boggles my mind how this product is so loved. I was so excited thinking I found the perfect jerky: organic, reasonably priced. So what's wrong with it: Mainly the taste. It has almost no flavor other than meat. Although it's organic it, has the texture and taste of being highly processed. Again, I don't mind that if it tasted good - it doesn't! And the after taste is -- ugghghhh!!! get the mouthwash! like roadkill exploded in my mouth.<br /><br />So I ended up spending over $40 and got 8 bags of which I couldn't finish even one. I tried to find a way to use it somehow, I tried deep-frying it, only intensified the horrible taste - this time more chemical like, I think it may have been the preservatives. I'm tossing them all out. Don't buy this.<br /><br />PS: I purchased this from Amazon but "verified purchase" is not showing up for some reason.

review/summary: Strong sharp fizzy lemonade!
review/text: I'm rather a fan of this and the Brainalyzer, which in turn is not the same as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IVWKCQ">BRAIN WASH</a> from the same producers. All three sodas (and all three are heavily carbonated) feature a respectable list of herbal powders added to the drink. I've already disposed of my first bottle of Brainalyzer (although I'll be ordering more--not from Amazon unfortunately as they don't offer it yet), but while it and the BLaid share some overlapping ingredients the list seems entirely identical between the BLaid and the BWash. Except for the strong infusion of lemon concentrate and lemon oil, of course: so this is BWash with enough lemon to punch the back of your throat. (Not enough to pucker your mouth, though; it isn't _that_ strong.) And some darker dye.<br /><br />The Brainalyzer has a much lighter taste (and color)--doubtless the fact that the next most prevalent ingredient after water is honey helps out a lot!--but both are quite peppery. No false aftertastes in either drink, just the lingering peppery notes. (I would have thought ginger, but based on the ingredient lists I'm going to guess gingko.) They're pretty much all natural except for the dyes. Pure cane sugar, too.<br /><br />This is probably not meant to be guzzled by anyone as a quick refreshing drink. It's a sipping drink, for the experience of doing so. Obviously it's also very expensive (unless you already buy a ton from Amazon and so have signed up for free shipping by paying the upfront Amazon Prime fee--and even then it runs more than $2.00 a bottle for a 12 oz drink!) I can't say I'd recommend buying a case of it, if you're even slightly apprehensive about the taste from this description. But you can buy single bottles of this and very many other exotic/regional sodas (including the Brainalyzer, although not yet the Brain Wash) elsewhere on the internet.<br /><br />(The store might be nixed by Amazon censors, but it's an old thirteen times four, if that helps any.)

review/text: For starters, the product itself is awesome. The bottle is hilarious and all my friend's got a kick out of it. The drink however was very bitter. I for one like sour things so I enjoyed it, but some of my friends didn't. The drink is literally black. If you hold it up to a bright light all you will see is black with a red tint. Even the fizz from the carbonation when you pour into a cup is black! It was just awesome! I would recommend this to anyone. Even if you don't like the drink, its still an awesome thing to have.<br /><br />The 12 sodas shipped in a sturdy box, and I was not disappointed with the shipping.

review/text: I have a six-quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn - perfect, right? Not so much - I find that they make too much - by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper - if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though - the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.<br /><br />Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs - I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too.

review/summary: Awesome!! Order this popcorn!
review/text: Last year I bought a popcorn machine for my son's carnival birthday party and needed some popcorn kits to go along with it.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with Great Northern popcorn because it had a lot more review. WRONG CHOICE!  It was terrible! It's had a chemical-like smell and was EXTREMELY salty -- and I am a person that salts everything and it was way too salty for me to even eat. It was just all around nasty popcorn.<br /><br />This year I decided I'm going to break out the popcorn machine and use it again, but I needed to get different popcorn.  I wanted to allow myself enough time this year that if I didn't like the popcorn I ordered, I would have time to order replacements before the party.  Last week I ordered the Real Theater popcorn kits and OMG! I LOVE it!  It tastes really good like movie theater popcorn or the popcorn you get at the popcorn carts at the zoo or amusement parks.  My house smelled really good like popcorn you just had to have.  I even stepped outside for a little bit and walked back in to see how the smell would hit you if you were just walking in the house.  It was fabulous!

You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping. While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl. Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is about $2.40 per pack (or $1.66 per pouch in the 15 pack), which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

review/summary: BEST POPCORN EVER!
review/text: I have tried so many kinds of popcorn, beginning with those for the microwave.  Then I went to an  electric popcorn maker and tried various popcorns.  When I got the Whirley, the Wabash Valley Farms was the first popcorn I tried for it.  I was immediately amazed. This pops larger than any one I've ever tried.  Much larger.  And the flavor cannot be beat.  It is truly an exceptional popcorn and I will never again use a different one.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this "Real Theater" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is "bad" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of "real" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be "artificial" and "thick".  "Thick", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent "real theaters" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.

I will stick to making great popcorn right on my stove and much cheaper. I just use a heavy 3qt saucepan, add popcorn, salt, oil and butter all right in the pan. Much better than any of these store bought kits.

It's very simple and easy to make, just pour in the the kernels into a stove pot and mix in the supplied seasoning and butter mix, put a lid on top and in minutes you'll hear popping. Each bag makes a lot of popcorn which is nice and if you do it just right none of it burns.

review/summary: Strange coconut aroma
review/text: I recently tried the five pack Wabash "Real theater popcorn."  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.<br />So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more "smelly" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie.

review/text: I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but I did base my purchase on reviews I had seen on both Amazon & another site, which were all glowing.  So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.<br /><br />Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.<br /><br />This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1/2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.<br /><br />I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.  But I'm going back to, & sticking with, my old method.  I think it must be the locally grown corn (FRESH!) that spoiled me.

review/summary: These cans will always arrive severely dented but the contents are delicious
review/text: When buying very large cans from Amazon.com, you should expect all of the cans to arrive either slightly dented or severely dented. Large cans have more mass than small cans and become dented much more easily. If both the top and bottom of the can become severely dented, opening the can will become extremely difficult. Despite this disadvantage, the whole button mushrooms inside each can are delicious to eat and it's difficult to resist drinking the salt water inside each can because it tastes so good - as good as soup.  The whole button mushrooms in this product are too large to use directly on pizza.  You will need to slice these mushrooms yourself or better yet, purchase cans of one of Roland's smaller-sized whole button mushrooms or purchase their sliced button mushrooms.

review/text: I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />Honeybush is a very interesting "tea." It's not technically tea since it's from a different plant; that being the case it's a completely caffeine free alternative to (typically) green tea. This is a very fragrant tea and has a very earthy, somewhat grassy flavor. The description says it increases appetite, but I've also read the opposite on other honeybush labels. It also says it has a somewhat sweet flavor, but I haven't found this to be true. I typically blend it with green tea as I find they compliment each other and are both high in flavonoids and antioxidants.<br /><br />Since honeybush is really more of an herb, you need to use a little more for brewing. On it's own you'd want to use about 2-3 teaspoons to every 8 ounces of water at 212 degrees for about 3-5 minutes. If you blend it with green tea, make sure not to brew above 180 degrees as any higher will cause the green tea to become bitter.

review/text: t's a close call, but if you're someone who eats breakfast in transit, Kashi Granola Bars have an edge over both the Nutrigrain too-sweet entries and the crumbly Nature Valley competitors. Neither a treat nor a treatment, Kashi Granola bars are light and just right--a way to get started without either residual guilt over a 7 A.M. candy bar or aversion to grandma's recommended fiber remedy. One warning: they go down easy, so don't take more than a single one with you in the car (or you could wind up scarfing down all six bars between traffic lights). Also, Amazon ships these three-buck packages in a generous-sized box, which may strike some consumers as ecologically irresponsible (wish I'd saved these boxes for a recent move of my mother-in-law. I think I ended up paying more for comparable new ones than the cost of the granola bars).

review/text: These are good granola bars.  We buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here.  The only problem is sometimes they get very hard (the grocery store ones are softer).  I'm not sure if that's from shipping here in a cold climate or what.  Also, the expiration date can be very close.  I was getting low on the bars and then ordered more and realized the expirate date is coming up in a few weeks when the last case had a later date.  So it makes me wonder how fresh these are.

review/text: I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!

review/text: Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong. Acidity is on a low side, but with plenty of pleasant taste. At the same time you can drink this coffee black w/o the need for the sweetener and/or milk. This coffee is in European tradition and will please many people. I would recommend it after dinner, but not if you need a jolt to wake you up.

review/summary: My mom said this was not as flavorful as other "Extra Bolds"
review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/text: I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.

Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

review/text: I'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled.  What you're seeing is a GENERIC ingredient list that covers multiple coffees.  What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol

Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.

review/text: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.
