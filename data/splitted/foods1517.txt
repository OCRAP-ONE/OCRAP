review/summary: Ella's Kitchen Organic Baby Food Strawberry and Apples
review/text: My son loved this. He actually likes this more than any other baby fruit. This is also very convenient. If you do not use it all at one time, then you just put the cap back on and put it in the fridge. They also take up less space in the diaper bag, and you do not have to worry about the jar busting.

review/summary: My Toddler Vegetable Snob is a BIG Fan!
review/text: These little pouches are great for toddlers who refuse to eat their vegetables in the conventional way. My son started getting picky around 18 months and I was on the verge of desperation when I found these at BRU. (They are also carried at a certain big box store that has a bulls eye logo.) Yes, they are marketed for babies, and are almost two bucks a pop, but my son ALWAYS finishes these pouches, which is more than I can say for most things he eats, and I feel much better knowing he ingested something green! Yay for Ella's kitchen! Oh. and I also recommend the pumpkin version. Super yummy!

review/summary: Great for babies and toddlers!
review/text: I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.

review/text: I just started buying this product. It is not available in local stores. I went to Target last Sunday and saw these so I decided to gave it a try. My baby happen to love these as much as Happy Baby products. I am surprised to see it here on Amazon. So next time I will buy it from here. It tastes great. My baby loves it. Yeah it is kind of expensive but if your child loves it then I would buy it for the child. They do go on sale too. If you have WIC ( Women , Infant and Children) You can buy these from Target Because only Target carry these here. I am not sure if Amazon accepts WIC.  Over all a great product I would recommend it.

Remember, sugar is a natural ingredient.  Just keep the intake to reasonable levels.  Sure beats the synthetic sweeteners (Sucral..., Acusul...-K, etc).  If sugar makes you feel fat, get more active and burn off the calories.  You will feel better all around.

review/summary: Talking Rain is excellent sparkling water
review/text: This is a handy way to get sparkling water (via the UPS man)!  And this product is truly delicious - no after taste just.  I like plain carbonated water, but to add flavor, I just thoroughly mix a little one-serving package of Wyler's or Crystal Light or Miro in a little plain water and then pour in the TalkingRain and I have orange or lemon or whatever calorie-light soda.  My first shipment was not packaged properly and some cans were damaged and leaking but Amazon took care of that by sending out a replacement shipment right away which arrived thoroughly bubble wrapped and in the proper size box.  I'll reorder this fine product.

review/summary: Very bubbly
review/text: Talking Rain sparkling water is the most bubbly sparkling water I've tried.  The other brands (Perrier, San Pellegrino, and other random brands I've picked up from the grocery store) have a disappointing lack of bubbliness.  Club soda (which has sodium bicarbonate or another alkaline salt added) is bubbly, but it tastes weird.  The talking rain cans hiss when you open them, and when you pour the water into a glass, it foams up nicely.  It's perfect for making homemade ginger ale.

review/summary: Canned water. Awesome.
review/text: I was thinking to myself the other day "Why don't they make canned water?"<br /><br />Well, now they do!  My only complaint is this is carbonated water and I would prefer just plain water in a can, but I can deal with a bit of the bubbly.<br /><br />The cans arrived on time with no dents. My purpose for these was to keep with my other canned food in case of hurricanes or other emergencies where I may lose power and utilities to my home.<br /><br />Unfortunately these are so tasty I have been drinking them every day, ruining any plans I had for long term storage.  I really like that there are no additives, no corn syrup, and no artificial sweeteners. Just delicious, bubbly, water.<br /><br />EDIT 10/2012 - I have now ordered 4 shipments of this water, and have received only one shipment that was not damaged or leaking.  The most recent shipment had 4 cans burst, soaking everything in the package. Thankfully there was nothing else in the box (like food or electronics) that was damaged.  The one shipment that was not damaged came in about 7 layers of bubble wrap.  All the others (the leaky ones) had only a single layer of wrap, which is not even close to being adequate protection.  My UPS guy gets rather concerned when packages make hissing noises and leak fluid all over his truck... he was relieved when I informed him it was just water.  Until Amazon fixes their packaging issues I will not be ordering this product again.

review/summary: Super sparkly sparkling water.
review/text: There is a reason that they call this "Talking Rain" seltzer.  It is one of the loudest cans of carbonated beverage that I have ever opened.  Since I love very carbonated water, I think this is great!<br /><br />However, if it's possible to switch to a home carbonation system, I'd recommend that.  I'm a bit worried about consuming so much trace aluminum.  That's the reason I gave it four stars - because I think it's worth going for carbonated water that doesn't have aluminum or BPA exposure as a required part.

review/summary: Most affordable sparkling water. Shipped free!
review/text: Super Saver shipping makes this one heck of a deal.<br />I love water, and I love Soda, who doesn't love Soda? But the problem is the sugar...  Sparkling water satisfies my thirst for bubbles/fizz in my beverage but buying it at the grocery store can be just as expensive as buying soda. Then i found this sweet deal on Amazon.<br /><br />I read some reviews from people who obviously never had "sparkling water" before...  what NOOBS!!! *facepalm*. Sparkling water HAS a "taste", some people don't like it. If you are one of those people, you were looking for WATER, not sparkling water! All sparkling/seltzer water taste the same, no matter what brand. The benefit here is that its really cheap.<br /><br />PLEASE, DO NOT confuse sparkling water with "tonic water". These are two different things. They look and feel the same, but taste much different. They are made differently too, (see: greatist.com/health/dangerfood-tonic-water-032712/). If you don't like sparkling water you will probably HATE the sour taste of Tonic water. They are easily confused because they appear to be the same, but they aren't.<br /><br />PRODUCT CONS: I noticed that the effervescence of Talking Rain faded away very quickly compared to "other waters" I consume. So if you open a can, you have to consume it quickly or else it will just be warm and flat. No good.<br /><br />That is it! I am glad I found this product!!!

review/summary: Good Deal.....Just Average Powder
review/text: This is a good tasting powder for the money you pay.  It's one of the best deals on Amazon for onion powder to be sure.  The powder itself carries very little in the way of onion aroma, but more importantly tastes much better with a sample on your tongue, and in your recipes.  I have never tasted any real difference between a pure talc like powder like this is, and a granulated one that a lot of people seem to prefer.  Granulated sometimes costs a little more, so I would advise you to make sure that's what you want before ordering this brand.  It's certainly not the best I have ever had, but a good powder at a very reasonable price here on Amazon, and well worth it for your kitchen in my opinion...Recommended

review/summary: More Mocha Than Peppermint
review/text: I'm not the biggest fan of powder creamers, but Coffee-Mate has always been the best of all I've ever used.  That being said, my wife purchased this for me to compliment the flavor of any unpleasantly cheap coffee I would subjected to while deployed overseas, and I was thankful for it.  While it did the job of making plain coffee taste better, I was disappointed by the lack of peppermint flavor (she got it for me specifically because of my love of mint).  The smell is sweet, and you get hints of both mocha and a little peppermint.  However the flavor of peppermint is lacking, and you're more or less left with a mocha creamer that only tastes slightly different than an ordinary mocha creamer.<br /><br />It may not completely live up to its name, but I would still recommend it.

review/text: I would like it if there was more peppermint flavor, especially this peppermint. But it is still good. The blend of the mocha is so subtle. I bought it to salvage the nasty bitter and acidic taste of an expensive but cheap coffee. This creamer wasn't able to completely camaflouge the cigarette taste, but probably would have if I had used half the bottle. It did a better job at disguising one of the decaf coffees, though. I found a small bottle of it at Schneuks tor $2.50. I think it was 16 oz. I'd buy this again, as well as buying a peppermint syrup.

We love it as an ice cream or frozen yogurt sauce (it's surprising how many flavors work with raspberry - try peach, in particular), as well as on fruit or in dessert recipes. It's highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. I also carefully freeze fresh raspberries when they're at the peak of the season and this is as good as the syrups that I've labored to make at that time of year. It does tend to be a bit sweet; this simply encourages us to use less.

review/summary: Natural Taste, Very Strong
review/text: I love this syrup. I make individual sodas at home and a good raspberry flavor has been a challenge.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2R2">Torani Syrup, Raspberry, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a> has an acceptable but still very artificial taste. The Monin syrup produces a well flavored very pale pink soda. I use less than a tablespoon to 8 oz of seltzer and it's perfect. No weird aftertaste, nothing overpowering. Excellent product.

review/summary: Great Seasoning!
review/text: We used to buy this seasoning at our local Sam's club under the "Tone's Citrus Grill" name. Tone's & Durkee are owned by the same company so it was a no brainer when I found this product on Amazon as Sam's does not carry the Durkee brand and Tone's does not make it any more. Glad I found this on Amazon as we use this seasoning a lot!

review/text: This economical source of Citrus Grill is excellent.  It is the same as Jone's and much less costly.  Since we use a lot of it, for all kinds of foods, salads as well as fish, etc., and since Jone's chooses to take theirs off the market from fall to spring, this is the perfect answer.  We use it year round.

review/text: We used to buy this spice at Sa_'s Club and when they stopped carrying it - had given up. I even contacted the company, but with shipping charges, it seemed too expensive, but Amazon was cheaper with the free shipping, we're fans again. This is an excellent way to season chicken, fish, especially salmon. You don't even need time to marinade... Just pour the Citrus Grill on frozen chicken breasts and throw them on the bbq grill. Flip and season again. I cooked a batch for some coworkers a year ago and 5 ended up buying the seasoning for themselves. Your chicken will be every bit as good as restaurants... Fish is also excellent, again no prep time, just season and cook. Your guests will be amazed.

review/text: Durkee Citrus Grill Seasoning makes a great grilled salmon. I usually put it on one side and grill only with the unseasoned side down, only because turning it over on the grill manages to knock and scrape much of it off. Add plenty of fresh minced/grated garlic and apply lemon juice liberally along with the Citrus Grill. Let this all sit on the salmon for a half an hour before grilling. Mmmmmmm, good!

review/text: If you're looking to make coffeehouse style frappes, you need to get a mix! I'm a big fan of McDonald's frappes, but the money and calorie content made me rethink my indulgence. I was looking for a lo-cal frappe mix and could only find this one. I struggled with purchasing this one as it was a 3 pound bag and if I didn't like it, then what? But I'm very glad I made the purchase. I tried it as soon as it arrived- mixed 3 scoops (just shy of 1/4 cup) with 1/2 cup frozen coffee cubes, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2-1 cup ice cubes- then to make it pretty I topped with fat-free Redi-Whip and a drizzle of Hershey's lite syrup. Tastes great, creamy, not gritty as I've had with some other mixes. And to top it off it's low fat and low cal!

review/summary: 5 stars from my hubby
review/text: I bought this for my husband because he's looking for treats that are low calorie, low fat.  It's perfect for him, I think it's 100 calories for a 16 oz blended drink, and there's 45-50 servings in this bag.  That's about 55 cents per drink, not counting the milk he puts in it.  He doesn't feel guilty having one every day and it keeps him from snacking on cookies or other higher calorie goodies.  Perfect!  He loves the taste and even though this is a mocha flavor with coffee in it, he's even added 1/2 a banana to his frappe and he really likes that too.<br /><br />For me, I'm sensitive to the flavor of aspartame (I'm fine with it in diet sodas, but not in anything else for some reason... like my beloved Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum?  Even the non-sugarfree Juicy Fruit now has aspartame, it's a yucky aftertaste).  If they'd used Splenda as the only sweetener I would've loved this frappe mix, but aspartame is the last ingredient in the list and even though I didn't know that it was in the mix, as soon as I took the first sip I could taste the aspartame.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Since I bought this for my hubby and I never intended to use it myself, I didn't dock a star for it.  But, if you don't like aspartame, be forewarned.  If you're looking for a good cold treat for yourself and you're watching your calorie intake and you're fine with aspartame, this is a great mix to use.

review/text: No more, "Omigawd it's 6 am and we just ran out of milk!  Nothing's open until 8!  What will my little girl have on her cereal?"<br /><br />Put this in your pantry and you're good for a year.  Tastes great, lasts a long time.  What's not to like?  Good for packing on car-camping trips too.<br /><br />I can't believe I can't find this in stores in SF.

review/summary: UHT milk should be long life! this is not.
review/text: I bought UHT milk on-line because - amazingly - it does not seem to be ubiquitous in stores in the US as it is in the rest of the world. I need it for my disaster preparedness kit, the food supplies we store against disasters such as earthquakes which would leave us without access to electricity (including refrigerator), water, gasoline or shopping for several days. We need milk for cereal, drinks and children. I was extremely disappointed to find that, instead of a 'Use Before' date of 2 or 3 years, as I have always found on UHT milk bought in other countries, the expiry date on this product, bought in August 2011, is February 2012. This means I will have to repurchase the milk every 6 months, making it much too expensive.<br /><br />It is maddening that buying the item on-line one cannot check (or ask about) the 'Use Before' date.  I would of course check this if I could buy the milk in a store. This reminds one once again of the disadvantages of shopping on-line, with no recourse to asking questions of a person and getting essential information which affects the choice to purchase.<br /><br />I do feel that sellers on UHT milk should give their customers the LONG LIFE product they expect.

review/summary: My kids liked it!
review/text: This soup is really yummy - and very "pretty" too, with the 21 bean variety.  I have 2 boys, ages 11 and 9, who are VERY picky eaters, and they truly liked it, which says a lot!  My 9 year old and my husband were asking if we had any leftovers the next night.  I really appreciated the clear Shopping List (list of ingredients needed to put the soup together) on the box.  And, as a novice cook, I also really appreciated the detailed instructions with the Gourmet Tips about soaking the beans the night before for softer beans and how best to use a crock pot (don't open the lid during cook time for best results... who knew?!).  The Shopping List and clear directions made it so easy to make, and it was very delicious.  We made the meat version the first time, and we can not wait to make the vegetarian version next time.  Great soup mix - easy and delicious!

review/text: I made this soup mix and took it to work. The aroma filled up the office with this fabulous smell. It was very tasty and really pretty easy to make - just had to add a few ingredients like chicken, sausage, tomatoes and celery. Everybody liked it and a few asked for order information. I would recommend cooking it on low for longer rather than on hign for a less amount of time - it will result in a thicker yummier soup. It's generously loaded with beans. Enjoy!

review/text: I bought a case of this for my family and it went fast.  Everyone loves it.  It's crunchy, sweet,and the raisins are good.  Makes a great late-night snack for Dad and a quick breakfast grab on the way out the door for the kids.  A good choice for camping grub, too.  Healthy adults might need two packs for a good breakfast, but my kids seem fine with one.<br /><br />I eat mine straight out of the box with my coffee and it's great.  The Granola was fresh and tasty and the raisins added a nice bit of flavor.  It's just what you expect and good.  Recommended.

review/text: This product is almost 30% sugar! (18 grams out of 63 grams in the single-serve box) That's a greater sugar content than in ice cream or pecan pie, and much more than in Frosted Mini-Wheats. It's over four teaspoons of sugar. This single small box has 240 calories. Be careful with fat-free or low-fat products---they are often high in sugar and calories.

review/summary: Mess
review/text: I would give it no stars if that were possible. I found Enchantacat in California and my cats loved it when we would bring it home. I ordered it the first time from an Amazon Prime seller and it arrived looking like someone broke into it thinking it was something other than catnip. The seal was busted. My cats wouldn't touch it and after putting it outside by a garbage can where the stray cats in my hood congregate, and seeing it untouched, I figured it was just a bad batch.<br /><br />My boyfriend ordered it from another seller. This time it arrived sealed, but it was just nothing the cats wanted any part of. I am not sure if the forumula is different now, or if my cats are just used to bad catnip, but two batches have had no effect on drawing out cats to engage in it.<br /><br />Other catnips, when we put it down, my cats will smell it from the other side of the house. They didn't like Enchatacat. Not a fan and will no longer order it---from anywhere.

review/summary: MY DOGS BARK...YUM!
review/text: BOTH of my dogs, American Bulldogs, LOVE the Blue Buffalo Large Breed Chicken & Rice Dry Dog food! My 5 year old female American Bulldog is a picky eater and was initially hesitant when she first tried it. After taking a few sniffs and nibbles, she went for broke.  My 2 year old male American Bulldog likes almost anything so he was not a concern.  The price is reasonable and the vendor ships QUICKLY which are two thumbs up in my book.  This was a great experience all around.

review/text: My two dogs love this stuff.  One had a little bit of trouble getting used to it (the oatmeal, cranberries, and other goodies in there kind of "loosened" things up a bit, if you know what I mean, and I didn't have enough of his old food to mix the new stuff in as slowly as I'd have liked), but after a few days he returned to normal.  Now, they're both very happy with it.  And if the boys are happy, then everybody's happy.

review/summary: Good Healthy Food
review/text: I switched my dogs to Blue Buffalo from about a year ago because of skin issues my German Shepard was developing. At this point I can't remember what I was feeding him. He was about a year old at the time was around 110lbs. We walk between two and four miles a day and have been sense he was seven or eight months. After the switch I noticed his coat did gradually begin to look better. Also he lost almost 15lbs and has a lot more energy. I included his age because I am not sure if it was the food or him just growing, but it did seem more that just a coincidence. I have always had dogs and I spend a lot of time with them being very conscientious of how they are feeling. In general the other food seemed to have the same affect on him that eating fast food does on me, tastes good but I am so run down later.<br /><br />I have tried the other varieties of Blue Buffalo, but this seems to be their favorite.

review/summary: Dog won't eat it (Updated: but likes other brands)
review/text: I bought this with high hopes in my quest for a dog food that won't aggravate my dog's allergies. Unfortunately, he doesn't like this food and won't eat it until he's starving and even then he eats only a little at a time. He's never been picky about his food before until now. Then today, after about 3 days, he vomited the food a few hours after eating an entire bowl.<br /><br />Warning: If you are a first time buyer, I would recommend buying a small package to test with. Unfortunately, I purchased the 30 lb. bag that will be wasted money. I may try to see if a local shelter wants the food, but they are usually picky about feeding the dogs multiple varieties.<br /><br />I did just buy a 15 pound bag of the Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato and will give that shot before giving up on Blue Buffalo. But so far, I'm disappointed.<br /><br />------------<br />UPDATE 1/1/2012<br />I bought the Fish/Sweet Potato food and my dog likes it! I'm glad that I can stop searching for decent, wholesome dog food and buy Blue Buffalo from now on.<br /><br />I bumped this rating to 3 stars from 2 even though my dog doesn't like this particular brand. But I believe the company is trying to do the right thing and they can't please every dog's palate. I'm giving 5 stars for the Fish/Sweet Potato food.

review/text: Prior to Blue Buffalo, my dog had a tendency to vomit after every meal.  The vet told me to experiment with different brands of dog food to see which one worked best for my labrador.  Due to his sensitive stomach, Blue Buffalo was the only brand my dog could eat without throwing up afterwards.  It's a bit pricey, but he loves the stuff.

review/text: My family (me, wife, and four kids) love this product. We use it to make muffins and pancakes. It is "just add water" easy to make muffins, and there is a simple recipe for pancakes on the back. We sometimes make chocolcate-chocolate chip muffins by adding a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the mix before adding the water. We usually use a mini-muffin pan to cook the muffins and the kids love to eat them for breakfast and for snacks. All of the muffins and pancakes we make come out tasting delicious. This product was hard to find in our local grocery stores, so we were delighted to see Amazon carry it and we use the subscribe&save to make sure we don't run out. Twelve thumbs up from our family!

review/summary: Excellent product, package a bit confusing though
review/text: Purchased these because the 5 kids across the street are bored to tears this summer. Ages 4-14, Dad is laid off and the Mom is working nights unloading trucks at a Target 5 towns away. To give the Dad a break once/week, I get all 5 kids together and we make a ton of these all at once. What they don't eat coming right out of the oven while still warm, we manage to cool and freeze so they have some all week. (I got a few other flavors, too, so they have a variety).  These are good with a fair amount of choc chips in them and couldn't be easier to make: just add water and spritz the muffin tins.<br /><br />Note:  The package shows a white/vanilla muffin with chocolate chips, however, the mix is actually a chocolate muffin with choc chips. Still pretty good, just looks different than the package. To keep the kids a bit busier for a while, we add other stuff: chopped nuts, cocoa powder for even more choc flavor, added choc morsels. Then, of course, we must all 'taste' the batter before placing it in the muffin tins. Good thing I bought cases of this stuff! Gonna keep it on hand from now on: it is that good and easy.

I've even used the mix in my breadmaker on the quick bake setting and made two packages at the same time with great results. Allows you to have cake any time and especially nice for unexpected company (don't need anything but water).Bakes in less than 25 minutes even in my convection oven. The choc chip is delicious and there are 4 or 5 other flavors. Impossible to get in the grocery stores. I hope Amazon keeps offering these.
