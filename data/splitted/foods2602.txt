review/text: What a great after meal tea!  It is soothing and has a great peppermint flavor!  I often have it at work after my lunch and I love it!  If you like candy cane lane I would say you would also like this.  The primary difference is that candy cane lane is a little sweeter naturally or this tea is a little more minty, but I do not add sugar or cream to my tea so I can not speak for difference if you use extras.  Overall I have been very pleased and will buy this again when I am out!

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: After going through the sample pack of K-Cups that came with my coffee maker and a second sample pack, Caribou has become my favorite.  It's funny, but the first cup I had I was really excited (maybe the caffiene).  There were no odd flavors that stuck out to me; which is my main complaint with most coffee.  To me, many coffees have good flavor(s), but they also have an extra twang or something that throws it off.  Caribou just tastes like good coffee without any distracting tastes.

review/text: I've had my Keurig for four years, and have always liked the convenience. But honestly, I found myself almost always using it for tea because all the coffees I tried just didn't do it for me. I was in Target this morning and saw these Caribou Blend K-Cups and decided to give them a try. I'm in the middle of a huge deadline and need coffee way more than tea. So I brewed my first cup, not expecting much, and was completely blown away by the flavor, the smoothness and the lack of aftertaste. Now, for the first time in four years, I don't just like my Keurig. I love it. Best COFFEE K-Cups by a mile.

I saw the Caribou blend at Costco in 80 K cup size and gave it a try.  It's the smoothest and best tasting coffee I have ever had.  I actually prefer it to regular brewed.  By the way, it is less than $33.00 for 80 of them at Costco, much cheaper than any where else.

review/text: Let me first say great choice for ur keurig... The price is high for some as it's about fifty cents per cup for many of the K-cups. If u want to save money then buy in bulk and if u shop around u can cut this price in half. If u want or need to save more money, then buy the 15 dollar part that allows u to grind ur own beans and fill w not much more work then k-cups if u are smart and fast. I sometimes u the cups for convenience sake, but usually ground for best results and ur own blending options. Gotta run...hope this helps some people make a decision. Happy New Year! Drew... FYI... obviously the co doesn't want u to know this info as it loses them money! But on the other hand it is great help to env., if u care about that. If not do what u like.... good luck people...lol.

review/text: I finally found gluten free oats that have just the right consistency and flavor, along with a price that is not outrageous as many brands on the market. These oats have been great for cooking breakfast oatmeal and oatmeal cookies. They do not have a smoky flavor that many other brands possess.

review/summary: Good value.
review/text: Looking for gluten free oats that are won't break your grocery budget is difficult, but after having Celiac diseae for twelve years, I'm grateful for the farmers who are taking such drastic measures to create a gluten free oat! Everything has to be accounted for, each field has to be clean of other grain, each machine used has to be used only for GF oats, it's a daunting task to take on! So, thank you Legacy Valley and the other few hard working producers!<br /><br />I would have given five stars except these oats tend to come with too many husks and unrolled oats in the bag. If you don't carefully sift through them before cooking, you'll be pulling the hard husks and unrolled oat pieces out of your cookies or oatmeal bowl. My kids didn't care for that and we found Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats never contain these unappetizing little bits. I'm not affiliated with Bob's Red Mill, just giving an honest review as a long time Celiac and mom to two Celiac children.

review/text: I first bought the Cherry Pistacio from Meijer and really liked it but when I went back for more they were sold out of that flavor. I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.

I tried to demonstrate this in the video. If it's still available, clip the coupon.<br /><br />Update 09/21/12: As of 09/21/12, my local grocery store sells the Real Medleys for $1.79 a piece. I just tried Apple Walnut. Apple Walnut tastes like a hot apple pie from McDonalds. Peach Almond tastes VERY delicious as well. I'd still rather have them shipped to my door with free shipping (Amazon Prime) paying no tax and getting a free sample snack bar. Please always check to see if a coupon is available. Recently, there was a $4.00 clip this coupon. It's a shame you can't use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment. Finally, the expiration dates from Amazon are better than the grocery store. I have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01/13 from Amazon, while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012.

review/text: Ordered all 4 flavors, so far my favorites are the peach almond and apple walnut. The cherry pistachio is a bit sweet but still just as good. I love the fruit in it, because its real fruit not the fake kind that is in traditional fruity oatmeal. I also like its the perfect size to fill up on. The food here in Afghanistan is not up to par come breakfast time so I ordered these to help make better choices over sausage and donuts for a young woman trying to watch her health/weight. They are a bit pricey, I can only hope they are cheaper on the shelves, but once again I was just thankful they ship them to Afghanistan. Will definitely be buying more once I run low. They are absolutely delish!

review/summary: I love sweets but this is too sweet for breakfast
review/text: I saw the Quaker Real Medleys at my grocery store for about 2.50 a container.  I loved the thought of pistachio and cherry in an oatmeal.  When I made the product, I found it to be robust on sweetness, skimpy on cherries, and fairly generous with the almonds.  The overall sensation was that this product was really nothing to cry home about.  The flavor was fine but the brown sugar and sweetened cherries yield something that is a bit too sweet for me to turn to again as a breakfast option, especially at the current price point.  I hated that the manufacturer used a plastic 7 container.  Plastic 7 containers - unlike plastic 1 and plastic 2 - are not easily recycled.  I'll stick with Dr. McDougall oatmeal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRU3U">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Peach, Raspberry, Oatmeal & Barley, 3-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTM8">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Cranberry Oatmeal, 3.1-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />Note: This product has milk derivatives and is therefore not vegan.

review/text: It is as close as cooking it from scratch. Everyone at work has asked me about. Once I add very hot water to it, it makes the room smell as if it was being cooked on the stove top. It almost smells like out of the oven apple pie. I would suggest that you fill it up with very hot  water all the way to the top. Being careful of course not to burn yourself. I usually place it first on a saucer, so I can carry it that way. If you fill it to the line, it is very thick. By filling it all the way to the top, it makes it taste like it was freshly made and just thick enough but not thick as glue, like it would be if you only fill it to the line. Also, I like to leave it covered with the lid that comes with it for about 5-7 minutes and then enjoy it. I would definitely buy again. I do recommend it.

Yuck, if you are looking for a high nutrition, healthy, low calorie food, look elsewhere. Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar.

review/summary: Would not buy again
review/text: I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I thought the ingredients sounded promising: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, MULTI GRAIN BLEND (WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, ROLLED BARLEY, WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED RYE), DRIED SWEETENED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR), DRIED SWEETENED CRANBERRIES (CRANBERRIES, SUGAR), WALNUTS COATED WITH ROSEMARY EXTRACT, BROWN SUGAR, DEHYDRATED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR, FRUCTOSE, CINNAMON, MALIC ACID, SODIUM SULFITE FOR COLOR RETENTION), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED WHEAT, SALT, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Part of the problem, for me, was that they're just too sweet. But part of the problem was also that they had a "weird" aftertaste. Kind of metallic and "off." I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the "natural flavors"?<br /><br />Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own "flavors" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill.

review/summary: Convenient but way too many carbs and too much sugar
review/text: On its face, this seems like a quasi healthy alternative for breakfast, but no. This is something I ate before adopting a healthier lifestyle.  Now I pay attention to labels, and I encourage you to read the nutrition label before making your purchase. If it still reads okay with you, then great.<br /><br />As to the actual taste, these are very sweet, especially if you add less water for a thicker consistency. They do keep you full for several hours, and hold you over.

review/summary: These are pretty great
review/text: They have sugar and probably artificial whatever, they're not organic, blah blah blah. They're tasty and super convenient (I have them delivered to my office via subscribe and save; doesn't get much more convenient than that). That is what I was looking for, and that is what these are. They have big fruit pieces and crunchy nuts and... oaty oats. I think the apple is the best flavor, though the peach was pretty good and the berry quite acceptable (if a bit tart). Haven't tried the cherry because I don't like cherries.<br /><br />I do recommend using more water than to-the-line; I fill it to a good centimeter or so (it's kinda imprecise) above the line, and let it sit awhile to absorb.

review/summary: Better than expected, generous amount of peach, and mostly whole oats
review/text: These are fast, convenient, easy, and tasty. Sized about right for a good breakfast, especially if you add an apple or other fruit, or some cheese. What I was not expecting was how good it would taste, the amount of peach, and the whole oats. There is enough peach for some in every bite, although not as much almonds. The downside as others have stated is how much sugar there is. But overall for getting me to eat my oatmeal and for being satisfying and tasty, this is a definite recommend.

The convenience is great and you don't have to find a cup or bowl for microwaving.  Due to the cost, another reviewer mentioned to make your own.  I do not agree with this at all.  By the time you purchase the oatmeal, peaches, nuts, etc. that are in each of these, you would be spending a lot more than what these cost.  I will continue to purchase these for breakfast at work!

review/summary: Excellent, delicious, healthy, portable breakfast
review/text: I was skeptical at a "summer berry" oatmeal. It's difficult to reconstitute berries, but Quaker has managed to do it. It's slightly sweeter than I might like, but otherwise delicious.<br /><br />It's important to follow the microwave directions exactly, especially stirring before microwaving. Failure to do so will result in lumpiness and an inconsistent texture. It's ready in just 45 seconds, which is perfect when racing out the door to work.<br /><br />Also note that this is results in a thicker oatmeal than you might be used to. However, it's delicious and just right.<br /><br />It also contains 8 grams of protein, which is more than many breakfast cereals (excluding milk).<br /><br />I also keep a few at the office for those mornings I wasn't able to grab breakfast before I left.<br /><br />I've tried several other flavors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04BY6">Quaker Real Medleys Peach Almond Oatmeal</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04AF6">Quaker Real Medleys Apple Walnut Oatmeal</a>, and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The Peaches in the Peach Almond are great, but the almonds don't work as well for the texture and flavor; I will not reorder this flavor. The Apple Walnut is what you'd expect for an Apple Walnut oatmeal. It's good, but not great. I will reorder it for variety.<br /><br />I'll definitely order the berry flavor again.

The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of using Meyer lemon juice in just about everything. But the fresh fruit can be really hard to find, especially during the off-season. This is the answer to my prayers! I use this when cooking seafood, making drinks, salad dressings, baking... you name it! Always tastes fresh, and it's such a convenient way to keep this precious elixir ready to use! Thanks, Perfect Puree! :D

review/text: The shipping for all Perfect Puree items shows as $70 because if you order less than three, there's a $40 dollar service charge. It costs as much for them to ship three (since it has to be expedited) as it does to ship one. Buy 3 containers (of the same flavor or different flavors) and the shipping is $30. Which is perfectly reasonable for expedited shipping.<br /><br />Kim

review/summary: Really Great Pasta!
review/text: I love the DaVinci Pasta! These Sea Shells are my absolute favorite pasta shape for sauces. They are not too small but they are not the huge ones either. I prefer them cooked al dente. They are just a perfect "bite size" to hold lots of yummy sauce! This pasta is so good that I even eat it plain or with a tiny bit of real butter & sprinkling of various fresh grated cheeses. I can't find these, or any of the DaVinci pastas in our little rural stores, so thank goodness Amazon.com carries them! I got them for $19.48 with the Free Super Saver Shipping. My order was packaged perfectly & the pasta arrived in great condition! I highly recommend this product!

review/text: These cans are small, but it is all I need. I am over sixty and live alone, and therefore do not eat full meals like I did when I was younger. Drinking one can of V8 during the day is fast, and with my low metabolism, V8 allows me to receive the necessary nutrients I need without eating a full meal, which would give me unnecessary fats, carbohydrates, and calories. This, of course, is only a substitute for one meal.

review/summary: Perfect for meals away from home
review/text: These are really great sized cans for a meal away from home - not too filling yet enough to feel full and gives a boost of energy. I like that my husband can take one can for lunch while he's at work and they don't need to be refrigerated. The size is good for a snack - if the can were any larger I would feel too full. This goes on sale frequently so watch the price for a bit if you aren't in a hurry and it's sure to drop.<br /><br />If you're buying these to have at home, it's probably cheaper to buy V-8 in the larger containers and portion it out. We make our own vegetable juice in the summer months but the produce is just too expensive in the winter to make juice, and this is a perfect substitute.<br /><br />As for Amazon's fulfillment of the order, there are a lot of cans in this order and they come in lots of plastic. Each 6 pack is wrapped in plastic, then the whole order is wrapped in plastic - you get the idea. This is typical of bulk orders but it just seems like such a waste. :(

review/summary: I hate it
review/text: I can't begin to tell you how much I hate this tea. I was looking for a good cinnamon tea and was encouraged by all the positive reviews of this particular blend. I wanted to start with just a 4-oz. tin of loose tea, but that size was sold out, so I sprang for the full pound bag. Note to self: Don't EVER do that again!<br /><br />Why do I hate this tea so much? Call me crazy or stodgy or whatever you like, but I believe that flavored tea should first and foremost taste like tea. You should know that you're drinking tea that has flavor added. This tea is completely overwhelmed by the hot cinnamon. It tastes exactly like drinking an Atomic Fireball. Exactly. I like Atomic Fireballs, but I don't want a tea that tastes like one.<br /><br />I've tried adding just a pinch of this Hot Cinnamon tea to unflavored tea, trying to find the right balance of cinnamon flavor to tea taste. I haven't found it yet. The hot cinnamon dominates everything that I've tried it with.<br /><br />I know that this blend appeals to a lot of people. Just look at the reviews. I'm not one of them. If you love tea, look elsewhere. This stuff doesn't resemble real loose leaf tea.

review/text: I tuck a few jars of this, a few packets of mustard and a box of crackers in my suitcase when I travel--just in case I arrive late and the dining room's closed.<br /><br />This particular flavor--Countryside--does the trick.  I've tried three flavors:  This pate (containing pork, duck and green peppercorns), the jar flavored with orange liquor and the one flavored with port wine.<br /><br />This is the one with the most "zip", (I'm not claiming there is a lot of "zip" in this jar...).  In the other two, there isn't enough port wine flavor and adding a bit more port wine didn't help; there is not enough orange flavor either, but adding some extra (quality) orange liquor worked just great.  Problem is, for this price, you shouldn't need to add anything.  I'll save my five star rating for refrigerated pate products.

review/text: After reading the reviews on dried Mangos from all of the different companies, I decided to try this one since it said it was low in sugar.  WELLLL, if this is low in sugar, the others must be a sugar bowl with a drop of mango flavoring.  It's almost 100% sugar!!  You can barely taste the mango.  I guess I expected this dried fruit to taste like real fruit but it's just another sugary substitute, even if it is "all natural".  I am truly so disappointed with this product but it is probably because my expectations were so horrably dashed.  If you want your family to develop diabetes....buy these!

It's easier to stop after 1 bag with the white cheddar.<br /><br />The good news is that, unlike many soy-content chips, these have a very nice (not at all mealy) texture.  Nor are there any red-flag ingredients to worry about.  The bad news is that they are higher carb than I had hoped.  Here's the breakdown for a bag of these lemon-herb chips...<br /><br />calories - 110 (30% from fat)<br />fat - 3.5g<br />carbs - 14g<br />protein - 10g<br /><br />If you're on a low carb diet, these probably won't fit.  The cheddar chips might (10g carbs).
