review/summary: Good base for making a bowl of soup
review/text: I make a large bowl of this  soup using two packs of this soup as the base.<br />Cook vegetables of your choice.<br />I use an immersion blender to  puree the vegetables and soup.<br /> Try lots of different vegetables. Aspargus and sweet potatoes with some onion ansd garlic is delicious .<br />So is pureed brocolli or kale , white potatoes, carrots,  onions and garlic.<br />Sometimes I add  pureed raw leaf lettuce.<br /><br />Experiment :)

review/summary: Great survivalist stock item!
review/text: After looking for the classic ramen flavor packets on the web along with a million other folks and finding nothing, I got the bright idea to try these Lipton soups for flavoring rice.  I am here to say they are the absolute best rice flavorings there are, bar none, and that includes the $9 small bottles of flavoring all the way from Japan.  They beat the heck out of ramen flavor packets!  I usually cook approx 1/2 a cup of dry rice at a time for a quickie lunch or a dinner side, that makes two eight ounce servings, and one packet of Lipton Cup-A-Soup is perfect to flavor that amount of rice.  You can literally have a different flavor each day of the week.  If you're up to it, put a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet and pan brown the noodles before adding to the flavored rice.  Try them all!  I have yet to find one that isn't terrific!

review/summary: Not like Grandma's but Quite Good.
review/text: Lipton Soup from Canada has another winner in there Veggie Soup. I originally bought the Chicken Noodle with White Meat and thought it was great for a powdered Soup and a quick alternative to coffee. Unfortunately it's unavailable on Amazon right now and I thought the Veggie soup would be a nice alternative.<br /><br />Well it didn't disappoint, it was quite good for a powdered soup. Although my cup of soup did not look like the picture of there cup of soup on the package.<br />However it was tasty but I still prefer the Lipton Chicken Noodle with White Meat Soup over this Spring Vegetable Soup.<br /><br />This soup is fairly healthy, its all natural and low in everything that is bad for you. True it's a bit salty, but if you add a little extra water it will be fine.<br /><br />This soup is consistently good unlike Grandma's. Depending on the holiday or occasion Grandma's soup would not be consistent all the time. It all depended on how much she indulged as to how the soup came out. I thought it might be a good idea to keep a couple of pouches of Lipton handy just in case.

review/summary: Just Add Water!
review/text: I like the Cup-a-Soup line, especially this Cream of Chicken, mostly for it's convenience (portability, ease of preparation, and, yes, the taste/edification factor).  I keep an array of just add water food and beverage products in a waterproof pouch for quick hot meals on the go (travel) and in a watertight box for disaster preparedness.  Things like instant soup, hot and cold beverage powders, and freeze-dried fruits that are compact and store for long periods are a good back-up source of nutrition, and it makes chemically purified water more palatable.  Instant Cream of Chicken Cup-a-Soup is not my only option in an emergency of course, but, when I find myself needing a simple, instant, inexpensive, comforting, hot meal in my Sierra cup while sheltering from the cold up in the mountains, it perfectly suits my needs.<br /><br />For my purposes, I don't much care about the scary amounts of sodium and trans-fats, nor the evil soy (oooo!)...  LOL.  It's not something that I consume everyday (unlike millions of Japanese people who don't seem to be in an estrogen crisis oddly... hmmmm).  In fact, I seek out soy protein products, like instant Miso paste (and Soy Joy bars), for their high nutritional value in compact form.

It's ideal: convenient, cheap, and low calorie. You fill up on hot water. But instead they stock various noodle variants, in styrofoam cups, full of noodles and fattening. Why?

review/summary: Actually really good.
review/text: I had really low expectations for this soup because come on, it's dry soup. But it's actually really good. I made 2 packets in 1 mug because 1 wasn't enough. Even 2 packets (plus water) didn't fill up my mug completely. It's a very light soup with a good flavor. Good tasting noodles, although small, it's great for sipping. I can imagine this being very easy to eat while ill. It's not salty like other reviews claim, it's perfect. Either way I want to eat this soup while reading a good book. I really like this as an easy snack.

review/summary: Luscious Soup, Little Guilt
review/text: Purchased this one about 2 months ago, and cannot stop raving about it.  Great taste, I use one packet to an 8oz styrofoam cup with a plastic lid, works great.  A quick pick me up in the office, right around when the air conditioning kicks in on high and your nose starts to freeze off - perfect!<br /><br />I just ordered another flavor, spring veggies, to give it a try.  And with 60 calories for the chicken and 45 calories for the veggies, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />About nutritional facts - compare this soup to ramen noodle cups - some with 300 calories and more than 10 grams of fat - this is a great alternative.

review/summary: The best soup ever!
review/text: I cannot find this soup locally and remember eating it a few times when I was younger. I was very pleased to find it here in bulk. I am very busy and also do not spend a lot of time on meals, could be because I am single and like to make something fast. First mistake I made when making first cup was just adding mix to water and stirring it a bit and thinking the clumps would even out, not the case. It requires ï¿½ water so I now add the mix to my cup, get a small whisk out to smooth it, then add the water and use the whisk again, comes out with no clumps now. I usually add a ton of saltines to it and stay full for hours. I love this soup and am amazed at how much I am eating it as a `meal'. It is also very nice to have something warm when it is cold outside. You will not regret this buy. Great value!

What a waste of money... It tastes like Maruchan ramen noodle soup, but much worse, and it's so salty as well! I had to add like two cups of water, not 3/4 cup as told in the directions. I should have ordered instant Nong Shim noodles instead. The rest of the soup boxes will be donated to somewhere...

review/summary: Quick, delicious and quite satisfying!
review/text: In 1865, Thomas Johnstone Lipton went to the United States and held various jobs. After five years, he returned to Britain, and opened grocery store that soon blossomed into a whole chain. Nowadays, Lipton (now owned by Unilever) is known for two products, teas and instant soups. Well, I must say that I love Lipton's Cup-a-Soups, they come in a convenient envelope, only need hot water added, and are relatively low in fat, calories and sodium. (Yes, any packaged product will be higher in sodium than homemade, but at 540 mg per 13g envelope, it's not that bad.)<br /><br />I keep a box of the Chicken Noodle with White Meat Cup-a-Soups in my desk at work, and on particularly cold days, I make up a cup. Also, I must say that when I am rushed, I can make a delicious lunch out of a quick cheese sandwich and a cup of this soup! So, overall let me just say that this is a delicious product, one that is sure quick, delicious and quite satisfying!

While that doesn't reduce the salt content, it doesn't taste as salty.<br /><br />The hearty noodle variety is my absolute favorite but it's become hard to find in my area.

review/summary: Can easily be spruced up...cheap "mini meal"
review/text: I had high hopes for this product. you really need to use at least 2 packages to get enough flavor in a single cup if you're not adding any additional goodies to it.<br /><br />I like to make it in a coffee cup and add some shredded carrots and veggie crumbles to spruce it up a bit. since there are so many in the package it will last me quite a while and I can keep them in my locker on campus (law student) for when I am unexpectedly stuck there and not able to go home for a meal.<br /><br />It's quick, easy, low in calories and pretty cheap. so all in all it's a good value but I don't think it will be a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: I enjoy this soup!
review/text: I am just finishing up a Spring Veggie Cup-a-Soup (that of which I received today), and feeling a bit nostalgic; I haven't had it in years...not since I was a kid and still living at home (longer ago than I care to admit :). It tastes as good as I remmeber...perhaps even better!<br /><br />Since my younger days, I've become much more aware of what's inside the prepared food I consume, and I am happy to say that this soups gets "two thumbs up"; no MSG, artificial flavors or coloring. The broth doesn't contain any meat, but is made with egg yolk, and the dehydrated peas and carrots might contain milk (as stated on the nutrional panel), so if you are vegan, I'm afraid that this soup wouldn't be for you.<br /><br />I looked in my local supermarket for this flavor, and couldn't find it, so I was pleased to see that it was available at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Spring Veggie Cup-a-Soup could very well be going onto my "subscribe and save" account, as it's something I will alway want to have around for a quick and easy accompliment to a lite meal or late night snack!

review/summary: Not meant to be a meal, but a terrific filler
review/text: This soup is great tasting.  It does contain quite a bit of sodium, but for those who think it is too salty can add more water to adjust the taste to their liking.  Also, as many others have previously stated, there is a severe lack in meat, vegetables, and even the noodles...what do you expect from a soup that came from a box?  A gourmet meal is not very likely.  Overall, this soup is great and quick to make.  Many can use the soup on the go as a snack to hold them over for an actual meal or even a late night snack for those who don't feel like eating a meal.  This product in my opinion, is great for busy bodies who sometimes have to skip or hold off a meal.

review/summary: Hearty chicken flavor, doesn't taste artificial, yummm!
review/text: This soup is amazing! It has that hearty home-cooked chicken flavor without the preservative flavor canned soups can have. It's great for a light snack, after being out in the cold, or when sick. I just half-fill my mug and add a packet, and microwave for a couple of minutes and let it stand for a minute and it's done. Very easy.<br /><br />I'm really picky with my soup and I hate most canned soup. They taste too much like preservatives. Powder soups taste too much like salt to me. But this soup somehow lets all that chicken aroma through.

review/summary: Chicken flavored salt I can enjoy anytime!
review/text: Seriously, I do like this stuff.  I hope the calories I'm saving by eating this soup sometimes in lieu of a full lunch makes up for the salt in this cheap but strangely addicting instant soup.<br /><br />Here's how it works: I arrive at work with my coffee or latte, get a coffee refill, then later rinse out the coffee cup (typically a large disposable paper cup), dump one or two packets of this soup into the cup, add hot water, and it's lunch time!  One thing I've discovered is that there's so much salt in this soup I can make it half strength -- double the water that is -- and it's still enjoyable if a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />And, the chicken heartiness soothes my caffiene wracked nerves and keeps me going and going.  Not only that, but every once in a while I even find what seems to be a little tiny bit of chicken!

review/summary: Yukky, sodium-laced junk food
review/text: I can't believe I paid a nickle of my hard-earned money for this stuff.<br />I also can't believe all the good reviews it got. You put it in a cup, add 3/4 cup of boiling water and stir it up. A bunch of white stuff that may be dried noodles will be floating on top. After a LOT MORE stirring, and it's been sitting there for a while (long enough to be too cool to eat), the noodles get more-or-less soft.<br />Take a sip. It taste like hot tap water with a hint of chicken broth. On top of that it gave me heartburn. I guess THAT part is MY problem, and YMMV.<br />I won't even give this junk away.<br />Read the label: One CUP of this "soup" has 25% of the daily requirement of SODIUM!

review/summary: Low Calories, but tastes really good
review/text: When I first got the product, I was a bit disappointed to realize that it's quite low calorie (50 calories/packet, 4 packets/box, 2 packets = 1 1/2 cups of soup). To me, that means that it doesn't really suffice as a meal, which I was hoping it would sometimes. However, on the upside, it does taste really good. Sometimes it's just what you need. So I consider it a decent product, even though it's so low-calorie it can't be anything close to a real meal.

The other regular Chicken noodle one is not like this. I know I put enough water so that is not the reason, I guess that's why they call it "hearty". I still love the flavor but next time I will add more water than they suggested and see if the consistency is better.<br /><br />UPDATE: Adding more water fixes this problem, it's delicious and edible now!

review/summary: High Quality for a Zero-Calorie Item
review/text: Let me break it up for you all:<br />1.) This has zero calories. That is great.<br />2.) The only worrisome chemicals is Sucralose and Potassium Sorbate. Potassium sorbate is about as deadly as table salt. The jury is out on sucralose toxicity, but if it doesn't kill you then obesity will.<br />3.) Flavor/consistency. It's not perfect. It's pudding/custard like, and it's overly-sweet, but kind of tastes like actual caramel. It isn't gooey, which is most disappointing. HOWEVER, considering that this is a 0-calorie product, it's pretty damn good. I've had the Walden Farms Italian dressing, and it's horrible. In this case, however, I tested it with a cut up apple. It sticks to the apple (which is a plus), and it gives the apple a dessert quality. Isn't this the point?<br /><br />This isn't for everyone, but I'd suggest trying it if you're curious. I'm on a low carb, high protein, high veggies diet and exercise routine (P90X) and my sweet tooth is what's going to get the best of me. With something like this, I can have my cake and eat it, and not get any fatter.

review/text: The only reason it doesn't get one star is that it actually smells rather good.  I sniffed it after opening and was initially hopeful that it would taste good, but alas--it was a disappointment and I ended up throwing away more than half a jar.  We tried it on apple slices and vanilla ice cream--neither of which were improved by the addition.  In fact, the stuff has an unpleasant aftertaste and a strange, jiggly consistency that is rather like runny flan.  Highly unappetizing.  Ugh.  The chocolate is slightly better in that it tastes a bit more authentic than this stuff, but it has the same artificial sweetener aftertaste and odd texture.  I won't be trying any more Walden Farms products--I'd rather buy a low-calorie product that I actually enjoy than a no-calorie product that sucks.

There is sodium in this caramel, so if you need to watch your sodium intake, check the nutritional facts at the Walden Farms site to make sure it isn't too high in sodium for you.<br /><br />If you are dieting, or need to watch your sugar intake (but still crave sugary tasting foods), I would highly recommend Walden Farms Caramel!

This one should have never left the factory. I prefer adding a few calories to my gut with a lower calorie option than to ever eat this product again. Chemicals galore!

review/text: This stuff is nasty. The texture is like a mix of jello and pudding and the taste as others have said is chemical.  The taste resembles nothing like caramel, it's got no "food" taste to it at all. I have found that walden farms products are all very synthetic tasting...waste of money.

review/summary: Wow, that is sweet!
review/text: This IS the sweetest of the Walden Farms products I have tried so far, which is only 3 so far. It has a wonderful brown sugar smell when you open the jar. The consistency is.... different. The best way I can describe it would be marshmallow fluff (without the stickiness)  that has been aerated. It is not the sticky gooey caramel that I am used to so it can take a little getting used to. Now the taste isn't exactly straight caramel flavor to me. I would make it out to be a more molasses flavor but it is still very good. My wife, who loves caramel on her apples said that she could eat this on her apples and be completely satisfied. I don't think you can get better praise then that.

review/summary: Really Good, Totally Free Caramel Dip
review/text: Honestly, I didn't think I was going to enjoy this product but I'm on a very restrictive diet for health reasons so I bought one jar. You know, hopefully it would satisfy a sweet craving if (more like when) one comes on.<br />I tried this with a cut up gala apple. Simply dipped the apple slices in a little and I was totally impressed. Granted it is not exactly like the full bore caramel you'd find at Halloween but come on now. To be able to have something that tastes this good without the guilt?! I'm sold!<br />I honestly and truly recommend this product. I've only tried it on apples yet but I think anything you can use caramel for you could use this for too. I'll find out because this is something I would keep in my pantry even after I'm better enough to come off this horribly restrictive diet. This is THAT good! And I'm a foodie. I love food, I love experiencing different cultures and different tastes. Keep an open mind and try it. You might well be as impressed as I was by this.

review/text: I have used this dip in a number of different ways, and each was wonderful.  Mixed with softened cream cheese, I used some as frosting on a low-carb cake and the rest in small spoonfulls refrigerated to make luscious caramel candy.  I have also used it as a simple dip for strawberries, and on top of an egg-custard to make it taste like flan.  It is incredible that anything can taste so good and be not only carbohydrate free, but calorie free!  I love this product and will be ordering more very soon.

As with most WF products, don't look to this as a replacement; look at it as an alternative.  I have a feeling this jar will be in my fridge a looong time, which could be good or bad.

review/text: I ordered this product a few weeks ago, believing it to be the six-star, aged sweet vinegar as clearly pictured in this listing.  What I received was the "regular" Colavita less-aged, no-star vinegar, which is an ok product, but not as good as the six star sweet product.  When I contacted the seller, they claim that Colavita does not make the six-star product anymore, which might be true, but they certainly should have changed this picture then.

review/text: I love Colavita's Aged Sweet Balsamic Vinegar.  I ordered this and was so disappointed to find that although the box was for the sweet aged vinegar, what was inside was their plain vinegar that is not aged and is definitely not sweet.  I've had both and I know the difference.  They do still sell it, but the bottle is smaller and different than this one.  So beware when purchasing this item from anyone, and especially I know of this place.  This is false advertising and I can't believe after all the hastles I went through to be able to send it back and get a refund they are still showing this as the vinegar they are selling.  How do you make a company stop falsely advertising a product and sending you something different?  I'll never do business with them again.  Had they unknowingly sold me the wrong product and been quick to resolve it, I would have a different attitude, but then to find they even still advertise this, makes me very angry.  I am trying a different vender now through amazon and hope they are selling the correct product.

"Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."

review/summary: They just don't work
review/text: I used these, hanging them very close to my swarm of flies, for about two weeks. The swarm of flies seemed to like about two feet off the ground above a Persian rug. I had about 10 flies. In two weeks, these TWO traps collected one fly, while the other ~9 just swarmed around and refused to leave or die.<br /><br />The flies popping into my house lately are different from the buzzing house fly I grew up with. The bzzzzzz house fly I can swat pretty easily. These new flies are silent and fast moving and not interested in ever landing on something. They are also long-lived.<br /><br />I tried schmalyn's recommendation and moved them around, even left on one the floor where they were swarming. Still no luck.<br /><br />I do not rec these traps.<br /><br />Afterward I got the SUPER sticky strips that you unroll. My flies were too smart for that stuff too, but if I waved them around I could catch flies in the air with the extreme stickiness that doesn't exist on these Victor traps.

review/text: These didn't work for me for a few days until I figured out the secret: you have to put them RIGHT where the flies go. (You also have to ignore the sad little buzzing sounds when the flies are dying...) In my case, I moved the trap around during the day depending on where the light was. Sunny kitchen? stood it on the countertop. Overnight? put it right next to a light that was attracting the flies. Once I did this, after days of no flies on the traps, I woke up to discover 14 flies stuck the next morning.  Flies were eradicated completely. I'm ordering these again the next time I have a problem.

review/summary: Works Great on gnats around small animal cages
review/text: We always have a box or 2 of these fly traps around for use around the guinea pig cage. I place them on top of the cage to attract the gnats we deal with seasonally. It seems like something about the color really attracts them, as the traps become quite full. When I tried the same shape traps without the color, the effect was much less. As a sticky side becomes full, I turn the four sided trap over to expose the next clean side. The gnats come from outside and are attracted to the guinea pig's litter and hay. To keep the gnats from taking over I keep the cage as clean as possible to prevent eggs from hatching and keep the traps on top of the cage. They have been a wonderful tool for our household.

I would imagine that in a place where you have hundreds of flies flying around one would land on it sooner or later.  But when you only get up to 5 flies at any one time the trap holds no appeal to the fly at all.  And the topper is they paint dead flies already on the trap making it look even uglier.  What was the plan there?  The fly was to say to himself, "Hey a dead fly.  I think I'll go land there to see what he died of."

review/summary: Black tea is good, has no taste of ginger flavor
review/text: I'm going to include a picture of the tea leaves I just brewed so you can get a glimpse of the large cut leaves of this black tea from China.  Because I bought it at a greatly reduced price, I'm not too upset that I taste no ginger whatsoever in the brew.  There was no aroma either when the perfectly sealed canister was opened, revealing the bagged tea inside.  The bag was not sealed, but folded over, and the leaves looked very black.  Because this is called, Roland Ginger Tea/Canisters, 2.5000-Ounce (Pack of 8), and it does not expose any ginger essence at all, I can only rate it at 2 stars for being a black tea (as described on package and Amazon) which was perfectly presented and at a great price for black tea from Hong Kong in little mauve metal canisters with cute images of ginger and a pretty decoration.  I cannot recommend this as a ginger tea and will move forward with presenting these canisters as part of assembled gift baskets with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NRTVWE">Melitta Tea Filters, 40-Count (Pack of 6)</a> and [[ASIN:B001GCVLVI, Walkers Shortbread Assorted, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M8GFJA">Tea Bag Buddy, White</a> and more.  The cute little canisters are attractive and can be used after the tea is exhausted.  I may also include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VZP6Y">Ting Ting Jehe Chewy Ginger Candy Value 10 Packs - 10x5.25 Oz</a> so the lack of ginger in the tea won't be sorely missed.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I bought this product from a local outlet several times and have always enjoyed it quite a bit. I usually brew 4-6 times in a row using my 16 ounce infuser and the same 2-4 teaspoons of tea. The price seems a little more worthwhile when considering this. The tea itself has a flavor that I would call smooth and green, a little strong but not bitter at all. I can only compare this to other Teavana loose leaf teas and various brands of bagged teas (Stash, Yogi, Lipton, and others), but gyokuru imperial is an all time favorite. I also like that despite giving a strong caffiene boost to my day it never has given me the jagged feeling or lift and drop that I have come to expect from coffie and strong black teas. It is a short steep tea made for 40 seconds to 1 minute per serving which I like as I am a little impatient with preparing tea. If you have a tea store nearby, do yourself a favor<br /> and ask to smell this, it will taste much the same when finished.

review/summary: A very nice mild green tea
review/text: I love Japanese green tea and had read that gyokuro is the finest variety, so I decided to splurge on this tea. The tea is very nice, but not worth the price (in my opinion) compared to other sencha teas at a quarter of the price. I prefer a tea that brews bright green with a distinct grassy taste. This tea (using 1.5 teaspoons with 8 oz. of 175ï¿½F water and brewing for for 3 minutes) brewed tea with a faint green hue and a delicate, mild flavor. The flavor was fresh and sweet but not as bold as I had hoped. As one would expect, a second infusion (brewed for 4 minutes) was even weaker and only beneficial if one is being frugal (or wants to avoid the caffeine that is mostly extracted in the first infusion).

review/text: I have tried a number of gyokuros and this one is way to overpriced for what you get. H&S has good gyokuro as do others here in Japan that sell directly from their farms.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern. The company simply does not seem to appreciate its customers and apparently many people feel the same way. I will no longer buy from them due to their poor service and overpriced products.
