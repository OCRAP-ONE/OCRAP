review/summary: Stevia, natures sweenter.
review/text: This is a great company that is looking out for our health. Stevia is more then a sweetener; It helps reduce sugar cravings and even acne. (I challenge you to look it up).<br />This company emailed me right back when I asked about it being Organic. They said yes and were working on getting it on the label. They are coming out with more products to benefit our health.<br /><br />I was not a fan of Stevia at first because it is a different taste,so I tried Chocolate first (Yum, not real chocolaty). This is also a great creamy flavor. I have been told the liquids are better then the Powder.

review/summary: not sure how old
review/text: I've used liquid stevia for over 5 years and have used 2 brands. I like the Sweet Leaf brand the most and have had the most experience with that brand.  When Sweet Leaf liquid stevia is new, it is a perfectly clear liquid.  Although I'm not sure why, when it ages, it turns a caramely brown color although it retains its taste and effectivness.  I purchased the Vanilla Creme (my favorite in plain Greek yogurt) on Amazon to save time in running to our health food store 40 minutes away.  The transaction was great and shipping was fast.  However, when I opened them, they were already caramely brown, which indicates to me that their stock is old, which is why I gave the review only 3 stars.  Although everything else was just fine, I think I will stick to getting it from my health food store to ensure the highest freshness (because it lasts such a long time anyway).

review/summary: Good in moderation, but can be bitter
review/text: This is by far (in my opinion) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line. The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking, coffee, tea etc. The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something. I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper. Otherwise, you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet.. bleck.. bitter city.

review/text: I absolutely love this product !  I ordered the small sampler 4 pk and really liked the vanilla creme so I ordered the larger one. Since then I ordered a 2nd large bottle ( one for home, one for the office) and even signed up for the monthly shipping so that I never run out of it.<br /><br />I have used it in numerous ways including coffee, smoothies, crushed ice drinks, on fruits and cereals... anything you want to add a sweet vanilla taste to, this is perfect.<br /><br />Does not have the chemical after taste of other sweetners, it does not contain alcohol and is a "natural" product.  So very happy I found it !

review/text: I use this stuff pretty much anywhere--coffee, tea, plain water, oatmeal, you name it.

This stinks because I occasionally like to make really sweet coffee for dessert, but the aftertaste is horribly distracting.

review/text: I'm on the HCG Diet and I can't eat any sugar or starches right now and I've got a big sweet tooth... and this product saved me! I bought this and started putting it in my coffee. Then my tea. Over strawberries. In my lemonade. On apple slices with cinnamon. I am crazy about this product now! I'm going to start baking with it and the regular Stevia Liquid once I'm done with my diet. Can't wait to start creating new desserts with substitute sugars. The HCG Diet Book lists a chocolate bark that is made with coconut oil, powdered cocoa, Stevia (Vanilla Creme would be my first choice!) and nuts or coconut flakes. Ideas like these are going to help me feed the sweet tooth and hopefully not gain weight. Dieting or not this is a keeper!

review/text: I have never before tried Stevia, but I was recommended it by a friend and deceided to give it a go. I mostly use it in my coffee, but plan to use it for smoothies and other purposes too. It is a truly great alternative to sugar, and with the right amount it tastes good. I found that if I put a few drops too much it tastes a bit likenlicorish, or bitter maybe. But I will never stop using this after having tried it now, and plan to buy other variants of Stevia as well. As Stevia is really sweetb and one only needs a few drops at a time, I think this bottle will last a long time. Do try it!

review/text: I am allergic to splenda.  It breaks my skin out in acne type bumps.  But I drink coffee so I found this product.  It has a slight aftertaste and I find splenda to be sweeter.  ALso I did not know that this item requires refrigeration for longer lasting.  I found that since I like my coffee sweet I use like 4 drops of this item and I use one pack of splenda.  I find that my body can take a few splenda packs a day without breakouts so for others in my situation, keep this in mind.  I noticed a difference in my skin in two days.  If you suffer from adult acne or have a child that suffers from acne consider this item, in addition to your dermatologists rx's.

review/text: If you're expecting a flavor like sugar or like the typical artificial sweetener, this will leave you disappointed.  However, I really like the flavored stevia.  The vanilla cream really does leave a good vanilla flavor and it is very satisfying for use in coffee and teas.  This stevia is also good to add to water if you're wanting to change things up a bit or make water more drinkable.  I do not advise buying plain stevia, but the flavored kinds are quite good.

review/text: We use this in soda water to make delicious soda that's not terrible for you.  The vanilla creme makes wonderful creme soda.  Most non-sugar (re- artificial) sweeteners have their own "flavor."  Stevia is probably no exception, but we're so used to it it just tastes sweet and delicious.  Actually my kids eat sugar, and occasionally have a "sugary" soda, and they liked the stevia clear "soda" on the first try, so I am kind of assuming there's really not much of a taste to get used to.

review/text: I am always on the lookout for a good sugar alternative and bought this Liquid Stevia to put in my coffee. Firstly it takes about 17 drops to sufficiently "sweeten" a 10oz cup of coffee.  When said coffee is "sweetened" it has a horrible sharp aftertaste. Not at all what I was expecting and certainly not the desired effect.  I will gradually use the remaining drops but I'll stick with the granulated stevia instead.

review/text: I do not have any idea how many bottles of this I ordered, but Vanilla Cream my favorite has made it so easy to drink lots of water.  I try to drink a gallon of water a day. It seemed impossible until I found this. But with this product in my ice water, I go way past a gallon, lost weight, and feel so much better.  The Velencia orange also very good, mix it with vanilla and it tastes like and dream sickle.  Berry and vanilla also very food.  Orange and Berry takes on a fruit punch flavor.  I carry this is my purse so when we are out to eat I save around $2.00 because I do not order tea or other beverage. So it really pays for it self. The only one I did not like was apricot nectar. You have to play with the dropper till you find exactly how much you need.  Start slow, to much can cause an after taste.  It is better to start slow and add more than starting with to much. if I had a  younger child I would use this instead soda or sugar drinks.  Enjoy.....Great product!

review/text: Got this hoping to cut back on my creamer/Splenda consumption for sweetness! It does sweeten, you can add as little or as much as you want with the dropper. It does taste ok, although you do NOT get a big vanilla flavor with it, but that is ok too. My only problem, it does leave an aftertaste. Maybe it is me because I am so used to my creamers, but I had my daughter try it and she had one too. I guess I will stick to my creamer/Splenda for now. Would love to retry if they can work on the aftertaste problem.

review/text: I like this sweetener and have not found it to be too syrupy like others have commented.  I found that if you wipe the rim after using, it will reduce the possible chance of it dripping, as I read from other reviews.  The price was great as well.  I like the flavor- to me it doesn't have a strange aftertaste.

review/summary: A little goes a long way!
review/text: I purchased Sweet Leaf Vanilla creme flavored Liquid Stevia after I decided to switch from my other no-calorie sweeteners to Stevia.  My first word of advice is to look at the vanilla creme liquid as a flavoring, not your complete sweetener.  I like to use it in my ice tea and it only takes a couple drops in a big glass, maybe the whole dropper for a pitcher.  I use a plain sweetner for the actual sweetness.  If you use too much, that is where the after-taste will come in.  It took me a few tries to get it right.<br /><br />If you buy this to add a bit of vanilla flavor, you'll be happy, but if you buy it to use to sweeten your coffee or other drink, you will not like the after-taste.

review/text: It took about 8 drops for coffe and 16 for green tea (green tea has a bad taste anyways, so its not the stevia's fault). The vanilla scent was really nice and relaxing. I'd choose this better than the unflavored stevia.

review/summary: Don't overdo it!
review/text: After reading through some of the more negative reviews for this product, I would have to say the users like used too much. Stevia can have a tendency to taste almost bitter if overdone; a couple of drops of this are all you need! I love it in coffee, to sweeten my kids' oatmeal and also for baking. I have purchased several of the flavors and find vanilla the yummiest and most versatile by far. The price is great, as a bottle will last you ages!!

It sweetens nicely and enhances the flavor of almost everything you use it in... from drinks to food.  I even put some in my oatmeal with fresh fruit.<br />The only time you will get an aftertaste is if you use a little too much.

review/text: I got this to go with the HCG diet - Not much flavor.  I tried chocolate and English Toffee - both had more flavor.  Difficult to find in stores -and much more expensive in stores.  Worth it to have a different flavor - but if only buying a couple buy a different flavor.  Ones that come in packages of 2 are a better deal.  Find a friend and split!

review/summary: Nice vanilla flavor, healthy Stevia
review/text: I only recently discovered Stevia, and I'm a big fan. I've used saccharine in my coffee for years, although I know it's not good for me. I eat a low carb diet so I didn't want to use honey, sugar, or agave nectar, and I've read too many bad things about Nutrasweet and Equal.<br /><br />I bought this 2-ounce bottle of Vanilla Cream stevia liquid to try it, and I really like it. It only takes a 2-3 drops to sweeten my morning coffee, and give it a subtle vanilla flavor and smell. The vanilla flavor isn't as strong as I'd like, but adding more drops makes it too sweet.  I'm going to try adding a drop or two of vanilla extract next time.<br /><br />I don't notice any aftertaste or bitterness after using stevia, although I've read reviews that other people do. The bottle lists the ingredients as "Proprietary Blend, Purified Water, Stevia (Leaf) Extract, and Other Ingredients" which makes me wonder what they've put in there that they can't tell me about. But for the couple of drops per day that I will ingest, I'm willing to let them keep their secrets.<br /><br />I got my bottle with free shipping with Amazon SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25, and it's also available at a 15% discount if I sign up for Subscribe & Save.

review/text: This sweetener is fine, it does not taste exactly like sugar, but I don't expect it to. I read that some people where using "a few drops" to sweeten their stuff but that is not the case with me. I actually use about a dropper when I add it to smoothies to make it sweet enough. If I add just a few drops it's like I did not add anything, that might work in a little cup of coffee but not in a smoothie. It's natural and not loaded with dubious sweeteners or fillers. This tastes great when you add a dropper of this to a smoothie with full fat coconut milk and raw cocoa powder; you would forget it's healthy.  Anyhow, I use about a bottle a month.

It is not "fake" flavored and the caramel is not overpowering.  This one is just plain yummy!<br />The Chocolate and the Hazelnut are also very good but this is my favorite.

review/summary: strong aroma, good flavor
review/text: My husband is a casual coffee drinker, so he prefers flavored coffees.  However, it can be challenging to find intense flavored coffee that smells good AND tastes good.  We've yet to find a chocolate that tastes like chocolate.  His favorite is Pumpkin Spice, but this Caramel Drizzle is a close second.  The aroma is heavenly, but the flavor is also noticeable.  It's not as strong as most pumpkin spice flavors, but the caramel definitely comes through even with cream and sugar.  And I have found Folgers to be a good, solid brand with a quality product.  Most of my grocery stores have name brand coffee for about $7.99 a pound (or more in the case of Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts brands), so Amazon's price is competitive and the subscription service is even more reasonable.  Plus, it's convenient to have it delivered right to your door.  Overall, highly recommended for casual coffee fans, and coffee diehards who also like flavors.

review/summary: Good, but not their best
review/text: I'm a strong user of these Folger's flavored coffees and had high hopes for this selection.  But, quite honestly, there really isn't much flavor in this caramel version.  It tasted more like regular coffee than anything else and for the price, I expected their usual great taste.  The vanilla biscotti is quite hard to beat so I thought this one would stand up close to that one.  Chocolate is quite good in the Folger's too so you might want to give that a try.  If you're a fan of flavored coffees, go ahead and try this with cream and sugar.  It might work for you, but if you're like me and prefer the more flavored versions, you'll have to add some of International's caramel-flavored creamer to get the full flavor of this version.

review/text: I am from Hawaii and while mostly fond of Louisiana, I miss my coffee! My mom usually tries to mail me coffee once the previous one is almost done.

This is a great deal, and you save even more if you subscribe! This coffee requires less than what I am used to as well (only one tablespoon usually I have to put in two per cup).<br /><br />I am a huge caramel lover, and unlike some of the reviews I have read, I can definitely taste it! It (caramel) isn't subtle at all in my opinion but it does not overshadow the coffee. Love this!

review/summary: Didn't like this brand of it, tasted like pot roast gravy
review/text: I was so excited to order this, I'm a curry fanatic and always looking for something I have not tried.<br /><br />But this? Let me tell you what this tastes like: it tastes like pot roast gravy. In fact I made this with beef, carrots, peas, and potatoes per the box suggestion: and it was like a bowl of gravy and roast.<br /><br />YUCK. If I want pot roast, I can make that any time. I was in the mood for some sweet curry (per the description) and this was not what I had in mind. You could pour this over mashed potatoes and call it beef gravy and no one would know any better!<br />Of course someone recommends this for kids: kids usually like gravy. Not a repeat purchase for me.

review/summary: Boxed Evolution
review/text: Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print.  Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala "Take the Skinheads Bowling" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic "II & III"; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them "scratching their heads out loud" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  "Camper Vantiquities", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: "Seven Languages" and the Harrison/Starkey composition "Photograph."  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper "phenomenon" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.  I hope it was helpful.  Rock on Comrades!!!

review/text: The notoriously out-of-print early albums of Camper Van Beethoven get a bare-bones presentation (CDs come in cardboard single sleeves).<p>The price is exceptionally cheap, there's a full-length live album, and also included is a lengthy booklet with essays on the Santa Cruz college rocker lifestyle of the early Campers.<p>For any CVB fan, this is a sure thing, a godsend for those who didn't snap up early CD printings of the first albums.<p>For those curious about Camper Van Beethoven, this is the set to get.

review/summary: Campervan beethoven- Cigarettes & carrot juice.
review/text: A great collection of music from CVB> A great way to get into CVB if you've recently become a fan.<br />I Have had an interest in CVB since I heard the track Pictures of matchstick men on the local community radio station probably in the late 90's.It was a good track,with many of the elements I look for in music. I like the variety of instruments the band employs(violin,banjo,steel guitar & sitar etc) are some of the instruments used in the cigarettes & carrot juice collection.<br />Even though I only heard my second CVB track when I bought this collection in late 2010, It does'nt really matter as unique, lively & colorful music such as this loses nothing over time.Don't know if they have ever toured Australia,but it would definitely be on my list.

review/text: I have been a huge fan of CVB ever since a friend of mine loaned me a cassette of (the then recent) Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart. It took some effort finding their back catalog on lp, but was even harder for me to find II &amp; III and the self-titled album on cd. Cigarettes and Carrot Juice is a necessity, and not just for the rabid fan.<br />It's great to have all these cds out with bonus material. I rushed over and bought this on November 5th and this will be my lone highlight of another forgetable election day!<br />This band was simply the most eclectic and humorous band around in the 1980s and early 90s. The best!

review/summary: This is the best Camper Van Beethoven
review/text: This is a  beautiful repackaging of Camper Van Beethoven's first three albums, plus a bunch of miscellaneous stuff. Each CD comes in a little cardboard cover just like the original record, which is sort of thrilling. To me, these three albums were, by far, the most exciting music Camper Van Beethoven ever released. After the 3rd album, they got caught up in that unfortunate late-80s quality pop songcraft thing, and it broke them. This stuff, though, is tossed out, sloppy, unprofessional, fun, and gorgeous. Don't get all that other stuff, get this.

review/summary: Camper van Beethoven is the greatest rock band ever
review/text: Well, maybe not &quot;the&quot; greatest, but one of the best.  This set brings together the earlier stuff which is slightly more quirky than the two albums they did for Virgin.  Some of it is even sort of challenging, but mixed in are some songs as lovable as a soft fluffy kitten with a ball of yarn like &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot; and &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot;.  There was this one story about them one time when they played in Philly and stayed with the Dead Milkmen for the night.  It's a great story, but probably shouldn't be repeated here.  When I first picked up a guitar (actually the first time I picked up a guitar after hearing the third album) I wanted to play &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot; but I was the only keyboard player in the band so I got stuck playing the keyboard part which is a lot more tasty after you play it a few times.  We can thank our lucky stars that these guys are touring again.  I was heartbroken when they broke up and Cracker always sounded a little too sanitized.  This set is almost like another album coming out, except that the songs came out before.  It's beautiful.

review/summary: Never A Dull Moment
review/text: Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a "Flexible Soup".  It's anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery's penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They're simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I've held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band's intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask "Why?", yet with an immediate second thought you'll smile and say "Why hasn't Anyone Else?"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I've caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today's music. ]

review/text: My wife tried ordering this item thru a Amazon listed seller (caiman) December the 10th it was due to ship out in 3 days (for a x-mas present nonetheless), by end of January it had not shipped. I cancelled our order with caiman and tried to order thru AMAZON itself the same day Feb 3rd i believe. Here it is March the 20th. No nothing , just an endless extending wait. Apparently AMAZON & their sellers feel they can list items they dont , wont and cant stock. Dont waste your time. I just cancelled my order and bought it on E-BAY , it will ship tommorow. Forget Amazon, or unless you like being blown off endlessly by email with no LIVE person to talk to, then by all means order this thru Amazon (or Caiman!). I prefer to spend my money else-where, this has really soured me.

review/text: I really do like this herbal infusion, it's an interesting blend.  I purchased it for a tea party bridal shower I threw and we had lavender short bread cookies as one of the accompaniments. The floral taste was a a bit bolder than I expected, the blend of cornflower and lavender and lemon was tasty.  If you like this you may like Harney and Sons Mother's Bouquet which also has rosebuds and citrus peel to the mix.  It is a very fine herbal drink, but most afternoons if I'm not drinking spicy black tea I like a light refreshing white or green tea.  I very rarely drink herbals unless I'm off to bed.  These tea bags are made to produce two cups of tea, and this is essentially loose tea inside a sachet for convenience.<br /><br />If you know an herbal tea lover this is a unique blend for them to try.
