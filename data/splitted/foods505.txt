review/summary: Outstanding Tea for Connoisseur or Non-Connoisseur Alike
review/text: Like many, I have drank tea for many years, decades, actually, and have had the opportunity to sample everything from the standard bagged teas available everywhere to some of the most expensive hand-made teas developed in Europe using traditional processes. I won't try to pretend this St Dalfour tea is the equivalent of these highly esoteric (and incredibly expensive) teas, but what I can say is that this is a truly great tea for the bagged varieties, and, due to its unfamiliarity, would certainly qualify as a "sleeper" find. I can recommend this particular brand and variety as one of the best I've had.<br /><br />What makes this so good? First, the ingredients are all natural, with no artificial flavors or fillers (check your labels carefully and be surprised to see how many flavored teas rely on artificial flavors). To take it a step further, the ingredients here are all organic (see the information on the boxes and on the website to read about this), with no pesticides, artificial colors, or flavors added. At first blush, one might not be immediately attracted to a "black cherry" tea, but the manner in which St Dalfour blends this results in a flavorful tea that contains a subtle flavoring and aroma of black cherry that is really wonderful.<br /><br />If you prepare the tea correctly, you'll end up with a very smooth and delightfully flavored tea that may become your favorite. One secret for this, or any, tea is to not steep the tea more than 60-90 seconds MAX, and then remove the bag. It might seem like too short of a time at first, but if you force yourself to keep to this time, with a few dunks at the end, you should begin to see how tea can really taste if it isn't over-steeped and allowed to turn bitter. (Everyone has a strength preference and so you'll have to experiment at first, but if you can keep it to no longer than 90 seconds, that should be ideal.) Further, if you have a water boiler that allows you to select temperature, if you use a water temperature right below the boiling point, that smoothness can be extended further.<br /><br />An easy recommend to the tea lover, this tea is one of my favorites. Five stars.

Its so delicious you can eat the whole jar in a day.....it tastes perfect alone on a spoon !  Where has the product been all my life ?  I will always buy this brand.  It comes in other flavors like chocolate and also in crunchy.  I enjoy the creamy variety and it's definitely a honey flavor so smooth and tempting.  WOW what a scrumptious product !  Its GLUTEN FREE, tree free, peanut free, safe for schools. 5 stars.

Healthy Soy Nut Butter.  He loves it.  I've tried it myself and think it's not bad at all.  It is nutty, with the same color and texture as peanut butter.  In a sandwich with jelly, it tastes like a PB&J.  On its own, I can tell it's not peanut butter, but the difference is subtle.  The kids can't tell the difference, and I'm not going to point it out.

review/summary: If You Enjoy Lime, This Tea is For You
review/text: *****<br /><br />Dry Desert Lime is an unusual premium Numi tea. It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste.  If you like lime, you'll love this tea.  If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense "lime experience".  I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: "From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it!"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea.  I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I have had a cup of this marvelous lime "tea" (there's really no tea in it and its creators call it a "teasan") every morning ever since I discovered it a few years ago. I take it with me when I travel, counting out enough bags to be sure I don't miss a day. It is quite tart, and I like it best sweetened with a spoonful or two of honey. It has a wonderful brisk taste that makes for a great way to start the day. Amazon's price is very good, and represents a nice savings compared with Whole Foods, which is one of the few places you can find it in a store.

review/summary: Not for everyone, but very interesting...
review/text: This tea is exclusively dried lime peels, so it's an unusal flavor.  It's not a fresh lime juice-y flavor, but a somewhat bitter & concentrated taste.  It is not terribly tart; I only add a little honey.  There is a bitterness to it, though - think of the pungent, bitter flavor of any citrus zest.  It will certainly not be a tea for everyone, but I could see myself acquiring a taste for it (I look forward to trying it iced!).  It's definitely an intriguing addition to my tea repertoire, if nothing else.  If you're not sure you want to purchase a whole box, try a Numi sampler - it includes two bags of each flavor, including Desert Lime.

review/text: I have always loved lime and anything acidic or citrusy.  If you do not love these things, pick one of the other Numi teas.  They are all excellent.  This is a premium tea, on the high end in quality and in price.  It is good both hot and cold or even at room temperature.  Two bags will make an entire pot of tea.  This tastes different from herbal teas if that has been your usual variation from regular tea.  It is much more distinctive and unusual.  This definitely does suggest the desert when you sip it and also the Middle East.

review/summary: Great for Under the Weather Days
review/text: If I have a sore throat and starting to feel a little achy, I reach for a hot cup of the Dry Desert Lime.  I don't know if the effect is purely in my head, but it seems to make me feel quite a bit better.  There have been several days where drinking this allowed me to feel well enough to stay at work rather than go home and take a sick day.<br />The taste is unique, and the smell is amazing.  A single packet of sweetener perks up the taste even more.<br />I tried the collection variety pack, and this was definitely the standout tea of the bunch.  Many of the others were not particularly special, good but no different than Tazo or other brands, but this one makes me believe some of the hype about Numi teas.  It's worthwhile buying a box of this, every cup is enjoyable.

review/text: Let me start this off by saying that this is definitely a step up from your standard grocery store cat food.  If that is what your cat is currently eating and you're looking for a budget friendly but more wholesome alternative, then give this food a shot.<br /><br />This is a downgrade from 100% grain free cat food, but I was looking for something better than the cheap stuff at the grocery store while recovering from some unexpected financial setbacks.  I did notice my two kitties eat a lot more of this food than they do the grain free stuff, and their coats are less glossy and they are experiencing slightly more shedding, but it isn't anywhere near as bad as corn-filled budget food.  They cut costs in the labeling, marketing, and their website design and invested their money into a solid budget friendly cat food.<br /><br />I rated it 3-stars because, based on what I am seeing in their coats, this food has a high filler content... a little more than I expected.  It isn't a terrible natural food, but there are better ones out there.

All the pet food cans are BPA-free now as well. I literally have offered every high-end quality wet or dry cat food available to my semi-feral cat, even raw. It doesn't matter how good it is for your pet if your pet won't eat it. My cat will eat every bit of this brand and flavor as well as the seafare. Her fur is glossy and her eyes bright. I particularly like that even after half of the can is refrigerated it stirs to a smooth consistency immediately and effortlessly. Few if any of the online pet suppliers offer free shipping except as a promotion with the price per can the highest they can mark-up. I appreciate the discount with and convenience of autoship which can be changed at any time. I don't have to keep track or run back out because I forgot and best of all I do not have to lug heavy cans anywhere except into the apartment.

review/summary: These are COFFEE beans.  ESPRESSO is made from them.
review/text: I love this coffee.  It makes GREAT espresso drinks, though I prefer lattes and capuccinos.  Lavazza is one of the top brands in Italy (and elsewhere in Europe, having scene their product in other countries). I have also enjoyed Rosa and the pre-ground in the black can (for stovetop espresso percolators).<br /><br />Some people reviewing this product appear to be uneducated about coffee, claiming this is NOT espresso, either because it doesn't say "espresso" on the bag or because it's not a dark roast.  The truth is "espresso" refers to a process of making a coffee beverage, not the roast or the bean itself.  A coffee bean is a coffee bean is a coffee bean.  How you roast it, grind it, send water through it, serve it or drink it is up to you.  Lavazza probably didn't put the word "espresso" on it for one of two reasons: 1) In Italy it's just assumed that if you're normal you're having espresso (probably straight); or 2) Lavazza knows that you may do whatever the heck you want with their beans as long as you keep buying them.<br /><br />Lavazza Oro is a great coffee.  I love the caramel aroma when I first open the bag of beans.  I don't usually drink straight espresso, so I can't comment on how Oro fares as a straight shot.  It seems to make a really nice crema, though that is somewhat controlled by the grind and the machine.  I have a super-automatic espresso machine, and its manufacturer actually recommends NOT using darker, oilier roasts because they may gum up the grinder or brewing apparatus. I've been drinking mainly plain lattes with this coffee, and I think they're phenomenal.  I really miss it if I'm away from home and have to settle for an overpriced, burnt alternative from a mermaid of Seattle.<br /><br />I love that Amazon will ship me four bags of Lavazza Oro every month on subscribe and save, although I've noticed the price jumping up in the past few months.  I hope the price stabilizes or drops back down.  It's currently a real value compared to another Italian espresso giant that comes in silver cans.  Those other guys make delicious coffee, but they're a little too pricey for me to justify buying regularly.

review/summary: The best coffee for the best price... PERIOD!
review/text: This is my usual, day-to-day, coffee and there's really not much I can write about it other then "its great", "the best I've tried and I've tried most all" and "its worth its price!".... blah blah blah.. its coffee! ... if you like it, then its good - if you dont, then it's not... Just like wine - dont let anyone tell you what to like.<br /><br />Here's what I *can* say though - this is the best price... especially when you setup a subscription through Amazon. My only wish is that they would carry the larger bags but given the price, I'm good with the smaller ones too... Each bag fills up my espresso machien (Jura Capresso E8) in full and carries me through a week of coffees (I have friends who come over frequently, so its not just my habit ;-).<br /><br />I setup a subscription for 2 X 4 bags every two months. When I need more, I just login and have my shipment sent out sooner... simple as pie.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: The Quality is Gone...
review/text: Lavazza Qualita Oro (Gold Quality) USED to be better, more authentic, more robust, more pronounced, more reliable as one of the traditional Italian roasts from Italy.<br /><br />In both a classic espresso, and when making a latte or a cappuccino, this label was an old reliable.  I found my recent purchase to be a huge disappointment, lacking in aroma but more so, a weak, flat and downright dull cup of coffee.  I do not know what has been done to lessen the quality, but I now regret not spending a few more dollars and getting something much more enjoyable, such as Illy.<br /><br />Be aware that as a grocery item, Amazon will not accept a purchase such as this for returns.<br /><br />Very disappointing.

review/text: This coffee tastes weak and old. Cream is very thin. I don't know the roast date, but it still had about year and half to expiration date. This is strange by itself- top quality coffee is good for about 1 month after the roast. It can survive longer, when beans are  packed in a nitrogen filled sealed container, but this coffee came in a regular valved bag. The beans are well roasted, not burned, maybe they'd tasted better when fresh.<br />Gave it 2 stars because it is still better than a cheap coffee from a supermarket, which I consider 1 star benchmark.

review/text: This was my first time with Lavazza. The coffee was weak, light, flavor was OK but not what I was expecting from an Italian coffee. With the milk (cappuccino) it was barely present as taste.<br />I drink cappuccinos every day and I use a very good espresso machine and I can change the type of grind, and the strength and all that. No matter what combination I used it was just barely Ok.<br />If I could I would have returned the coffee.

review/summary: Delicious (but not actually Espresso)
review/text: This is really good stuff.  This coffee has a creamy chocolatiness about it that always makes me want some when I wake up in the morning.  I make mine in a 8 cup French press.  5 heaping scoops with a couple of spins in a $10 krups ginder and 3 minutes in filtered freshly boiled water and I am in Heaven.  My mother tells me that this is even good without milk or sugar, which should say something.<br /><br />I should note that some people give this coffee bad reviews because they believe it is espresso.  It is not.  Repeat:  THIS IS NOT ESPRESSO.  Look at the picture or read the packaging if you find it in a store.  It is not espresso.  Amazon listed it incorectly.  Don't give this coffee bad reviews because of someone at Amazon who made a mistake.<br /><br />I should also note that if you want any coffee to retain it's flavor you should not leave the coffee in the bag.  You can always smell the coffee through the bag which means that the bag is not air tight and the flavor of the coffee is dissipating into the air.  As soon as you get any coffee you should always put it in a plastic container that is air tight and stored out of direct sunlight.  Do not store coffee in the freezer because the air cycling will also suck the flavors away.

review/summary: Depends on what you're looking for. Not my favorite.
review/text: Not a bad bean, not my favorite either. The flavor is well rounded with strong herbal scents and related undertones (primarily cut grass, wild flowers) . It grinds well and brews well.  It's not an overly oily bean and the resulting coffee is not as viscous as with other blends. It's a more acidic bean than I like.<br /><br />I prefer the Lavazza Tierra blend, it's oilier and its aroma is less herbal and more chocolaty. It's less acidic as well.<br /><br />All that being said, I tried buying Lavazza on Amazon to get the free prime shipping, but it's not worth it.  I'll go back to buying my favorite beans: Danesi Classic (Kimbo Black Top is very good as well).

review/summary: Lower acid, lower caffeine but still a deep, rich taste every time
review/text: If you like rich, full-bodied flavor in a black drip coffee without the nervy jangle and burned taste of what passes for coffee at the franchised green cafe (wink), then give Lavazza oro a try. I normally prefer lighter, lower acid roasts which tend to be supercharged with caffeine but have found that this coffee is smoother and more even, with zero stomach irritation that higher acid/higher caffeine brands can sometimes bring me. One caveat: if you're looking to make espresso-type drinks, Lavazza has an actual espresso coffee that is much better for that purpose.

review/text: I use the Lavazza Qualita Oro beans in my Automatic Espresso machine. Subjectively, I believe it is the best choice out there. This coffee is pure Arabica beans, lots of body without the bitterness.<br />I have made a point of trying different types of espresso beans over the years. The trend tends to be towards over-roasted beans with bitter after-tastes, and this coffee avoids it. It is plenty strong, but roasted perfectly for espresso use, and avoids the bitterness. I don't like to add sugar to my coffee and this bean with a hint of sweet finish works great. It is also not too oily which keeps the machine internals happy.<br />When you order it with automatic subscription on Amazon, it is also an unbeatable deal. Perfect.

review/text: Lavazza Italian Coffee is the best coffee I have had in a very long time. For many years, I have ground my own coffee beans.  Some times the coffee was o.k. but a lot of the time it would just taste off.  That was the way it was until my son ordered Lavazza Italian Coffee beans for me last Christmas.  It was like a miracle.  From the first time I ground up my beans and made my first pot of Lavazza coffee, life has been so much better for me in the morning.  I drink my coffee black and with Lavazza there is no bitter taste, its honestly just perfect. The beans just blend together to make a cup of dark coffee that is just very smooth and wonderful to drink with my newspaper in the morning.

review/summary: BEANS: they are not yet GROUND
review/text: I have loved Lavazza Oro since learning to love caffe espresso in the late 1970's while attending Bologna Medical School. I purchased these because I got tired of hauling the ground Lavazza packs in from Italy and the price was good BUT did not notice that they are BEANS not yet ground. I don't have the time or inclination to grind them myself. Still a great coffee. As the late Nino Manfredi used to say in a series of TV ads at the time in what seemed to be a double play on words: "Piu lo butti giu, piu ti tira su." meaning "The more you drink the more it picks you up!" This was in the days before Viagra but the lecherous look in his eyes communicated the meaning well.

review/summary: Deliciously Simple
review/text: I really got this mainly as a mixer. I tend to lean towards the more complex, dessert-y matcha flavors like Pumpkin Pie and Cheesecake, and Earl Grey seemed like it'd be the perfect compliment to a lot of my favorites. I have so many different Earl Greys in my cupboard, it seemed blasphemous not to have an EG matcha as well even if it's just for experimenting with. But of course I have to try it by itself first! Bergamot is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey, and it's nicely present here. I'm really happy with the amount of flavor used: while I do like a strong EG, I didn't want it overpowering here at all. There's that classic citrus tang, with just a hint of floral qualities that really go well with the fresh, grassy matcha. I'm not sure if bergamot is the only flavoring used here, because as the description states there's just a tiny hint of warming smoke. It reminds me of a brisk EG with a strong black base, mixed in with my matcha! Refreshing, bright, and very different from all the other ones in my cupboard.

review/summary: Duke of Earl...
review/text: This was added to the box in an continuing effort to seduce my wife to the ways of matcha. So far, the best I've gotten out of her was "That's....interesting." Ah well, more for me. London Fogs, also known as an Earl Grey with vanilla and milk, are her favorite winter drink, so that's what I had in mind when I snagged this little beauty. That and she's a sucker for anything Earl Grey. But I'm looking forward to mixing this with, you guessed it, vanilla. An Earl Grey/vanilla was my very first tea, though I'm not much of an Earl Grey fan nowadays. But still, it sounded very tasty and I had to at least try it. I'm a bit worried, after the bitterness of the lemon matcha, but I was worried about the watermelon and it turned out amazing. And we're big fans of the Earl Grey from Red Leaf Teas around here, so we have a lot of faith in this blend. Their Earl Grey Oolong is one of the teas my wife absolutely cannot do without, and their Raspberry Earl Grey was one of the few teas I've actually seen her mourn when it was discontinued. So yes, if there was ever an Earl Grey matcha to get her into matcha, it would have to be from Red Leaf Tea.<br /><br />Success! We went to the zoo on Friday and my poor wife was only running on a couple hours sleep, so I made her a matcha London Fog and she loved it. Loved it! I stole a few sips of the Earl Grey before mixing it in with everything else and it was perfect Earl Grey, and I knew that I'd made the right choice. I mixed together equal parts Earl Grey matcha and French Vanilla matcha (both from Red Leaf Tea, of course) and whisked it together in a bowl to be sure to get all the lumps out. Personally I don't care about a clump or matcha or two, but it really turns her off of her drink. Anyway, I heated up some vanilla soy milk, frothed it up, added it to the blend and it was perfect. She loved it! And it's so much better for you than the regular London Fog, full of syrup and dairy...blegh. This is one I think I'll have to keep in stock, if only for my wife's sake, which I am more than happy to do.

review/summary: Looks LIke Food network dish!
review/text: I was so surprised when I opened the can to see real shrimp prawns like the ones served in shrimp cocktail! The chicken looks like the canned white meat chicken that my husband and I purchase from Costco to make our homemade sandwiches with.  This is not your usual ground mystery meat that one usually thinks of when talking about wet dog food. This is whole food in a can that looks fit for a human. In fact, I called my husband after I opened the can to tell him that our new puppy was eating shrimp prawns and shredded chicken breast with kale and sweet potatoes and beans. Hubby wanted to know why the dog was eating better than he does. My 3 month old puppy wasn't eating that well and not gaining weight. I will continue to mix this with her dry food because she devoured it and was wagging her tail like crazy during the meal. I will have to see if she gains weight with this.

review/summary: my cats turned their nose up
review/text: Neither of my seafood loving cats liked this at all. It looked very dry, and both my cats love the juices to be plentiful in their half of  one can of wet food a day.  Both cats are crazy, crazy, crazy for an occasional real tuna treat, so i thougt this would be a sure  thing.  Two weeks after I got it I brought home two 12 week old kittens I decided to adopt, and they gave it a sniff, and walked away. Not even  my neighbor who I gave it to for feeding strays could get it eaten. This leads me to believe it wasn't a good  batch~ but the date was fine~ 2013 and the end of it, too. Disappointing for me since i had been looking for a cat food that was tuna and good for the cats, but this isn't it.

review/summary: Best simple cat food
review/text: My cat that can eat fish loves this food!  I was concerned as well about tuna on a regular basis, but then learned that the tuna in the Pacific has much less mercury than that which is caught in the  Atlantic.  Along with the fact that my super finicky cat loves this keeps me buying it.  I do have to say that the ingredient list is not correct on this website because they do not use the synthetic K...menedione sodium bisulfate, in the large cans.  I don't think they have it in the small cans anymore as well, but not sure about that.  In the ones that I ordered, small cans, it was not included as an ingredient.  Anyway, I also want to say that of all the large cans of tuna with topping, this one looks the best and has big chunks of the albacore on top.  Mabel loves it!  You can not beat the price and quality of this food. Oh, another thing, Mabel even prefers this one to Tiki or BFF tuna and the latter still uses MSB in their foods and have no plans to change in spite of new research.  Doesn't say much for Weruva in my mind.

review/summary: Roses
review/text: I love this tea. I found it by accident at a grocery store near me while i was searching for "Wild sweet orange". The minute I openned the packet I smell a rose scent similar to that found with Rose essential oil.  (not the scent of rosewater, not the cloying scent of rose perfume nor even the perfumey sweetness of fresh roses, but a scent that is the true essence of roses.) The fragrance flooded me with pleasant memories. I see one reviewer didn't like it. I guess it is not for everyone. I love it. It is truly unique. I have never had a tea like this. After finishing half a box in 3 days, I have been in search of somewhere else to buy it.<br /><br />The tea itself is more subtle than the aromatics that are released when the packet is openned. That is much harder to discribe . slight smell of rose with a hint of woodiness. It is more subtle than a lot of their teas. Too bad everyone can't try a sample before committing to an entire box.<br /><br />Edit 12/12/10 OK maybe it is not so much the roses that give the strong scent. maybe it is the geranium oil. Whatever it is, it reminds me of a spa not a chinese herbalist.

review/summary: Overall nice tea
review/text: This is a nice subtle tea with soothing ingredients. Personally, I would prefer the floral essences to be more pronounced, but I understand the need to appeal to a broad range of palates. I see some reviews have mentioned a putrid or medicinal smell/taste to this tea: what they're smelling and tasting is the valerian root. Valerian has an unmistakable odor; once you smell it you'll never forget it. I'd say to go to a health food store and sniff a bottle of pure valerian capsules to familiarize yourself with the odor, but it might ruin the tea for you. Its presence in this tea is noticeable, but not overpowering. The valerian scent is strongest when you first open the packet; the smell of the brewed tea leans more towards the rose, geranium, and citrus side of the spectrum. The licorice in the tea doesn't impart much in the way of overt flavor, but does make itself known with an ever-so-slight cooling aftertaste.

review/summary: Strong Rose, Lemon, Geranium, and Orange Taste
review/text: I've decided that reviewing tea is risky as we all have different taste and desires for what we want from our drinks, but here goes.<br /><br />I tried this because Tazo Passion is my favorite and I wondered what else Tazo had concocted that may be fantastic. I drink this tea unsweetened. I detect the taste of rose petals, a taste of lemon (not sure which of the three lemon tasting herbs that is from), then geranium and orange. It left a strong floral aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be buying this again, it is "okay", thus 3 stars = It's Okay in Amazon's rating sytem.<br /><br />This is an herbal blend, caffiene free. Per the ingredients it has: lemon balm, rose petals, honeybush, orange peel, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, licorice root, lavender, valerian root, natural flavors, ginger, orange essence oil and chinese geranium oil.<br /><br />I liked the idea that these herbs promote calmness but I never felt those effects. I'll stick with pure chamomile blossoms to make chamomile tea (with honey) when I need to unwind.

review/summary: Froot Loops + Funeral Home
review/text: I have to agree with the first reviewer on this. While I'm generally not a fan of fruity or floral teas, I love rose in tea. When I first opened the bag, I almost gagged at the overpowering aroma of citrus and florals - although tazo uses natural ingredients, it seemed almost synthetic. Luckily, the tea (unsweetened and brewed as suggested) does not taste nearly as strong as it smells. Still, I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled overwhelmingly like a funeral home / aunt gertrude's perfume while tasting like a bowl of froot loops.<br /><br />I suppose I had hoped for a more neutral base with subtle accents of flavor. If you don't mind in your face citrus and florals, then you will probably enjoy this tea.

review/text: Tazo normally has decent tea, however they do have a love for citrus and lemon grass. I was so curious about this tea that I decided to buy some, and with the tag of "well-being"-who doesn't want to be a little healthier? That being said my first smell of this tea left me gaging just slightly , but being of Asian decent I have drank medicinal herb brews which can peel paint from walls. I muscled through and took a sip. The taste wasn't nearly as bad as the overwhelming scent of old Chinese apothecary with random bits of leaf and twigs you don't want to know about. In fact it could be drinkable if you're into vile tasting tea with a side of puking in your mouth.<br /><br />For those that actually do enjoy this tea...more power to you it gave me a headache just by it's pungent aroma.

review/text: We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an "organic pear-only" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is "cooked" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!

They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish.

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.

review/text: Same food as in the store, but delivered right to your door.  This came in handy when we were nearly out of baby food and didn't have time to go to the store.  Two days later, a package of food arrived.  Very convenient.

So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/summary: Ehh, good gummies, but you don't get much.
review/text: First off, you can get these 3.5 oz boxes from your local "Wally-World" for 99cents each. So, Amazon is obviously making a killing off of these boxes.  The amount of gummies in the box is deceiving.  The box is extremely big compared to the bag holding the gummies.  I'd rather buy the Angry Bird Fruit Snacks, not sure if I can find them somewhere else .. other than on here.  $7 a box of fruit snacks is pretty ridiculous.

review/text: Angry Birds Gummies rock!  They are well packaged, great tasting, and big portions.  The kids go wild for them!  They sell out quick in stores, so I'm glad to have a mail order option.

review/text: OMG! MOST DEFINITELY FIVE STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT! These are by far the most AMAZING Gummies I have ever tasted!! (and believe me I've tasted LOTS). Each color has its own unique,divine fruity flavor. The texture is absolutely perfect: soft, tangy and totally gummy! Whether or not you're an angry birds lover doesn't matter in the least; once you taste them you will become an 'angry birds gummies craver'. Stock up on em for Halloween, kids and adults alike will love it. Awesome.

review/summary: B&M Brown Bread w/raisin
review/text: I grew up with this wonderful canned bread and have always had trouble finding it in the grocery store.  When I could talk the manager into ordering a case for me, I would get very strange looks and then they wouldd never call me to let me know that it was in ... so I don't really know if they even ordered it.<br />I am so happy that I found it on Amazon.  I had looked elsewhere but should have known to start my search with the best "shopping mall" on the internet.<br />Thank you, Amazon!!!
