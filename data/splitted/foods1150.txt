review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I recently purchased the Caribou k-cups and this coffee came along with it. While I don't like it as well as the Caribou, it's not a bad tasting coffee. It's a very smooth coffee with no bitter aftertaste. And surprisingly I cannot tell that it only has half the caffeine. I usually get a headache if I don't get enough caffeine in the morning. I got no headache or any other side-effects from caffeine withdrawal. I will probably purchase this in the future.

Honestly, it tastes very watered down.  I don't like it but have no choice.  It's either this, or no coffee at all.  Please make it stronger.  Thank you.

review/text: I normally drink half-caff and am very pleased with it, but after trying a sample of the Tully's French Roast decaf that came in a variety pack, I was truly AMAZED at the flavor.  I anticipated it being bland, not much taste but I was sooo wrong.  The flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times I checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated! Although I will continue to drink the half-caf, this product has taken the #1 spot on my coffee list!

review/summary: Hard to find but worth it
review/text: I see K-cups everywhere but not these. Found them once a while ago and haven't been able to replenish till now. I love these because although i am a coffee fiend (they did a blood test a while ago and found 90% coffee) I want to have these when I only need one cup and really don't want to be anything more than semi-concious. They are great for people who get the shakes from coffee also. I prefer really brewed pots of coffee but these are a great substitute when I only have time for a cup and really need to get back to sleep in a couple of hours. Great taste, expensive like all K cups but not bad if you only drink a couple of cups. Well worth keeping on hand.

review/summary: Tastes good and the caffeine content serves a purpose...
review/text: I've been drinking this coffee for a few months now and it's not my first choice in terms of taste but it still tastes good and it's helped lower my caffeine intake which is what I am mainly concerned with.  I switched to this coffee after I found out I was pregnant and was told to have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day.  I emailed the company directly at the time and was told that "The relative caffeine content in a 6oz brewed cup of Half Caff is 48-53mg" so it met my needs perfectly! I would recommend this product if you're not looking to give up coffee altogether but still want to reduce your intake.

review/summary: Great Buy and the Price is Right!
review/text: we've been devout Folgers coffee drinkers for over 35 years and never thought we'd switch brands. after my husband had a bout of heart problems, he was told to go to decaf coffee or stop drinking it, which wasn't an option. we started buying the Folgers half caff and he cut back to 2 cups a day. when i bought the keurig coffee maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System</a> i switched to the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I29E">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cup for Keurig Brewers</a> (love it) and bought the ekobrew refillable k-cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064A7SRS">Ekobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREEN</a> for him and his Folgers half-caff.<br /><br />on a whim, i decided to buy a small box of the Green Mountain half-caff k cups for him to try. i was very nervous about it because he's such a die-hard Folgers kind of guy. since i don't care for decaff coffee i didn't want to have to drink it if he didn't like it. he took a couple big drinks of the coffee and i finally asked him how he liked it. he said he liked it a lot, and thought it was much better than the Folgers half-caff, it seemed to have a lot more flavor. phew!<br /><br />in fairness to Folgers half-caff ground coffee, the reason he may think the Green Mountain half-caff has more flavor could be because of how much of the Folgers he used to make a cup. with these refillable k-cups it doesn't seem to be an exact science, so one cup could be a bit stronger or weaker than the next. i think this is what he was saying. because the Green Mountain k-cups are accurately pre-measured, you get the same taste in every cup.<br /><br />the bottom line is, he loves the Green Mountain half-caff coffee, and we will definitely be buying more of it. i asked him if he wanted to try the Folgers half-caff keurig coffee and he said, "ummm, i don't know". for a hard-core coffee drinker to be ok with that kind of change says a lot about the GM half-caff coffee. as least it speaks to me of how great this coffee is.

review/text: I have a sensitive stomach and can't take those fire-blasted, carbonized roastings that a lot of coffee has been subjected to, so when I saw a medium roast, I wondered if it would be a true, flavorful medium roast or charred beans with a toasted outside.  I also am trying to cut back on caffeine.  So it seems that this coffee is tailor made for me!<br /><br />I have a cup of this every morning and I love it!  Great flavor, not much acid, clean aftertaste and enough of a jolt to get going without so much caffeine I get the jitters.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering this in the 50-pack boxes!

While in the brewing process, the aroma fills the air leading a person to anticipate the reward at the end of the brewing cycle.  If a person does not want the caffeine, this is the coffee for them.

Upon opening, instead of receiving the usual, expected k- cups in wrapped boxes of 2 or 3 containing the individual k-cups, there were 50 individual servings thrown in the box. I counted them, so I did receive the amount ordered. But these cups look like they were discarded samples, all of them wrinkled, twisted, some with top punctured. Would you drink any of these? Highly disappointed, will not do further business with this vendor again. Time to order direct from Keurig.

review/summary: Not even worth the one star
review/text: I ordered this and had it shipped to a friend. She said that the box arrived crushed but she didn't think it mattered. When she opened the box up, she noticed that had very little adhesive on it, making her think the box may have been opened before or that an old box had been used. She looked at the candy and it was white all over and indented and looked very weathered and old. She is a big fan of Whoppers candy and I sent these to her to brighten up her day but because of bad management on the part of one company, she ended up with candy that she could not even eat.

review/summary: Great Tostado Shells!
review/text: These "tostada shells" are great for making "cheese crisps" with cheddar cheese and a taco sauce or salsa. Simply heat two tostada sheels in the microwave for about 50 seconds and they come out very crispy. Then add shredded cheese and microwave again for about 20 seconds. Finally, top with sauce and enjoy! You can also use regular taco toppings, starting with either ground beef or rfried beans, for a tasty treat.<br /><br />The tostada shells are substantial enough to hold a lot of toppings without breaking. The shells are rather tough right out of the box, so it is better to microwave them first before adding toppings.

review/summary: Utterly delicious neat and born to be mixed.
review/text: For the record, I'm not a liqueur drinker.  I'm a whiskey drinker who prefers single malt scotch and single barrel bourbon neat, never anywhere near ice and aired for 10 minutes before first sip after well sniffing in a small cylindrical glass.  I was expecting to HATE Red Stag - but it seduced me because it puts the taste of bourbon first.  It smells like bourbon with a hint of cherry pipe tobacco in the glass: notes of popcorn, molasses, tobacco, leather, and cherry.  At first sip the first taste is bourbon: corn, honey, bacon, and molasses.  The mid palate explodes with cherry and tobacco and leather.  It's sweet, but it's oddly sophisticated.  The finish is sweet with honey, cherry, and smoke.<br /><br />It's utterly delicious.  I polished off my glass like a hungry wolf.  The cherry is robust - but tastes real.  It never obscures the bourbon which shines through with character, age, and American cowboy splendor like Johnny Cash's voice.<br /><br />I'm a whiskey snob, but this liqueur is the only whiskey adulteration I've ever loved.  The cherry bourbon alchemy is killer mixed with coke.  It's even better in a modified Manhattan.  I suspect it will work in any mixed drink where bourbon plays a part and you'd consider putting in a cherry.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  I love this stuff - but I'm a whiskey purist and this isn't pure whiskey.  By all rights I ought to hate this...  Where's my glass?  I want more...

review/summary: Not just a side -- Add stuff for a quick main dish!
review/text: While I still serve Near East rice pilafs as a side dish, I now fix them for a quick and healthy weeknight meal! For most of them, I cook as directed in my small rice cooker (Cuisinart CRC-400 4-Cup Rice Cooker). Five minutes after I hear the water starting its boil, I add a cup of cut-up cooked protein (leftover chicken, turkey, chickpeas, beans, whatever) and a cup or so of chopped veggies (fresh broccoli, carrots, onions, frozen peas). When the rice cooker light tells me the rice is done, so is everything else! (If you use a long-cooking whole grain pilaf, you will want to add these ingredients later in the rice-cooking cycle to avoid over cooking.) I guess you could also mix the meat and veggies in after cooking them separately, if you prefer. This is enough to serve three adults (unless they are really, really hungry.)<br /><br />I like the Toasted Almond mix so much that I often add nuts myself to the other flavors; the crunch adds interest.<br /><br />You can find recipes at the Near East website for other ideas.

review/text: I love Trident Layers gum - it's long lasting, sugar free, has good texture, and is fruity without tasting like "kid stuff."  That being said, the "Orchard Peach and Ripe Mango" is my favorite flavor.  It's on the mellow side, not sour, but with a little added zing.  If you like peaches or mangos at all, this gum is a great choice.

To be sure, like anything, it can get old, so my gal and I like to change it up...but we come back to this stuff more and more.  From using just as an enhancer by adding some to the morning pot of our standard brew, to iced frappacinos, to straight up hot...this stuff really satisfies.  Shipping is not cheap if you are far from New Orleans like I am because this stuff does need to be kept cold and so they insist on 2 day shipping, but I would rather it arrive fresh.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great Way To Buy These Biscuits! My Dog Loves Them.
review/text: My dog is medium in size, but he doesn't like large bones or treats. These are tiny, and I think he thinks he's getting more, because he gets them more often. They are easier for him to eat though and he doesn't need large ones because I don't want him to overeat.<br /><br />He also has a sensitive stomach and these don't bother him.<br /><br />Good choice for us and SO convenient to have them delivered right to the door. I'm hoping my dog will come to think of the UPS delivery man as a friend, but so far it isn't happening.<br /><br />EDITED to say that this order contains a lot of dog biscuits! I think I bought too much for one dog. It's going to take a long time to finish all those boxes. I probably should have bought less or added more dogs.  :)

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July. Anyway, all four of my dogs love these Iams biscuits. My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.

review/summary: Dogs love them, a lot of treats!
review/text: I have 2 dogs, one is a small chihuahua and one is an older sheltie. The small dog eats these things like crazy, loves them. The older dog has few teeth left (she was abused and we rescued her). A lot of treats we buy are to hard for her to eat but these are the right texture and hardness. She can chew them up and she loves them as well. Perfect for giving to the dogs after they use the bathroom.<br /><br />The value is great. I didn't really think about how many boxes 6 of these were but the deal is that much better when you actually see how many treats you have. It's an amazing amount and I'm set with treats for a few months at least!<br /><br />Great deal, I will be placing a new order when I start running low.... But that will be a long time!!<br /><br />I uploaded a picture so you can see how much the little dog loves these thing!

review/text: I live in an isolated town, and you cannot purchase Iams dog biscuits within a four hour radius.  Unfortunately, Iams small biscuits are all my parents' spoiled dogs will eat for a snack.  Like another reviewer's dog, these dogs will not eat large biscuits, even though one is a Great Dane and the other is a lab mix.<br /><br />When I found the monthly subscription on Amazon and found they were slightly cheaper than in the stores (where I can no longer buy them; thank you, over-sized "super" stores that carry fewer and fewer products since you feel the consumer is at your mercy), I immediately ordered them.  They arrived a week later with free shipping.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and tight; very few biscuits were broken in the opened box.  They were also very fresh.  The expiration date was June 15, 2012.  Traditionally, the ones I've purchased in stores were only good for six months or less.  I subscribed for two six packs a month, and it's very satisfying to know I don't have to worry about my mother haranguing me to drive to Mississippi to pick up dog biscuits.  They come to the PO box once a month: No fuss, no muss, no bother.  And the dogs are infinitely happier. :)

review/summary: Best in nutrition & taste despite the Snickers brand
review/text: I am hoping this will be included in the Amazon Prime selection soon because as a frequent protein- and nutrition-bar consumer, this one is the best I've found so far.<br /><br />I also like Odwalla Super Protein, Kashi Protein Roll bars, and Atkins Nutrition bars, but they are all 190-250 calories which I find a bit too high in calories for an afternoon or mid-morning snack.<br /><br />This Marathon Nutrition (different from Marathon Energy) bars comes in two flavors, almond nut crunch and dark chocolate, and the dark chocolate flavor is excellent and true to the description.  It has no discernible metallic/chalky aftertaste that many of the fortified bars have (although this includes a good range of vitamins and minerals too), and contains the following macronutrients:<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Protein: 11g<br />Carb: 22g with 7g fiber and 9g sugar<br />Fat: 4.5g<br /><br />150 is just right for me, and 11 grams of protein with that calories profile is EXCELLENT.  Most of all, it's delicious.<br /><br />The only drawback that I can see in these bars is the relative unavailability in markets (I think it's still new), and its non-organic ingredients.  Overall, excellent, healthy product from a candy brand.

review/summary: Snickers Dark Chocolate and Multi-Grain Energy Bars
review/text: Twice now I've purchased Snickers products from Amazon:  Snickers Dark Chocolate and Multi-grain crunch Energy bars, and twice I received boxes whose expiration date was less than one month away and the bars tasted old!!!!  Hard to return food, so we just kept them, but if you are discounting a product because it is about to expire, then say so, so I order one box and not 3 by the expiration date! I even ordered some for my elderly parent in another state and was embarrassed to learn from her that she too received 2 boxes that were about to expire.

review/text: These were wonderful. I want to order more, but I live in the south.<br />The only problem I had was there needed to be more dry ice packed<br />in the box. By the time I got the box, the dry ice was not cold and<br />the bars had started to melt. Had to wait a day to let them harden<br />back up.

review/summary: Good low-calorie bar
review/text: This is a satisfying low-calorie, high nutrition bar at a good price (although I've seen it cheaper in supermarkets when they have it in stock).  I'm using it as a meal replacement in an ultra-low calorie "Optifast-type" diet and it gets me through the three hours until the next meal very well. It has a tasty chocolate flavor and is a normal size for a candy bar (not one of those bite-sized low-cal bars). Congratulations to Snickers for making a low-calorie nutrition bar that tastes good.

review/summary: Energy Bar Has Never Tasted This Great!
review/text: Snickers Marathon Long-Lasting Energy bar promises to give gym enthusiasts long lasting energy which is rarely found in most chocolate bars. It is typical to find lots of carbohydrates and fats in these chocolate bars, especially for Mars chocolate products, but long lasting energy? Isn't this just a fad?<br /><br />I have enjoyed Snicker products ever since I was a child. Guess Filipinos are patrons of most US products, especially their chocolates. I have accustomed my taste bud with the rich chocolate contents and satisfying chewiness these Snicker bars provide. I eat during examinations because a friend of mine informed me that chocolates are good brain boosters.<br /><br />However, the new challenge Snickers placed on their shoulder is to provide us with long lasting energy bars. I must admit that it gave me additional energy boost during stressful office hours but to say that it is long lasting is not acceptable.<br /><br />Gene Eden VIR 101 offers long lasting energy booster even if this is not the primary task of these all natural supplement. It is designed to shield the body from viral infection thus helping the body gain more energy for his or her daily activities.<br /><br />Mars may have exaggerated a bit in stating that its Snicker Long Lasting Energy Bar provides LONG lasting energy to its patrons. It would be enough to say that it gives extra-energy to those who will enjoy munching these tasty chocolates in between their gym work-outs.

review/summary: Just a hint of coconut
review/text: Depending upon how much you like M&Ms, will determine how much you like this product.  If you are crazy about M&Ms and the candy shelled coating, but don't want an overwhelming coconut flavoring, this product will probably meet your expectations.  It is just enough that you can taste it.  I was expecting a bit more coconut.  Certainly not to the point of a Mounds or Almond Joy, but something a bit stronger.  My coworkers who are not that sensitive to coconut flavoring, couldn't taste it at all.  They were "blinded" in that I did not tell them they were coconut M&Ms before I gave it to them. When I asked them if they could tell what flavor it was, most could not.

review/summary: Use with caution
review/text: Ok folks, this is not a joke.  I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave's Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I've ever tasted.  I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot.  This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa.  DON'T USE IT LIKE TABASCO!!!  It is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish.  My brother doubted its powers so I poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him.  The poor guy freaked and ate more Italian bread than I've ever seen anyone eat in my life.  This bottle will last you a long time.  Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  It's just too hot.

review/summary: feed your sadistic side
review/text: Come on, read the label. One of the manufacturer's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains.<br /><br />For the last five years or so, I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot. The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much. It is particularly helpful to quiet those who cannot refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events. Invariably, for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally. The only downside is this ploy only works once.<br /><br />I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings, or add a dab to any taco sauce, however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible.

review/summary: Awesome Sauce
review/text: The first time I had Dave's Insanity* sauce, I was at a restaurant. The waitress had sensibly warned me about its intensity and suggested I put just a dot of it on my plate to test it out. "Hah!" I thought, "Maybe some of your typical hot sauce wussy customers can't handle it, but I'm made of stronger stuff" and I proceeded to pour a ketchup sized pile on my plate. It was not until I coated half a french fry with it and stuck it in my mouth that I learned the folly of my ways. I began to sweat and blush as my vision started to get blurry. There was not enough water in the world to cool the inferno blazing in my mouth. Such is the way of this sauce. Heed my warning as I should have heeded hers.<br /><br />It probably isn't the hottest on the market, but it's the hottest I could find. It heats up anything with the tiniest of drops, which means the 5 oz bottles lasts a good while (about a year to a year and a half for me, but I add it to almost everything). I was not a fan of the semi vinegary taste at first, but have grown to like it. This sauce is thicker then most, which I prefer to the more watery ones. Definitely worth trying if you like super spicy sauce, but if that isn't your thing, stay away.<br /><br />As a final warning, try not to get any of it on your skin. This stuff burns!<br /><br />*It should be noted that this sauce neither contains nor creates insanity. This is a clear example of false advertising, and I have written Dave many times regarding this issue. He has yet to write a reply.

review/summary: daves insanity
review/text: i have been making my own hot sauces a couple years now, and ive always heard all these reviews about daves insanity, so i was happy to get a chance to try it to see what it REALLY is all about. ill compare it to my sauce , which is nothing but habanero peppers cooked with vinegar and salt and pureed in a food processor. daves sauce dosent attack your tongue right away,like my sauce does, first you taste the tomato/spice flavor, and a strong cayenne pepper type flavor, then it heats up slowly until it is a little hotter than my sauce. this is what i like about it.. the fact that it builds in heat and the warmth lasts a good amount of time.. what i dont like is it lacks that fresh pepper taste, and the fast bite that my sauce has. to be honest as far as taste goes, ive never tasted a hot sauce that had a better flavor than cholula.. too bad its too mild for me

review/summary: Great sauce!! but treat it with respect..
review/text: I came across this sauce about five years ago. A Thai friend had brought it over and claimed it was one of the hottest things he's ever tried.. I told him that being a Latino guy, I was used to dealing with hot stuff, (Habaneros being my favorite because of bite and taste)I followed his advise and used a toothpick to put a tiny dot on a chicken wing... and it did the job well!! I came across this sauce again at a Ross store and bought a couple (which by the way, lasted for a long, long time).I was very impressed with how hot this sauce was that I went out of my way to put little DOT "Hazardous Material" and "Flammable Liquid" placards on it... specially after I found my roomate bent over the sink, making hissing sounds and practically scrubbing his tongue in an attempt to stop the burn, he had treated this sauce and if it was your common Taco Bell sauce... big mistake. Unless you like scratching bathroom walls, treat this sauce with respect! For beginners (or anyone without "hot sauce scar tissue") use a toothpick to test your limits and move up little by litte. It's not meant to add flavor to your food but to add bite to it. Try a small drop in your ranch sauce, you'll love it! try a drop in anything in the pot, from pastas to stews to chili, (be careful with soups, the heat multiplies). I now have about 2 oz. left in my bottle and have been scanning the shelves at Ross, hoping to find a bottle for under $3 but so far, it looks like I might have to place and order online..

review/summary: This Is HOT - Highly Recommended
review/text: "Dave's Insanity Sauce" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: For the serious chili head only!
review/text: Dave's Original Insanity sauce is one of those sauces on the "must try" list that has avoided my radar for some time. However, tonight I managed to score a bottle and almost couldn't wait to get it home and opened.<br />The obligatory side bar warnings included "not for use by persons with respiratory or heart problems" HAHAHAHAHA! Wait, for real? OK, so now my interest was completely piqued. I tore off the shrink wrap and shook it really well as I could see the labeled "pepper extract" floating into the neck of the bottle.<br />I grabbed a Doritos hint of lime chip and poured a puddle about the size of a quarter (no fear) and in the hatch it went. The flavor of this sauce is good; smoky and rich with a dark undertone which is typical of high end sauces. There was a slight bitter flavor that also accompanies other extract added sauces. But the warm rich overtones mostly covered the thin vein of bitter. This sauce is a slow burner. There was no ghost pepper 'kicks your face like a mule right out of the gate' burn, but it started building about 30 seconds in and kept billowing up like someone shoveling coal into an already stoked furnace.<br />This sauce is hot. Not hot in your ordinary stinging, tingly, brings up a little bead or two of sweat. No, more like throwing back a shot of molten lead, followed by a hot battery acid chaser kind of hot. I was really impressed with Dave's ability to make my face pound with every heartbeat and then for my tongue to wilt and go to sleep in protest. Despite my well earned capsaicin tolerance I have to admit I drooled a little bit as my mouth was not responding to mental commands. This sauce can easily stand tall against Blair's Mega Death (with liquid rage) and Red Ghost. The pain is searing and lasting and the subsequent endorphin rush awesome! I highly recommend it. Seriously. But please... don't come back all snappy and say, "what, you pu$$y... that sauce was nothing." Because I will know you are a poser... yeah fosho. Put on your big boy pants and give it a good try... and let the tears of happiness flow.

So when we first got this one drop was enough and scary for many. But we are starting to get accustomed to it and can add a little more. Keep the bottle clean. If any sauce gets on it and you touch it it can burn. But we like it. Good taste and heat.

review/summary: A legendary ultra-hot sauce!
review/text: Yes, I'm a chilehead. I not only grew my own peppers (jalapeno, habanero, and the hottest-at-its-time red savina) back in the mid-'90s but also made it a point to sample lots of hot sauces. I have a huge collection of hot sauces instead of liquor behind the home bar.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce was the first ultra-hot sauce I've tried. What's interesting about this sauce is that it uses capsaicin extract in an oil base. This adds a lot of fury to an already fiery coarse and thick mix of tabasco and habanero peppers with a hint of smokiness within a tomato base. But you know you're into something brutal when you shake the bottle and witness the changing of the dark red contents to a fiery orange.<br /><br />The heat of this sauce creeps up on you. At first you begin delving into the already hot and slightly-smoky tastes and textures of the base. Then the extracts hit and lock onto your tongue. It's a very persistent burn that wiped that smug grin off of my face as I looked for the nearest glass of iced milk. And just when you think it's over, depending upon how much you consumed you may feel a wicked afterburn when you go and relieve the other end of your gastrointestinal tract.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce is legendary. Even the label is worth a read. If you really want to test yourself or your friends you can't go wrong with this just for the burn.

review/text: This is a nice hot sauce, as everyone is saying it IS hot.  Don't attempt to be macho and eat too much of it on your selected dish, you will be rewarded handsomely if you do.  Come to think of it, I think this could be the subject of Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" song.<br /><br />I normally put a small amt in a bowl of chili and the heat is enough to make you sweat.  Sometimes, when I walk by the fridge I will grab a toothpick and drop it in and pull it across my tongue just to get the heat between meals.<br /><br />If you like things hot, you can't lose with Dave's Insanity Sauces.
