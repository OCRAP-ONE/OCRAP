review/summary: Give it a few tries
review/text: The first time I tried these I really didn't like the fakey artificial smell and taste of the pebbles. Then I waited a few months and decided to try them again and now this is one of my favorite cereals! There are plenty of marshmallows so you're not getting ripped of in that department either. Personally, I couldn't care less about sugar content, but they aren't really any worse than most other kiddie cereals out there. It's actually pretty low now that I'm comparing it to some of my other favorites. Anyway, the deal is, it's tasty, I like it and as long as they make it, I'll keep buying it!

review/summary: Tastes stanky!......the pebbles are gross, they really missed the mark on this one!
review/text: I was expecting normal pebbles, you knmow like Fruity Pebbles or the Cocoa Variety but I got a flavorless pile of knock-off Lucky Charms. These taste nothing like the others and the texture is also pretty bad. The only good thing about them is the marshmallows, I picked them out and gave the rest to the birds and ducks in my pond. Not that cheap either. All in all I'd rate this 2 stars.

review/summary: Yumm!!
review/text: I'm very picky when it comes to fruitcake.  I hate average fruitcakes that taste synthetic and are full of preservatives and who knows what else.<br /><br />But THIS fruitcake is amazingly good!  I ordered it out of curiosity and to try something new.  Wow!  So much flavor and richness!  It's moist without being soggy, and the cherries, pineapples, and nuts taste perfect with the brandy flavor and spices in the cake.  This is a very dark, rich, flavorful fruitcake.  It tastes homemade.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering this again!  Probably soon, too, because I know this one won't last very long, it'll be eaten before Thanksgiving for sure!<br /><br />The seller was quick to ship and it was packaged great.

review/text: This was a nice change from most fruitcakes sold.  I am a fruitcake fan, but i really have had some that were just way too much citron for my taste.  What i liked is the cake is REALLY dense, smells of brandy, has a lot of cherries and very minimal citron/citrus and tons of nuts. Stayed moist for weeks as i nibbled away at it, and still not finished..LOL.  Try it you'll like it.

review/summary: Mouthful of Party
review/text: I am not a fruitcake fan.  I gag on maraschino cherries.  And whatever weird spices go into your run-of-the-mill doorstop fruitcake are a big turnoff for me.  But THIS cake is unlike any I've ever tasted.  Over the past couple of months I've eaten two of the 1-pound cakes and went ahead and bought a 3-pound.  It is moist to the point of being ridiculous.  I can't discern any pastry substance in the cake except on the top.  It's more like a big brandy-flavored block of pie with pecan pieces in every bite.  The top is sprinkled with walnut bits and half-pecans.  (It also has a very few half-maraschino cherries just on the top which I flick off into the trash.  There are none in the cake itself.)  But each slice is like taking your mouth out to Disneyland.  I've even visited the monks at the abbey where the cakes are confected.  These fellows bake the cakes in an atmosphere of natural beauty and joy.  I've found a reason to eat fruitcake year-round! ~ Deacon Pete

review/summary: I dislike fruitcake.
review/text: I dislike fruitcake. But a business associate bought me one of these and convinced me that it was unlike anything I had ever eaten. So I tried it. WOW! First off, it is chock FULL of NUTS! I mean, there must be $20 worth of NUTS in the thing. Second, the fruits were fantastic! Like PINEAPPLES and CHERRIES...not the expected raisins and dates. And finally, the BRANDY! There must be a pint of brandy in one 3 lb cake...seriously. So I looked for this online and was a bit surprised by the price. But, I have to admit, it is worth every cent. One 3 lb. fruitcake (which is more like a dense, BRANDY NUT loaf) lasted my family about 2 weeks, almost daily slicing off about a 1/2 inch at a time and being completely satisfied as if having eaten a rich candy bar. And yet, it isn't overly sweet. It has a very dignified...well BRANDY...flavor to it, punctuated with a bit of sweetness from the pineapples and cherries (and maybe other fruits, not sure) and almost solid NUTS. The bottom line, I LOVE this particular fruitcake! And I have tried several other brands since, but I cannot find anything CLOSE. I dislike fruitcake! So...here I am ordering these expensive fruitcakes once again because...well, they're just flat WORTH it! Even with the shipping. Treat yourself to one of the finest delicacies in the world. You won't regret it.

review/text: I love dark fruitcake. I grew up with dark fruit cake.  I grew up with homemade fruitcake, but I am not such a cook.<br /><br />After disappointment with grocery store fruitcakes, I thought:  Hey, I'll get one on line that is highly recommended.<br /><br />I bought 3 lbs of this one -- the price is reasonable -- it has lots of good ingredients and I was thrilled when it arrived in my mailbox today.  I cut a slice to have with my tea and it was dry, it was bitter, it was perhaps the worst fruitcake I have ever had!  Am I supposed to drench it in brandy before I eat it?  How do I rescue this $35 doorstop.  This fruitcake is the kind of thing that gave it its bad name.  My wife hates the stuff, but I still love it -- when done right.<br /><br />Think twice before you buy this one.

While the water smelled like root beer as I brought the cup up to my mouth, the taste was nothing at all even remotely similar to root beer not to mention it was just awful.<br /><br />Form now on I guess I just stick to real live root beer sodas.

review/text: YaYa's Herb & Garden Vegetable popcorn is a great treat for snacking that doesn't involve sugar or tons of fat. This corn is air popped, so it has a light and airy core. Since the kernels are misted with oil so the flavor powder will stick, that takes away a little of the crispness. The ingredients are outstanding, a-lot of natural herbs and veggies. We have also tried (and thoroughly enjoy)the white cheddar and white cheddar and jalapeno flavors, but this is our favorite.

review/summary: Blended to perfection!
review/text: After my experience with the Amedei Limited Edition Chuao bar, also available on Amazon, I had to expand my horizons with Amedei and will endeavor to write reviews on all of their products. For those of you who have tried Amedei products before, you'll recognize this as blatant self-serving, but for the rest of you let me assure you that I only have the most noble of motives - to provide an honest review based upon personal experience.<br /><br />That being said, I must admit that I have become a fan of this company. Everything I've tried so far from this company has been of extraordinarily high quality, and these continue that trend.<br /><br />As noted, I first tried the Chuao bar, and had accordingly high expectations of the Amedei Signature '9' Blend Dark Chocolate Bar.  Predictably, I was not going to be disappointed.  For those who have tried other Amedei bars, the Signature 9 sits squarely between the Chuao and the Porcelana bars in terms of flavor.  The Chuao bursts with a variety of almost overwhelming flavors, while the Porcelana is more subtle while remaining very powerful.  The Signature 9 blends a variety of flavors from different beans in order to bring balance while keeping its own unique flavor.  Likewise, there is a bit of bitterness, more than in the Porcelana but less than the Chuao.  I imagine that the blended nature of this bar would make it exceptional for mixing with other foods (melted over a rich vanilla ice cream comes to mind), but I've never kept a bar long enough to consider such applications.  Ideal use for this chocolate would be for introducing friends to the joys of gourmet dark chocolate, before branching off into the novel single bean varieties.  Downside to that plan is that you would have to share....<br /><br />As with any order from Amedei, it will be shipped with ice packs to preserve the integrity of the chocolate but has the unfortunate effect of driving up the total cost of shipping. Anticipate a significant shipping charge if ordering just one item. My recommendation is to order several items to spread out and justify this cost, which only makes sense as this chocolate is too good not to share with friends!

By the way, the place I first tasted this served the mound of beans topped with a raddish rose.  Striking presentation.  I love the beans on a corn chip with salsa.

review/summary: Timothy"s Coffee
review/text: Received 2 boxes of Reg Timothy's and 2 boxes of Decaff. Packaging was excellent and delivered in just a few days. Amazon did a great job, but I must say the Decaff is a 5* but the regular is a 4* since it is a bit too strong. I can not blame that on Amazon, it's just a learning curve for K-cups for my Keurig coffee maker. Thanks Amazon. I'll be back. B

I have been enjoying Tully's Italian Roast, but something is messsed up with the pricing on Amazon (like: it is twice the price I paid for it last time!) So, I figured I would try the Timothy's instead. What a mistake!!!  It is bitter, weak and truly disgusting. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this one.

review/text: When I received my Keurig coffee maker with a variety pack of different coffees, I tried very hard to find my favorites because there were many I didn't like at all. Out of the assortment, I liked 3 and the Italian blend was one of them. However I couldn't find it in stores so eventually I ordered it from Amazon. Now that I have been drinking this blend for several weeks, it really isn't as good as I remembered. It's okay but I like the Kona and Nantuckett blends better.

review/text: The Italian Blend has a nice aroma and good flavor.  I brew it on the 10oz. size and it still has a nice little kick to it for a medium roast. I would say that it's comparable to the Timothy's Kona Blend, although it's a bit bolder and not as flavorful as the Kona. Still, a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />At this point, I think I've tried about 10 different types of K-Cups, and I think I'm liking Timothy's Kona and the Mocha Java the best.  However, the Italian Blend is a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: OK, but there are better choices
review/text: I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me.

review/summary: From Flavorful Favorite to Weak Disappointment
review/text: I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor.

review/text: When I purchased my Keurig coffeemaker I had no idea what coffee to buy.  Especially since there is such a huge selection of coffees to choose from. The saleslady suggested the Timothy's Italian Blend based on what kind and what flavor that I told her I liked. Plus, she really liked it, too. I'm from Louisiana and was a little hesitant to buy it.  Italian coffee.........for a southerner??  Well, I'm so glad I did! This is the smoothest, best tasting coffee I've ever had! No bitterness, just a great cup of coffee!! I even converted my husband over to it. He drank only one brand, one kind of coffee for a number of years. Now, he loves it and won't drink anything else!! I keep it on hand at all times. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I last bought this in May 2011, for around $26.  I used to get it for around $17 on Subscribe and Save, before Amazon ended that option.  I had to stop buying all my k-cups from amazon, because the big warehouse club has an 80-pack of Donut House and Caribou blend varieties for $33.  I first thought it was just the coffee product that amazon was having pricing issues with, but their prices seem to be inflating across the board, while their competitors are not reflecting the same sort of steep increases.  I've found myself going to v*t*c*st.com for many of the repetitive grocery items that I used to order through amazon.  The main difference I can see is that amazon's competitors don't have to worry about pleasing Wall Street, so their prices are kept more honest.<br /><br />Italian Blend coffee is a decent mild coffee, my wife's favorite.  We'll keep ordering it, but it won't be from amazon.

review/summary: Great Smooth Coffee
review/text: I drink this coffee as my second, third, etc cup of the day.  I usually drink a lighter cup first and then continue with the Italian Blend.  I love this coffee.  It's a little stronger but has no bitter taste and still manages to taste light in my mouth.  I love it.

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.  One cup, and I was hooked.  Usually bold & extra bold are deliciously strong but also have a bite to them that ruins the taste of the coffee for me.  It tastes like the brewed coffee was burned.  The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.  I know that everyone has their own taste in coffee, but to my mind this is "kewl beans" (don't know what that means, but heard it somewhere and it sounds right, lol)  Absolutely delicious.

review/summary: Great medium roast brew
review/text: Timothy's Italian Roast is a very good medium roast coffee.  I found little bitterness or aftertaste with it.  A nice smooth cup of coffee.  So many choices in the k-cup world. There's something for everyone. I would give it 5 stars but the name says Italian Blend.  I would figure an Italian coffee would have a darker roast.

review/summary: OK Medium Blend Coffee. Slightly Bitter.
review/text: Timothy's Italian Blend is a standard Medium roast coffee - nothing remarkable in my opinion.  I found it to have a hint of bitterness, which is also a negative for me.<br /><br />I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> because Tully's seems to have a little more flavor, but is also a touch bolder.<br /><br />If you are a medium to light blend coffee drinker, then you may find this blend pleasing; however, if you lean to medium bold blends, then you should look elsewhere.

review/summary: By far, my favorite blend
review/text: Tastes like coffee!  Not burnt, not bitter, just good coffee.<br /><br />Only gave it 4 stars because of "blow-outs".  Unfortunately, with this brand, I get about 1 blow-out per 30-35 k-kups.  I have never experienced this amount of blow-outs with other brands (in fact, only a single one in about 500).  I would recommend gently squeezing before inserting in to brewer to verify a tight seal on the top.

We make the 6 oz cup and it is almost syrupy in flaver.....rich, caramely, heavy coffee flavor with no bitterness (even when served black) Robust, but not acid, fragrant .......wow, we just love it.

review/summary: Tasty coffee, attractive Subscribe&Save price
review/text: We tried several different varieties of Timothy's and other K-Cup providers (Green Mountain comes to mind, but I know there were others also) and found the Italian Blend by Timothy's to be an all-around very drinkable blend, and as a result also practical to order through subscribe&save.  When using multiple blends it was not practical to manage each subscription because of lower volume, but having been able to settle on one favorite the additional subscribe and save discount, and the ease of managing just one subscription makes this a winner.  Also, it is admittedly a fairly small sample size but the number of cups that are duds (i.e. when brewing either grounds end up in the mug, or the mug does not brew completely) has been much smaller with the italian blend than with other Timothy's or other manufacturers products.

review/text: The Timothy's World Italian Blend coffee is a great K-Cup for those that just want a simple cup of coffee, nothing too strong or too weak. It's the kind of coffee you could drink every morning and be just fine with . I personally like my coffee on the stronger side and wouldn't mind a little flavor so I was looking forward to getting my second shippment in so I could try some different kinds. Right now I am loving the Tree Hugger's Organic blend. It's got just the kick I was looking for!

review/summary: Great coffee - HORRIBLE PRICE~
review/text: This is great coffee but I cannot believe this company has jumped in to sell it at twice the price Amazon was selling it for a month ago.  Amazon needs to get it back in stock and get the price back down into the realm of sanity!<br /><br />I love the smell and taste of Starbucks Espresso Roast in the latte's we make at home and work, which is why I decided to try the Italian blend, and it is by far my favorite.  It smells like a good morning cup should smell, then tastes just as good.  Most of the others have too much coffee in the k-cup for me and come on much too strong.  This one makes a perfect large cup of coffee.  I still buy others because my husband likes to explore but, in the morning, this is my coffee.

review/summary: A very good cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried several of the Timothy's coffee's as part of the initial variety pack which came with the Keurig brewer.  I tend to use the 10oz brew and add a bit of creamer or flavored creamer to my cup of coffee, but I always try to taste the coffee itself before doctoring it to my taste.  This was a very good cup, I prefer a medium to dark coffee, and usually drink a moderately strong french roast at work.  This was the best of the non flavored coffees, Timothy's or otherwise which I have tried so far (coffee people french roast is a 3 star, Newman's extra Bold and Timothy's Nicaragua extra bold are both very good but a little strong for my taste)  If you like a medium coffee that is smooth and flavors nicely with a creamer give this one a try.
