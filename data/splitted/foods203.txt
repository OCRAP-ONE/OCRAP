review/summary: I will be back for more...
review/text: I purchased this candy, on vacation, at a candy store in Michigan at the cost of $9.89 per pound plus tax. They are delicious and I wanted more, so I went looking on the internet. I was pleasantly surprised to find the very same candy at a much more reasonable price and they arrived fresher and even better tasting. I have offered them to several friends and family members and they are a hit. Careful, they are addictive! :o)

review/summary: In-Your-Face Grapefruit Flavor, Chewy, Not Hard, Store Well
review/text: I bought these the last time I was in the US to bring back with me to share with family and friends.<br /><br />These are not hard gummies, be aware of that if you haven't tried the Haribo gummies that have sugar or sour coatings. They are chewy, but not like a gummy bear. They're about 1 step up from the gummy-factor of a fruit slice. Chewy enough to last a bit, but not hard enough to pull out your dental work. :D<br /><br />I was suprised by how real these grapefruit slices taste. I've tried others and they were bland, these have a very strong, yet natural-tasting, grapefruit 'kick' to them.<br /><br />Can't get these in Mexico, so I was very popular when I brought them home with me a few months ago. I gave away all but about half a pound of them.<br /><br />I still have about half of what I kept, which have been stored in a heavy ziplock bag. After about 5 months, they are still soft and fresh, so don't worry too much about buying such a large quantity, they do hold up well, even in the high humdity of the tropics.

review/text: I first discovered these as part of the fruit salad gummi mix.  When I saw these were available by themselves, I snapped them up.  They are absolutely delicious.  I've had them on my candy jar at work for four years, and people are still coming by to eat them.  The pink ones are definitely better than the white...which are way to sugary.  These are a bit more tart (but not too tart).

review/text: I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange.  It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout.  Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me.  Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste.

review/summary: Yummy best waffle mix
review/text: Provided the mix is fresh, this is the best mix ever.  Easy, consistenly delicious waffles everytime.  The best thing is they don't have that baking powder taste of most mixes.  I have got my parents and inlaws hooked to it as well.  I warn you this stuff is addictive.<br /><br />My recommendation is to get yourself a decent not to expensive Waring waffle iron (the type that flips them) then you will have nice light, yet crispy delights.  You will not be sorry, do it, you will love it.<br /><br />My only downside here is that there are not too many blueberries, but enough. The blueberries are dehydrated, so they will not be as good as fresh (but you don't get the thermal bomb effect when you eat them). To make the most of the berries I recommend you let the mix sit for 10 minutes after you mix it for proper hydration. You will probably want to serve thse with fresh berries for the best experience.  They are also great with pure maple syrup.

review/summary: Welcome taste relief in my diet
review/text: I picked this up at the store after reading mixed reviews online. I am on a diet that is low calorie, sugars, and carbs; I've been missing a lot of foods as per usual so I was hoping that this would mix it up. Well it did.<br /><br />When you pick it up you can see that it is runny, which is a con in my book, but the flavors are pretty spot on. I added some extra seasoning like cayenne, paprika, and a pinch of salt. Possibly cooking it down would make it a bit thicker.<br /><br />If you're expecting some awesome hearty bbq sauce, this isn't it, but its a good substitute. I will definitely be finishing the bottle and would buy again.  (The 4/5 is for runny factor)

review/summary: Our favorite cheese crackers
review/text: We had eaten regular Cheez-It crackers in our family for years, but once the White Cheddar flavor came out and we tried it, we never went back to anything else. My wife and I go through a box or two each week. These crackers are absolutely delicious and have a strong cheddar taste. They are also more filling than other snack foods, and each cracker is low enough in calories so that you can eat quite a few without worrying about gaining weight.<br /><br />Although these have somewhat more fat than the reduced fat version, I think that these taste much better. Also the fat in the regular version is still relatively low compared to other snack foods like potato chips.<br /><br />Bottom line: Very tasty snack. I eat it almost daily and recommend it.<br /><br />I have signed up for subscribe and save to get this delivered monthly, which lowers the cost 15% to less than $2.50/box and is cheaper than I can buy these in my local supermarket even on sale.

Well, now Kraft has come out with a more grown up premade Ritz - Ritz Crackerfuls.<br /><br />Shaped like a snack bar, this one ounce snack cracker comes in at 140 calories (60 from fat) or 18 grams of carbs. It has a great taste, with the sweetness of the chocolate and the savoriness of the peanut butter. It is really delicious, not too sweet, but not too peanut buttery (if you know what I mean). This Peanut Butter and Chocolate Crackerful makes a great afternoon snack, being close enough to the 100 calorie mark for me, and being delicious and satisfying (some 100 calorie snacks only seem to whet my appetite!).

Then, a couple of years ago I found it on Amazon, only to be told that I would be notified when it was available; but it was never available until this year; that's why I took the opportunity to purchase two 6-packs while I had the opportunity. And by the way, in order to make a mincemeat pie with an appropriate amount of filling, I use two of the 9-ounce boxes. Also, most of us who are committed to this product do not find the ready-made mincemeat in the glass jars to be an acceptable substitute.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, this has disappeared from store shelves in the NYC area as well.  The only place I've been able to get it consistently is from the Borden online store.  My "trick", which I'll share for the first time, is to make it with apple cider instead of water. The additional flavor gives it an incredible kick. It adds some calories, of course, but for a treat you enjoy once or twice a year it's a small price to pay.  Hoping that Amazon will be successful in bringing back this beloved favorite.

review/summary: for delicious mince pie
review/text: I love Mince pie made with Nonesuch brand mincemeat but it has to be the condensed kind. This year mur local stores did not carry the condensed packaged type and I do not like the jars as I find them too soupy.<br />I went on line and found I could purchase it that way. I ordered it, got it very quickly, and now know that if our stores do not carry it again next fall, where I can get more.

review/summary: Would rate several more stars if I could
review/text: First became acquainted with these in Italy. They sold them at the "Auto Grills" at rest stops along the "Autostrada" (their version of the turnpikes here in the States). When we got back, found out that I could order them through Amazon. I like to order them by the case as they are only available during the Fall and Winter months.<br /><br />Love the unique blend of expresso coffee and dark chocolate. The chocolate surounds a liquid center of expresso, which when you bite into it blends with the chocolate to make a wonderful mocha taste. Have found nothing here in the states which comes even close to this. would give it 10 stars if I could. A great product, and a great value in this packaging. (If you want to give these as gifts, the case containing the "5-piece" packages is a great alternative. We did that for the holidays last year.)

review/text: I wish I could say that the new Bonomo Turkish Taffy was "only a shadow of the original". That'd be good. But, in fact, it's much, much worse than that. The new taffy has none of the full, rich flavor of the original product. Instead, it fills your palate with intensely and unpleasantly artificial flavors, and little else. Probably, manufacturing the candy using the original ingredients in their original proportions proved far to expensive. Unless the makers of the new taffy change their product to adhere to the original, I'd say don't waste your time or money on what presently amounts to a hoax.

review/text: I loved this French vanilla coffee - it was really flavorful but also smooth and delicious!  I don't usually drink flavored coffees because they tend to taste sort of "fake" or chemically, but I decided to try Aloha Island's French Vanilla coffee after I tried their French Vanilla Pods in my Senseo Machine.  My mother-in-law is still living in the "dark ages" and still uses a drip brewer, so I took this coffee over to her house this past weekend.  Everybody loved the coffee (we have a big family)!  My mother-in-law was so happy that we finally brought her something she can use and that she likes.  I'm just happy that we no longer have to drink the bad coffee she usually brews!  I'm an Aloha Island convert - we've been spoiled and now we can't drink anything else!

review/text: This jumped-up cookie-wannabe really is taking things a little too far. McVitie's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJD5LQ">Hobnobs</a> are already a mite sweeter than many British biscuits and many believe that they already pander a little too much to modern American-influenced tastes ever to truly qualify as a proper biscuit. To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton.<br /><br />Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a "proper" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube.  Hmmm...

Even when it eventually loses most of its flavor, it doesn't have an unpleasant taste or feel - and no aftertaste. I was happy to see it for less than $1/pack with the Subscribe & Save option.

review/text: I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!

review/summary: Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.
review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.
