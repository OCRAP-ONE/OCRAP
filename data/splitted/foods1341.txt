review/summary: Poor substitute for quality mincemeat
review/text: Decent mincemeat should be full of chunks of fruit and peel. This brand has so little fruit that it is almost translucent. After apples, the next two top ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and then corn syrup.

review/text: This order was pure trash. The assorted "Mexican Candies" were in a small ziplock bag. These had been bagged so long, and were so old, that they had "bled" through their wrappers, and all the products in the bag were coated with a sticky residue. I gave up and threw both bags away. Amazon should be ashamed of offering such a product!

review/summary: Like cheetos for babies
review/text: My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent. I have noticed though that if opened (with lid on) for more than 1 week, it starts to become less crunchy and more on the chewy side.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 35, Serving Size 18 pieces, Servings per container 6, Sodium 50mg<br />% Daily Value for infants 0-1:<br />Protein 0%, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 10%, Vitamin E 20%, Zinc 15%

review/summary: very hard
review/text: These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to.

review/text: I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them.  He loved the puffs and now the crunchies.  They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy.  Even when they get stale, he loves them.  It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating.

review/summary: Son's favorite snack!
review/text: I started him off on the Puffs, since I was a little afraid of the Crunchies because they looked so big. But he actually has a lot easier time with these. They seem to dissolve a little better than the Puffs, and since they are bigger he can manipulate them better. He either holds them while he noms on one end (they dissolve fast), or he's able to push it around in his mouth well enough that he doesn't gag. The Puffs tend to go to the back of his tongue and he often coughs and gags on them. They are nutritious, and there may be better snacks out there but for right now these are awesome.

review/text: We attribute our son's new-found interest in eating finger foods to these little cheese sticks.  He first discovered them on a visit to grandma's.  They're perfect - long enough that he can hold them in his hand and still bite off the ends, and he appears to think they're quite delicious.  He's start being interested in other finger foods now that he has mastered these, but they are by far his favorites.  Would definitely recommend!

review/text: Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss.  The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard.  They do not dissolve at all in the mouth.  I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them.  We had to toss these.  I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke.

review/text: I wish I knew how to make these with a bit less salt. ALL my kids want to eat them from the 13 y.o. down to the toddler, but we try to save them for travel or a special snack because they cost so much per pound!<br />They do taste very good. They are more spicy (not hot, just spice) than I had anticipated, but my toddler likes that. If yours doesn't like spice or you don't want them to eat a snack with a higher salt content (for toddlers) I'd skip buying this.<br />I did buy these earlier, but then waited to feed my son until he was old enough to handle the spice.

My mother-in-law bought them the cinnamon maple flavor, and they are wonderful!  I wish they had a variety 6 pack on Amazon so that we could try all the flavors!

Actually, my hubby loves them too so I find myself running out pretty quickly!<br /><br />I love the fact that these are tasty, healthy, provide teething relief since they are crunchy, yet soft enough for our (as yet) toothless baby to "chew", melt in her mouth pretty quickly so there's no choking hazard, and are easy for baby to pick up with her own hand. Sometimes when my daughter is in a fussy mood and wont eat anything else, I put some of these in front of her and while she's concentrating on feeding herself, I sneak in a few spoonfuls of food. Very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend.

I recently got some Gerber Graduate coupons and combined it with sales and got some great deals.

review/summary: Great Puff alternative to the "Fruity-yogurt" kinds
review/text: Our daughter loves these!  She had a lot of trouble transitioning to solid foods, and we had to take her to a specialist. The specialist mentioned that if your child has trouble with solids and with chewing motions... you should use foods that are longer and thinner to encourage chewing on the sides of the mouth. These were perfect.  THey can be easily cut into rounds using a serated knife, and to encourage chewing, they are long enough for you to hold them to the one side of the mouth.<br /><br />Also, since our daughter loved puffs of all kinds... we wanted to at least introduce a variety of flavors. The garden tomato ones were a hit right from the get go and we continue to use them in "mixes" with other easy to pick up foods (goldfish, veggie crisps, etc.)<br /><br />Would recommend, will buy again!

I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items.

At the supermarket, they are $2/can.<br /><br />Whenever we go out and run errands, I make a snack container for him. I mix a bunch of different snacks together and let him choose what he wants when fussiness ensues. He always chooses these or the Dr. Sears yogurt melts.

review/text: MY DD has trouble with solid foods but loves the puffs. I ordered this to get some variety from the standard gerber puffs/ sticks.  Unfortunately I ordered a pack of six thinking that these would have a similar texture to the other snacks.  These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister, but when we opened the next canister... same issue.<br /><br />IF your child is to the point where they can chew these... they certainly are not in a stage where they need puffs anymore!<br /><br />Would not recommend.

review/text: My daughter loves these!  I used to be so super worried about her choking on anything; I even used to cut those Gerber star puffs in half.  Then one day she just chewed it up.  So I then tried the Gerber crunchies and she loves those too.  The cheese are her favorite, but she doesn't like the cinnamon maple ones.  Then I tried the Gerber Wheels and she loves them.  She holds them with one hand and then bits a piece off and chews it.  They are harder than the rest of the snacks but they still dissolve.  She did stick the whole thing in her mouth one time and I told her no, and out it came.  She hasn't stuck the whole thing back in her mouth since.  I would defiantly recommend these, just watch your child while she is eating them.

I often like to go with store brands to save money, but I've found that the taste of these is quite superior.<br /><br />As my toddler is getting older, I'm not buying these as often as I used to since they are expensive.  However, when she was still in the early stages of eating table foods, these were awesome.  I'm actually a little bummed that I'm not going to be getting them all that often anymore.

review/summary: My son LOVES crunchies!
review/text: I bought these for my son to try, and he absolutely loves them! He's also tried the maple flavored crunchies, but prefers the veggie dip. His breath smells a little like garlic after he eats, them, but I'm not a vampire, so I don't mind. Ha ha! I call them baby cheetos, although they are very soft for toddlers learning to self-feed. I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save program to get a pack of 6 of these every 2 months. I love the program and hope they keep adding more items to it. It's an easy way to keep those constantly used items in the house. I know as he gets older, we'll stop the subscribe and save, but for now, he loves them and eats them like crazy so I'm glad I don't have to worry about running out!

review/text: My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!

review/summary: DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD
review/text: Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth.  My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth.  Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke!  I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth.  On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!!  We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBU2CO">Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start!  Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy?  One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more.  America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger!  And thank goodness this product "tastes good" -- because that's all that matters, right?

Our vet recommended it and our dog seems to enjoy it and it's though it's hard to know what is going on in his joints and cells, he looks as healthy as ever since we switched to this food; has predictably regular movements, etc. The kibbles are huge - like charcoal briquetes- but the dog seems to like it; occasionally he will pick one of the bowl and carry it away to chew on it like a treat.<br />The bag is big and heavy fortunately we have Amazon Prime to cover the shipping. So far we shopped this from petco but they are discontinuing the item as it doesn't seem to sell enough.

review/text: We tried all the various tricks to slow down one of our Shiloh Shepherds.  The doughnut shaped bowl, the big metal ball in the dish, but settled on this one.  a) because it's a simple solution and b) because our guys really like it.  The kibble is huge maybe 1.5" on a side.  Too big to inhale.  It forces them to slow down and eat each piece individually.<br /><br />I'm unlikely to ever try another brand for my two.

review/text: We began feeding Royal Canin Giant Breed Adult to our first two German Shepherds in 1990. From 2-5 mos., we tried every top brand on them - Iams, Hills Science Diet (store brand and Vet line), Canidae, Eukanuba, etc. Some they wouldn't even touch and the ones they tried would come out one end or the other in no time at all. The pups were weak and sickly. Exhausted from their daily surprises, I found this food - their coats started shining, lots more energy, clear bright eyes, and NO stomach or health issues since.

review/summary: Why Do I Buy Groceries from Amazon?
review/text: Just a couple comments about buying this product: I live in a small town and our grocery store only sells tiny bottles of this lemon juice at a price that exceeds what I pay per bottle for these large bottles from Amazon.  And being a voracious drinker of iced tea with lemon (don't even MENTION sweetener!), I use a quart about every two weeks.  And despite people who say store brands are just as good, sorry: they aren't.  RealLemon is a vastly better quality than the Kroger brand my store sells as its single large-size offering (at more than I pay, again, than this product through Amazon).  Really, if Amazon ever starts selling fresh meat and veggies, I'd cheerfully abandon the inferior Kroger store which is this town's sole supermarket.

review/summary: Tasted GREAT!
review/text: These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.

review/summary: Healthy & the cats love them. They seem filling!
review/text: I was looking for treats I could use for training. Two adult cats were new to our home and were learning which repeatable behaviors to do more of (use the scratching post and other things.) I wanted to completely avoid treats full of carbohydrates or other nasties the cats would get loaded up with and found these as an option. I like that they are semi-moist and is nice to add in to the different types of treats they can get and not keep the treat types exclusively freeze-dried.<br /><br />It turns out I do still have to stick with the freeze dried for certain types of training. I use these as treats for "just because" or as the big dessert treat at the end of a training session. They seem to be filling for the cats, so I am only able to feed a few before feeling like one of their mealtimes would be ruined!<br /><br />One thing about them is; if fed whole they are awkward for the cat to eat and chew on. I can split them in half or into thirds and the cats get 3 good sized treats from 1 pellet. The package says they are about 2kcals per treat, so splitting them helps give them 'more for less'.<br /><br />The ingredients in this treat are healthy. The wheat grass helps with getting their "cat grass" fix. So far it has been a good treat selection to rotate in with the freeze dried treats and keep their diet well-rounded with their usual meals. When the bag is open the odor and grass scent is enough for them to detect right away and start getting excited about. There is actually a lot of product in this bag and the cats really, really like them. I am very happy with the product and have continued to buy these, including in the other two available flavors.

review/text: I bought these for hairball control rather than treats, and I wasn't disappointed. My long-hair coughs up a ridiculous amount of hairballs and she is too picky to take any kind of hairball control treat or medication (I've wasted so much money on things she won't eat). I tried giving her real grass, but that resulted in almost as big a mess as the hairballs.<br /><br />I tried these on a whim, and they are great! I give her one with breakfast and one with dinner and I have seen a drastic reduction in hairballs. Best of all? She loves them! For her, it actually is a treat and she'll even beg for them. So far we've tried the tuna and the chicken and I have no complaints.

They prefer the Tuna flavor over the chicken, but as we know, every cat has a different  taste preferences.I have ordered several bags over the past months and will continue to do so in the future.

review/summary: My Cats absolutely love all the flavors
review/text: These bellrock growers semi-moist treats (not the crunchy ones) are the favorites here in our house. Cats cry for them and they jump on me to catch the bag when the see me carrying it, they actually can hear me when I carry the bad and they come running to me. I give it 5 stars and even more if possible :)<br />Also bellrock ingredients are not like the cheap other brands, they are certainly good for their health, helps in a better digestion, etc... I feel happy when I give it to them.

review/summary: Good, healthy treats and cats love 'em
review/text: My cat just loves <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4YYYC">Pet Greens Deep Sea Tuna w/ Wheat Grass Cat Treats</a>, he always wants more of these. Tuna is his favorite of Pet Greens flavors, though he does like them all. These treats don't have any grains in them, and are good for your cat's digestion. My cat has a finicky digestive system so we can't feed him grains. I took these to his vet for our yearly visit and she approved them for his use. The only other treats he can eat are dried fish, meats, or bonito flakes.

review/summary: Why is there sugar in these treats?
review/text: Our cats enjoy these treats well enough but I don't get why the Deep Sea Tuna recipe includes sugar (Dextrose.) How can that be good for their dental health? Do cats even like sugar? None of their other favorite treat brands contain it so unless I get a good explanation I'm sticking with their Turkey & Veggie version, which according to the label has no dextrose.

review/summary: Delicious But SALTY
review/text: I absolutely love Chicago-style cheese and caramel popcorn like Garrett's.  So, feeling a craving for the stuff, I decided to try this gourmet cheddar cheese popcorn.  It was delicious, but very salty.  The cheese is also not the same quality of stuff that they use in the better Chicago popcorn shops.  Frankly, it didn't taste as cheesy and a bit fake.  The popcorn itself was quite fresh though.<br /><br />All in all, I guess if you're desperate for some gourmet-esque popcorn, this stuff is good.  However, in my book, it doesn't compare to the real, fresh gourmet popcorn shops' stuff.

review/summary: Not My Favorite...
review/text: I tried the variety pack of the popconopolis from Amazon. Really liked all of it except for the cheese. For my taste the cheese was way too salty. If you thought Cheese Doodles gave you orange fingers, you should have seen my fingers after eating some of this. The coating seemed to be a fine powder that really caked onto my fingers. Also, with this one cone the popcorn had no crunch...seemed stale. Maybe this was just a bad or outdated cone. I love my junkfood, but actually threw away a small portion of the cone. One of those things I asked myself, why did I eat that much? I wasn't enjoying it.

review/summary: SUPER YUMMY!
review/text: We fell in love with Popcornopolis when we first tried it at a Blockbuster store... however the price<br />was pretty steep for the small cone that you got... so I looked it up on Amazon and lo and behold here<br />it be!  This popcorn is unreal... if you like pecans and caramel popcorn you will LOVE this. I still<br />have a hard time figuring out how they make it so good but whatever they are doing they are doing it<br />right!  It is fresh and crunchy - PERFECT for a late night snack and a cuppa decaf coffee, feels like<br />you are eating something super sinful yet it isn't too bad for ya.<br />Can't beat the price either! I sent this to my mother in law as her mothers day gift and she was super<br />thrilled - she actually hinted to us that she wanted this because we had sent them a 5 pack sampler and<br />this one was her favorite.<br />She said she hid them where noone else can find them.<br />Hope this review helps.... I am also in hopes that the chocoloate zebra will be available on Amazon too...<br />That one is amazing as well  :0)<br />PS: The cheese one is softer and kind of stale even though the flavor IS something to write home about -<br />don't get it unless you don't mind it stale-ish. Also the husks can get annoying in the cheese kind.

I was happy, coz' I wanted to have this before mothers day, and I think is a very good price.<br /><br />I surely recommended!! ^.^

review/text: I totally love this popcorn.  I first had it at Universal City Walk in LA and thought it was terrific.  I've tried a few flavors and decided their Caramel and Cheddar Cheese (both white and regular) are for me, the best flavors.  The caramel is much better than any of the others I've tried at my local grocery.

review/summary: Cheeeeeesy popcorn!  But read here first.....
review/text: This is great tasting popcorn... First tried it at our local blockbuster DVD store but then went direct to the Popcornopolis website and ordered direct - the big cones.  At Blockbuster and direct from Popcornopolis it was fresh and crunchy but for some odd reason this tasted a bit stale from the very first.  The flavor is amazing and just a large handful will satisfy that salty craving but it may be a bit stale if u get it from amazon... I do highly recommend Popcornopolis though... It IS the BEST popcorn you can get and we've tried a lot! The pecan and zebra is unreal too.  I recommend giving it a try at your local blockbuster first then their direct website. They have a nice array of yummy addicting flavors - we've gotten many many friends and family addicted to it and it makes a great gift if shipped direct from Popcornopolis- they have neat packages.  (by the way... The candied ones tend to be fresher from the beginning and last a long time!)

review/summary: Best Cheddar Popcorn EVER!!!
review/text: I consider myself a foodie and am always trying to find the best of everything.  I tried Dale and Thomas popcorn when it was one of Oprah's favorite things and yes, it was good.  My local Costco store had the Popcornopolis people in-store for a few days and I was IMPRESSED.  The zebra (white and dark chocolate drizzled) was really great but the cheddar was like none other I have ever tasted.  WOW.  It has to be good if it says "Why is this popcorn so good?" on the back of the bag with an explanation.  Oh and two thumbs up for the perfectly sized, individually sealed cones.  I can eat one cone in one sitting (and they aren't tiny!) and can stop there.  It is a good limit-setter.  :)
