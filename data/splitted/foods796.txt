review/summary: Only buy if you REALLY WANT IT!
review/text: The soda is very refreshing(I got the strawberry) and the bottle is very fun to open(but i can see being a hassle with future openings), but the price is way too much for some foreign soda. So if I were you, I would try to find a local asian market(found out a little late that there is one near me and I never noticed it, Stupid me) and see if they have it or any store that sells foreign stuff.

review/summary: Very fizzy
review/text: These are very fizzy soft drinks, they are quite expensive compared to buying regular American sodas. Though they are very flavorful. I prefer the melon flavor.<br /><br />Recommended for kids, as they get a thrill of opening it.As for adults after you open a few the amusement will go away and it'll become bothersome to open.

review/summary: Far too expensive.
review/text: I have to say I'm quite a fan of Ramune soda.....just not at this price. I know there should be a store SOMEWHERE wherever you might live that sells this soda or just some other online store. It's just not worth it at this price. Even if you were using amazon.com credit (which I am) I wouldn't waste my money on this. It's a shame.

review/summary: Whoa! HOW MUCH!?
review/text: I figured you could rip off the typical Anime freak/nerd/whatever but this is just dumb. These sodas cost a buck in Japan. ONE BUCK. And you'll selling it for FOUR!? This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it! Cute little 6.6 fl oz to boost (or you can buy the larger ones for like three bucks) and the marble is a cool effect, just a little confusing on how to open the bottle at first, especially if you're craving soda. This stuff is worth buying.........but not here. This is a total rip-off. Unless you're adamant about Amazong and willing to stay at home and pay for shipping and handling, and the greedy price for cheap soda, have at it. It's your money. Your call. I'm not the government telling you how you should spend your money. ........I just highly recommend you go somewhere else for your Ramune. Like Japan. Or a Japanese store. Not here.

review/summary: White chocolate with crunchy chocolate cookie... yum!
review/text: This is one of my favorite candy bars to pick up at the grocery store.  It's a smooth white chocolate with crunchy chocolate cookie bits (think Oreo cookie) adding a nice change to the texture of the bar.  Addictive!<br /><br />Someone mentioned that the Cookie's 'n' Creme bar has a lot of trans fat?  It doesn't have "a lot", but it has some.  I have a 4 oz bar right now (which looks like a king size bar, but it doesn't say king size), and it says it has a half a gram of trans fat per 6 blocks (43g) of Cookies 'n' Creme bar.  So for my entire giganto 4 ounce bar, there's about 1.25g of trans fat.  In each of these 1.55 oz candy bars, there's 1/2 a gram of trans fat.  No trans fat would be better, but still, there's saturated fat in these which isn't exactly good for you either.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of Jack Daniel's jelly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016268C">Historic Lychburg Tennessee Whiskey Burgundy Grape Jelly</a>, so I definitely wanted to try this.  I love how you can get four different flavors instead of a four-pack of the same thing, so this is a good buy.<br /><br />I prefer the Spicy Original and the Original No. 7 Recipe, as I like my sauces to have more of a bite instead of a sweetness, which the Hickory Brown Sugar and the Honey Smokehouse versions have.  So if you like sweet sauces, you're also covered here.<br /><br />I put the Spicy Original on my mashed potatoes and Original No. 7 Recipe on ham, so you're not limited to pulled pork or ribs.  But I used to live in Memphis, where I would eat barbeque pizza and barbeque spaghetti.<br /><br />Overall, I don't consider this expensive for what you get, and I'm pleased with the quality of the product.  Now if I could get the jelly at a reasonable price without having to go to Lynchburg, I'd be good to go.

He is an active dog and I only feed him 3-3 1/2 cups a day and he maintains a very fit weight. This does contain a lot of protein so it keeps "Petey" nice and full all day. I would definitely recommend this product; and, who doesn't think a Blue Buffalo is cool?

review/summary: Happy going in, perfect coming out
review/text: Bruce has allergies and many foods I have tried over the years create various degrees of discomfort in his ears.  He shakes his head and sometimes his ears are so painful that he cries.  Breaks my heart.  I finally found Blue Buffalo and what a difference.  His allergy responses are down by 80%.  Although not completely gone, he is a much happier dog and Benedryl usually handles his occasional attacks quickly and effectively.  I think as he continues to eat this food, the allergies might actually go away completely.  He loves the food and plows right into it.  He is a big dog, 110 German Shepherd, but he has a dainty stomach.  Some foods give him the runs, and being a long-haired dog, the cleaning process is awful for his mom...me.  Blue Buffalo creates in my dog what I consider to be "centerfold" quality poop, if a magazine with such pictures existed.  He is on the senior recipe, but I think I am going to try the longevity formula, too, now that he is eight years old.  Blue Buffalo is worth every penny.  I also buy their treats and a can or two of the food.  Bruce loves all of these products.  He's happy and that's all I want for him!

We switched over from Nutro about to the standard formula a year ago; and 6 months after that to the senior formula.  Sophie, our family member of the K9 pursuasion, is very happy with the food; everyday.<br /><br />Her coat and nails look great, her weight is perfect, and she always has energy and affection to give.  We feel really good about the improvements we've seen in her health since making the switch to Blue Buffalo.

review/summary: Love Blue Buffalo!
review/text: I can't tell you how much I enjoy being able to read my dog food label and know what each ingredient actually is. No by-products, no corn, no wheat, no artificial flavoring or coloring(like my dog really cares what color the kibbles are). I also really love that the food already includes Glucosamine and Chondroiton for my dogs joints, and I did notice a differnce in him after switching from a food that did not contain them.<br /><br />Its true you are paying more compared to other brands, but take a look at what you're really getting for your money. My dog eats less food on Blue Buffalo, so the food actually lasts me longer even though its more expensive. He also has a better coat and has smaller, healthier stools. Nobody can believe how great my beagle looks and acts. Just today he ran 4 miles with a doggie back pack on with no problem and he'll be 13 in June!<br /><br />I firmly believe that you are what you eat, if you eat junk you're going to feel like junk and ultimatly be junk! Why not give your dog the fuel his body needs to function and ask yourself: If your dog was faced with a plate of corn, wheat gluten, soybean meal and random animal parts with pretty colors or a plate of deboned chicken, oatmeal, potatoes, carrots and more...which would he dig into?

review/text: It has been a challenge to find a healthy dry food that my dog enjoys eating. (He prefers the cheap stuff with fillers, basically junk food). Not only does he like this stuff, this kibble has a bonus of being very thin and small, a plus for senior dogs with missing or sensitive teeth. It also helps with digestion. He has a sensitive stomach and so far has had no problems with bloating or gas.<br /><br />This stuff is expensive, but it isn't a scam. You honestly are getting a high quality food here.

We had been feeding Iams for many years.  After slowly incorporating this new food into their meals,  we are almost completely switched over.  All the dogs, (Labrador (6 yrs) Border Collie (10 Yrs) Pomeranian (4 yrs)) are doing much better, and the shedding is quite diminished.  They love the food too!

review/summary: great senior food with the plus of easy delivery to my door
review/text: I previously was feeding my dogs Eukanuba but was finding it very hard to get the senior version in my area anymore that was not lamb based(lamb equals gas with my dogs) in large bags due to the amount of senior dogs I own. I switched my dogs over to Blue Buffalo and let me tell you they love it. It was an easy transition. I decided to order from amazon due to being on a lifting restriction of 20 lbs. I figured if I could get it delivered to my house it would save me the trouble of getting a stock boy at the local store to carry the items out to my car only to have to then wait till someone got home to help me bring it in to the house. The shipment arrived before the expected delivery date intact no issue with damage to the bag at all. Ups dropped it right on my porch where I keep the dogs food it worked out great. I highly recommend ordering this food, especially if you have issue with carrying the larger bags.

review/summary: No more ear infections!!!!!
review/text: We have a 9 year old 120 lb. Mastiff/Sheepdog mix that has had ear infections her entire life. She has been to 3 different vets to remedy the problem, and nothing helped. I had to clean her ears and use a cortizone remedy for yeast a least 3 times a week or her ears became enflamed and were painful. I heard about the Blue dog food, and I liked the ingredients used. So we decided to try it. I couldn't believe that within 2 weeks, her ears were no longer squishy with fluid inside, and the smell went away. We have been using both the dry and the canned Blue formulas and after 2 months there has been no recurrence of infection or inflammation. In the 9 years we have had her, we have tried at least 4 other brands of dog food including some of the high end expensive ones. It had never dawned on us that her food might be causing the infections in her ears. Thanks to Blue dog food, our girl will not have to endure the pain of ear infections the rest of her life.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I have been feeding this dog food to my dogs for 6 months.  I wanted to feed it long enough for a measured evaluation before reviewing.  Simply stated - It's the best.  My two older dogs(a 14 year old Border Collie mix and a 10 year old German Shepherd) are thriving.  They have glossy thick coats, great energy levels, and best of all THEY LOVE THIS FOOD.  I even give them a few bits for a treat instead of regular dogs treats.  As far as digestibility goes, my oldest dog had started throwing up sometimes after eating her old brand of dog food(which had been vet recommended) - but no worries with the Blue Buffalo.  She eats this with gusto and no digestion problems. I really like the high quality ingredients and feel this is the best dog food I have ever found.  Can't beat being able to order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door.

review/text: I am not one to usually write reviews, and I usually never have a bad experiance on what I purchse.<br />I'm not writing this to "slam" the Blue Buffalo company,and can't prove that the food I purchased was 100% responsible for my experiance,but here is what happened. I have fed my dog the same food for years. Dog is healthy with no issues. She is getting older and I did some research and decided to get her on a better brand AND figured it was time to switch to "senior" food. I followed the directions and slowly started to mix "Buffalo" with her old food to get her adjusted. Within a few days she started acting odd and had blood in her urine. Took her to the vet, and he said that he has seen this type of food cause the urine to be too acidic and cause an infection. He told me to STOP feeding her "Buffalo" and to go back to old brand. After 1 day of not feeding it to her, and the first day on her round of pills, she is much butter and no more blood in her urine.<br />Like I said... could be totally unrelated, but seems obvious that the problem started within 3 days of feeding this to her, and the problem stopped (per advice of vet) when I stopped feeding it to her.<br />I am writing this to inform you, in case you have the same issue and to hopefully save someone the expense of a vet bill and all the hassle my purchase caused me.

review/summary: Much lighter cereal than the Crunch flavor.
review/text: #1 thing to mention is Flavor vs Fiber in these breakfast cereals. In shopping around I have looked for different breakfast cereals I always search for one that is high in fiber without sacrificing loads of flavor. Please note that most of my purchases are for office employee use, since I work roaming construction there are jobs where breakfast options are very limited and products like these come in handy.  In comparison with Special K, Frosted Mini-wheat's, All-Bran, Raisin Bran Crunch, Fiber One, and Grape nuts we have come up with the brands that match our needs. The need is simple, a balance between flavor and fiber. The usual picks that come out on top are Raisin Bran Crunch, Frosted Mini-Wheat's and Kashi Go Lean Crunch. But for as much Fiber (10g) and flavor as Kashi Go Lean crunch had, the 240 Cal/ 3.5g of fat factor was keeping it on edge to being dropped. Thankfully this lighter version made a good impression with only 130 Cal and only 1g of fat but still has 9g of Fiber! Although I will admit I like the flavor of the Crunch more, I have to balance my purchases to a 2 to 1 ratio in favor of the regular Go Lean vs the Go Lean Crunch. Construction workers are getting more health conscious and do look out for things like nutrition facts in cereal now a days.

review/text: this is the same lovable kashi golean that you find anywhere but in a good portion size and for a good price. i am in love with most of kashi's products.<br /><br />this cereal is very crunchy, holds up well in soy milk, is semi-sweet and just plain delicious. i prefer to get them in the little containers to have it measures already and for it to stay fresher longer. i usually eat oatmeal for breakfast so these make a good alternative when i dont have to commit a whole box of cereal and risk it getting stale.<br /><br />i get the auto-ship so the price you can not beat. go kashi and amazon.

review/summary: Great Diet Food! Great way to start the day!
review/text: I have been eating Kashi GOLEAN for several years now and to ensure I get a good start to my daily diet I weigh out my portion into a bowl on a kitchen scale. Sometimes more, sometimes less, and sometimes I add stuff to it. Then I have to figure out the calories. But I have to tell you that it is just so much easier to flip off this lid, pour in my almond milk and have a 150 calorie breakfast that gives me protein, fiber and a satisfied feeling! If you are on a diet, and you just don't want to have to "think", then this is the answer.<br /><br />A little tip:  You know, watching TV at night and the nibbles start creeping into your thoughts, flip open the GOLEAN, pour in your milk (soy, non-fat, almond, whatever), and you've got a low cal, no guilt, filling, nutritious and satisfying snack. There is a total absence of guilt when snacking on GOLEAN!

review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: Excellent high fiber, high protein, crunchy cereal.  Unlike the standard commercial cereals, Kashi cereals are truly made from all natural ingredients.  The flavor is good but I do need to add a little sweetner.  These bowls make an excellent breakfast to take to work or on trips.<br /><br />There is a similar cereal by Kashi called Crunch.  It to is high fiber, high protein, sweeter and also taste good.  It is also sold by Amazon in the same type of portable container.<br /><br />They both go well with bananna, blueberries, raisins or strawberries.<br /><br />These cereals are a must if constipation is a problem.  Eat them daily as well as fruit like plums, peaches, or nectaarines and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Can also be purchased in standard grocery stores for at home use.  Cheaper that way.

review/text: I was so blown away by the quality of this coffee.  I like bolder roasts, but all too often bold roasts are too acidic and bitter.  Not so with Joffrey's Viennese.  The Viennese roast was simply the best cup of coffee I've ever tasted!  It has a nice subtle smoky overtone and is so smooth it could be tea if you didn't have that wonderful full bodied aroma.  You can tell that Joffrey's take their coffee seriously and understand and appreciate a coffee junkie like me - there was a nice note included in my order thanking me for my purchase, nice touch. I am so in love with this Viennese coffee and highly recommend it!

review/text: The only way I can think of not thinking this tastes like root beer is if you like the taste of diet root beer.  Put this in either flat or sparking water and you have a zero cal. natural taste treat.  I find it takes more than a drop or two to get the flavor for me, but be careful not to over do it too, since stevia will start to taste bitter if there's too much of it used.  Enjoy!

review/text: I've tried many of the Sweetleaf Stevia liquid flavors and have throughly enjoyed all of them, but the root beer one is one I will never buy again.<br /><br />I love root beer, even diet root beer and this liquid is very weak compared to the other liquids.  The other products I can put a half of a dropper into 64 ounces of water and have a perfect taste.  The root beer takes two or three times this amount to get any taste in the liquid and it is not a true taste.<br /><br />The english toffe, vanilla creme, chocolate raspberry dark chocolate and cinnamon are all great tasting.

review/summary: Not quite soda, but pretty darn good...
review/text: It IS good for what it is. Someone had told me about this product, and as he did, he was licking his lips. That was a pretty hearty endorsement for something that you drop into water for flavoring. He was speaking of another flavor, but when he said there was Root Beer flavor available, I jumped at it. I love Root Beer soda, and was drinking more than I should be, so I figured what did I have to lose? You use 1 drop per each 2 oz of water, so the bottle should last a while. You can also use it to flavor yogurt, and other things as well. Its uses are only limited by your imagination. One other thing I will say is be careful not to overdo it. Using too much could have a bitter result. It also recommends that you refrigerate it after opening so that it lasts longer. I like the "taste" of water, but it's so much better with these drops, and definitely better than the soda (although it certainly doesn't match soda's rich flavor).

review/text: My doctor wanted me to quit drinking sodas for a number of reasons but I find it didficult to just down glasses of plain water.  So, I gave this a try and I have been able to break my soda habit successfully.  I agree with another reviewer that the rootbeer flavor takes more product than some of the other flavors.  However even with two eyedropper squirts per glass, the bottle lasts me almost a month.  This is my favorite flavor with English toffee being a close second.<br /><br />I was spending probaby $30-$40 per month on sodas.  So I think this product is a win-win.  I am off soda, drinking tons of water and feeling a lot better as well.  If you are trying to increase your water intake or to break the soda habit, this product is a HUGE help.

I wasted my money!"<br /><br />I was getting ready to throw it away but I bought 2 bottles of seltzer water and I was like, "Oh, hell, I'll just drink it. Then, I put a fairly modest amount and started drinking it and then it sort of grew on me.<br /><br />I mean, it's a sort of light taste and it leaves a bit of an after taste, but it's really not that bad.<br /><br />From my personal experience, I hated it and then found out it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />IT DEFINITELY WILL NOT TASTE EXACTLY LIKE ROOT BEER! DON'T HAVE ANY DELUSIONS! I'd suggest you give it a try, though. It's really not that bad... and if it is, experiment and drink it a few more times and it might grow on you :D!

Also, looking at the ingredients of some of the other varieties made by this company, I see such things as wax, food dye and maltodextrin.  I threw them out and would not give them to my dogs.  If they are made in the usa they should say that. If they are made and or sourced in china, they should say that.  It is not a good idea to buy dog food made in china. The fact that there is no info on the package regarding where the treats are made worries me, some of the ingredients do not fit the standards of what I would feed my dogs so I tossed them. I would not purchase these treats.

review/summary: Great Salad Dressing
review/text: I was introduced to this excellent product during the Jewish season of Yum Kippur in December, when my local Ralphs market had a promotion of special foods for that holiday.  It is rare to find bottled salad dressings made with olive oil, rather than canola oil, soy oil, or safflower oil, which are the three major allergens.  Most people don't even realize they have allergies to these oils, but they could have a stomach ache after eating some.  I bought a number of these bottles when they were on special.  I have noticed that the bottles vary greatly with the amount of green flecks enclosed inside the bottle.  Some have a great deal, and others are almost green-fleck free.  I prefer the bottles with more green flecks, but I'm happy enough with those that have just a few.  Clearly, this is one of the very best commercially prepared salad dressings available.  The front label indicates gluten free/dairy free.  The ingredients are simple enough:  water, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, salt, xanthan gum, garlic, onion, potassium sorbate (preservative).

review/summary: Absolutely Addictive!
review/text: After almost 20 years away from Rochester NY, Country Sweet is still one of my fondest memories from growing up. My friends and I were fortunate to have the restaurant close to our high school. You could pour this sauce on a ROCK and I'd bet that someone would EAT THAT ROCK! It's that good! Hopefully I won't offend anyone when I say that we used to call it "crack," but it seemed like no matter what time of night it was (and they were open until about 3AM if my memory is correct); there was always a line coming out of Country Sweet and we'd always catch someone walking out grinning, saying "I got SAUCE!."<br />Now, it is sweet, so for those watching their blood sugar, this may not be the best choice. For the rest of you, even those funny eaters (like me) who won't eat all of the meat off of a chicken wing, that will no longer be a problem. Infact, you'll have to keep yourself from eating the bones! Depending on the temperature,it can also have a bit of a kick, but the sweetness balances it out. It also has just the right amount of tang. Soooo good! I was excited to find some on Amazon since I have a niece moving down for college and was considering telling her she could only come if she's bringing the sauce! lol! Hey, I said it was addictive!

review/text: I'm so pumped that Amazon is selling Country Sweet!  My buddy from Buffalo sent me this sauce years ago and I've never been able to find it since.  This sauce is crazy good, it's a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. (Something you might not think goes together but trust me it's great)  I use it mainly with chicken whether it's the chicken tenders out of the frozen food aisle or some fresh grilled chicken.  There's nothing quite like it. I prefer the Hot over the Mild but either sauce should please.

review/summary: Sugar in Beef Jerky
review/text: Short and Sweet:  this beef jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.<br /><br />I notice that in the more "natural" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.<br /><br />It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: I originally purchased this jerky at because it was the ONLY jerky at the big box warehouse that wasn't full of Nitrates, Nitrites, and MSG.  It is more dry than the Original flavor Beef Jerky from Golden Valley.  I give it a four instead of a five because it tends to have fibrous 'strings' in it and several thin ribbons of fat (per bag, not per piece).  The flavor is very good, simple and 'sweet'(not sugar sweet, but good meat sweet).  The price on Amazon is Excellent.  I still buy this jerky but prefer the texture of the Golden Valley Beef Jerky since it's not quite the jaw workout that this Buffalo Jerky is.  All in all, I am very impressed with the high quality of this company's products.

review/summary: Great taste but some portions were a bit dry
review/text: I've always thought buffalo jerky is much better tasting that beef jerky, as well as being leaner, and hence better for you. This buffalo jerky doesn't disappoint in the flavor department. It is slightly sweet, and has a very nice texture. However, some of the portions were a little dry and hard for my taste. There are also the occasional pieces of fat that I found in one bag. That is the disadvantage of buying 8 bags at a time online; you can't visually inspect what you're getting and not select bags that contain too much fat. You can contact Golden Valley and they will replace any bag that has too much fat for your taste, but expect 2-3 weeks before they'll deliver the replacement bag. Still, better customer service than most companies!

review/summary: Most delicious jerky EVER
review/text: I had previously been pretty loyal to Jack Links beef jerky-- it always had a nice flavor and was never crumbly (I can't STAND dry, crumbly jerky!).  But I noticed every time I would eat it I would get terrible headaches.  So I looked at the ingredients-- I had NO idea it had MSG in it-- and I had been feeding it to my CHILDREN!<br /><br />That night I was on the net looking for a healthier alternative.  This is what I found.<br /><br />It is truly fantastic.  Delicious and flavorful, it is soft enough for my 3 year old to chew up and NO MSG or NITRATES!!  There was only a little bit of fat in it.<br /><br />I had looked all over the net for buffalo jerky to be delivered and it was pretty expensive.  This is a bargain-- I signed up for continued shipments (every 2 months--though I might have to make it EVERY month) and it worked out to be $[...].<br /><br />I was worried that the Original flavor would be boring but it is quite tasty--lots of flavor (the ingredients say it has soy sauce in it).  It is not strong like a terriyaki flavor but it gives it a nice taste.

But, and yes I know jerky is dried meat obviously, I found this product to be very dry, a bit too dry and tough.  The thicker pieces were in fact hard for me to bite through and chew.  I'll still enjoy this jerky, but it could be a lot more tender, and I've had tender jerky made with no MSG or nitrates in the past from other companies.<br /><br />If you like very tough jerky, I suppose raise this to a four or five star review for you.

I've fed my dogs Blue, Iams Naturals, Science Diet, Purina dog chow and numerous others trying to find one that they all will eat. Gravy Train is the only one! It seems Gravy Train really keeps their weight on them, kind of like a maintenience dog food. Once a day I mix in 1/3 of a can of the wet Gravy Train with their food and they always clean their bowls. The only other dog food they've liked as much is the Eukanuba Naturals Turkey and that is expensive and hard to find locally in my area.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend for any dogs. Though, the kibble is on the larger size, so if you have a very small dog, you might want to get a smaller kibbled dog food. Otherwise fantastic!

review/text: (5-pound bags pack of 2) Good & Plenty was always a favorite of mine at the movies when I was a kid. Seem to remember them having a fairly hard candy coating back then and very chewy.

Have repackaged the 10 pounds into several zip-lock bags in hopes that they'll stay fresh for a long time.

A previous reviewer refused to eat them because they claimed to be made of beetle parts (which one?, John,Paul,Ringo,or George? I can't figure it out) that reviewer should look up the "foreign objects" tolerances by the FDA in ALL manufactured and processed foods, beetle parts are a welcome change! Again, wonderful, tasty candy.

review/summary: bad & plenty
review/text: Good & Plenty Licorice-flavored candies have to be my personal least favorite candy ever.  The taste never once delighted my tastebuds and in fact, only tickled that gagging sensation in my throat.  I really dislike these miniature Dr. Mario pill-looking things with a passion.  I was hoping the day would come when they'd finally be out of date and would go obsolete, but it wasn't meant to be.  I still see them all over town.

review/summary: Loved it till i found i was eating beetles
review/text: In the ingredients it lists k-carmine.<br />I was asked this question recently in a game and said no to some red food colors being made from beetles.<br />Well I was wrong.  Yeah i researched it all and there's other ways to list it even just natural color. =(<br /><br />I'm sorry if i ruined them for you like most people I have told.<br />But its really nice to know whats going in your mouth.<br />Shame on these people for calling it other names then crushed beetles!!<br /><br />At least i have 1 relative that will still eat them he said.<br />It's to bad this is about the only black licorice I liked.<br />Now they are just to hard to swallow.
