review/summary: What a Rip
review/text: Okay I am not a math wiz but the Box cleary says .25 cents each. So there are 24 boxes. That comes out to $6.00<br />I am not sure if they sell these candy in jars like they do lemon heads, but this is not a deal at all.

review/summary: Bought Apple, Grape & Cherry
review/text: I remember these from my childhood, and randomly, I decided to look online and found them here.  I went overboard and bought 3 different flavors, so now I have LOADS of candy around.  I need to find people who also like this candy to share with them, because if I eat all of this, it would be a bad idea.  :)  My favorite are STILL Appleheads, just like they were when I was in middle school.  The funny part is the case reads "25 cents" a box.  But, if you multiply 24 boxes x 25 cents = $6.00.  If you plan to sell them, your return won't be good. HA! I paid $10 for each box.  Time to share them!  They still taste just like they did when I was young.  If you miss this candy from your childhood, buy some, you won't regret it.

review/summary: Very good-Larger Size
review/text: Really like this product.Its much like Uncle Bens Spanish Rice.It is a ready to eat product.Just heat in the microwave for 1 to 1 and 1/2 minutes and that's it.Other ready to eat rices are usually around 8 oz per pack.This one is almost 16 oz.So there is plenty for two servings as a side.We like bratwurst,pork,or chicken, on the side or mixed in and it makes a meal for two that quick and easy.The green peas on the label arent regular peas.They are crispy with an almost nut like taste which we really like.Great price for 6 packs considering the size.

review/summary: Great product! Too expensive from Amazon!
review/text: We love these corn flakes and were so happy to see them at Amazon. They are the perfect alternative to mainstream corn flakes! They have just the right texture and flavor and everyone in our house will eat them! We even use them for crusts in many dessert recipes!<br /><br />Ordering groceries from Amazon has always been both convenient and saves us money. But we paid $30.40 a case for these a few month ago! I can get them at our local health food store for less than they are now listed so unless Amazon changes their prices of many of our gluten free favorites to reflect the savings we USED to get, we won't be ordering groceries here anymore.

review/summary: Pricy but good
review/text: These corn flakes are very good and tasty. My last order was $30.40 which makes the new price of $38 about 25  percent higher. I guess if you have celiac problems you are a captured audience. But with corn flakes costing about $1 a box at the dollar stores it's going to be a hard sell to continue with this brand at these high prices. Gas has gone down but their prices are still going up. Maybe it's because they are imported from Canada?<br /><br />Too bad. These corn flakes could get a much bigger share of the market if they would just stop pricing them out of reach. Remember--they are only corn flakes. Great product for those who think it's a deal.

review/text: I have followed a strict gluten free diet for about 7 years now and this cereal, I think, is one of the best out there.  I eat this cereal for breakfast almost every morning and sometimes as a snack during the day.  What I like most about this cereal is how universal it is.  Besides a great breakfast cereal, I also use it to make special k bars (which my husband loves).

review/text: Long Story Short.<br /><br />I get the flu from Co worker - WOW, thought I had flu before but now I totally understand how it can kill infants and old people.<br /><br />The months to follow I slowly got worse and worse with a G/I.  I ended up losing 45 lbs (not trying) and was having a problems getting to work.<br /><br />Every test you can have and all the results are normal.  I don't have a Gluten Allergy according to the tests BUT<br /><br />I started to avoid Gluten and Dairy (and caffeine and gum and hard candy...) having honey with decaf tea and coffee (1cup a day)<br /><br />This Cereal with Silk Milk saved my sanity because I used to live on cereal as a kid and this at least gives me a staple that I can trust and is enjoy to eat as well.<br /><br />(if you have the same deal as me here is highlights)  once you get your routine down and can survive this and... believe it or not, feel better than you ever did before (cuz your not eating all that crap) took me about 1 year to finally get a handle on it.<br /><br />In Short - this cereal is a tool that works keep you happy and healthy.

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Great Coffee -- Great Everything
review/text: If you ever visit Canada you cannot miss the Ubiquitous Tim Horton's franchises, it seems as if they are on every corner (and small wonder: everything they sell is excellent, reasonably priced, and served with typical Canadian efficiency and politeness.) The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/text: Removing the lid gives you a big hint of what you're in store for you when you brew this fine coffee. If you've ever bought ground coffee in a store only to get it home and be dissappointed in the taste this coffee will give you a bit of a surprise. Canadians know what this coffee is about and introduced us to it. Starbuck's doesn't even come close!

review/summary: You're paying for the tin
review/text: For Father's Day I presented dear old Dad with all moustache-themed gifts; these candies made the cut.  The candy itself is quite off putting...as while itty bitty 'staches are adorable, the fact that they're a smokey black/gray color makes the brain think of licorice or, well, anything that isn't fruity. But they're indeed generically fruit-flavored. Not too tasty and pretty darn hard. Not sure we recieved the freshest batch, but I think had they been more gummy or even passably soft they'd have scored higher on the taste scale.<br /><br />But the fact is you buy this sort of novelty as a stocking stuffer type of gift, or, in my case, just to go with a theme. The tin is well made and Dad will probably use it to store some tiny, albeit manly man odds & ends. Is it overpriced for what you actually get? You betcha! But since they don't sell moustache candy at every corner store, the price is worth the smile.<br /><br />Just skip actually eating the candy... unless chipping a tooth is kind of your thing or if you're on the 'dark grey food only' diet. And of course, understand it's a small piece and won't feed (if you're brave) the entire neighborhood. Small 'stache for lots of cash.<br /><br />4 stars for the novelty tin, 1 star for the contents. If you're dead set on mustache candy and have teeth as mighty as Chuck Norris, order away!

review/summary: Wonderful organic raisins... and a wonderful value!
review/text: I never tried Bonner raisins before and purchased them at Amazon based only on the favorable 5 star reviews I read here. I'm always a little nervous about buying 6 pounds of any product I've never tasted before but my concern was unnecessary because these Bonner Organic Raisins are truly wonderful! I concur 100% with the other reviewers. These raisins are great and here at Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL29M">Bonner Organic Raisins, 16-Ounce Bag (Pack of 6)</a> are a great value as well!<br /><br />I like them much more than Newman's Organics, SunMaid Organics or the bulk organic raisins at my local health food store. They are not the jumbo sized raisins I'm really crazy about but still they are a decent size and they are moist, soft, juicy and oh so very sweet. They are almost too sweet for snacking (for my taste anyway) but they are a great addition to many of my favorite raw recipes and I love having them on hand as a healthy treat for visiting  nieces and nephews. I bet your kids will love them too, just the way they come out of the bag!<br /><br />I think the price is wonderful too ~ they end up costing much less per pound buying the pack of 6 16-ounce bags here at Amazon rather than the single pound packages at the grocery or bulk at the health food store.<br /><br />And they are certified Farm Verified Organic ~ so no worries whether they are truly organic or not.

review/text: These raisins are moist and chewy and very flavorful with a potent sweetness. They are almost comparable to Dole brand raisins, which in my opinion are usually the best tasting and highest quality raisins available.  Another brand worth trying if you are an aficionado is the Trader Joe's jumbo medley pack, which are EXCELLENT.<br /><br />I would like to note that Trader Joe's sells organic raisins for something like 2.49 or 2.69 a pound and I find them to be just as good as these, which come out to 3.4 in change per pound i.e. Trader Joe's is the better deal.

review/summary: Soft, sweet, flavorful!
review/text: I usually toss a small handfull of raisins in my oatmeal in the morning.  For years, I have purchased Sun-Maid products without complaint.  I decided to just try something a bit different since I saw all of the good reviews for this.  Man am I glad I did!  They are very soft and flavorful.  I don't have any complaints against Sun-Maid raisins, but in my opinion, these are better.  I don't have a preference of buying organic products, so I guess that is just a bonus in this scenario.<br /><br />They arrived quickly and well packed by Amazon.  Also, each of the 6 packs were air tight and should last a while.  Considering how much I use on a daily basis, it may take me 9 months to go through them all.  The nutrition information is about as standard as it can come.  Since I noticed that the nutrition info was incomplete on Amazon's site here is what the package had...I didn't include items with 0. It was exactly the same as Sun-Maid raisins...without exception.  The only difference I can tell was in the taste and texture.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/4 cup<br />Servings Per Container: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 130<br />Sodium: 10mg<br />Potassium: 310mg<br />Total Carbs: 31g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars 29g<br />Protein 1g<br />Calcium: 2%<br />Iron: 6%

review/text: My wife recently picked up a box of this awesome 'white fudge drizzled caramel popcorn' (the name says it all), and needless to say, it didn't last long.  Our family must have gone through a few boxes in the past few weeks.  As a previous poster here said, this truly tastes like gourmet popcorn, and the white chocolate and caramel topping give this popcorn it's mouth-watering flavor. Easily the best 'Snack Wells' product EVER!

review/summary: If I could give this more stars, I would!
review/text: Let me say that I love this popcorn. I found it in the grocery store a few weeks ago and have since bought and eaten much more of it than I would care to admit. I have also helped others learn to love it. This tastes like a gourmet product, it is quite sweet and has a perfect amount of caramel and white fudge without being sticky at all. Because of this, I can conveniently eat it while driving, watching TV, or sitting at my desk. So, as you can see, it is my new addiction and I love it! I guess the only negative would be that they sneakily packaged it so that each box only contains five little packages. It's about three to four dollars a box in the stores here (Safeway, Winco, Walmart, yes I have bought it at all three), so the price on Amazon for six boxes is actually quite high, at least at the time I write this. If you love caramel and white chocolate, get some of this immediately. nd then write a review so I'm not the only fanatic here ;)

review/text: Uncle Ben's Ready Rice offerings are fast cooking side dishes. Put the pouch in the microwave for ninety seconds, and it's done. So easy even a Potato Head can do it.<br />A serving size has 4 grams of fat, .5 of them saturated fat. A pouch contains two servings, each serving said to have 220 calories.<br /><br />For two adults and a child, the pouch should have just enough to satisfy all three unless one of the adults is a glutton like me.<br /><br />The Ready Rice an also be prepared in a skillet, and in my opinion is tastier prepared that way. The butter and garlic flavored rice is subtley flavored, not overwhelming at all. I like mine mixed with some frozen peas.<br /><br />The grains of rice are soft and do not stick together like some rices do. A little pricey, but the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice gets a thumb's up from this Potato Head.

review/text: Unlike the 5mil extracts, the 1mil extract is not prohibited by most states. More importantly, you can "work" with it. The 5mil extract is awesome too, but the fumes area killer, it will make you cry and choke just from smelling it. The 1mil is just not pleasant to smell, but you can still work with it and cook with it.<br /><br />From a torts perspective, if you plan on putting this product on someone's food, (1) put only a small amount, (2) tell them that it's "a bit spicy." That way, your intended target is at least aware of the risk of the food he or she is about to taste being spicy. He or she is assuming the risk of "how" spicy the food will be, and if they can handle how spicy it is. The "choice" is entirely upon the free-will of the target, and not due to misrepresentation or concealment.<br /><br />On the same note, please do NOT put this in food and NOT tell the person that it's spicy. Sure, it might seem like a funny thing to do, but it won't be funny if they file a pretty strong tort claim against you civilly. Also, some people are unable to handle spicy foods, or due to some stomach, heart, or GI condition, are extremely sensitive to spicy foods. Giving them food containing a 1mil extract poses a serious risk to their health and life! That means, what you thought was a joke, could end up putting you in jail for reckless or criminally negligent homicide.<br /><br />As an added warning; please be careful when you use this product. If you don't use gloves, and then rub your eyes later, enjoy the sensation of 1mil SHU on your naked eyes. To enjoy a similar sensation, just allow the sauce to splash into your eyes while washing something or closing the top of the bottle with the cap. If you thought you felt pain from your mouth being on fire, wait till you see what it feels like in your eyes. It's not fun, so please use gloves and glasses, or try to be very careful.<br /><br />No communication herein constitutes legal advice.

review/summary: Actually Taste Like Buffalo
review/text: I would say this is the only buffalo snack i have had that tasted exactly like buffalo!  Many other chips and pretzels claim to be buffalo, but are just spicy.  These have the taste and spiciness of buffalo sauce.  These are probably my favorite snack!

review/summary: Way too salty and too much MSG.  Horrible aftertaste
review/text: I tried these pretzelcrisps after thinking what a great idea.  Unfortunately there is so much salt on these things, it even made my lips burn when eating them.  Once I looked at the ingredients, not only was I shocked to see the amount of sodium in these (10 pieces have 23% of your RDA for sodium), but MSG is the third largest ingredient in this product.  WOW, what a shock.  These snacks left such a horrible after-taste in my mouth.  Unfortunately for taste these things get two thumbs down.  Stick with normal pretzels in this case.

review/text: I hate to be THAT person, but these are gross. Buffalo wings are one of my most favorite foods ever but these do not taste like buffalo wings. They taste really sour, then really spicy and hot, and WAY WAY WAY too salty, and I love my salt! I can't pick up a good flavor with these. I'm really sad because they sounded amazing. I recommend the "Everything" Pretzel Crisps.

review/summary: Almost as good as the real thing
review/text: I first tried these after my sister gave me a bag of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT5NFO">Snack Factory Original Pretzel Crisps</a>.  My family really liked them as a quick snack they could grab a handful of.  I also found them dipping them in sour cream, peanut butter, cream cheese and also adding sliced cheese.  When I saw they had flavored ones, I had to buy them and so far the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YTC9MO">Snack Factory Buffalo Wing Pretzel Crisps</a> are our favorites. They don't work well dipped in peanut butter, but are good with all the others including ranch dressing or just by themselves.  Although the size of the bags seem small, because they are so light and crispy, you do receive quite a bit in them. On average I've paid anywhere from $2.50 to $3.50 a bag and I'm okay with that. Definitely give them a try if you like Buffalo Wings!

review/summary: 5 stars for the quality of the food, 2 for the price
review/text: The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them.  They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.<br /><br />My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.  Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the  water.

review/summary: fantastic product--worth every penny!
review/text: As other reviewers have noticed, this is not the cheapest goji berry product on the market.  However, in my experience, as with pretty much every other Sunfood Nutrition product [...] quality is unsurpassable.  I have tasted many goji berry products, and non are as soft and juicy as these little babies.<br /><br />In response to some of the other people who are objecting to the price, I have been to David Wolfe's lectures (the founder of the company that imports these gojis) and he has spoken of the extreme difficulty with proper quality control of goji berries.  They grow in China (and in Tibet) natively, and even many of the products out there that claim they are "organic" may not really be, as some of them can be tested and proven they are still sprayed with sulfur dioxide among other preservatives.<br /><br />Sunfood Nutrition has 4 checkpoints in China and in the export process to absolutely ensure the quality of their product is a high as they say it is.<br /><br />David Wolfe has stated that Sunfood is not at all trying to compete on price with cheaper products that are flooding healthfood stores and internet companies nationwide.  Their only passion is the highest quality available.<br /><br />By the way, I have tasted dozens of raw chocolate products (raw cacao) as well, and NO ONE has the consistent quality and taste of the Sunfood products.  Try it for yourself and see.

review/text: I found these, a solo bag actually, at a local market where I buy my 'natural' items that Vons apparently refuse to carry. These are, like the picture in the gallary shows, MUCH bigger than the bulk box of gojis I occasionally buy. These are actually squishy, tasty things - not hard. But not too squishy, either. When you compare to the bulk bag, these are clearly gojis, but must be a different strain. Likw how some raisins don't look alike at all - but they're clearly raisins? I just wish they werent as pricey, gojis, since I can eat the bag in one sitting.

review/summary: Veterinarian review
review/text: It's not every day that you learn about a great product and solid company that makes you want to quit your job and join them, right? Well, I discovered Zuke's, a "bone brokering," performance pet nutrition company based out of Durango, Colorado that makes treats so good that you almost want to eat them. I was first introduced to a sample size of Zuke's "Hip Action" treats, and questioned how "natural" they really were. With the melamine-induced pet food scare back in March of last year, I've been much more discriminating (as a vet) in what I feed my pets (as a pet owner!) and always make sure to read the ingredients on any treat or food product.<br /><br />Being that JP, my 10 year-old rescue pit bull, has discriminating tastes (i.e., he's uber-picky and doesn't even eat pig ears sometimes!), I thought I'd put him to the test. Well, he wolfed these Hip Action semi-moist dog treats down and begged for more. JP has always been partial to soft treats, and these often contain a lot of propylene glycol (which is a humectant used to add or preserve moisture content of the treat). Upon reviewing the ingredients in Zuke's treats, I was impressed that I understood all the ingredient names and they were quite natural after all! Keep in mind that "natural" is different from "organic" (which must be certified organic). "Natural" means that no additional ingredients are added into the product, and I was glad to hear that all of Zuke's ingredients are natural by definition of AAFCO. I also loved how all the ingredients are sourced in the USA, as we know we have tighter regulations (USDA, FDA, AAFCO) than other countries (hence, the pet food poisoning last year). Zuke's only exception to this is their lamb and venison, which are imported from New Zealand. Apparently, even the salmon in their treats are wild-caught! (Remember, we green-crunchy types always want to promote that people eat WILD salmon, as farmed salmon has quite a severe, unhealthy effect on the environment).<br /><br />Hip Action: Ahhh... my favorite. Well, actually, JP's favorite. As a 10 year-old dog, JP is fit, lean, and well conditioned... but he still is slowing down from arthritis. I have him on Cosequinn DS (double strength), which contains 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin (GAGs) in each capsule. Unfortunately, I have to pill JP each time (by hiding it in a meatball of canned food) to get this medication into him. Zuke's provides a tastier option in these Hip Action treats (dog), which contain 300 mg of glucosamine and 50 mg of chondroitin. These are very similar in size, appearance, and ingredient to the Jerky Natural treats - with the added benefit of these cartilage-protecting, safe products and some blueberries, apples, carrots, and flax seed to boot. That said, keep in mind that most of the veterinary research that has been done has only evaluated Cosequinn (we vets know that this brand of GAGs works), so I can't vouch for the anti-arthritis properties of Hip Action. That said, it's likely the same and is benign enough to be a safe, healthy treat for your dog. For you cat lovers, fear not. Zuke's has this in cat form too. Your average cat likely doesn't need it, but if your cat is diagnosed with arthritis, has had a fracture before, is stiff getting up in the morning, or is grossly overweight, it might be worth trying this treat for Kitty. With only 2 calories per treat, these cat Hip Actions contain 50 mg of glucosamine and 15 mg of chondroitin.

Just push in the little pill, or fold the treat over it and they gulp it down, especially when I have a second one in my hand waiting for them.

review/summary: Wonderful treats for my Rottweiler/Shepherd
review/text: Our 98lb Rott/Shep loves Zuke's Hip Action Treats. We got the treats upon a good friend's recommendation when we told her that Phoebe had started limping a little over a month ago. She had hip replacement when she was a year old, so we suspect the hip is bothering her again. She's only had the treats for a week so far, but I highly recommend Zuke's Hip Action because of the all-natural ingredients. These treats supplement her Science Diet Mobility dry dog food.
