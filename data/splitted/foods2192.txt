review/summary: A little box of Vietnam in your kitchen! Delicious!
review/text: I've traveled quite a bit in Vietnam and found comfort in a delicious bowl of Pho on many a bad day at work or when I have a cold.  I've been looking for an easy and delicious way to make pho for myself but have never seemed to get it quite right.  But this WORKED!!! It is hot, delicious, and oh-so-easy.  Add some veggies and a little tofu or meat of your choice...you have a fantastic lunch or dinner. PLUS, bonus for me, gluten free!! I also have to say, I love that the packaging is 100% recycled paperboard.  If you're a Pho lover, I would definitely invest and keep some Happy Pho in your pantry.

review/summary: Happy to discover Happy Pho!
review/text: I am beyond thrilled with this product!  It is difficult to find vegetarian pho in restaurants and making vegetarain pho (which I have attempted several times) is a long process.  Happy Pho has solved all of my problems!  It is vegetarian, healthy, quick, and delicious!  I can't recommend it enough!

review/summary: Taste very extremely bad
review/text: I'm Vietnamese and I know how Pho should be tasted. Of course, I don't compare this one with fresh Pho. But compared with all kinds of instant noodle, organic or not, gluten free or not, this one tastes extremely bad. After eating a first few bites, I threw the whole box. I don't even call this one Pho, from the look to the taste!<br /><br />I would rate it 0 star!

review/summary: Down right disgusting!
review/text: I was really disappointed in this product. I eat Pho a lot, and good Pho (I travel extensively, Internationally). While I did not expect this "Pho in a box" to match that of my previous culinary experiences, I did have hope that it would at least taste "ok". This tasted disgusting, reminiscent of bad tasting medicine. As other reviewers have mentioned, the box includes the noodles, and the spice packet. Everything else needs to be purchased. So based on that premise, you are better of buying everything from the store (Asian specialty if you have one), since you will need to go there anyway.<br /><br />Update:<br />I also find it interesting that almost all of the 5 star reviews come from persons who only have 1 single review, and it is for this soup. Coincidence? I doubt it.

review/summary: There is anise in the actual mix......
review/text: The noodles are fine and cook well.  But this is WAY overpriced for a box of noodles.  The sauce mix that is included has anise in it...  I know that's the name of the company, but really, in the soup?????  And they really do want you to add another 5 things to it to make it soup...  I just put some garlic and basil in mine with chicken bouillon.  The mix that is included is thrown away, it is really horrible.  I have celiacs and this is great because it is gluten free, but I can buy cheaper stuff at the local health food store, or giant...

review/summary: Zone 7 (indoor during the winter, outdoor during the summer)...1 year later.
review/text: I purchased this almost a year ago to the day because I wanted something to fill a corner of a room, and because I love banana trees (they remind me of home) and wanted one I could grow and keep indoors during the winter months in the mid-atlantic region.  I was between this and the tiny dwarf variety, but figured I wanted something that would occupy the biggest possible space without being the size of a full banana tree.  It arrived a tiny little plant, and at first I was worried that the container I had gotten for it looked ridiculously over-sized.<br /><br />It grew slowly for the first few months because I tried to grow it using artificial daylight lighting, but then started to pick up a little steam around April and I set it outside from May-September (summer months).  I thought it was gonna die outside with the intense heat and sun (I probably should have acclimated it to full sun a little more slowly), but then suddenly it started sprouting leaves at the rate of ~ 1 new bigger leaf per week. The leaves also went from being thin to being much thicker.  I watered it daily, btw, since it likes humidity.<br /><br />FYI, I repotted after the summer and holy moly does this thing have a lot of roots!  Give it a week or so to acclimate once you get it, but transfer it to a large pot soonish to avoid getting root-bound.  I used well-draining palm soil and apply slow-release fertilizer 1-2x a year.<br /><br />A year later, it is getting close to 3 ft. tall and still going (with the large container, it's closer to 4 ft), and currently is overwintering by a sunny window instead.  It's one of my favorite things to wake up to every day.  I've purchased a few plants from Hirt's and am yet to have a bad experience.  Pretty fast shipping, too!

review/summary: Arrived fast & healthy, but with broken leaves
review/text: The banana plant, along with a Hoya carnosa 'Strawberries and Cream' (rated separately), were ordered together and arrived together just 3 days after ordering, an admirable accomplishment. The only thing that could/should have been done better was in protecting the banana plant's delicate leaves. They were simply suspended in a plastic-foam 'peanuts' that provided very good insulation, but they shifted about in transit resulting in 3 of its 5 leaves to be broken and damaged. I have no doubt that given the plant's overall health otherwise, will recover in a reasonably short amount of time, but is the reason for the 4-star rating. I found the condition acceptable as the plant was ordered for myself, but would not have found it acceptable if the plant was ordered as a gift for someone else. The only other, very minor complaint is that neither plant arrived with a plant tag.<br /><br />In summary, given that both plants were very reasonably priced and arrived quickly and in good-enough health that I would order from them again. I would suggest that if the plants are intended to be gifts that a note to this effect be included with the order.

review/summary: adorable!
review/text: Arrived perfectly fine and healthy-  just re-pot it, water it, and watch it grow! I've had it for about a month now and it has grown like a weed! One thing I have learned though, is when the bottom leaves die off (don't freak out, your little tree is ok!) don't strip them from the plant like I did. Dumb mistake - it only weakens the 'trunk'. Instead, I just go ahead and cut the dead leaf off when it dies! That way it doesn't effect the strength of the trunk while getting rid of shriveled up, ugly leaves! Overall I'm very happy with my purchase - have gotten many compliments on it :)

review/summary: arrived in good condition but no instructions
review/text: I just received this plant in the mail. It arrived in good condition (a few bruised leaves from the travel but I think it's going to be OK). The plant looks very healthy. My only complaint is that it came with NO instructions. I think there should be something included that lets the consumer know if it needs immediate replanting; what the soil, water and sun/shade needs are as well as when one can first expect it to bear fruit. Admittedly, one can find this information on the web but I think they should have provided it in the box. Otherwise, it seems like a good product.

review/summary: Lush plants but re-pot immediately.
review/text: My superdwarf banana plants arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Each plant had about a six leaves on it with minimal shipping damage. I re-potted them immediately and they suffered no transplant shock.  They're now thriving in a sunny window.<br /><br />Another word on re-pottng.  The plants are packed and potted for shipping in shallow, light-soiled, 4" containers, which means that you'll want to re-pot them into a bigger pot immediately.  I can't stress that enough. I honestly wouldn't wait more than a day to re-pot, as in the warmer months the plant could dry out very quickly.

The pineapple I ordered with it is also in fantastic shape.  Based on this alone, I would recommend these plants and this company for the best shipped plants I have ever received.  C'est magnifique!

review/summary: A very beautiful house plant
review/text: It arrived OK with some broken leaves but in general a healthy condition. It grows pretty fast, 1 new leaf comes out every 1-1.5 week, new leaves are completely healthy looking with a very beautiful green color. Smaller weak leaves dies off near the bottom but it's OK, not terrible.<br /><br />It is an excellent house plant and got that exotic feeling. The hope that it will bloom and bear mini banana some day adds so much fun! It is really exciting as the new leaves unroll themselves and you will find another tiny one growing in the middle.<br /><br />My only problem is that Gnats are breeding in the soil after 2 weeks because of the moist soil. I am still looking for a remedy that doesn't hurt the plant.

review/summary: Novice Grower, and Plant is Thriving!
review/text: I am new at growing plants. I received this plant early March 2011. It arrived and looked nice and healthy. The plant was inside until it warmed up here in Missouri. Then I put it outside on the porch. It did really great until we got all that horrible MO weather. The wind ripped up the leaves, and the hail did the plant a lot of damage. I thought for sure it was a gonner. But this plant came back, and seems to be doing great! It's a bit over 2 feet tall now! I hope it makes bananas! That would be great, but it is very nice looking. Also, there are 2 little babies growing around the base of the plant now, so if this one doesn't work out I have 2 to try again with! I will try to add a picture. Mine is in a yellow container.

review/text: Plant arrived in decent condition, packed very tightly with a "Song of Jamaica" that I had ordered from the same seller. Multiple leaves were bruised and two of the six leaves were torn almost halfway off. Needless to say, the plant was still very much alive and kicking. I replanted into a 5" pot temporarily, and then replanted into a 10" shortly afterwards. Since it's arrival (just about three weeks) the plant has mended itself as much as possible, and has grown two beautiful new leaves with no sign of slowing down.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with this purchase.

I've had it 3 weeks and it's doing well. It has even grown a new leaf!<br />I did notice, however, you can't place this plant in full sun, no matter how long. This will cause the leaves to "burn". Also, if the plant gets too dry, it will warm you by "curling" the leaves.<br />Thanks, Hirts, for a beautiful plant! Even if it never gives me bananas, it is a gorgeous plant.

review/text: Got a much smaller and less healthy than expected plant based on description and comments here.  Its only been a few days, so it might suddenly explode with new growth.  Currently the 3 leaves on it are either dead or damaged, so unless some new growth happens immediately, the plant is a goner.<br /><br />Updated 4/26/12: Original leaves have basically rotted away or already fallen off, but on the upside 1 large healthy leaf took their place and another on has started coming up.  Looks half dead still, but should make it if enough leaves come up fast enough.<br /><br />Updated 8/26/12: Original plant died off completely, but had faith and put it outside and watered it every day for a few weeks.  Eventually a tiny leaf popped up even though it was half brown.  Since then 8 new leaves have come up even though most of them are up to 20% browned to start.  Each leaf rots away after a week or 2 but they are progressively getting bigger.

review/summary: Very Nice Fast Growing Little Plant.
review/text: I ordered this plant last week and received it in the mail just a few days later. I expected to receive it much later so I was surprised. The only reason why I don;t give it 5 stars is because it was packed in a tiny box and the some of the soil spilled all over the leaves despite being taped, So I had to clean it. Also two of the leaves were damaged because the box was too small. The plant itself was puny, very disappointing if you expect to get something like the picture or the description(This is why it gets 4 stars). It was definitely not 10" long, the stem is not even 5" tall right now and I find it has grown considerably. And it only had about 7 leaves including one in the center that was still curled up and 2 at the bottom that didn't make it during shipping. So now the plant has 5 leaves. The middle one has uncurled but the tip has a few tiny holes which worried me. I checked for bugs but I haven't found any yet.<br /><br />I transplanted this little one to a pretty 8" pot with 4 parts organic potting mix and 1 part perlite and added some organic fertilizer. The first and second day the it was a bit distressed but then after that it started perking up and getting more and more beautiful. The leaves are much longer and it loves my sunny windowsill. I will move it outside as soon as the temperatures are warm enough. I water it lightly everyday, leaves and all in the early morning because the soil dries up quickly in the direct sun. So far my little banana tree is growing fast and doing great.

review/summary: This one is doing quite well now.
review/text: I received my banana dwarf on Monday. Two of the four leaves were healthy. One of the others was broken. I hold out hope that it will flourish, but i give it 50/50 odds. I havent watered it since it arrived, and yet the soil is still quite saturated. This gives me cause for concern since the soil should only be moist for this plant, even though it is a tropical. I am leaving it outside for the next couple days to see if that will help, rather than by the window where it has been. I snapped a photo which i will have available here for review. I will continue to update this as things change for good or for bad. Presently, i can only offer three stars on the plant.<br /><br />July 6th: It has recovered and is doing quite a bit better. The broken leaf has actually grown back and looks strong. In addition, a new leaf is unfurling from the top of the plant. Definitely looks a lot better now. I have upped my rating to four stars to reflect the change in status.<br /><br />August 20th: The plant is doing quite well. Each new leaf that unfurls is larger than the last. What i have found is that the plant doesn't like direct sunlight, but does thrive in the heat. So, placing it in the shade seems to be the way to go...at least for my plant...at least until it gets cold, then it's coming inside for the winter.<br /><br />Update, January 6 (2012): This is by far the healthiest and most vibrant plant i own at this point. Each new leaf grows larger than the last. I have it indoors presently for the winter, sitting next to a window. It is still thriving. Some interesting notes....the leaves tend to grow against the window (because it is the light source most likely), and they trap condensation between them and the window, which seems to be beneficial. Also, we have had an issue with gnats, but for some reason, they tend to die around the banana plant, which is really good. We clean up the little bug graveyard every so often, and this benefits out other plants. I will take some more pictures soon, but from what i can tell, if your plant survives its transplant(s), you will have a wonderful addition to your home and/or garden. Presently, the plant is about three and a half feet tall, btw.

review/summary: Great condition and speed!
review/text: I just got my plant a few days ago, but so far it is doing great! It came really fast, and was in great condition when it arrived. All the leaves were green and the plant was healthy. So far, it has been easily worth the cost.<br />Well, i have had my banana for a couple of months now, and i still like it, but there is a big problem. During shipping, a bug must have gotten into the soil. I had the plant in my room for a week or two, when i noticed these little white bugs on the soil. they were about a centimeter long, and a millimeter wide, and they multiplied like crazy!! i tried using bon-neem to get rid of them, but they just hid underneath the dirt for a day and came back the next day. they seem to be causing the banana trouble because about half of the leaves have died. If not for the bug problem, this would be five stars though.

review/text: Arrived three days after order, bottom two leaves were a tad beat up, but the plant bounced back nicely after a few shots of Liquid Grow.<br /><br />Waited a week to transplant and it is now sprouting up its third set of new leaves in as many weeks and growing nicely.<br /><br />Pretty plant, for sure keep it out of direct outdoor sunlight.  I keep mine inside where it receives indirect light and it seems happy as a clam at high tide.  It can take daily (yes daily) shots of liquid fertilizer.<br /><br />Another great buy from Amazon for me.

review/summary: :) Cool plant!
review/text: This plant is very cool, but it arrived only 7-8" tall D;. I live in massachusetts, and I am amazed it is still ALIVE after 30 F degrees! It took 11 days total to get here, and in those days it has been in the - degrees, so I can't imagine how clod it was on the shipment here! One of the leaves seems to have frostbite though, but the other 2 leaves are in good condition. The top is a little frost bitten, but I'm sure it will turn out to be good. The over all look of the plant looks lush, but it is a little limp, but it will grow a lot! I recommend this for people anywhere, even in the north, where I am!

Second time I ordered for my friends and I don't know the condition of those.<br />But today, I got the last two plants delivered in a very small box and two banana plants came with all leaves broken. One was very bad and I'm pretty sure because of the box being too small.<br /><br />Sarah Zhang

review/text: I waited several weeks before reviewing this plant because I wanted to see how it would do. I arrived in a small plastic container and had 3 damaged leaves. I replanted it and immediately it began to grow new healthy leaves at at fast rate. Indirect light and watering it about every 10 days has seemed to work perfect. It is a beautiful plant and is growing well. It was packed well but lost most of the soil, I was happy with the shipping speed and price. The plant is doing excellent and I hope by next summer I will have little bananas.

review/text: I ordered two plants and only took a few days for shipping with standard shipping.  They were in great shape considering they've been bumped around in the mail for a few days.<br /><br />The Seller recommends using a 8-10-8 fertilizer which can be a bit harder to find in a smaller quantity.  Search Amazon and you'll find one listing for a 20lb bag for over $35 after shipping.  The same product is available in a 4lb bag, but doesn't list the 8-10-8 in the description.<br /><br />Search for 32086 Garden Fertilizer.  It's also Prime eligible.

review/text: My banana plant arrived in great condition, no broken leaves or anything. I re-potted right away into an 8 inch self watering plastic pot and it has been thriving near a window in my living room. I've gotten a new leaf about every week or so. I cant wait to get fruit growing on it, but even just as a fruitless house plant it is very neat. Every leaf that grows is larger than the one before it. Highly recommend!

review/text: Honestly, I'm not sure if I have the correct plant.  The plant I received is teeny tiny...maybe 5 inches tall (excluding the pot it's in) with 4 tiny leaves.  I'm hoping it grows quickly into something remotely close to what the photo looks like.  I've owned other banana plants in the past and they have been great house plants!!  I've just never seen one so "young" before.  So, I'm going to give this little baby my best shot and hope it grows up to be a great plant like my others.  I can't say it's a bad plant, but just not what I was expecting to receive.  It's a baby.  :)<br /><br />I'm going to try to attach a photo just so people know what they are getting...

review/text: Honey often makes things too sweet for me. I don't like an overpowering taste.<br /><br />I made whole wheat bread with Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Fair Trade Honey. I used the same amount of honey that I usually use, but I liked the result much better. It seemed to add a full, rich, taste, but was not overly sweet or "it is not sickly sweet" as another poster stated it. That means I am happy to use it again and again for baking bread, my main reason for buying honey.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this brand of honey and would gladly recommend it to those who want a full-bodied taste, but  not an overpowering sweetness

review/summary: Delicious Honey, Worth Trying
review/text: This is a dark honey, similar to buckwheat with a bit of a caramel undertone. Very yummy! We drizzled it on homemade cracked wheat bread and it was delicious. I've had a lot going on here lately and when I put a pan of custards in the oven, I found I had left the sugar out of the recipe! Oops. Well, I just squirted a swirl of this honey on top and it was so good I'm thinking of always making them that way in the future.<br /><br />The only thing that would make me hesitate to purchase this product would be that we prefer raw honey for the nutritional value.<br /><br />As far as the fair trade issue goes,it's a nice thought, I approve of the humanitarian angle. However, we have plenty of bee keepers here in the USA selling wonderful raw honey, working very hard. Let's give them a break and a dollar.

It certainly doesn't have a great, sweet taste to it like many domestic honeys.  Plus, the idea of something from another part of the world defeats at least some of the reported benefits of honey if it comes from one's local area.<br /><br />We'll probably use it all, but more out of a desire to not waste it by throwing it away.  It's not awful by any means, but at best a 3-star product, and really just a bit below that (thus the high 2-star rating).  Others may like it - we don't.

review/summary: Robust Flavor
review/text: This is great tasting honey.  It is thick and a dark amber color.  And like many dark honeys, it is robust in flavor.  I alsolike the bottle.  It sits on the cap which means it is always easy to squeeze the honey out.  Some of the bottles I have bought in the past did not do this and after a while it became difficult to get the honey out of the bottle.  I will definitely buy this honey in the future.

review/summary: No reason not to award 5 stars - rich, sweet, dark - with a molasses-like after taste
review/text: To begin with, I like the premise for the product, and I am more than happy to try out this product from Central/South American beekeepers.<br /><br />I was a little surprised when I first saw the honey.  It is much darker than most honey I've seen and used over the past several years - mainly clover and orange blossom honeys.  I wasn't wary, just surprised.<br /><br />The honey has a deep color (darker than the color shown in the product description) and rich flavor.  It is extremely sweet, and has a distinctive but not unpleasant aftertaste that is reminiscent of molasses.  My college daughter, who considers herself something of a honey connoisseur, pronounced it good and even offered to take it off my hands :-)<br /><br />I also like the bottle.  It is plastic and is designed to stand on its cap that has a no-flow plug.  The honey is dispensed easily by gently squeezing the bottle.<br /><br />All in all I think that this honey deserves 5 stars.  Though the taste is a little different than North American honeys I've tried, it has a very good flavor and comes in an easy-dispensing plastic bottle.<br /><br />5 stars!

review/text: This honey has a strange smell to me, almost like caramel that has been nearly burnt. I so wanted to try this but it came to me with the seal broken and had leaked all over the inside of the packaging. I guess I am a little leary of trying it since the seal was broken, it was probably in shipping but I can't be certain of it. I buy local honey and they all have a very nice honey scent but this one doesn't have a good scent to me, I am not sure what makes this one so much different from the other natural honeys I have gotten.

I believe the flavor is just OK because I can taste burnt caramel which is not a taste I like.  I am not sure if it is caused by the type of flower this honey is made from or by something else.  I prefer this honey mixed as a sweetener in a cup of tea rather than eating it by itself.

review/text: I liked this honey a lot. Great taste and consistency.  The squeezable container makes it easy to use and easy to work with if the honey eventually crystalizes.  The idea that I can buy honey that is organic and fair trade where the money goes to the farms and bee keepers makes me feel like I am making a good choice.  Is it cheap?  Not necessarily, but is it worth it to buy organic and fair trade if you can?  Absolutely.  Great product and I would definitely consider purchasing this item and telling my friends/family about it.

review/summary: Delicious, non GMO and organic
review/text: I usually only buy honey from local sources because of the scandal of high fructose corn syrup being mixed in with almost all honeys you find commercially.  I also like that local honey is unpasteurized, which preserves the enzymes and anti-bacterial quality of the honey. We use a lot of honey in baking and on our food, so having a quality product is important to us.<br /><br />I tried this honey just to see if it was a good as the description makes it sound.  I'm really impressed!  I love that it's organic and non-GMO, and of course the fair trade aspect means the people who tend the bees are actually getting paid for the honey. The one downside is that it's been pasteurized.  But the flavor of this honey is the best part. It has a dark, rich taste that reminds me of molasses or sorghum.  It was lovely on toast, much different than clover or apple blossom honey.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this product for baking because it's rather expensive ($8+ per 16 oz) but as a condiment at the table, I think we've found a new favorite.

review/text: This honey is very dark and, as mentioned above, has a very strong flavor. I don't know what flower to attribute it to. It doesn't taste like clover or orange blossom honey, but is delicious nonetheless. This will work great in Indian style teas or any baking goods that need the honey flavor to be robust. I also love the fact that it is not only organic but Fair Trade in origin.

review/summary: Good for you, good for the planet and tasty
review/text: Organic and fair trade are two designations I like to see on products I buy. Together they're nearly irresistible, but of course a lot depends on whether the product is worth buying.  Does it taste good?  Wholesome Sweeteners honey does taste good.  It's a dark amber honey with the kind of slight bitterness you find in buckwheat honey.  It also has an odd flavor, probably because I'm unused to honey produced from South American plants.  Not unappealing, just different.<br /><br />If you can find something like this that suits your tastes and covers a lot of socio-political bases as well, why not buy it?

review/summary: Great for baking!
review/text: I use honey mostly for baking.  I tried this honey in a batch of whole wheat bread (and I scooped up some to taste while I was mixing the dough). The color is unusually dark, like molasses. The flavor is distinctive, richer than most honeys.  The difference is more obvious when you just eat the honey, but the baked bread did taste subtly different than usual. I am concerned about mounting pesticides in food and am glad to find a honey that does not contain any. I should care about fair trade, too, so am glad that makers of this honey are doing the right thing. The bottle is a standard plastic squeeze bottle, not very organic but you can recycle it.

review/summary: Dark honey, a little sweeter?
review/text: I was so excited to get honey that is not only Organic, but Fair trade!  Other than that, I really didn't expect much of a change from the honey I buy at the store and I wasn't really wrong.<br /><br />I use honey in tea.  For me that is the main reason I buy it (other than the occasional recipe that calls for it).  I enjoy at least 1 cup of tea a day with about 1 1/2 teaspoons of honey to sweeten it.<br /><br />I have to say that this honey is beautifully dark.  I don't mean a shade darker than regular honey, but it was almost molasses colored! I thought that was pretty great because dark honey usually means very sweet honey.  It also has this wonderful, rich scent.<br /><br />For tonight's tea, I decreased the honey to about 1 teaspoon to see where it measured and I don't need any more than that. I don't taste any difference in flavor, though.  I thought there might be a little more clover to it or something to really make it distinct, but there just isn't.<br /><br />So, to sum:<br />Pros: Use less for same sweetness<br />The fact that it is Fair trade (no ripping off 3rd-world countries by paying them pennies)<br />Organic (be real, we have no clue what pesticides do to our bodies but are much sicker than our counterparts of 60 years ago)<br /><br />Cons: Price -- but not awful really.  Local honey from vendors tends to be around the same price, though store brands are cheap but no telling where/who they come from.<br /><br />Overall, I would probably buy it again.  I know I feel better about having it to give to my daughter and a little less sweetener in my tea...

Very appetizing. Improve the taste of all your foods and beverages with this honey. Works well in both tea and coffee.

review/summary: Recipe: Hot Choc for Grown-Ups
review/text: Heat 8-10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1-1/4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1-1/8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.<br />Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted. You'll know it's right when the mocha + hazelnut + brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant -- the result will be a new experience "greater than the sum of its parts."

review/summary: Wonderful hot cocoa!
review/text: This is delicious hot cocoa but if you make it according to the packages directions it would be very strong!! I made some for my son with only 2 TBSP and it tasted pretty good but not super sweet. I made it for myself with 3 TBSP and it was like drinking a melted chocolate bar. It was very strong and sweet. Delicious but almost over the top! Later I made it again but I mixed only 1TBSP of it with the cheap swiss miss cocoa I already had. I think that was actually perfect! Creamy but not too sweet. I also think that this is overpriced. I got quite a good deal on it (saved several dollars) and still thought it was a bit expensive and I was suprised how tiny the cans were. I am definitely going to save this for my husband and I! My kids can have the cheaper stuff. :) This hits the spot on a cold winter day when you are craving chocolate though!

review/summary: Too sweet but good enough for 3 stars
review/text: I like this cocoa if mixed with unsweetened cocoa. By itself it is just too sweet with not enough chocolate flavor. I debated whether to give it 3 or 4 stars, but I think I'm going to have to go with 3 stars because my wife also agrees it is just too sweet. Adding some unsweetened cocoa powder, like "Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Chocolate Powder, Cacao Power, Mayan Superfood" increases the chocolate flavor and reduces the sweetness and brings it up to 4 or 5 stars, but that requires additional expense and work.<br /><br />On another note, I did find that adding a spoonful of this cocoa mix to a cup of Keurig coffee and then half and half makes a nice cup of coffee that is just the right sweetness for my taste. So in that use it works well.

review/summary: not much hazelnut flavor
review/text: It is a good hot cocoa mix. Some reviewers said that it is too sweet but I think you can customize the amount you put in a serving as you wish. The directions on the box said to use 4 tbsp (3 tbsp here on Amazon description). That amount looked too much to me. So I used just 3 teaspoons to get the taste I want (I should mention that I don't like too strong chocolate taste). Obviously, by adding less powder you are decreasing the sweetness as well as the chocolate taste. So if you like strong chocalate with less sweetness, this product might disappoint you.<br /><br />Only thing I was really disappointed about was the lack of hazelnut aroma. It was very subtle. It almost tasted like plain hot chocolate. I love hazelnut so I wish it'd be richer.  I still enjoy it.<br /><br />On the box it says 12 servings per box. Each box contains 16 oz (1 lb, 454 g) and you get 4 of these in this order, 4 lbs total.

If they would promote and give it time to develop users, it would be a winner. It's uncommon for my wife and I to go a day without an iced, blended Ghirardelli mocha. About 12 to 16 ice cubes (in a good blender), fill to top of cubes with milk, add about 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons of mocha mix. Sometimes a little cinnamon. Mix until well blended. Add a little instant coffee if you like in a cup with just enough water and about 10 sec in the MW. Yum! We have recently discovered hazelnut iced blended mochas, adding coffee. We're hooked :-)

review/text: I have been using Coffee-Mate creamer, bought from grocery store's refrigerator section for the past 12 years. Since I was moving to Berlin, and you cannot fine it in Germany I bought 6 boxes of these and took them with me. I could not use even one, since they taste nothing like the ones you buy from the store. I was very disappointed, and will not recommend you to spend your money on this item.

review/summary: Cinnamon Bears
review/text: The bears were sticky and not edible. I realize they were ordered during the summer season; however, I brought them immediately into my home and there should not have been an issue with humid weather. Very disappointed. I have ordered this product before and was satisfied with the quality.

review/summary: Really works (worked) well...
review/text: My 13-year old ShiTzu had to be put down due to diabetic seizures...in her mid-life years, she developed a bad skin disorder (hot spots, Seboriah) and after hudreds of dollars worth of treatments, this product was the ONLY one that worked! And when I say only, I do mean ONLY!!!<br /><br />It did not irritate her (except for the taste - done on purpose to keep animals from licking the infected area & causing it to spread), and the alcohol-medicine smell was tolerable.<br /><br />When (if) I get another dog that is prone to skin disorders, the remaining 4 bottles (yes, I bought this stuff in bulk because the price does fluctuate!) will certainly be used!

review/summary: Works for this Weight Watcher
review/text: My wife and I were looking for a cracker that would work with our Weight Watchers program. This one is our favorite. Large enough to handle any spread, cheese or meat. We first found these at Costco but when they ran out searched until we found them on Amazon. A great celebration when they arrived.

review/summary: I love these flatbread
review/text: When i first tasted these i feel in love with them, then i notice that I could get them by the dozen which was very very good my only problem is that several of my packages had a whole in it, it wasn't that bad because it did not spoil, I would probably order again but ask that you check to make sure there aren't any whole in the opening of the package

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD FOR YOUNG AND OLDER DOGS
review/text: was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food. That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it. He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated. I have 12 toy poodles ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately. The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard. I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it. Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well. It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard. I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too. I have always let my dogs "graze" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat. Normal BM's too. Can't say enough good stuff about this dog food. Once your dog gets a taste of this, they will never want another brand! Oh, it is for big dogs too!

review/summary: The neighbors will love it
review/text: My neighbors ask me if they could try the beer I just made and they loved it. Now they want me to make this beer for July 4th.<br /><br />The directions were very easy to follow and the package was delivered on time. If you like smooth beer with great taste, try the nut brown ale, you will only make this beer from now on.

review/summary: tasty
review/text: I'm very pleased with the results, after 2 weeks in the fermenter and 1 week bottle conditioning, this tastes good. This was my first attempt at homebrew, and it was rather easy. I am excited to see how much better it is after a few more weeks.
