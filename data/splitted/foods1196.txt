review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/summary: Unhappy hips! supplied by AMAZON
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.

review/text: I like Dogswell products and have purchased the "Vitality" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.  My dog and my roomie's dog didn't care for them one bit.  I purchased them because they were on sale (deeply discounted) and now I know why....<br /><br />Buy other Dogswell Chews, just not these sweet potato ones...

review/text: In my search to find yummy treats for my dog, that don't make him sick, I stumbled upon happy hips, which is perfect since my dog is a lab mix predisposed to hip problems.  He loves them!!  In fact he has gotten to the point where he refuses other dog treats.  I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!  They came quickly and were quite a deal.  I will purchase again and again.

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

review/summary: My dogs won't eat this!
review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.

He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

I emailed the company and they told me that they had already tested it in a lab and it was found to be starch, which occurs naturally on sweet potatoes. But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????

review/summary: Not sugar
review/text: It states to use it like sugar.  Well, not exactly.  It does not work in homemade cookies.  They wanted to crumble removing them from the cookie sheet. The ones I salvaged, were OK frozen.<br /><br />And using to make homemade jam, it crystalized when the jam cooled.  Need to get it hot to use.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Good for use by teaspoon as you do sugar.

review/text: When we were told my kids were allergic to wheat, we have had to find other alternatives.  This is by far even better than the regular wheat spaghetti. My entire family enjoys the "green" spaghetti, and have had many friends over, who had no idea that it is "rice" spaghetti.  It's not too often that you find alternatives better than what you are used to.  All the Tinkyada pastas are great!

review/summary: This is the one.
review/text: I'm allergic to gluten, and although I can tolerate some now and then, eating it regularly causes all manner of immune system annoyance. When I finally figured this out and laid off the gluten, my physical condition improved immensely.<br /><br />But I'm a total spaghetti maniac. I was raised among Italian families, my nose teased by sauces that brewed all day, and then when dinner came, delighted by superb pasta dishes of many kinds, quite often spaghetti. Getting the news about my gluten allergy was like being slapped across the face. With a brick.<br /><br />So I've been on a search that lasted years, hunting for a gluten-free spaghetti that had the right texture, went well with the same things that regular spaghetti does, and tasted good, if not exactly like the traditional wheat-based spaghetti does.<br /><br />That search, let me tell you, has been a trail of tears. One rice-based product after another deliquesced in the pot, even before it could be served, much less eaten. Those that made it to the plate still looking vaguely like spaghetti inevitably tasted like something pulled from a dumpster. No, really - it's not hyperbole. Wheat based pasta has a unique taste, and trying to replicate both taste and texture appears to be a complete dead end.<br /><br />But Tinkyada has hit a (perhaps "the") sweet spot: They got the texture exactly right (based on cooking time, you can get any kind of pasta-like texture you would expect), and they've created a lovely flavor that, while not that of spaghetti, is *excellent*, and also, very importantly, has gone well with everything I think of as going well with standard pasta: Shrimp, garlic, parmesan, tomato sauces, salt, pepper, clams, sausage, meat or meatballs, olive oil... the whole nine yards, as it were. Wine and salad both contribute just as they do with the real thing. You can feed it to visitors as a specialty pasta, mentioning the spinach rather than the gluten free (unless someone asks, of course), and it goes over quite well.<br /><br />This is the one to try. Initially, when you boil it, stay with it rather than using a timer. Check it regularly so you can take it off the heat and drain it at just the right consistency. At my altitude, at least (approx 2300 feet ASL) it goes through the various stages of stiff, al dente and soft at a faster rate than the regular stuff, so you do need to keep a closer eye on it. Once you're familiar with the correct cooking time for your preferences, just set a timer and you're good to go. It cooks consistently from package to package, so once you get it all figured out, there's nothing to it.<br /><br />My highest complements to Tinkyada. Great job. Thank you so much for a really, really excellent product.<br /><br />Now if someone would just manage to come up with a good bread, or a flour that can be used to make bread, I'd be all set. But that search is still ongoing; after hundreds of flours and finished bread products, I'm still looking.

review/text: If you enjoy brown rice spaghetti, you already know the nutty snap this food brings.  What may surprise you is that the spinach in the pasta adds a hint of flavor that doesn't overwhelm the dish, but complements the flavor of marinara and pesto sauces.  It also brings out the tang of basil, making it a good choice for pasta salads.  Even if you aren't living gluten free, this pasta has a flavor so appealing that you will make it a regular menu item.

review/summary: look up "organic"
review/text: For the purpose of food, "organic" means raised or cultured without the use of pesticides and other chemicals.  It does not mean "raised in a mythical land without pollution" or even "good for you."  Lotus Foods looks to be a California company so my guess is that this was certified organic in the US, not China.  The objections of the other reviewer are silly -- sure, Chinese cities are polluted, and the country has many other problems, but this does not mean every kernel of rice from this vast expanse of geography is inedible.  I have eaten this rice and I love it; it has a great flavor and texture, and it holds together well if you want it to.  Its green color is visually pleasing.  And it is no more inherently unsafe based on being from somewhere in China than a carrot from North Carolina inherently tastes like cigarettes.

review/summary: What China Should know
review/text: It has become a habit for me for some time to step away from edible products that carry the made in China tag. It saddens me since some things are rare and not easily found. This was only the second item I bought this year knowing that it was produced in China, however, even after cooking it I still kept thinking that I had poisoned myself some how. It was a strange feeling that just would not go away, all due to the made in China label. I'm certain that I would not buy this product again even though I really enjoyed cooking with it, since I'm simply far too skeptical of the very polluted soil this rice may have been grown on.<br />How can such a great country have gone so wrong for so long that even buying a wonderful bag of rice can feel like a mistake some how? Reading all the reviews here it seems that I am not the only one debating the products purity. I only wonder how much revenue China is loosing every year because of their bad reputation!<br />My mistrust may not make it to mathematical equations that calculate surpluses every year in China, but if distrust was actually calculated then China's loss of revenue would certainly out number it's profit.<br />Just a thought.

The milk had a slight blueberry flavor upon drinking, but overall this is a terrible cereal.  I'll never grab this off the shelf again, and with so many other options I recommend you steer clear as well.

review/summary: Wonderful for both cooking and for health
review/text: The turmeric arrived much faster than expected, and the quality was far superior than expected.<br /><br />I have used turmeric in my cooking for many years, both for Indian-inspired dishes and also for the coloring effects it adds to certain dishes or components of dishes.<br /><br />A few month ago, my mother got me into taking turmeric for the health benefits.  She was having extreme respiratory issues and problems with severe arthritis.  She had several traditional medical treatments and nothing seemed to be working.  After she did a bunch of research, she found a bunch of information regarding the health benefits of turmeric.  After taking turmeric twice a day for about 8 weeks, she was able to be taken off of oxygen and she no longer has problems with her arthritis.  She is no longer taking any other medications and has no further problems as long as she continues to take her turmeric every day.<br /><br />If you are planning on taking turmeric for the health benefits, I highly recommend you do some research first.  The basics are that you need to take about 1 tsp of turmeric mixed into a liquid that contains a fat (such as whole milk) along with about 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper (the black pepper helps with absorption and the nutrients in the turmeric need the fat because they are fat-soluble and not water-soluble).  Do the research before you begin and don't just take my word for it... there are a lot of very respectable medical institutions currently conducting research on turmeric for treating such things as arthritis, acne, joint pain, pain management, respiratory problems, and even cancer, so you should have no problems finding more information online.<br /><br />I usually just take powdered turmeric in a not-too-revolting mixture recipe that I got from my mother: I mix 1 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric in a 12oz glass of V8 along with 1 tsp of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 Tbs of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic.  (all that's missing is the vodka)<br /><br />The bottom line is that this turmeric powder is not only great quality, but it is also very inexpensive and in a much larger volume than you might expect.  Shipping was also very fast and I will be buying from this seller again in the future.

review/summary: A little counterbalance
review/text: R. Adams said "The weight of the container is stated to be 10 ounces. It's not! The turmeric powder arrived in 8 ounce jars."<br />R. Adams has confused liquid ounces with dry ounces.  A liquid ounce is a measure of volume whereas a dry ounce is a measure of weight.  Thus an 8 ounce jar, which holds 8 liquid ounces, could hold a variety of materials, each with a different weight, depending upon the density of the material in the jar.  Therefore the only way to tell if there is 10 ounces of powder in the jar would be to weigh the powder.  Imagine if you will that an 8 ounce jar could be filled up with rocks or marshmallows. You would not expect these 2 jars to weigh the same.<br />I'm giving this product 5 stars just to counterbalance R. Adams's unfortunate error.

review/summary: Pictured is a 10 oz jar, Received 8 oz.
review/text: I haven't opened the seal on these jars of turmeric just now received, but before I ordered I enlarged the size of the picture so I could see the weight.  The picture shows 10 oz.  With that in mind, I ordered 3 bottles to get the free shipping.  What I got were 3  8 ounce  jars.  I'm feeling cheated right now, especially because the company went out of its way to plaster over the "NET WT 8 OZ"  with a tracking sticker.  No need to disguise the label if there wasn't something to hide!<br /><br />Of course shoppers want to know the weight!!  They don't need a lame description of "Large Jar".  It's not a large bottle but half the size of what I usually buy my spices in.<br /><br />So, Marshalls Creek....you owe money to all those you are cheating.  Don't moan and groan that the picture was not intended to show the weight.  It showed the weight quite clearly, leading people to believe they would get a 10-oz jar.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS SPICE
review/text: I heard spices and herbs were needed for optimal health.  I heard from a nutritionist and doctor that tumeric was extremely healthy.  They were right!!! Tumeric improved my health and it makes my food taste great.  Only a pinch is needed in recipes.  I like to add it to my eggs for  breakfast and dinner rice. It makes a good seasoning for meat such fried chicken and pork chops. I love it unique taste. It was the best priced product of its kind on Amazon that I reviewed.  It is package in large jars so you won't run out since only a little is needed to season food.  This has become my favorite spice.  If customers do a internet search on tumeric they will find that tumeric is extremely healthy for you.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Turmeric well worth the cost
review/text: Since reading about how Turmeric is a great natural preventive for cancer, I began looking high and low for it in food store chains, Costco, Smart and Final and even<br />Trader Joe's.  Here it was at a price like 20 years ago in big clean containers.<br />It is not an intrusive taste at all and goes well on chicken, some fish, loads of<br />veggies and you can also use it on saffron rice to get that DEEP yellow color without having to sprinkle a load of expensive saffron.  This company has a load of other good spice deals as well.

Flavor is strong, but slightly different from the organic turmeric I had on hand, and grittier making it easier to pour out without clumping (silicates?). Very good price - about a third per once of the smaller containers from grocery stores. I use turmeric an almost everything for it's therapeutic effects. I add it to soups, sauces and sprinkle on meats prior to grilling. I even drink in the morning drink with decaf coffee, cocoa powder, ginseng, ginger, and cinnamon.

review/text: These are great snacks. I was looking for healthier alternative to the Welch's fruit snacks.<br />These have fiber in them (3 g. per serving), and less sugar (9g. per serving vs 15g. in Welch's).<br />They also taste great and my son loves them. They are expensive, though. And also, there are a very few pieces of a snack per each bag - maybe five or so. They are just larger than others on the market, and they are gone in seconds. My son immediately wants more, the amount is just not sufficient.<br />I will probably buy them again (for the ingredients), but I wish they were smaller in size and had more in the bag.

Most Kcups leave a bitter after taste, mostly due to the fact that the water is not hot enough.  This coffee is flavorful, as strong as a medium roast yet does not have a bitter taste. I highly recommend this Kcup.

review/text: Given the need to avoid over-stimulation of the heart with increased blood pressure -- too much caffeine and, yet, maintain a great taste, I fortunately discovered the Green Mountain Half-Caff option for K-Cups. My wife loves the strong bold choices with Sumatra and French Roast rather than the wimpy de-caf and half-caff, so we both get our fix on coffee choices.  Bulk coffee orders via Amazon with free shipping is the way to go.  Most of our shopping for household, sport equipment, and technology items are channeled through Amazon... great price options are already taken care of with helpful recommendations.  Downloads for my IPAD and Kindle Fire provides new readings and movies via Amazon that make tedious shopping treks unnecessary.  Thanks.

review/summary: INACCURATE WEIGHT
review/text: First, I happened to be the customer who told Pamela (and Amazon) the declared weight of this product is wrong. It is listed (here on Amazon as well as on Pamela's own website) as .7 ounce each. In fact, each packet, a single cookie, is .2 ounce or slightly more. After lengthy email and phone correspondence they sheepishly admitted the error in weight. You could say this is not worth troubling oneself over, but that's more than three times exaggeration, .7 to .2, so the goal of truth in advertising should have straightened them out. (If you order these cookies and have a postal scale, you can weigh them yourself; you won't find them weighing in at .7 ounce, nor the .43 ounce suggested with their chocolate version.)<br /><br />Second, before I had finished corresponding with the company, I had ordered the Extreme Chocolate version of this cookie product (100 packets of .7 ounce each). I'd tried them previously in the other package they offer, 7 ounces. These individually wrapped cookies are dry/stale, nothing at all like the larger package version. If you do order them, and you have a postal scale, check out the weight for yourself.<br /><br />Try them if you want, but be prepared to ask Amazon for credit. I did.

I have tried all the food at petsmart and any and all wet food for toy dogs.  I like the more holistic dry foods but would have to put some wet food with it and still would "maybe" get him to eat.  He acts like he's afraid and all stressed out when ever it's time to eat.  I remembered a "dirty jobs"  episode about tripe and wondered if the digestive enzymes would help.  I don't know if that's what made the difference or not, he is still slow to start eating but he eats the dry food with a spoonful of this tripe mixed in very well.  I am so , so happy......and my little Cooper seems very pleased as well!!!!!!!

review/text: We like the limited ingredients: beef tripe, water, garlic, carageenan (vegetable gum)<br />and it doesn't smell any different to me than other canned dog foods.<br /><br />We make homemade raw dog food, and this is a great addition to the "batch".<br /><br />If you are interested, here's the recipe/ratios..<br />I don't really measure, I just guestimate the amounts - after you do it long enough, you get a feel for how much is needed of what item.<br />Roughly we try for 75% main protein, 10% organ meats,10% greens, 5% carbohydrates.<br /><br />We use a big stainless steel bowl and mix together<br />3 pounds of raw ground turkey,<br />1 handful of organic mixed greens (salad mix)<br />1 can drained french cut green beans,<br />1/2 can of pumpkin (the plain cooked vegetable, not the seasoned pie mix)<br />Sometimes I use a baked sweet potato instead of the pumpkin.<br />1 raw egg, with shell! - we get good country eggs -<br />1/3 cup alaskan salmon oil (like Grizzly's)<br />1/2 cup cooked brown rice,<br />1/2 cup of PLAIN regular Dannon yogurt. (not sweetened, not lowfat)<br />3/4 can of Tripett Green Beef Tripe<br />about a dozen chicken gizzards, cut in half<br />and<br />1/4 cup liver (beef or chicken)<br /><br />We mix this really well, and dish out messy well-rounded (almost heaping)1/4 cupfuls onto<br />paperplates, then cover with plastic wrap and smoosh it flat, stack the plates<br />and stick them into a big freezer baggie (like the gallon size)- and freeze em!<br />About 6 plates (3 days of dinners) fit into one of the freezer baggies.<br />Just pull out a pack and let them thaw in the fridge when you need them.<br /><br />this makes 16 plates, or 8 days of dinner for each of our two 18 lb dogs.<br /><br />We rotate their diet, also feeding raw beef ribs some days,<br />raw chicken wings some days<br />and Nature's Variety Prairie Kibble or Nature's Variety Instinct Kibble some days.<br /><br />They always get 1/2 of a Stella and Chewy's Raw Dehydrated steak for breakfast every day.<br /><br />Our pups are not overweight, and have no "doggy smell" to their coats,<br />no bad breath AT ALL, they don't fart, have no gum disease,<br />and they have gorgeous white teeth, that don't need to be brushed!<br />and hopefully, (they're about 5 yrs old now)no future arthritis or diabetes.<br /><br />Arthritis results from a diet of corn and wheat, and diabetes results from those<br />icky sugary dog snacks. Read all pet food labels carefully.<br /><br />A good diet is worth everything.<br />We all love our pups so much - we must give extra careful thought to how we feed them.

review/summary: Stinky goodness
review/text: I recently decided to feed raw and after doing research on it, realized I needed to add green tripe to my dog's diet. Tripett seemed to be a convenient option. I feed it to him as a treat after his regular meals, a couple times a week. I use maybe about a jar a week for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />My dog did NOT like this at first. I had to force feed it to him, literally scooping it into his mouth and making him eat it little by little. He kept trying to spit it out, but I was persistent. After a few days of this, he grew to really love it! Now he will happily gobble it up.<br /><br />I haven't noticed whether green tripe specifically has benefitted him, but he's definitely gotten a lot more energy since we switched to raw. I think it definitely helps though!
