review/summary: SPORT BEANS
review/text: These beans are very tasty, and are very effective at giving me an extra boost of energy on my bike rides, and they are a good source of carbs. They are easy to eat, but if you do choose to eat them while exercising, be sure to have some water near by, as they tend to produce a lot of flem, which can be very uncomfortable while exercising.  I really enjoy these beans, and they are a convenient source of carbs and energy.

review/summary: ON THE GO GOODIES
review/text: This product has been available to runners for quite a while. The flavors are just like the Jelly Belly beans, but with a little extra kick and loaded with carbs. Very useful during those long runs when you need those carbs and potassium. Low in calories. Very convenient small packaging for your fanny pack or Fuel belt. Highly recommended and great price to boot!

review/summary: Perfect size and work well
review/text: Ever since I started marathon running I've been searching for a calorie supplement. Ive tried the gels, goos and cubes but was never satisfied. The cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them. The goos and gels are just too dessicating, its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and I need to get something to drink to wash it down.<br /><br />The jelly beans are the best yet. They are smaller making it easier to breath while running. they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good, aways a plus. They provide 100 cals per pouch and contain no caffeine.<br /><br />That said it is not the perfect product. The package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth. Also they should make a variety pack. 24 packs is enough to last me a month and I prefer to buy only one at a time. The same flavor, while good, can get a little boring. They have other flavors, a variety pack should not be too hard to make.<br /><br />Enjoy your exercise!

review/summary: Tart taste
review/text: I have been riding for about 1.5 years  (average 30 - 40 miles - 17-18 mph).  Once I got over 25 miles decided to enhance my liquid replentishment with a solid - purchased these, "GU" gel and "GU" chomps all at the same time so I could try side by side.  All appeared to have helped me from hitting the wall equally, but the gel and chops go down easier.  These beans are smaller - thus need to ingest more/more often to make same impact and are "tarter" and not as easy to swallow.  I bought I case of these so will choke them down, but of the three, I like the chomps better.  Ride safe

review/summary: Easy to Chew and Carry
review/text: Of Chomps, Shot Bloks, and Honey Stingers, these beans are best because they a) don't melt or get messy, and, b) are easiest to chew (no major jaw-action required to get through them).<br /><br />All the flavors I've tried so far are totally fine.<br /><br />I just empty the pack into my pocket or bra or whatever and scoop out the beans as needed while racing. I've tried this with the more gelatinous other varieties of sports candy but those make anywhere from a small mess to a big one, and they tend to clump together. Plus, its too effortful to get your teeth through gummy candy like that. Sports Beans are pretty perfect.

review/summary: Anti-bonking!
review/text: These are great.  They taste good.  Buying the quantity of course comes with the discount.  I think the expiration on them is like a year out.  They are great for energy when out there for an extended period of time.  Of course, I only use them like I use Gatorade, only if I am exercising (biking, running, etc) for 2+ hours.  I like them because it gives me the energy to keep going, but instead of eating something that sits in my stomach and weighs me down, these don't do this, niceeeee.  They are well worth it to me.  With these and Cliff Bars, I can just keep goin.

review/summary: Distance Runner in Love!
review/text: As a marathon runner and lover of long distance, I've found my match. Lemon-lime Jelly Belly Sport Beans are really one of the best electrolyte products. I just stick them in my pocket and without a lot of fuss (or pace change), I can grab them on the go. Many sport nutrition "candies" are nasty tasting - when you're exercising you can somehow gulp it down. But the Jelly Belly Sport Beans are actually good whether exercising or not! Conveniently, they come in a resealable pouch that keeps extra beans fresh and secure when bouncing around.

review/text: I've been living and riding in Florida for 6 years and came across Sport Beans as a great alternative to PowerBars, Gels, Blocks and Gu's a few years or so ago.  They are great.  Not a ton of energy - only 70 - 100 calories per pack, but they restore some electrolytes and they don't make a mess of your pockets or fuel packs.  Sport Beans hold up in the heat of summer and that is a great thing!!

review/summary: These taste awesome, and do the job!
review/text: After trying GU gel (which made me gag), I decided to try these beans. The watermelon flavor was awesome, no fake taste like the gels that I've tried. They go down as easy as regular jellybeans. Do drink with water though to prevent stomach upset (it tells you that on the box). I haven't had any problems with them at all, as long as I drink water. They give me the most energy of any I've tried, plus caffeine -- which I really need before a run (as I don't usually drink my daily coffee before running). I would definitely buy these again!

review/text: These are really tasty, and make a decent snack, but I've found that they aren't that helpful for running. When I'm doing a long run (10+ miles), they are too sweet, and leave my mouth feeling weird. I had also thought I was ordering the version w/ caffeine, but... appears not (mea culpa). Anyway, lastly, don't seem to give my system much of a boost, so... these go into the snack pile, but I'll not be using them for endurance sports.

review/text: I had my reservations about this product when I first saw this product.  But being a big fan of Jelly Belly I had to try them.  I've used this product off and on for two years now.  I has helped me recover from training sessions.  Long runs, cross fit sessions, and field exercises that would have left me dehydrated for the day just become "fond" memories after taking one of these packs.  I do not recommend eating these Jelly Bellies unless your body needs the electrolytes, they taste too sweet and salty.

They are just the right amount to provide an energy boost, whether it be first thing in the morning, mid-afternoon to fight off food-coma (or meeting malaise), or even as a snack before dinner. I first started using them to supplement on the train to or from nighttime grad classes. They're also handy to have on hand between sets, quarters, or whatever your sporting needs might be. Quite tasty, too.

review/summary: Iranian Style?
review/text: I purchased several different saffron's from Amazon and a local store to taste and sample.  This was of interest because it stated it was Iranian.  Having read that Iranian saffron was of the best in the world I was intrigued.  However, when received the label stated "Iranian Style". This was disconcerting. This is quoted from the product description:  "You will get about 500 saffron threads with this one gram purchase. We are known throughout Florida and the USA to have some of the finest quality Iranian saffron around! Since it is illegal to import saffron from Iran to America we have worked hard to source some of the finest Iranian style saffron from the nutrient dense lands of New Zealand, France & Greece."  Unfortunately I had not read this prior to ordering.  If it is not Iranian, why say it is?  Or at a minimum be consistent in the representations.<br /><br />To be fair I would say that it is good saffron, at least based on my limited saffron expertise, and compares favorably to the others I had ordered.  I am cooking with it and also taking it as a supplement having read of the clinical study proving saffron's efficacy in treating depression compares favorably to a leading pharmaceutical.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a feeling of unease about the transaction which I thought to share.

review/summary: Delightful Drink
review/text: .<br /><br />I have been searching for the perfect coffee for my taste and I selected a strong dark roast  Guatemalan coffee. I liked it so much that I stopped searching. Then a friend mentioned that, although he liked my selection, his wife would not drink it. I thought about that warning until my brother came to visit and didn't like my coffee. That, and the fact that no one else in my house would drink my selection, led me to question my choice.  Since I like to share my coffee, I decided to resume my search.<br /><br />After testing more than ten coffees I decided I liked Boyers French Roast and  Italian Roast the best (as stated in my review, Italian Roast is easy on the digestive system).  Both the French and Italian are dark roasts, so I thought maybe I should try another lighter roast coffee.  .<br /><br />I am now trying Boyers Kona Blend. I had avoided Kona coffees for awhile because they tend to be too sweet and too expensive. Real Kona comes from Hawaii, and is noted for its sweet pleasant taste. Boyers advertises that their "Kona blend is a medium to full bodied coffee with delicate sweet undertones." That sounds tempting.<br /><br />The original Kona coffee is arabica coffee grown on the Big Island of Hawaii. Kona has a very favorable reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and most desired coffees in the world. The best pure 100 percent Kona is often priced between thirty and fifty dollars a pound. That, of course, puts it out of my price range. Boyers Kona Blend is probably only ten percent Kona. Ten percent may be enough to enhance the taste for my friends and relatives.<br /><br />I have now tried several pots of Kona Blend. Kona is good coffee that is not weak or too mellow. Kona is smooth and has a gentle coffee flavor that teases the palate slightly  without becoming overwhelming.  Boyers Kona Blend is a pleasing drink, but is not as exciting as I expected  Kona would be.  Maybe I need to try a blend with a greater percent of Kona (maybe 20 or thirty percent).  I do, however,  like this coffee enough to share it with my friends and relatives.<br /><br />I will continue my search for a better Kona, but I feel safe to say that I recommend Boyers Kona Blend coffee.

review/text: This Arnold Palmer drink is delicious. It already has sugar in the mix so it is ready to drink as soon as it flows out of the Keurig. Fill your cup with ice, pop in the k-cup, press the cup-size button, let it finish and enjoy a delicious drink! My husband also liked the drink. He doesn't drink much other than coffee but I made him taste it and he was surprised it was so good.

review/summary: Good Iced Tea
review/text: If you like iced tea and lemonade mix then you need to try these K-cups!  They are not to sweet like some of the iced tea K-cups.  I use about 6-7 oz water and then fill my cup 1/2 full of ice when brewing.  I have a 2 qt pitcher I fill 1/2 with ice and I make 3 K-cups in a row and have a pitcher of ice tea ready in less then 10 minutes.

review/text: I tried this because I've always been a fan of Half and Half. I will say that my taste buds love this product and I hope it stays available for a long time. I have made this for nearly a dozen friends, and every one of them asked for a second glass full. I have found that a pint size glass full of ice and the 6oz cup size setting on the brewer tastes the best, and you end up with a full glass of ice cold Half and Half.

review/summary: I love 'Arnold Palmers'!
review/text: When I don't want an alcoholic drink when eating out I always order an Arnold Palmer which is half tea and half lemonade over ice (and not all bartenders make them the same way). So I thought I'd give this a try at home instead of make pitchers of iced tea and lemonade; this beverage is a real 'hole in one' (sorry for the pun, couldn't help myself!).  I just brew it over ice on the smallest beverage setting of my kuerig.

review/summary: Hmmm Good
review/text: I was a little reluctant to try this half/half combination because I'm not a big fan of lemonade.  Celestial Seasonings has found the right balance between iced tea and lemonade, aka Arnold Palmer.  I've even started to ordering this beverage at restaurants that serve both.  But it's so convenient to have the K-Cups so I don't have to make two different beverages and try to combine them in the right proportions.

review/summary: Favorite Non-Coffee Drink for Keurig!
review/text: The Celestial Seasonings Half Tea/Half Lemonade K-Cups make the perfect, refreshing summer iced beverage!  I had never really tried using my Keurig to make anything other than coffee or hot chocolate, so when I got a chance to try a sample of these K-Cups as a BzzAgent, I wasn't sure what to expect.  This product makes a delicious drink - just fill a cup about 3/4 full of ice and brew these K-Cups on the 6-ounce setting, and you get a yummy iced half-and-half beverage to cool you off.  The taste is lightly sweet (not as sweet as sweet tea) and lightly lemon-y, it's a really nice combination!

review/summary: Love Arnold Palmer iced tea/lemonade and these taste great!
review/text: I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough.  My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.

review/text: A really good product according to my MIL, she is using it as a flavoring in most dishes. However, be careful, do not add salt as usual to your dish while cooking when using this product, otherwise your dish will be salty.<br /><br />I wish I could say such nice things about Otto's Hungarian Import Store & Deli too. After I posted my bad review of their lack of customer service and that I had to get my money back through my credit card company because they refused to give me credit for the spoiled items they shipped to me, they sent me numerous threatening e-mails and they even threatened to "pay me back" by posting bad things about my company on various message boards! (They never have done business with my company.) The situation got so bad I eventually had to have their e-mail address blocked on my server. Just a fair warning to those who are thinking of ordering from Otto's Hungarian Import Store & Deli.

review/summary: It works, and it's cheaper than that other brand
review/text: I can't understand why that 'highly advertised' brand of energy drink in the little bottles costs as much as it does.  Yet, people still buy it.  I tried it and a few times with mixed results.  I prefer Stacker 6 Hour Power because it works and it's considerably less expensive.  For me the energy does not come on suddenly.  Instead, I find that it gives me a steady stream of energy (mental & physical).  My mind is clear & sharp and my middle-aged body has more zip.  Before I know it, I've gotten a lot of things done!  I don't drink this stuff every day.  I only use it when I have a lot of things to do and I need a little extra help.  The effect lasts around 5 or 6 hours.  The taste is okay.  It's certainly not a bad taste.  As long as the price remains stable, I will continue to be a consumer of this product.

review/summary: This cake mix is OK.  Note the serving size.
review/text: I purchased this gluten free cake mix with the hope that it would be just as good as the cakes I have been missing since going gluten free about 18 months ago.  Well, yes and no was the response I got from my family and my own impression after I baked it this weekend.  The cake does have a lemon flavor, but it seemed a bit dry for all of our tastes.  Maybe this was because I made cupcakes rather than a cake.  The mix only makes one 8" cake, not two cakes like most traditional mixes.  I was able to salvage the dryness by making a lemon buttercream frosting as suggested on the packaging.  I wish the package came with a recipe.  I had to look it up on my own.  In the future I will probably make a cake from scratch and continue to add the lemon buttercream frosting for some extra lemony-great taste.

review/text: These were purchased as a gift for an avid Gummy Bear fan. Knowing they'd go quickly through the little bags you find at the store, I felt this large 6lb bag would serve as a funny gag gift and yet still be very useful, and I was right! This was a hit.<br /><br />Like others have noted in their reviews, these bears seem to have a nicer flavor than some you find at the store or elsewhere online. I found myself grabbing handful after handful, and I normally don't eat gummy products.<br /><br />The bag is resealable and fairly durable, so it will last awhile. Make sure you've actually sealed the bag proper and you haven't missed a corner, and make sure to get the air out before sealing, this will keep the product fresh for awhile. You could also dump them into ziplock baggies.<br /><br />For the price you'll be hard-pressed to find better tasting bears, in this quantity.

review/text: Great flavor, not to firm not to soft, high quality gummies. If you are a person who is picky about what kind of candy you like to enjoy like i am. These little jewels of chewy, fruity, awesomeness are for you! With the zip-lock bag so you can take a handful or two at a time it allows you to eat them at your own pace, i expect to have these for my own personal stash for quite awhile.

review/text: If you liked Tazo Black Iced Tea in the past - you may not like it anymore.  My wife and I have been buying Tazo's Black Iced Tea for several years.  It was the best iced tea we ever found, and we enjoyed it immensely.  Recently we ordered two more boxes from Starbuck's through Amazon.  When we brewed the first bag, something wasn't right.  The taste was bland, not at all like every other time we had it.  We tried a second bag, and it was bland as well.  VERY disappointing.  My wife Googled and found on another web site that Tazo changed the formulation of its Black Iced Tea.  It is a flop in our opinion.

Directions are on the box and are easy enough.  I used a powder lemonade to make a pitcher of lemonade and then mix the two as I want a drink.  Equal amounts of each.  When I want it to be a little sweeter, I simply add some agave nectar and it is absolutely perfect for me.  I'll be buying this box of tea regularly.<br /><br />Update:  Now my favorite way to drink this is as 1 gallon passion fruit tea with 1/4 cup agave, which I also bought on Amazon at a great price!

review/summary: Starbucks lost a loyal customer
review/text: Since the formula change, this tea is nothing special.  For many years, I have been addicted to Starbucks Black Iced Tea.  I live in a little town in the midwest that doesn't even have a Starbucks, but I have a gold Starbucks card.  I would check every route when travelling to plan stops for this iced tea.  I have purchased the quart sized bags from Starbucks and Target when available and ordered the gallon bags when that was my only option to brew this tea daily.  I started noticing a change when I was in South Carolina in March, 2012.  I thought maybe southerners just have a different tea preference.  I then noticed it in Nashville over the summer.  Since I spend time regularly in Nashville, I knew a change was on the way.  The tea has lost its crispness and citrus finish.  It seems Starbucks has purchased Tazo from Steven Smith and decided to change it.  I hate to think it was to make more money with a cheaper blend, but I haven't been able to find another reason.  Given the fact that I was paying over $3.00 per Trenta, I can't imagine the mark up was unfair to them no matter what the cost of the original tea.  By buying Tazo, Starbucks cut out the middle man to make way for more profits, then made major change.  Couldn't it just have started its own tea brand?  It has lost a loyal customer in me (and many transfers from my bank account to the Starbucks card).  If you are loyal to taste rather than brand, start your search for a new tea.  I have started my search with the former owner of Tazo who has opened a new business.  Maybe the old formula will come back before we find something we like better.

review/summary: I'm a Starbucks Passion Iced Tea addict...and finally found my fix.
review/text: There are some products that make our lives better, and some that make us happy, and this does both for me. It's on my list of things that make me happy. Seriously.<br /><br />I love Passion iced tea at Starbucks. I always get it unsweetened with ice.<br /><br />I had one of those moments (after handing nearly five dollars to the barista for just one glass of this stuff) and I thought, "You know, if I could have a bunch of this at home, I'd up my water intake, and I bet my kids would love it."<br /><br />And I was right. I drink it and so does my husband three kids. Its refreshing, a little tart, and just a nice break from water. No sugar, no additives, and that makes it feel healthy.<br /><br />I started with the regular sized bags and found 6 bags per gallon works. I boiled a half gallon of water, let it steep, then added extra water in the pitcher until it hit the gallon mark.<br /><br />I bought a new gallon pitcher here at amazon to cut down the amount of times I made tea, and when I found the gallon sized iced tea bags were available, I was thrilled. One bag per gallon is perfect for us. I know there are those out there who want it stronger and tarter, but I have two reasons. One, it saves money by using less and honestly, if I let it steep for a long time--- leaving the bag in the pot for an hour or two until it cools--- it's plenty strong.<br /><br />It's a big hit with guests, too. People are so pleasantly surprised when I offer them a cold glass of passion tea.

review/summary: Good thing this tea tastes great, otherwise...
review/text: Tazo Black Iced Tea is fantastic. Always has been. It is a brilliant blend of black tea and citrus that is simply beguiling. I drink a lot of tea. I am always struck by how refreshing and complex the flavor notes are, especially when I haven't had it in a while. The citrus notes are quite subtle on the tongue, but much more present in the aroma. It serves to highlight the black tea in much the same way that coffee brings out the flavor of chocolate-you don't really taste the coffee, but the chocolate is more pronounced and accessible. Very pleasant and delicious.<br /><br />I wish I had such praise for Starbucks the company. Dealing with Starbucks in ANY capacity other than in one of the ubiquitous coffee-stores is irritating and unpleasant. Starbucks Store, the online retailer of Tazo, is especially egregious. Like ALL Starbucks products, Tazo teas are considerably expensive, almost to the point of price-gouging. To order the large filter-bags in the past was to recieve a resealable, coated bag to keep the tea fresh. Then when the Starbucks "Store" was created, they quickly ditched the resealable-bags for a crude cardboard box, with a gaping hole for commercial use that can not be resealed, with the unwrapped tea packed in helter-skelter. Moreover, they shipped the whole package in boxes literally big enough to fit a computer, filled with Earth-friendly styrofoam peanuts. Not only does the majority of their coffee benifit large corporations that rob the growers and harvesters of fair-trade, but their shipping practices are out of the Stone Age and, true to form, expensive. Stryrofoam is non-biodegradable and no cheaper than other, greener products, and those big shipping-containers take up unnecessary space on cargo-planes resulting in lost efficiency and increased use of diesel fuel.<br /><br />Now, as if Starbucks wasn't making enough money off their overpriced-products, they have the audacity to short their 24-count Tazo Black Iced Tea by four filter-bags. Now 20 bags for the old price of 24 bags. Nice work if you can get it, I guess. They know that people love their products and will pay for the convenience with which they are offered. But their arrogance is systemic in many of their policies, and certainly no more apparent than dealings with customer service. God help you if you have a problem with shipping or product. I was treated with rudeness and indifference both verbally and with the resolution of my issue. It's like I said, it is a good thing this tea is so good.

review/text: We LOVE Starbucks' Tazo passion iced tea, and having a pitcher of it at home in the fridge is terrific. They have directions on the side of the box, which is helpful, but I like to steep it a little longer than the directions say (7-10 minutes instead of 5). I add 1/3 cup splenda/sugar blend to the pitcher and it's just as good as getting it at Starbucks--my husband says it's even better. The directions also say to leave it out and then throw it out at the end of the day but once it cools to room temperature we stick it in the fridge and enjoy it all week.

review/summary: Iced Tea for Iced Tea Connoisseurs
review/text: A friend sent me two boxes of this tea two years ago for my birthday (and that now qualifies him as a really good friend), and since then I can't bring myself to make anything else. I make a large bottle of sun tea once a week with the exception of winter. This tea completely spoiled me for any other iced tea. Living in Texas, liquid refreshment is a necessity in the summer. The problem is finding a drink that's satisfying and not sugar-laden. The choices are limited to diet drinks (which I don't drink), water (which is nice, but you yearn for something with taste), and iced tea (the Texas kind, unsweetened). And because of the heat, we drink a lot of tea in my house. I've tried all kinds of teas including those "specially blended for iced tea" and froo-froo specialty teas they don't hold a candle to Tazo iced tea. Why? It has a distinctive rich and full tea taste...and I'm sorry but sweet tea covers true tea flavor. It's a shame that this is the only way you can buy it, but it beats not being able to buy it at all. Have an iced tea fanatic at your house? This will be their new "crack tea"....I know it's mine.

review/summary: Not as good as their old blend, but it's still decent
review/text: Like every other Tazo iced tea lover, I was heartbroken when I read they changed the blend of their iced black tea. I had 6 of the old bags left and rationed them as long as I could. I broke down and bought a 3-pack of the new blend. The first batch was disappointing--it was a weak pitcher of iced tea that lacked color and taste. I didn't think I'd be able to drink another pitcher, let alone 3 full boxes of tea. But then I started adding 3 Irish Breakfast tea bags to the water, and I let the pitcher sit in the fridge overnight before drinking. Finally I've made a decent pitcher of tea with this new blend. It's dark and full-bodied and not half bad. I've got one bag of their old blend left and am going to try to concoct my own blend to match.<br /><br />If you like sweet tea, try taking 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, mix with enough water to cover the sugar, then microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. Pour into the pitcher and stir, then let sit overnight. It's a delicious guilty pleasure.

review/summary: Never Received Product- Starbucks Poor Customer Service!
review/text: After enjoying Passion Iced Tea at Starbucks brick and mortar stores, I was excited to make some at home with the filter bags. I would have never ordered it if I knew that it would cost me not only $27 but hours of dealing with customer service with no resolution, no filter bags, and no refund.<br /><br />In short:<br />At the end of the day, only purchase from companies you can trust. Starbucks is no longer in my list of go to trust-worthy companies. I now purchase Mighty Leaf Teas instead.<br /><br />The full story:<br />I purchased two starbucks products the Passion Iced Tea Filter bags (PITFB)and Earl Grey Tea Bags. I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.<br />We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.<br />After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.<br />Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of your<br />order."<br /><br />When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their "counts matched", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.<br /><br />I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.<br /><br />Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing. I expected more from a company that is praised for its customer-centric attitude when in reality Starbucks neither offered to replace the unreceived merchandise nor refund the cost of the PITFB.<br /><br />I have attempted to obtain a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Program on June 16. As of 09-02-11 and several inquiries to Amazon, I still have not received a credit to my Amazon account nor a refund to my credit card.<br /><br />This has been my worst Amazon experience to date.

review/summary: I carry it with me daily
review/text: If you're into perilously spicy food, you will appreciate naga jolokia powder. I've started sprinkling it very lightly on a salad to add some "pop" to the flavor of the dressing.  In contrast to habanero this powder has less identifiable flavor of its own and more consistent strong heat for very little volume of powder. The container is well sealed so you can keep it handy and not worry about spilling it or getting it on hands.  Great product and packaging.<br />Beware.<br />IT IS VERY HOT.

review/summary: Great gluten free pasta
review/text: This brand was carried by my local supermarket until just recently.  Now, it is no longer on the shelves and is replaced by another brand.  Big disappointment.  Thank goodness I purchased the last few boxes when it appeared as though they were going to stop carrying it.  I shall be purchasing it though Amazon in the future as I do other gluten free products that Amazon carries.  Well, now to Lundberg's pasta.  It is great.  I have tried other brands but none ever were as palatable as this brand.  Not hard and "dry" like so many others.  I recommend it.

review/summary: My Favorite Cereal
review/text: I've eaten a bowl of this cereal each morning for 10 or more years.  I used to buy it at a food co-op near where I used to live and would still buy it there when I visited.  However, their supply became erratic, and I found the cereal at Amazon.  I've ordered it from Amazon four or five times now, and it's always at my doorstep within a day or two.  Arrowhead Mills Shredded Wheat is a simple, nutritious, flavorful cereal.  It is a natural grain (wheat) product without lots of sweeteners and has been consistent in flavor and quality over the many years I have eaten it.
