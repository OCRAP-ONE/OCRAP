review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

review/summary: Been drinking it for YEARS!!!!!
review/text: This blend use to be called Henry's Blend.  I've been drinking it for year (about 15).  It is a very good blend, not too sharp, but not waterered down either.  I use to be the only coffee drinker in the family until I started using Seattle's Best Henry's blend (now #4).  My husband never drank coffee and never liked the taste until he tried Henry's.  To this day, its the only coffee he likes.  Same with my 2 adult children.  It has to be Seattle's Best or nothing.  I know Starbucks owns Seattle's best now, but they have NOTHING to compare that is as good as Level #4 (aka Henry's Blend).  If ya want a good cup of coffee anytime of day, this is the coffee for you.  I am dissapointed its becoming harder to find in the stores.  Since Boarders is closing the Seattle's Best Coffee shops in Boarders are gone.  The Grocery stores are carrying less and less Seattle's Best.  I have a very hard time finding whole bean at all in the 4th largest city in the US.  Sad.  I hope to be able to find it online soon.  I'm running low.......

review/text: This is great rice! I primarily use a rice cooker for all my rice-making needs, while my roomates use pots. We tend to share all of our food, including rice, and this is popular with everyone. It also happens to be the kind of rice that Ghanaians use to cook (I'm Nigerian but we rarely use long grain) and so it is doubly popular in my household.<br />Very fragrant, very distinct scent when finished cooking.<br />This bag lasted me over three months!

review/summary: Magical Ancient Grecian Formula Really Works!
review/text: This is like having a magic wand in the kitchen for a busy person who doesn't want to succumb to the seductive wiles of fast food or take out.  All you need is a package of chicken, a skillet and this seasoning and you have an amazingly simple and delicious meal in less time than it takes to order a pizza or go to a drive-thru.<br /><br />Add some rice (20 minutes inactive while you are cooking the chicken) and a zucchini or some other favorite veggie and your meal is square to boot.<br /><br />I cut chicken into 2" to 3" chunks, toss in a bowl (with the veggies sliced to bite-sized pieces) and sprinkle liberally with this seasoning.<br /><br />Heat a couple tablespoons of your favorite oil in a skillet or pot and dump everything in.  Cook on medium-high heat for about ten or 15 minutes (until chicken is cooked through) stirring occasionally to keep browning on all sides of meat.<br /><br />I like to serve this over couscous (5 minutes to prepare instant couscous--my secret is to use canned chicken broth in place of water).<br /><br />It's also great with pita bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, or just on it's own.<br /><br />That's emergency recipe number one and it is so good you will want to make it all the time.<br />I get requests for it weekly.  Even the EXTREMELY finicky 3-year-old loves it!<br /><br />This stuff is also AMAZING sprinkled on veggies of any kind.  My favorite is zucchini spears lightly coated with olive oil and sprinkled in the seasoning, then grilled on the gas grill.<br /><br />It is also really great on lamb and pork!  For about US $3 a jar, you can't go wrong giving it a try!  I'll bet you find something that it goes perfect on, and when you do, come reply and let me know so I can try it!<br /><br />My review is connected to a bulk 12-pack for about thirty bucks, but individual jars (actually cardboard tube shakers) can be found at Safeway Stores and WalMart for under $3 at the time of this review.

review/text: My son-in-law first introduced us to Cavender's Greek Seasoning a few years ago. We started by adding it to shrimp and steaks but quickly found so many more things we enjoy it on as well. Grilled vegetables, hamburgers, baked french fries are just some of the foods this seasoning goes great on. Not overly salty or peppery, it's a hard to describe taste. Just that it seems to make any food that it's added to even more flavorful!

It's like a bit of garlic salt and seasoning salt all rolled into one product, but it is unique and tasty.  You can use a little but I use a lot, and it is never overpowering.  It adds a hint of flavor without disguising everything, and yet it is not too salty - it is now my favorite spice and I use it on almost every meat and veggie I cook.  Yes, it has MSG.  But I don't care!  It's delish!

review/summary: No longer 100% Vitamins & Minerals
review/text: I would normally not have given Multi-Grain Cheerios just 3-stars. But General Mills recently changed the ingredients so that it's no longer fortified with 100% vitamins and minerals (might be sweeter, too). Someone wrote on the internet that they called General Mills, and their reason was simply that they wanted it "to be more like regular Cheerios" as if people were somehow confused between the two. The real reason was probably "to save money." There was also no notice of a change on the box except for the nutrition panel, so, I'm writing this FYI.

review/summary: very good although still not the healthiest
review/text: MultiGrain Cheerios is a wonderful cereal for breakfast or really just about any other time of the day! Although it's probably not quite as healthy as General Mills would like you to believe, it's really not bad for you, either. In a 1 cup serving, it contains very little fat, no cholesterol and it has some fiber in it, too. It also has 100% of the daily recommended amounts of things like iron, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12. It does fall short on other things including Vitamins A (10% of recommended daily intake) and C (25% of recommended daily intake). You can click on the "nutrition facts" link above to find out more about what this cereal contains. Please note that this cereal does contain 6 grams of sugar per 1 cup serving, so if you need to watch your sugar intake very carefully you may want to find another breakfast cereal.<br /><br />On top of what it gives you health wise, it tastes delicious without being overly sugary; and I like that. A 1 cup serving also gives you 10% of the recommended daily intake of fiber and I think that must come from the whole grain ingredients of this cereal. In addition, it's kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't have to watch your sugar and you're getting a good diet with vitamins and fiber in it already, this is a very good cereal. It's not the very healthiest but it's far from junk food and it tastes great! I recommend it.

review/text: While Honey Nut Cheerios are my favorite, this multigrain variety is also very tasty. These are not the healthiest of the multigrain cereals out there, but they're not terrible for you either. They are a very nice middle ground between a sugary "kids" cereal and a true whole grain cereal. They have a light, sweet glaze, and the delicious crunch typical of Cheerios. Also like all Cheerios they're beloved by toddlers and make as good a snack as they do a breakfast meal. They go really well with half a banana sliced over the top.

It was a GREAT price compared to buying it in the grocery store and I love it and eat it every morning.  After receiving the items for a couple of months, the other day, without ANY reason given me for it happening, I was informed by Amazon that I won't be getting the product any longer.  It was bad enough that it was happening; however, the worst part was Amazon couldn't even give me a reason for it - something I think they should have absolutely done!!

review/text: I love cheerio's multi grain.  Even tho is has that sweet coating.<br /><br />Taste is far better than straight cheerios, but I do mix them.<br /><br />Why, oh why, does General Mills think that corn should be one of the grains, is beyond me.  There are far too many corn based foods in the American diet, they could have left that one out.<br /><br />Otherwise, excellent.  No corn, more of the other grains.  How about flax ?<br /><br />Ingredients label:  Whole Grain Corn, Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, Whole Grain Barley, Whole Grain Wheat, Whole Grain Rice, Corn Starch, Brown Sugar Syrup, Corn Bran Salt,<br /><br />Corn is FIRST, CORN starch, CORN bran salt.  Three corn based products in the first nine ingredients.<br /><br />General Mills used to have a cereal that was like Rice Crispies:  Triple-something.  I LOVED it.  I'm sure it didn't meet their sales goals, but truly they didn't give it time.  It too was corn, wheat and rice.<br /><br />Lets leave corn for bio-fuels and get lots of it out of our diets.  I truly love corn-on-the-cob; I love sweet corn;  I love corn pudding, but it doesn't need to be in our cereal supply so much.  General Mills?  Make corn the LAST of the multi grains....I bet it would work.

review/summary: Product good Packaging may not be.
review/text: I was really happy when I found this deal on Amazon!  Great price for my Cheerios!  However, I did see the note about the packaging may contain more and different information... I figured how bad can that be...<br /><br />When I opened my first box this morning, the first thing I noticed was the package inside was short. I didn't care too much until I poured the Cheerios into the bowl.  When I stopped pouring and stood the box back up a bunch of Cheerios slid down the inside of the box between the packing and the box!<br /><br />So to avoid wasting some Cheerios each morning I'll need to tell everyone in the family to lift the bag up above the box top before you pour your cereal in the morning (which probably won't happen much).<br /><br />The bottom line is these are so cheep because they are factory rejects.  The interior or exterior packaging may not be up to standard.  I would hope that they would all (at least) be sealed, but I'm sure you could get a little more or a little less cereal than what's printed on the box (hence the disclaimer on the page).<br /><br />So as long as you understand what your signing up for then this is a great deal.  My Cheerios tasted real good!

A few days later, the box arrived and I was amazed at the bigger boxes than the standard cereal boxes that you can generally find in the grocery stores. The taste of the multigrain cheerios is a bit more on the nutty side if you are used to regular cheerios. There is none of the sweetness that the honey nut version has however, the multigrain should be healthier than the other cheerios. Overall a good purchase.

review/summary: About the lowest 'sweetened' cereal you can find
review/text: I can't stand artificial sweeteners.  While this cereal has sugar, it is lower than most sweetened cereals.  I find that if I buy cereals that aren't sweetened, I tend to lose control of how much sugar I put on it.  It does taste very good... think plain cheerios with a touch of sweetness.

review/summary: Light calming no-caffeine comfort tea
review/text: Sometimes you want a decaffeinated or no-caffeine hot drink, and this fits the bill. This isn't really a tea, but it tastes great nonetheless. It's got a light brew that's smooth. The mint and chocolate flavors are very slight; the aftertaste is more minty than the actual sip. This probably won't satisfy a chocolate craving - but it does have a delectable chocolate aroma. I had never tried rooibos tea before this blend, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The brew is sweet & a bit nutty, and is complemented well by the chocolate. A nice change from traditional teas. This brew is *very light* so those of you who are looking for strong mint or chocolate look elsewhere. For those who want a hot smooth non-caffeinated drink, try this out. And if you don't like it, please send the rest to me. ;)

Personally I'm not a tea drinker, but after tasting this I would say I've changed, and it's perfect if you're looking for a no-caffeine hot drink. The after taste has more of a minty flavor, but you still get a real taste of chocolate. It's not too sweet and not too chocolatey, but the ideal balance blend.

Add some hot soy milk or milk and you have a great beverage that will tame your mid-morning or afternoon sweet tooth.  It's not really chocolatey or minty, but a nice rounded flavor.  No licorice, so there's no weird aftertaste.  The discount for the pack of three is economical, too!  One for house, office and pantry.

Pricey for herbal tea, yes (but cheaper than their website or the store), but it really helps calm my sweet tooth and was very soothing to drink, so for me it's worth it.

review/summary: Incredible white chocolate bar
review/text: Unlike the other reviewers, I loved this bar.  Very well balanced in terms of sweetness, lemon and pink peppercorn - nothing overwhelmed, and sweet but not too sweet.  Pink peppercorns are NOT peppery, but have an unusual flower-like taste.  I often use them when I bake simple shortbread cookies.  I think that this is the best white chocolate bar that I have ever tasted, but the Amazon price is on the high side.

review/summary: Hindered by the peppercorn
review/text: The white chocolate is really delicious. It's not too sweet like most white chocolate. It's buttery, dreamy... Just heaven really. I loved the lemon zest too. It wasn't sour but gave a nice little essence like an implied "zing" that was different but unoffensive and made the smell of the bar just delightful. The peppercorn felt like a party crasher. They're pretty little pink pearls, but they're still pepper. It's like meeting someone beautiful with a mean personality. It didn't compliment anything and instead clashed with the other tastes. They're sprinkled throughout the bar. You won't get one in every nibble, and in those cases that subtle pepper taste is tolerable. However you will get whole peppercorns and it's kind of overpowering. As delicious as the first two components of the bar are, I'm not sure I'd buy another one. I know the aim of this company is to be a little different but pepper coupled with white chocolate just wasn't the way to go.

review/summary: Magnificent Matcha!
review/text: I am a new tea drinker and I am certainly new to the world of Matcha tea. But oh, what a wonderful world it is! After reading all the rave reviews for Red Leaf Tea's amazing flavor assortment of Matcha teas on Steepster, I took the plunge and ordered their "2 in 1" Custom Matcha Tea. I chose Caramel and Madagascar Vanilla for my flavors and I am so glad I did! I am not sure I can adequately describe how much I love this tea and these flavors.<br /> I had been a little apprehensive prior to ordering mainly because I had never heard of it before and it was so green. Even after it arrived, I didn't dive right into it. After a couple days I decided to make some and see what all the hype was about. One taste and I am hooked. The flavor is amazing! I had it hot and then I made some cold. They were both awesome! I mixed up a tumbler full for my daughter for her morning tea at work and she absolutely loved it. She said she thought it would also taste great in cupcakes and I agree! Now my wheels are turning about all the awesome ways I can incorporate this flavorful Matcha into recipes. On Red Leaf Tea's website they have some delicious recipes for smoothies, frappes etc that I can not wait to try. I love that there are so many possibilities of ways to use this tea besides drinking it (which is awesome in itself!).<br />I have been trying to diet but have a bit of a sweet tooth. Drinking this Caramel & Madagascar Vanilla was like having a dessert. I was totally satisfied. With a bit of sweetener added to these already uniquely superb flavors, this was like drinking a high calorie fattening dessert but was actually guilt free and healthy.<br />Finally, I definitely need to comment on the amount of energy I feel after drinking this tea. It is a really good energy not like a coffee or sugar rush. My whole transition from coffee and soft drinks to tea was to reap the vast health benefits associated with tea. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the various and significant health benefits of Matcha tea. Besides the antioxidants & cancer fighting properties, it also aids in weight loss and mood enhancement!<br />Great taste, health benefits and lots of ways to use it. It doesn't get better than that!<br />I highly recommend this brand of Matcha tea.

review/summary: This is the mystery "plum sauce" used in Peking Duck
review/text: For years I wondered what the sauce was that is served with the traditional Peking Duck meals as restaurants, since it was the definitely the star ingredient in the dish. At every restaurant I have ever ordered Peking Duck at, they described the sauce as "plum sauce". However when you buy plum sauce, you find it has a very different taste than the sauce used in the meal. So I was never able to put together what it was that was served with Peking Duck. Finally one day I was making a different dish at home that called for Hoisin sauce, which I had never used before. After tasting it, I was thrilled to find that this was that mystery sauce used in Peking Duck. So now I can enjoy my favorite meal at home any time, since I just substitute the duck in the dish with chicken.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the sauce, it's a sweet Asian barbecue sauce. It's not even the least bit spicy.<br />This is the ingredients list:<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup, Soybean Paste (Fermented Soybeans, Salt, Wheat, and Water) Molasses, Pumpkin Puree, Red Wine Vinegar, Water, Wheat Flour, Modified Corn Starch, Salt, Hydrolyzed Soy, Corn, Wheat protein, Garlic Powder, Caramel Color, Sesame Seed Oil, Spices, Xanthan Gum, Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, FD&C Red No. 40, Sodium Benzoate as a Preservative.

review/summary: Walters Bay Tea is pure AWESOME
review/text: I have tried every flavored tea known to mankind that I have access to and by far Walters Bay is the best for flavor AND for value.  Raspberry, Mango, Peach, and Plain iced are all wonderful and 1 pouch will brew 2.5 gallons of tea.  2.5 GALLONS!  I bought the flavor sampler from them and each version yielded the same result.  Yes its a dark brew but so what...for me that translates into my tea dollar stretching much farther than ANY of their competition.  I am not a tea snob by any means and ONLY drink iced versions. Period. So it may be that for the tea snob inclined the flavor, body, bouquet, balance, yadda yadda may disagree with you and if so, so be it. For me, Walters Bay is a perfect and very economical replacement for Paradise Tropical, China Mist, and all other flavored variants.  And for the tea snobs out their, Walters Bay Tea has won multiple awards details of which can be found at their website.

review/text: I have been purchasing Splenda for my mother and myself for over 5 years. I think it is great and so similar to sugar. I know it is ctiticized, but since I understand the workings of "competition" this does not sway me. They already have over 60% of the market from what I know and I understand why!I am sure none of these types of sweetener are good for you (but then is sugar?), but not all of use can get used to drinks which are non-sweetened, so ... Splenda is definitely better than saccharin and probably less dangerous. Time will tell.

review/text: I have read a ton of reviews on the Atkins All Purpose Bake mix...although as of today all I have made with it are pancakes I gotta say, it's good!  I know most people are saying otherwise, maybe I'm just weird or perhaps they have changed it over the years.  It does have a strong 'soy' taste to it 'raw,' however I found that once the pancakes were done it was pleasant and "better than regular pancakes" as my husband stated.  My almost 3yr old also enjoyed them as well without batting an eye.  I think it is worth giving it a try and then evaluate for yourself, you never know till you try it how you'll feel about it!  I hope to try other bake mixes as well, I'm sure they all have there strengths and weaknesses.

review/summary: Best Mix Ever
review/text: The Atkins Bake Mix is the best.  By using your imagination you can use the batter to make different things. By thinning the batter and cooking two pancakes the size of bread is a great way to make your favorite sandwich. Great for snacks by taking leftover pancakes, cut them like chips, deep fry, drain and sprinkle with ranch dressing mix. Use the batter to make hot dogs on a stick. The best thing is that you can still loose weight and not feel like you are depriving yourself.

review/summary: Help, Bisquick!
review/text: Bought them when they first came out. Somewhere around August 2009?  Went a little "nutty" and expecting them to be great and using the offer Atkins was offering pre-release, I purchased 3 bags. Wanted to love them, as a matter of fact. Found the texture too "gritty" for my complete approval and a somewhat of an after taste. Not very pronounced but present, never the less. The main purpose was to be able to enjoy tasty pancakes with less guilt but in the end, after trying to make biscuits one day, I had to ask help from my old buddy Bisquick. Bisquick basically said to me: "I understand your frustration but why don't you add one cup of that Atkins Mix and two cups of me plus eggs and see how that goes?". I admit it is unusual to be having a conversation with a box of bisquick but in this case I did not regret the sound advice. The quality improved immediately, waffles or pancakes, and now all I had to worry about was finding out a (real difficult to find) perfect sugar free syrup to match the serving of pancakes (traditionally every Saturday morning) but that is another story and frankly all this talk about pancakes is making me eye the refrigerator way more that I would like to at this time. 3 Stars for the idea is commendable. Regretfully, on the practice, this baking mix is not as good as it probably could have been? Must say that Atkins has pulled through several times for me and their products are always excellent alternatives with a whole less sugar. See? I am not badmouthing anyone that didn't have it coming!

review/summary: So its not Bisquick!!! It is Good.
review/text: OK, if you are going low carb, by now you know it is a tough lifestyle and you have to make sacrifices. Well that is the same with this baking mix. It does make an EXCELLENT substitute for flour. I have made several things with this mix and I have had to TWEAK the recipes a bit to suit my taste. I have added yeast and honey to make BREAD and although it is a little tough, it is GOOD! I love this mix and NO it is not Bisquick but it is a very good sub if you are going low carb. Just use your imagination and this will satisfy the need for flour. The texture is different, there is an odd smell but all in all I am very happy and have lost 23 lbs in 3 months and without this mix, pretty sure I would not have stayed with the low carb lifestyle. Gotta have my bread.

If perhaps I could find something to make this mix taste better without compromising the carb load I'd definitely use it more.  Right now, it's on stand by.

review/summary: The most AMAZING low carb cookies!
review/text: I started baking cookies using this mix as a base (to replace flour) about a year ago and I'm addicted!  I took the basic cookie recipe I found on the Adkins website and added more nuts (6 cups of walnuts, pecans and macadamia) chopped up sugar-free dark chocolate, dried fruit (mango, coconut and tart cherries) and seasonings (cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg).  I use butter and peanut butter and splenda for sugar and added some rolled oats, flax seed and baking soda to the recipe.  I have stopped buying the bars and candy because I like these cookies so much better.  They're very delicious and satisfy my desire for something sweet but not too sweet.  It takes time but baking is so enjoyable and I make enough to last for 3 weeks at a time, then store in the fridge.  I also use this mix as a basis for pancakes.  I had to put it on an automatic order so I don't run out.

I use an "oil free spray"  and add a little seltzer water to the mix to get lighter thinner pancakes ( I also use two egg whites instead of one egg.) They brown up beautifully and taste great. I sometimes will take them from the pan an microwave them for 20 seconds to get a little better texture, but all in all they are my saving grace to stay "legal!"

review/text: The Atkins All Purpose Bake Mix. Made a convincing pancake. It looked like regular flour. It cooked up a little less fluffy than regular pancakes. The price was a bit high but not as bad as other low carb flours on the market. This one does have soy flour in it. But that wasn't a problem for me. It's not the lowest carb flour on the market but it is less than regular flour. I will most definitely purchase this product again in the future. If for pancakes alone. I will be trying out other recipes though and will get back to you.

review/summary: I think this might be a life-saver for me!
review/text: Ok first of all, I agree with previous reviewers who are stating that there have to be sacrifices if you are going to strictly follow the Atkins diet. That being said, this mix seems to be great. I have so far only made the Atkins recipe biscuits, but I ate them and enjoyed them and so did my boyfriend who isn't even doing Atkins. It seems you do have to keep an eye on whatever you are baking when using this mix, and probably cook it a little less time so that it doesn't over-cook. The biscuit recipe said to cook for 10-15 minutes at 425; they took under 10 mins. Next time I will probably cook them a little lower for a little longer. I am very pleased that not only does the mix give you the lower carbs, but also such high amounts of protein! The biscuit recipe advises that there are 2.5g net carbs in each biscuit. Where else can you find a biscuit like that?! I can't wait to try muffins, pancakes, cookies, etc. I'm glad that I got this on Amazon through the subscribe and save option. It is much cheaper and you get free shipping for all your shipments. I will more than likely keep this on for delivery every 1-2 months. I really think this could be a life-saver for me. I'm a girl who loves her carbs, and here's my way to feel like I'm getting them.

review/text: I decided to buy this as a low carb alternative to bread in hopes that I might have a delicious option when I got that craving. Unfortunately this product is pretty disgusting. I decided to make a batch of the garlic toast crisps following the recipe on the Atkins website. Appearance-wise it worked out great, the bread looked like a dense "soda bread" style loaf. The problem was that it had a strange aroma of trout/fish and I couldn't get past the smell for it to taste any different. I'm hoping I can find other recipes that might mask/hide this strange quality of the mix, but I'm literally holding my breath.

review/summary: Works great
review/text: I made muffins with this and I didn't expect them to rise much but this baking mix works great. I only added water, oil, salt, an egg, Splenda, baking powder. It makes something that tastes like a bran muffin. will buy again and it is worth the price.
