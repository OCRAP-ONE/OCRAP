review/summary: Simply Delightful!
review/text: I found this tea in a most unorthodox setting - a pizza shop when I was sick and wanted something warm and soothing to drink in December.  Not only does this tea smell heavenly, but everyone around me asks what smells so wonderful.  When I tell them it is this tea, they can't believe it and want to try it.  I ordered the 50 packet box and need to reorder already as I keep giving these packets away and everyone who has tried it loves it!  The tea smells fabulous, is bold and tasty.  I tend to like honey in my tea, and find this is truly the best cup of tea around!  I love it and think if you are considering, you should give it a try!  You may want to check Harney and Sons website directly as they actually sell it for a bit cheaper, but be sure to check whether Amazon winds up being a better deal due to shipping costs.  Plus, if you prefer loose tea, the company's website offers that option as well.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious and Festive
review/text: My mother-in-law gave me some Hot Cinnamon Spice tea from Caribou Coffee and I loved it so I tried to find it online.  I was surprised to find that this tea seemed to be the exact same tea at a much lower price.  I decided to give it a shot and it is delicious!  I would definitely recommend this to tea drinkers and non-tea drinkers alike.  My husband, who is not much of a tea drinker was pleased to find that it had a rich, full taste, unlike a lot of other teas that he has tried.

review/text: If you are a tea drinker and like cinnamon flavored things you will love this.  I<br />keep it on hand at all times.  You know how sometimes you really want a cinnamon...<br />something? Usually something bad for you, try this instead. The flavor is perfect and most of the time it does the trick for me. And research has shown that cinnamon<br />improves the way our bodies handle sugar. That makes it even better. Love this tea!<br /><br />And if you are a tea lover, Harney and Sons has really good tea. You should give<br />them a try.

review/text: Love it!  I am an avid tea drinker (instead of coffee), and I love this flavor.  I bought one in a metal tin for myself and savor each tea bag.  The smell of cinnamon, allspice (and maybe cardamom?) are so cozy and flavorful.<br /><br />I decided to send this as a gift to warm up someone else's spirits.  It's particularly great for autumn/winter, but I enjoy it year-round.

review/summary: Best Cinnamon Tea Ever
review/text: My husband and I both love teas of all kinds, but this one is the best for true cinnamon taste. Nothing from the grocery store will compare. It not only smells wonderful, but it has a rich, spicy taste that is so perfect for a cold winter afternoon, all snuggled up by the fireplace. I love having a cup of this with a fresh scone or a piece of pie. Honestly, it reminds me of Christmas now since I have bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for the last few years since he loves it so much.

review/summary: Sensational
review/text: I prefer loose-leaf teas, but at work the convenience of bags is hard to beat, and Harney has been reliable in the past.<br /><br />This "Hot Cinnamon Spice" is an excellent cold-weather tea: a pervasive cinnamon aroma with just a hint of orange, and a nice balance between the subtle spice and the tea flavors (assuming for a moment you want to taste the tea, not just the spices, that is.) I'm not fond of herbs and spices that totally overwhelm the underlying tea -- this preparation was actually better than I expected.<br /><br />Good packaging, even though the bags are not the top-tier sachets that Harney uses for their fanciest offerings; a great value.

review/summary: Excellency certified by the chai wallah.
review/text: The taste of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. I grew up in southern India(Hyderabad) where tea flows like water and chai wallahs are omnipresent. It was hard for me to appreciate the choices I have in the states as far as tea is concerned (Black tea specifically) because none of the black tea I find here tastes good to me unless I turn it into chai by adding milk and spices. But this tea does not need even a crystal of sugar because the combinations of cinnamon and sweet cloves they use make it naturally sweet and it smells heavenly too. Every time I go back to India, I order a box to take with me.<br /><br />The tea comes in different packages. You can buy the large rectangular bags which come in shiny copper-colored tins which are not value for money compared to these individually wrapped, slightly smaller tea bags. I seep two bags in piping hot water for three minutes to reach the strong taste I like.<br /><br />Keep sipping! :)

However, I noticed that after my tea cooled down more, I could taste the flavor more.  Still pretty comparable to the ones in the tins, just needs to brew longer and only good for one cup.

review/text: This tea is just amazing. It has a very unique taste, and if you like cinnamon at all you will love this. It is a bit strong at the recommended 1 cup per tea bag, but I'm guessing 1 & a half will be perfect. It is not overly hot like the (only) bad review says, except for maybe the fact that you may be willing to scald your tongue to drink it, its that good!<br /><br />One thing to note is some of the actual tea bags aren't very secure on the top, and the tea will likely pour into your cup. Might want to staple it down a bit more.

review/summary: A Tea That Can Take you Away
review/text: I got hooked on Harney & Sons teas some time ago. It started with their Paris tea, and I imagined that I was back in Paris with every sip. So that led me to try the Hot Cinnamon Spice, the heady aroma of the cinnamon made me think of Morocco. The first sip...I was transported by the smooth flavor and yet there was an intense melding of slightly sweet and hot spice. Once again, hooked. My 18 year old son loves it too! If you love tea, these teas are the best out there!

But if you hate cinnamon, you will want to throw this on the ground. As for myself, I love cinnamon. This tea is flavorful and different from other teas. The first sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of cinnamon. The second sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of spice. The third sip of the tea, you will taste a bit of sweetness. It is simply wonderful. You want quality tea? Harney & Sons - Hot Cinnamon Spice will not disappoint you.<br /><br />Okay, it's tea time.

I've had at least two dozen people try it and not one has disliked it. If you still uncertain go by Caribou and order their Hot Cinnamon Tea Harney is their distributor.  I must say you need to buy it in the silken sachets it's much better tasting that way but this way is darn good too.  I'm a facebook fan of Harney tea so I posted a concern that they were out and they emailed me the day it was coming back into stock and I bought a 50 ct bag  in decaf for $13.50. Low and Behold I went back the next day to add a bag and it was out again.

review/summary: Natural, no calorie, and tastes great
review/text: I've been wanting to try stevia (the plant that is used in this product) for a long time, and finally picked up this container at the grocery store.  I didn't buy it on Amazon but wanted to share my impression with other shoppers.<br /><br />The little jar is rather expensive, but stevia is very concentrated and you only need a tiny bit for most uses.  I like the container, with the flip top lid that allow me to use a spoon without screwing off a lid.<br /><br />The product itself is very nice!  I've used it for several weeks in my morning tea, and I'm a convert.  It gives my tea a nicely sweetened taste and I haven't detected any aftertaste.  I only use about 1/4 teaspoon in two cups of hot water (I have a big mug for my tea).<br /><br />I'm going to explore Amazon and the rest of the Internet for a bulk sized package of this sweetener.  Unfortunately it would be nearly impossible to grow my own stevia in my herb garden, so I'll have to buy it instead.

review/summary: I am in love!
review/text: I really, really liked these nuggets! These are akin to boneless nuggets you would find at a restaurant, but without the messy sauce. Of course, these are bagged, shelf stable nuggets - so they are a bit salty (which means you won't risk death upon eating them). I love the size of this bag as it is great for snacking - only 90 calories! The shelf life was great as mine don't expire until Dec. of 2011 (purchased Feb. of 2011). I will be keeping a pack in the car, a pack in my desk at work, and they are great for grabbing on the run for a quick snack. These are buffalo, so there is a good and HOT spice with them.<br />Another big thing for me is having something yummy, fun, and interesting to eat in case of an emergency (like a weather event that takes out the power). What would you want to eat - canned tuna or buffalo nuggets to get you through a power outage? See, reason enough to order - you can add them to your emergency preparedness bag - LOL.It looks expensive, but the price is actually really good. Less than you would pay in the grocery store and the smaller size bag means you don't have to refrigerate leftovers or over indulge (there is a lot of salt). I can imagine taking these camping, to sporting events, or anywhere that a "semi" healthy snack is warranted or you just get a craving for buffalo nuggets! Will definitely be purchasing more of these!

So, instead of gluten, an individual can FATTEN THEMSELVES UP with sugar! Further, if you suffer from a sugar addiction, and gluten--- THIS IS definitely a huge let down. Sugar in any form such as malto dextrin, dextrose, organic sugar (I love it when they nickname this one as being organic as if the chemical composition is any different on the body!), WHEN ARE THE MANUFACTURERS GOING TO MAKE REAL healtlhy products that have ingredients that ARE TRULY FOR THE HEALTH CONSCIOUS. By omitting one ingredient such as gluten, you have done NOTHING to help consumers with health allergies---- instead you have dumped humongous amounts of the number ONE SUBSTANCE IN THE U.S. THAT Americans are addicted to;  sugar

review/summary: Ghastly Sponges in Mouth-Burning Sugar Syrup
review/text: This tastes like I imagine a regular sponge would.  They look that way too.  Indeed, I am suspicious that these aren't really "cottage cheese patties" or paneer at all.  I've bought paneer for years and I know what it looks, feels and tastes like.  I've no idea what the heck this is, but I think this company is engaged in some funny business in what it's putting in the product.<br /><br />Beyond that, these sponges are soaked in an uber sweet sugar syrup with a slight hint of rose.  That's to be expected for an Indian sweet of this type; however, this stuff actually not only burns your tongue and throat, but mine was still burning 8 HOURS AFTER CONSUMING ONE PATTY, WHICH I HAD SQUEEZED AND RINSED WITH WATER TO REMOVE AS MUCH SYRUP AS POSSIBLE.<br /><br />I would strongly advise others not to purchase this product.  I was expecting something completely different than what I received.  Oh and also all the cans were heavily dented upon arrival.

She said this is the only dry food she would ever recommend for any older dog or cat, based on its excellent nutritional balance and anti-inflammatory qualities. Following that advice, I purchased the food for my 15 year old cat, who seems to adore the flavor of it, but it's a bit too large for him to chew easily.  I'm holding out for a cat version, but until then, I will keep smashing it up for him ;)

review/summary: Great taste gourmet treat on a budget!
review/text: First off if you are looking for one of the super dark 70%+ chocolateThe bars this is NOT for you.  The chocolate is dark, however not bitter at all and has a slightly sweet taste.  The dark, rich, full chocolate flavor is apparent and is complimented well by the creamy texture and smooth taste in the mouth.<br /><br />The dark chocolate bars are made in the USA in Novato, CA.  Torn Ranch is a company that supplys high end treats mainly in the hospitality market.  Might be difficult to find unless you fly first class or stay at a 5 star hotel.  You can direct order online at tornranch.com.  Though if you do these are going to set you back $3 each plus taxand shipping with a 6 bar minimum.  Amazon was 31 for 24 and no tax plus Prime as a shipping option.  A GREAT deal.<br /><br />Package was interesting.  The 24 came in a large, ugly, cardboard box that had been directly sent by itself to amazon,  Basically 24 loose bars in a Torn Ranch shipping box.  So if you are looking at giving this whole as a gift the package will be lacking.  They are individually packaged with each bar having a sealed plastic inner sleeve that is surrounded by a nice printed light cardboard outer box.  The chocolate is sectinal - unlike the other review these are now three piece to a bar.<br /><br />Very, very tastey treat that I will reorder once these 24 are gone.  However, would not reccomend youy buy this as a gift to send (all 24 at once anyway) as the packaging for ther 24 is pretty rough and not eye pleasing.

review/text: I love dark chocolate and have tried and enjoyed many of the well known brands.  I had never heard of Splendid Specialties before and there were no reviews here on Amazon to go by but I took a chance and ordered these and I'm glad I did.  These dark chocolate bars are two ounces each.  One half of the bar (a one ounce serving) is only one hundred and forty calories. The bars are thick and have a nice snap to them when you break them apart and the taste is rich, not too sweet, not bitter and very satisfying.  Delicious chocolate and a great value since you get twenty-four bars for about $1.18 per bar.  I'll be buying these again!

review/summary: Oh! Mr. Salty! Say it Aint So!
review/text: To me, a chocolate covered pretzel is among the 10 best things in life. Even unadorned by a robe of rich, sweet chocolate, Mr. Salty pretzels are honored members of my junk food pantheon. When I saw these on the supermarket shelf, I grabbed a box. Note to self: some things in life are just not possible. A 100 calorie pack of chocolate covered pretzels will either contain very few pretzels or will contain very little chocolate. Nabisco chose the latter. How many little pretzel "O's" are in a 100 calorie pack? About 5 or 6. How much chocolate coating does each little "O" have? A very thin coating of not very good quality milk chocolate. I realize other reviewers have loved these, however, I found them disappointing. For a really satisfying salty-chocolate-crunchy 100 calorie treat try: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JGQ15E">Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, 5.3-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.

The flavor is a very fresh tasting robust tomato taste; it helps thicken and adds wonderful flavor to my soups and sauces.<br /><br />The label has lots of useful information, including -<br /><br />* ingredients: Italian tomatoes, salt.<br />* the recommendation refrigerate after opening and discard the unused portion after 20 days.<br />* a serving size is 2T and a 4.5oz tube has approximately 7 servings.<br />* processed using a dehydration method that results in 28% dry extract of the tomatoes<br />* certified as using environmentally friendly cultivation methods<br /><br />If it could be stored longer than 20 days (like ketchup) I would give it a fifth star but I often either store it longer than the recommended date and worry about food safety or I wind up throwing out the unused portion which is not particularly cost effective.<br /><br />Still, a far superior taste than any canned paste I have tried so I'll continue to buy and enjoy it.

review/summary: Rotten and covered in mold
review/text: I decided that i should first research how to germinate acorns, they said you should soak them in hot water for 24 hours. I did. None of the seeds sunk, I know that it is not a completely reliable method to prove the viability of the seeds, but still! out of the 10 acorns that I bought, none sunk! They floated like dead fish. So I decided to open with a hammer 3 acorns to check their appearance. 2 out of the 3 were completely rotten with mold covering their entire surface. I would definitively not buy these seeds again! However, I have bought several species in excellent condition from this seller, that germinated.

review/summary: Fizzy Juice, yum
review/text: The peach flavor of Knudsen Spritzers is one of their best (i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango).  The soda doesn't contain any added sugar or other undesirables.  While the main juice isn't peach juice (most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices) it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor.  Some people may find these spritzers a little too sweet.  I like to drink mine with ice or a little seltzer added.  I've tried other competing brands and find these spritzers the best all-juice sodas out there.

review/summary: Peach Spritzer from Amazon
review/text: I love that I can get the Knudsen Peach Spritzer on Amazon, because I can only find it at one store in my city of 80,000 people.<br />I am especially pleased that I can have a case sent to me automatically on a turnaround of my choosing. I believe the Peach<br />flavor is the nearest to the actual fruit flavor of all the spritzers, and is the most refreshing. Having free shipping means<br />I can better afford to keep this product on hand.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MFUS">R.W. Knudsen Spritzer, Peach, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Best Ice Cream EVER!
review/text: I had this ice cream once. It was the best ice cream I had ever had in my life. Its so smooth and creamy. Everyone I made it for enjoyed it a lot. I can't believe they don't sell this in more stores. I would really enjoy purchasing many of these, but it seems amazon has  made a mistake in the shipping weight. This error will cause your shipping to be just as much if not more than the ice cream itself. I have tried calling and emailing with no response. They say the package of 12 boxes is 10lbs. Well, as you can see, each box is approximately 4oz each. About 1/4 of a pound. So 12 boxes would only be about 3lbs. Not 10lbs.Hopefully writing this review will get the problem solved. I would really love to purchase this ice cream soon.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: If you have a Cuisinart or other home ice cream maker, very easy to make good chocolate ice cream with the Junket Mix. Even good using non-fat milk. Just mix milk and contents of Junket package-25 minutes later-you have ice cream. Can be eaten right away or stored in freezer. Quick delicious dessert for a dinner party as it can be freezing while the main course is being eaten.  Also add-ins such as nuts, chopped candy bars, and fruit make it even more special.  Try toasted almonds with Mounds candy bar.

review/summary: The Secret Ingredient...
review/text: This little box contains a brown chocolaty powder.  The instructions tell you to add two things: whole milk and whipping cream.  By itself, whole milk and whipping cream, with a little sugar and frozen, IS ice cream.  So what does this little box give you that some sugar and powdered cocoa doesn't?<br /><br />I have no idea, but it's worth it.<br /><br />Whatever is in this powder does two things you won't get from the plain ingredients alone: volume, and thickness.  The ice cream was thickening so quickly that what should have taken 20 minutes to reach was thick enough to overwhelm my electric machine in 10.  The volume more than doubled over the liquid base, which is about 50% more than with plain ingredients.  These alone make it worth it.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, there are no complaints.  It's chocolaty and sweet... nothing spectacular, but no worse than you'd get out of your store freezer.

review/summary: Junket gets it done
review/text: Junket has been around for decades.  I saw my great grandmother use it for ice cream.  Recently we saw it advertised and bought a small case of it.  We were amazed at how great the chocolate Ice Cream Mix came out.( the one we bought)  It was awesome and lightning fast without the egg custard necessary for good quality ice cream. We even used just whole milk and no cream and it was great ice cream..We recommend this product for those that want a quick treat or a handsome dessert done done up just before dinner guests arrive.  You do have to use two of the small boxes for a good quart but Who knew?

review/summary: a good assortment of different things
review/text: This box isn't HUGE, but it's not tiny either.  I got it because of the variety of items it seemed to have, and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />That being said: because it has 27 items or whatever, all of the items are pretty small (I was expecting this, so I'm NOT lowering it's ranking for this).  If you're looking for a large amount of meat and cheese, I'd get something else, as while the meat and cheese were both very good, the logs were small and went fairly quickly.  The sweet things in it were quite good as well, and offered something different to eat- and the sweet/hot mustard was loved by all.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the only item that was either 1. not liked at all or 2. simply "ok" to most people that were eating out of this (6 people) was the Spice Cheese, which seems to be the only item that is repeated- as I believe there were a total of 3 of them in the box.  If you really liked the Spice Cheese, however, that might make your day.  The replication of that one item instead of putting in something else twice, or something different, is the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />In short: very good variety, though small items.

review/text: Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don't consider this to be a 'gift box' as a 4x7 inch non-removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box. As I was giving this to a friend for Christmas I attempted to remove the label. The holiday box design came up in strips along with the label. As one pays a premium for these food samples one does so because they are arranged and displayed attractively and come in a 'gift box' to be given as gifts.
