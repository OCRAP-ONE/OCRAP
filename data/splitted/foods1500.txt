review/summary: great for training!
review/text: I bought the original PupPeroni and my puppy loved them. I had also bought specific "training treats", seemed like we went through a $10, 16 or so ounce bag within 2 weeks-he liked them too, but they seemed to be the same kind of treat, just cut in small pieces. I was excited when I saw the 25 ounce for $10, it saves money, and I feel a little better giving so many treats a day since they are "lean".  I usually carry one or two sticks around per day and tear off a tiny piece each time I reward him for following commands or going "potty" outside. Puppy will do anything for a PupPeroni. I tried to cut them up and bag in advance, but they crumbled and dried out faster.

review/summary: Puperonies for our German Shepherd
review/text: Our German Shepherd, a spayed female, who is 8 years old, really likes Puperonies. She is very smart--taught her self to lower the rear-door window on our Honda Accord. She did not learn to remove her foot from the switch after the window was lowered. As a r esult of holdng down on the switch, the motor stopped working. She very  much likes the Puperonis.

review/summary: Not the greatest
review/text: I wish it were easy for me to get a picture up for this review. The reason is that the mint is gangly to the point that I have not yet harvested it and it has been six weeks. The Cilantro did not even sprout, never mind that one. The dill consists of five little sprites, not exactly harvestable either. The two plants that did well are the regular and the red basil. We have been eating those and they taste good. Overall, I'd say this thing is a mixed bag. It is very easy to do, yes absolutely. It allows you to grow plants all year long in a controlled environment, yes. Does it work? In mcase it does not, I'd say it is pretty bad that it comes advertised a certain way - beautful ful plants and then when you do it yourself and you follow all instructions you will absolutely not get the same results. Personally I think it is not worth it, and I'd gladly take a refund. By the way, the replacement capsules for your next batch are 20 dollars! How do you spell rip off? I'd stay clear from this one.

review/text: I got this for my wife for Christmas.  She planted the herbs on Christmas day, and they are doing great.  She planted Basil, Chives, and Parsley.  The Chives are growing like weeds, and the Basil is looking good too.  The Parsley just sprouted.  They tell you on each pod how long it will take for them to sprout and they are right on.  It took her about 10 minutes to put everything together and about another 5 to get it going.  Very easy set up.  Great so far!

review/summary: More work, but it works
review/text: It took 2 kits to get a full garden.  Only  2 seeds grew on the first kit.  I wrote to aerogarden and they sent me a replacement, told me to use distilled water (the kit said not to use distilled water, to use tap water).  I received the replacement kit quickly and was able to get some more growth from new seeds, but took a few more times.  There are 7 spots, 2 grew with first kit, 3 more grew with second kit, and 2 more are still waiting on.  I like this product, but should be as easy as they said.  I really like the customer service that went with the product though.

review/text: I bought this unit on special from Amazon. I have followed the instructions to the letter and after 7 weeks, the only thing that can be harvested is the chives. Dill is doing ok, but looks nothing like the pictures. Basils, mint, parsley and thyme have barely past the sprouting point. I will try one more kit and if this doesn't work it is going in the next yard sale.

It is great to have fresh herbs on hand anytime I need them and definately beats buying the packaged forms that go bad so quickly.<br /><br />I love mine so much that I just purchaed a second one to grow an additional garden! I would suggest the Pro 200 or Deluxe if you want to grow full size veggies but for herbs or salad greens the Classic is just perfect.

review/summary: The BEST gift I've ever received!
review/text: My husband got the AeroGrow for me for Christmas. Honestly, I was happy to receive it but unsure if it would live up to the hype. Right now I have fresh Italian basil and fresh purple basil, as well as parsley, mint, chives and dill growing right on my counter! It tells me when to water and nourish it, it turns the light on and off... all I have to do is harvest the herbs. We LOVE this product. A few minutes ago I walked by and pinched off a basil leaf and ate it with a big smile on my face. The herbs are there when I need them; there's no running off to the store or herbs going bad in the fridge because we couldn't use them right away. It's an incentive to be a more imaginative cook. "Hmm, what else can I make with basil?" Or dill, or mint or chives? Next time I think I will try the lettuce mix...<br /><br />I've received some nice gifts from my imaginative husband but this one gives me joy every single day, sitting right there on my counter.

review/summary: Aerogarden system
review/text: I bought the unit from Amazon and It came with the herbs. The herbs grew very well and fast and will last a long time. Easy to read and follow instructions. I did purchase the Strawberry plants for this directly from Aerogarden in Colorado in early spreing . The plants arrived and the root system was a little bit black, even though it was sent with a heated unit for the plants. Several weeks later I received an email stating that they made an error with the nutrients tablets and that you should use only 1 at a time . Th strawberry plants did not do well until I transplanted them into my outdoor strawberry bed, now they ar fine. Buy the unit though and get the herb garden its really worth it.

review/summary: Liked it so much I bought stock in the company
review/text: Yes, it's true:  I've never been so impressed with a consumer gadget in my life.  In fact, it changed my life, awakening an interest in urban gardening.  Having proceeded to get up to my chin in hydroponics, I bought 5000 shares in Aerogrow (pretty cheap at its current price).<br /><br />I received my first Aerogarden (I have two) as a gift.  The first thing I grew was lettuce.  You don't know what you're missing until you've yanked fresh leaves off of living lettuce right on your kitchen counter to put in your sandwich!  So simple, so fresh (no refrigeration!).  Anyone who buys lettuce regularly should consider replacing that habit with this, the 7-pod Aerogarden.<br /><br />The complaints that interest me the most are those regarding the cost of seed kits, the failure of supplied seeds to germinate, or the failure of plants to grow adequately.  Currently I have one Aerogarden going.  The only Aerogarden-supplied plant in there is a cherry tomato.  The others I supplied myself: three pods are growing miniature Mexican sour gherkins (a sort of miniature cucumber) and another is growing purple tomatillos.  The remaining two pods I am using for experiments.  I asked myself, could I germinate fruit trees in my Aerogarden?  The answer is yes.  An apple seed (simply from a grocery store apple) is now a four-inch "tree", and an orange seed is just starting to get going.  I have also grown small varieties of eggplant and sweet peppers to (delicious!) maturity.  So, I recommend that you acquire your own seeds rather than rely on the Aerogarden seed kits.  (Do consider whether a given plant will fit the dimensions of the Aerogarden.  I started an okra plant in it and it did too well, too fast--for one thing, I didn't know that okra leaves are gigantic!)  In fact, I think the company should give up on the seed kits and just concentrate on selling the basic things you need to plant your own seeds (like the sponges).  They do already offer these items, by the way.<br /><br />The Aerogarden is not a Ronco-like novelty item.  It is simply hydroponics made simple.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no other all-in-one hydroponics setup available.  The closest competitor was the Prepara Power Plant, now no longer manufactured.<br /><br />If you were to put together a similar set-up yourself (which you can do, as the construction is easy to understand), you would find that your $100 would not buy much more than a proper lighting fixture and light bulbs.  Incidentally, the light has a marvelous daylight quality which I find brightens the mood of the room.  This might be a consideration for you if you live far north (esp. in Seattle, I would think!).<br /><br />I haven't noticed any reviews that mention placing an Aerogarden in an office.  While the 3-pod and 6-pod models might be slightly too noise for that setting (they operate on a different principle), the 7-pod model is whisper quiet and would, I think, be just as welcome in an office or lobby as an aquarium.

review/text: It is great to have fresh, clean herbs on my counter top anytime.  As a long-time gardener and cook, I really missed my fresh herbs when winter came.  I bought an aerogrow garden in February and love it.  Now that warm weather is here and I can grow herbs outside, I plan to grow salad greens, bug and dirt free.  The garden looks attractive on the kitchen counter, doesn't take up much room and has been fun for me and my grandaughter.  I highly recommend it. Would make an excellent gift.

review/text: I have had the aerogarden for three months. Maybe I am doing something wrong but the yield does not justify the cost. The  seeds cost about $20. Running 100 watts for about 18 hours a day is expensive. You can do much better buying organic food at Whole Foods.<br /><br />It is a good conversation piece.

review/summary: A great little unit though not perfect
review/text: If, like me, you have little outdoor space and/or lack a green thumb (me too!) you'll be delighted with the AeroGarden. It's more or less fool proof in that you supply water and nutrients when the light flashes on the front. The newer units are very quiet so they're perfect for a kitchen or office and yield maybe $100 of herbs over the course of a harvest. The lights operate on a timer so it really is very simple to operate.<br /><br />Here are a few kinks and quirks:<br />- The life-cycle could last much longer if they gave you more nutrient. While I understand the desire to sell more pods, it's somewhat wasteful to kill the plants just because there's no more feed left.<br />- Some of the seed kits are bland - out of 7 pods, one I ordered had three different types of basil. I like basil but not that much basil! Others have a better variety so definitely check before ordering.<br />- Spiders and bugs do like attacking the plant and I haven't found much information on what to do about this. I had a million little spiders living in the thing during the final harvest so had to dump the crop.<br />- Pods are not foolproof - some simply do not grow. To the manufacturer's credit, they'll replace any that don't germinate so don't forget to contact them if this happens to you.<br /><br />Still it's a good system and I can only believe it will get better with subsequent iterations. If I could buy the pods for half the price or get the nutrient in bulk, it would be perfect, especially given the inflated price of herbs in supermarkets.

review/summary: The Classic Garden 7 Pod with Gourmet Herb AeroGarden
review/text: I bought the AeroGarden in hopes of starting my own indoor garden since I live in a highrise apartment and off the ground.  I also get the morning sun so growing plants on my balcony is hard to do.  I searched the internet in hopes of a indoor garden for myself and I came accross Amazon.com they had on their site the AeroGarden.  I purchased the AeroGarden and within a few days it arrived and wow!! I'm still impressed with it I put it together the same day I got it wich was March 31/11.  within the first 5 days I saw seedlings.  On April 22/11 I transplanted my plants into a flower pots.  I will purchase another 7 pod black AeroGarden again soon. I had a bit of a problem with setting the timer other than that it was eay to assemble.  I highly recommend the AeroGarden to anyone who wants to start their own indoor Garden.  The AeroGarden is the right thing to own it's the size of a meduim sized plant and it sits on a end table. I bought the Gourmet Herb seeds and I found that the Dill and Mint took the longest to grow but they did come through ok and now they are bigger then the other plants. I'm so happy that I got this AeroGarden it's the best investment I had ever made.

review/summary: Other people don't just get it!
review/text: People if your reading the negative reviews don't believe them completely.Though there are times that a plant does not always germinate but some of the easiest mistakes everybody makes when growing plants in the AeroGarden is. 1. They may not always keep track of pruning the plants such as tomatoes and peppers when growing in the AeroGarden Elite and Extra Elite models. 2. Also people may forget to water and give the plants it's nutrients when needing to grow them but don't worry the AeroGarden has red lights that come on every two weeks to let you know when it's time to do these task but not to worry it's easy as 1, 2, 3, 3. You should also raise the lamp hood so the plant leaves don't get burnt under the grow bulbs or AeroGarden's versions of the CFL bulb for growing plants. 4. You should also harvest the plants fruit or when it comes to herbs you should not let them grow out of control and store them in bags, containers, damp paper towels, or vacuum seal bags to keep them fresh. 5. Next the biggest mistake that all AeroGarden growers happen to do is believe it or not is forgetting to pollinate there plants such as tomatoes and pepper plants such as you should give them a shake at least twice a day. 6. AeroGarden also gives instructions as well when it comes to there kits but not always because you will need to look them online most likely and here are the instructions if you want to give them a look plus herbs as well and I will give you some instructions so you can get to them easily. [...]<br />Here are the steps so you can look at both links so you can grow both tomatoes and herbs and the tomato section also has steps for peppers as well. Step 1. Highlight the link on the address bar then hit back space or delete. Step 2. highlight one of the links and then right click on the link you highlighted and then hit copy. Step 3. Put your cursor on the address bar unless it's already there and then right click again and hit paste and finally hit enter then you should be there in no time. Last but not least if you think you have gotten better at growing with the AeroGarden grow kits from AeroGarden.com Then you can take it to the next level by buying empty seed pods and some other stuff at AeroGarden.com if your wanting to Grow Organic, Heirlooms, Hybrids,etc. As well when it comes to other seeds you can think of when it comes beyond to your wildest imagination. So don't give up you're probably just having a first time bad experience when using the AeroGarden.

review/text: I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it! It was easy to set up and get started. The plants sprouted within just a few days, some even sprouted after 1 day!! We have had this product for 2 weeks now and are already enjoying fresh herbs from it.<br /><br />The only downside to this product (and the reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars) is the fact that the light is very bright. We live in an apartment so decided to move our garden into the office so we can close the door at night which allows us to sleep without the light bothering us. If you live in an open apartment you may want to consider the amount of light this puts off before you buy it. If you have someplace to put it that you can close the door then I'd say there shouldn't be anything that stops you from buying.

I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.<br /><br />Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.<br /><br />I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant. Great product.

review/summary: Well Thought Out Product
review/text: Lots of nice features make this pretty easy to use and be successful at.  I like the lights that light up when it needs water or food.  Instructions for trimming/pruning are explicit.<br /><br />Only two draw backs - it is a bit pricey, and one of the lights keep coming loose so I had to rig it a little to keep it turned on

review/summary: AeroGrow - Plant and stand back
review/text: We saw a friend's AeroGrow and collected a handful of basil. Looked like fun, so we got one. WOW. Everything came up. The plants sat there for a couple of weeks then took off. The chives reached the light and it browned the tips. We raised the lights one notch, then another, then another. Now a month out, the light is in the highest notch. Everything is growing well, although the parsley is slower than the rest. The growing is fun, but having a sprig of fresh cilantro in homemade salsa is even better! Instruction sheet is clearly written and easy to follow. I rate this product as 5 star fun. Christmas breakfast will include scrambled eggs with fresh chives. We bought a second one to give as a gift.

review/summary: Money sucking gimmicky plastic waste
review/text: I'm an experienced gardener but thought I would extend my grow season.  Long story short....<br />paid a LOT for this system, herb plants were so wimpy and weak after two months.  called them and was told they had a problem with their nutrient tablets, sent out new ones.  One month later, string thin plants, no progress.  I purchased new lights $20 per set and a new flower kit for $25 and continued using distilled water and....nothing.  The new flower kit sent up a few very wimpy flowers, but mainly looked rangy and unhealthy.  ONe last try, bought new nutrients and still nothing much.<br />I am trying not to add up the kit, lights, nutrients, distilled water and time that went into a few flowers and a handful of herbs.  I grow 100 times that much in pots on my deck.<br />Also, its very important to note that I tried twice to post my reviews on their website and guess what? Disappeared.<br />They only post top rated reviews, no complaints welcome.  Kudos to Amazon, amazing that you can get the true scoop from others instead of a bunch of fake positive reviews, right?<br />Save your money, this is a gimmick,

review/summary: Aerogarden - Great!
review/text: We actually purchased 2 Aerogardens. We are very pleased with both transactions. The Aerogarden is a hydroponic growing system with automatic lights and water circulation.  It took only 3 weeks for the herbs to come up. You can also use the unit as a starter for plants you want to put outside. Our second Aerogarden was the more advanced model with a trellis system so we can grow bigger plants and vines. My only complaint about the system has to do with the little paper caps and plastic lids that go on the seed pods.  Sometimes the paper caps are on crooked and this prevents the plastic dome from seating correctly. So, I peel off the paper cap and have to tape it down. They need better quality control on the placement of the paper caps.<br />One of my seed pods developed some mold. I called the company and they told me to put a little peroxide on it and they mailed out new seed pods just in case. I received them in a few days.<br />The transaction itself went smoothly and the items arrived on time in exactly the condition as described.<br />I recommend this item and the company.

review/summary: AeroGarden Classic
review/text: I hope I can convey how good I feel about my purchase of the AeroGarden. While waiting for the unit to arrive, I visited some websites with some negative things to say. Nothing serious, but little things that once added up may have led me to steer clear of this system.<br /><br />Let's just say I'm glad I read about it after I bought it. It was delivered early (Thanks AeroGrow), was securely packaged and after reading the ABC instructions, it was setup in no time at all. I estimate under an hour - maybe 45 minutes. That was almost two weeks ago and for the last few days, I've been noticing sprouts poking their heads outside the seed pod labels - 5 so far.<br /><br />I am impressed with the quality of the product and simplicity of the design. Everything in one neat little package - simple to use - easy re-ordering system whether through the catalogue or online. The prices may seem steep but you're paying for simplicity and convenience - the fact is that it is literally a plug and play system. You need to know how to do some very simple assembly, fill a reservoir with water, empty a couple nutrient packs and plug it in...it couldn't be simpler. The seed pods fit snuggly into the holes in the growing area and the clear plastic caps create a greenhouse effect for each plant.<br /><br />I'm so impressed with it, I bought a second unit to grow full sized plants.

review/text: FAST GROWTH! I've never seen plants "take off" so fast!<br />I love having fresh herbs in winter!  Now that the summer is approaching, I'll probably transplant them to a window box in a couple of weeks. And start my flowers in the Aerogardem, and then transplant them outside.<br /><br />  I would have given the product 5 stars except for the pump cleaning process that's necessary.  I don't really mind it too much,  but; not everyone is mechanical.  I'm sure lots of people aren't going to be comfortable taking apart the Aerogarden's pump. Also, you should clean between the growth deck and the pump.  YouTube has a video on how to do it properly [...]<br />Residue tends to collect in that tight space and inhibit water flow.

review/summary: My Own Winter Herb Garden
review/text: My husband and I are as enthralled with our attractive AeroGarden 7 as though it were a new pet.  I placed it in an active part of the house where we both admire the growth of the plants several times a day.  It is incredibly easy to set up, plant and maintain.  Because these indoor gardens do not require any outdoor light they can be placed anywhere.  We have had it for 6 weeks now, have cut off many full grown herb clusters and have appreciated the blinking lights reminding us when the water is low or when a feeding is due. Actually, it really is like a fun addition to our family.  We have not named it or anything silly like that.. although that could be a cute idea...  These guys could be addictive. I know a few people, besides myself, who are considering getting another one.<br /><br />Flaws:  It's a bit expensive for supplies.

review/summary: wonderful fresh herbs
review/text: I received my Aerogarden two and a half weeks ago and am thrilled with it. The only reason I have not given it five stars is that I think they are too expensive, particularly the seed kits. I hope that as their popularity grows the price will come down. At two weeks all the seed pods had sprouted. They are expected to sprout at different times as indicated on the seed pods and all sprouted on schedule or earlier. I'm new to reviewing and would like to upload a picture but not sure that is possible.<br /><br /> The set up was ridiculously easy but I do recommend you read the instructions as doing things in a certain order is needed. Also you are supposed to put the seed pods in in a specific order (as they are in the box) I didn't read that part first and took them out of the separate seed kit box so then didn't know what order to put them in. I think this is a likely error and a list of order they are to be inserted in enclosed in the box would avoid the problem. I guessed on the order and they seem to be growing well.<br /><br />After set up you just add water and nutrients and then again in the future when the machine tells you to with flashing lights. Couldn't be easier!! The instruction booklet is short ( nice for those of us who don't like reading instructions :)  The only part that can be confusing is the adding of nutrients. The instruction book refers to tablets/pellets but what you receive is plastic tubes of liquid and you don't add as many tubes as the instruction says you should add tablets. Just ensure you read the nutrient amount info in the instruction book in the seed pod box for guidance on this and ignore it in the master instruction book. Also you add more or less nutrients depending on whether you have 3 or 6 or 7 pod gardens so read carefully.<br /><br />The light is super bright. You don't want it where you are sleeping. I have it in the kitchen and I put a three sided board in front of it at night ( small version of what kids use at science faires for their exhibits to block out the light as it seeps into the bedroom nearby. Herbs have 7 to 8 hours a day where the lights are off so I set the timer to turn the lights off at 11 PM and they automatically come back on 8 hours later. This is a fabulous feature and super easy to operate.<br /><br />The pump was so quiet that at first I didn't think it was working.<br /><br />So except that I would like a lower price I HIGHLY recommend this product and can't wait to enjoy the herbs that after 2 and a half weeks are  almost ready to start harvesting<br /><br />UPDATE after two weeks one of the bulbs died. I contacted customer service and they immediately said they would send a replacement. I was disapointed it was a week before they confirmed it had shipped but they have shipped two new bulbs and even with just one currently working the  herbs have continued to grow and I have had so  much basil that I have had to harvest some.

review/summary: Renewed Green Thumb
review/text: I ordered my Deluxe Aero Garden when it was a "Deal for the Day". It came with the Gourmet Herb Seed Kit, but I don't care much for the herbs. Before my Aero Garden arrived I went to a local kitchen store and bought the Cherry Tomatoes seed kit. I have Prime delivery (2 day free delivery) but it took 10 days to get it as we had bad weather. The end result is that it was worth the wait as I am very happy with the garden. It is now 3 weeks since I "plugged in" my cherry tomatoes and they are 3-4 inches tall. Each day I check the progress of the tomatoes even though it is almost care free and can be left for 2 weeks with no extra care or watering as the Aero Garden does it on its own. When my budget allows I'm planning on buying another one but for growing petunias. Like I stated before, I'm happy with my Aero Garden and I know you will be too!

review/summary: Excellent when used for what it's designed for
review/text: 5 weeks ago I bought the Classic 7 with the salad kit and have had good-sized salads every 4 days or so.  It has been quiet, not loud at all as I have seen others describe, and I have the light timed so that it's a great light source in the kitchen at night.<br /><br />A few weeks after buying the first, I got my second one and herbs are already a few inches tall and doing quite well.  Again, not noisy in the least.<br /><br />As a clean freak, I appreciate that the Aerogarden doesn't make a mess.  In fact, my second one is sitting on a smallish table in the bedroom, this one with lights set to come on when we get up in the morning and turn off when we go to bed.<br /><br />I have discovered that salad greens do drink a lot of water so I tend to check it every few days instead of waiting for the indicator light to come on but this hasn't been a problem for me.<br /><br />Must admit I am considering a third to grow cherry tomatoes.  Great product and I'm very pleased so far.

After I cleaned it the first time however I could not figure out why the pump wasn't working or find an explanation in the manual. A simple call to the manufacturer cleared it right up! They where very kind and helpful. The only thing I have noticed is the plants that I have transplanted have not continued to flourish as nicely outside in the dirt, but I cant really fault them for that because that's not what it was made for. There also might be some operator error involved but I haven't been curious enough to look into it yet...

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I love my new AeroGarden! I have been wanting to grow my own herbs at home, but I have no outdoor space. I know that herbs take a good deal of sunshine, but I don't have any windows where they would get adequate sun! I opted for the AeroGarden and I am glad I did! It arrived quickly even though it was backordered when I ordered it. It was very easy to assemble, and comes with extensive instructions. Just push in the herb pods, fill with water, add nutrients, and walk away. I set it up a week ago and all of the pods have sprouted and are growing quickly! It is very quiet (the instructions mentioned the sound of dripping, but I rarely notice it) though it is very bright when the lights are on. If I had a choice, I wouldn't have so many varieties of basil...but nonetheless, I can't wait to be able to start harvesting and using nice fresh herbs for cooking with my family!

review/summary: Fantastic and Awesome
review/text: The Aerogarden has proven to be awesome.  All but 1 of our seedlings have sprouted and are flourishing.  I was impressed with the timer adjustability so that it is on and off when you want it to be.  The only thing we did not like was the fact that it only came with the "Quick Instructions" and lacked the supposed in-depth instructions as we had some questions that we had to look up online.  Aside from that, it has so far been a great purchase.

review/text: i've wanted one of these since i saw it in an overpriced kitchen store last summer. i don't seem to have any luck growing herbs from seed and keeping them alive. this neat little machine had the seeds started in no time at all. some of the plants grow faster than others, but i've just been trimming them down to let others catch up. working very well so far! i find it wonderful to have fresh herbs at hand in the winter. i just set it up less than four weeks ago and i already got to use my basil. the only thing is to set the light timer to go off around bed time. it is incredibly bright!!

review/summary: Very close to perfect!
review/text: I actually found my Aerogarden in a thrift shop where I was excited to be able to purchase one at a fraction of the price.  We had some old seeds in the garage for a garden we were supposed to plant that just never happened.  I threw those in the pods and was astounded that after coming home from a weekend trip, got my first lettuce sprouts in only 3 days!  I followed directions which were easy and virtually care-free after the start and couldnt believe my eyes as my lettuce grew tall and delicious.<br /><br />We then purchased the gourmet herb garden and I could not be happier.  I was missing two herbs that I wanted and called customer service and had the quickest complaint and solving call ever.  He was extremely helpful and didnt try to place blame or make excuses.  He solved my problem, sent me the seeds I was missing for free and that was that.  A very nice experience for a change.  I have now my second crop of herbs growing and they are wonderful!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE:  I have two problems with my aerogarden.  The previous owner may not have cleaned it well, or I dont know, but in the back where the water pump is powered, there is a lot of battery acid that I cleaned up, but prevents the pumps from working unless you place it just right.  Second problem would be the cost.  If I had not found it as I did in the thrift shop, I would have never bought it.  I wish it was cheaper because I would have more than one in the house because I love to cook.  And the people that say the cost of seeds is over priced need to look at their grocery bill and add up what it costs to buy and then throw away unused portions of veggies.  The aerogarden pays for itself.

review/summary: AeroGarden is wonderful
review/text: I've purchased my fair share of gadgets over the years, the AeroGarden gets a GOLD medal.  It is flawless.  It is easy to assemble, It took me less than 10 minutes.  Planting was equally easy, I just dropped the little canisters in the appropriate spots and plugged it in.  Within a week the various herbs were sprouting as advertised. It is so exciting.  I do not have a green-thumb but AeroGarden makes me a competent gardener.  I check it 2-3 times a day, not because I need to (it runs automatically) but out of sheer pleasure.  I highly recommend this product and in fact I will buy a second one and start growing tomatoes next.  It is such great value for money, I estimate that it will pay for itself within 90-120 days compared with purchasing fresh herbs in the supermarket.

I'm only wanting to plant foods to eat and survive.

review/text: This is not necessarily a review of the Aero Garden itself--I'll let the other reviews do that. I will say, although I've never had an AeroGarden kit as full as the picture(s) purport, it does most definitely give you fresh vegetables, and a copious amount.<br /><br />I want to highlight AeroGarden's EXCELLENT and OUTSTANDING customer service. In an age where customer service seems to have gone out the window (and down the street, over the ocean, and on to India), AeroGarden does good ol' fashioned "what's right". Simply stated, my Lettuce seed pack didn't sprout for about a week. I called AeroGarden, the gentleman asked me what model AeroGarden I had, and 2 minutes later, he emailed me a confirmation of a new seed kit coming my way. No charge, no stance, no platform, and no issues--it's exactly what you want out of a customer service representative, and a company.<br /><br />Get the AeroGarden because the product works; keep using it because the company cares.

review/summary: Aerogrow Gardener for YEARS!  Almost a perfect love affair....
review/text: I love my garden and all the seed kit delights that have been a part of my home and life for several years. The first part that give me a problem was the pump. I emailed the AeroGods...you seem to be going away from the enginerring of my original 7pod system, should I just get a new improved 6pod system that doesn't have the pump or wait for you to get the pump in. If you guys see a future of the next type of engineering, I'm with you and will just buy a whole new system. No, buy the pump, your style will be supplied for a long time to come. That was less than 6 months ago. Now, I need new grow bulbs... If you are reading this story, you can imagine my attitude of not being able to find replacement bulbs ANYWHERE for my model of garden. JUst tell me the truth. I love having the gardens to play with and watch, enjoy the cascading petunias or the winter colors of the marigolds and zinnias... Be true to your art and your client. Now, once again I ask you, shall I lef my new planted Cascading Petunias get wimpier and wimpier because you are not now selling the grow bulbs for my system. or should i buy them a 6-pod system with the new style of seed pod and light system. or are you going to really have parts for us old timer aerogardeners ??<br />Either way, love ya..just to thine own self (and Leshia JOhnson) be true!  Thanks! Leshia

review/summary: Works as Advertised - Classy Product
review/text: see update at end of review<br /><br />******************<br /><br />I was lamenting about only having frech lettuce, herbs, chives, and tomatoes from may garden during the long fall-winter-spring parts of the year. The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either.<br /><br />Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different.<br /><br />So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss.<br /><br />The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out).<br /><br />The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes.<br /><br />The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank.<br /><br />The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span.<br /><br />I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety.<br /><br />Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork.<br /><br />I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people.<br /><br />The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield.<br /><br />Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on.<br /><br />The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Update November 2007<br /><br />I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce.

review/summary: A Nice Item That Makes a Horrible Racket
review/text: I bought an AeroGarden for my wife back in May.  I'll start with the positives:  It's a clever, generally well-designed item that generally functions well and is a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's really great to have easy access to fresh herbs.  In fact, if not for my one big complaint, I'd seriously consider getting another AeroGarden, so we could grow a greater variety and have a continuous supply of herbs.<br /><br />However, there's a fundamental design problem with the AeroGarden's pump.  After having the AeroGarden for about a month, the pump became terribly noisy, to the point where it could be heard vibrating in adjacent rooms.  After running through a few steps with customer service, they sent me a new pump.  However, because they've apparently had so many problems with the pumps, they were back-ordered and it took about three or four weeks for the replacement to arrive.  Once I replaced the pump, the AeroGarden was again a welcome cohabitant, virtually silent except for the gentle sound of water trickling through the system.<br /><br />All was fine until I pulled out the last crop of plants and inserted new seed pods and nutrients.  I thoroughly cleaned out the reservoir unit, but within a few days, the pump (a replacement) started getting noisy.  I just called AeroGrow's customer service department and they are shipping another pump.<br /><br />The customer service folks have been very helpful, but they've acknowledged that there's a design problem.  The pumps get noisy because tiny bits of root or nutrients get past the foam filter in the base unit, then get sucked into the pump's impeller.  A small nick in the impeller throws off the balance of the pump and they become increasingly noisy.  The only answer--at this point--is to periodically replace the pump.<br /><br />So, just a little shy of four months into AeroGarden ownership, I will soon be on my third pump.  I'm hopeful that they'll get this figured out at some point.  They're very understanding and helpful in replacing the noisy pumps, but it appears to me that there's a fundamental design problem.  As much as I like the AeroGarden when it's functioning as it's supposed to, I can't in good conscience recommend buying one at this time.  I'd wait until they get this problem sorted out.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The third pump did the trick.  I haven't had to replace it since.  I'm not changing my rating, however.  Overall, I like the AeroGarden, but their seed pod packages are overpriced and underperform.  The tomato garden was a total bust--lots of leaves, but not a single tomato--and the herb gardens always include one or two plants that die out within a few weeks.  Some herbs consistently do well--basil and parsley come immediately to mind--but others just wither and die (and, yes, I'm very careful about water levels, nutrients, and trimming the herbs appropriately).<br /><br />I think they could do a much better job of selecting quality plants that would actually perform well.  Since this has been a consistent theme with each of the herb packages I've tried, I have to assume that most purchasers will have the same problems.

review/summary: Why Didn't Someone Think of This Sooner??!!
review/text: I love this product -- no dirt, no bugs and no chance of over-watering!  This is very easy to assemble and easy to use.  Just add water and a couple of nutrient tablets every two weeks.  There's even a light that tells you when you need to do this.<br /><br />I planted my Gourmet Herbs on June 15 and I was ready to harvest the basil before the fourth of July!  If you follow the instructions, there's no way to mess this up. The herbs lasted about six months. My only caution is (and this is noted in the instruction booklet) that the lamps are on about 16 hours a day and they are bright at night.  I can close off the bedrooms, so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone one who has tried to grow herbs indoors in the past.  Aerogarden's customer service team is the best -- they know their stuff and are vary helpful.  I had a problem with one of the herb kits and they have really worked to fix the problem.<br /><br />Update:  I read another reviewer's note about installing a new pump.  I had a seed pod that never sprouted and after being shipped a replacement pod that also didn't work, Aerogarden sent me a new pump.  I installed it last night with a new kit.  The instructions were clear and it was pretty easy to do.  I liked doing it myself in five minutes instead of sending the unit somewhere to be repaired.  It still was an inconvenience, but my positive experiences with the product far outweigh the annoyance of the installation.<br /><br />Update:<br />My first kit was the gourmet herb and as noted above, I had problems with the cilantro.  I have since replanted my garden by mixing the French, Itallian and new Gourmet Herb kits and they've worked beautifully,especially the cilantro.  The new pump has made all the difference.  My oregano is even more hearty this time around.  With the mew pump, all of my herbs are doing better.  After almost two months of growth, the thyme appears to be the least robust of the bunch, but still has a good yield. It's in a back corner spot.

review/summary: Bad Pump
review/text: Bought a unit for my 80 year old Mother at Christmas. Great for a month. And the pump started making noise. Got so bad she had to turn it off. Emailed the company and they sent a new pump out. That one lasted another month. Noise could be heard all over the house. Emailed company again. No reponse. Called several times. Customer service got back to me and said they had a batch of faulty pumps from China and new ones were arriving the beginning of April. They had been redesigned. One would be shipped by the 15th of April. Its now June 4th and nothing. I have left several messages with customer service. Hoping one of these days someone will call me back and take care of this. With the kits and shipping this cost me over $200. And I am unable to return it since almost 6 months has passed. I should of returned it right away.

review/summary: Nice Kitchen Accessory
review/text: I received this as a gift; I was a little skeptical at first of the concept, but quickly got over it as I started to set it up and use it.  I've now had it operational for 6 months and my opinions have pretty much solidified.<br /><br />I want to end this review on a positive note, so I'll start with the two cons I have.  First, its really bright.  This might sound like a no-brainer, but is certainly something to consider as it has the harsh-white lights on for up to 16 hours a day.  Lastly, you have to put in fertilizer tabs every two weeks, but they don't really give you enough to last through the life of the plants; you have enough for the first three months and if you want to "extend your growing season", you can purchase additional three month supply packs from their web site.<br /><br />On the positive side, it really couldn't be easier to setup, grow, and maintain the plants.  Takes less than 20 minutes to setup, and then just a few minutes every couple of days to maintain.  Once the herbs are grown enough for casual harvest, you just snip and use.  The plants are healthy and flavorful.  Although you can use their seed packs, they also recently added a "Masters" kit that gives you a years worth of setups and fertilizer so you can grow your own seeds.  All in all, a nice addition to a kitchen for either using fresh herbs when needed, or drying for later.

review/summary: Little Rainforest in my Kitchen
review/text: Well, I have five of these gardens now, so obviously this is a product I've been very happy with.  I started out with tomatoes and salad greens, and the salad greens were so tasty I added a second garden of those and two strawberry gardens (the second one is on order).<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pumps or noise, and everything has grown beautifully.  With five gardens going at once, it's so bright in that area of my kitchen that it looks like a UFO landing site, LOL, but they are all scheduled to go off at 11 p.m. so it's no problem at night when we're sleeping.<br /><br />These gardens are so cheerful to have around.  They add a nice moisture and a green, fresh smell, and I find the lights cheerful too.<br /><br />The salad greens grow very quickly and are so tasty that my biggest problem is resisting the urge to constantly pluck off leaves and eat them all day long.  That's why I got a second one -- so there would be plenty.  With four in my family, one garden did not produce quite enough for us.  Our first salad crop also did not grow for very long, only a couple of months, but I think that's just the nature of the plant.  The tomatoes took a long time to go to the fruiting stage (13 weeks), but now they are producing two or three ripe tomatoes each day, and they are delicious.<br /><br />I love having food growing indoors.  No bugs, no bird poop, no dirt, and everything can be eaten right off the plant.  Tonight over dinner we literally watched our first strawberry turn from white to pink on the end.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly economical way to grow food, but it's loads of fun and has been educational and exciting for my kids, who are much more interested in fresh produce than they used to be.<br /><br />I've had no trouble with either the pumps or the customer service.  In fact, everyone at Aerogrow has been very kind and helpful, both over the phone and in e-mail.  I hope the company continues to thrive because I just love these little gardens and hope to use them for years.

review/summary: Cool gadget - one caveat
review/text: This is one of these more useful kitchen gadgets. Every time I need fresh herbs for a recipe, I end up buying one of those expensive packs, use one or two twigs, and end up tossing the rest, and everytime it irks me. So this looks like it solves that problem, and do so without becoming this huge time sink that a full-blown herb garden would do.<br /><br />One can argue that for $149 for the unit, and $20 for extra seed kits, I can buy a lot of herb packs at the grocery store before breaking even. True, but it makes it less painful to use fresh herbs or garnish your dish with a single salad leaf.<br /><br />The one caveat I would put on it: you can't really mix and match the seed kits. The settings on the unit, and the nutrient tablets are optimized for each seed type. First I thought, I'd use 2-3 salad pods, a few of the herbs, some basil, and then some fresh tomatoes in the two units I bought. Well, that doesn't work (or at least I don't know what the results would be - but it's clear from the package that the nutrient tablets have different ingredients, and the water pump runs all the time for salad, when it only cycles on/off for other seeds). So I'd have to get 4 of those - that's a lot of money and a lot of space in the kitchen. So I guess I'll sequence which seeds I grow every 6 months and stay with 2.<br /><br />The base unit always comes with the salad green seeds. Looks like they're the ones sprouting the fastes (within 2-3 days) - they must be hedging their bet against impatient and skeptical customers.

review/summary: Covers some points not considered in other reviews worth mentioning
review/text: I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very fine product.  It comes well-packaged and the instructions and assembly are easy to follow.  The unit itself takes up very little space and gives off a lot of light for 15-17 hours.  If you have a dark spot in the house you want to light up, one of these AeroGarden's can really improve the aesthetics.  However, it's too bright to place in a bedroom in my opinion unless you good to bed late!<br /><br />I like the idea of growing vegetables in the house and I think they look good in a kitchen.  However, when you consider the cost of the unit, replacement bulbs, seed packs and operating expenses, it isn't necessarily economical compared to say organically grown lettuce.  For herbs, I think it's great because you can freeze them and there is nothing quite like fresh herbs for cooking purposes.<br /><br />I bought my unit primarily for aesthetic reasons and it is quite well designed and attractive.  I'm looking forward to my first crop and my pump is quiet as could be.  If the pump is noisy or becomes noisy, I highly recommend contacting customer service.  My understanding is that AeroGarden service is top notch!

review/summary: ANYTHING BUT CHILI PEPPERS!
review/text: We sell this item at the store where I work, and I am the person who keeps it running, takes care of it, and makes it look good. That being said, I would recommend this item- just not for the chili peppers. We had no problems whatsoever with any of the seed packs until we grew the chilis. For some reason (maybe due to the length of growing time and strength needed in the the tap root), the root system just gets massive and ends up winding itself into the pump hardware. There are some "safety precautions" that the aerogarden has that usually prevents this (a specifically placed filter sponge and a tight seal leading towards the 'fan' blades), but this did nothing to stop the chili pepper takeover.<br /><br />I spent almost an hour on the phone (on hold) during their open hours, waiting for a representative to ask for advice about the garden. I finally just left a message (because that option pops up about every three minutes), and they never called us back. I just decided to attempt to fix it myself. After taking apart the whole thing, and putting it back together root-free, it still makes grinding noises and hopefully the company that these come from will be able to help with a replacement.

So we replaced the Dill with Oregano and let me say it worked like a charm.  We simply removed the Dill seed from the sponge and put in our Oregano seed.  Normal germination for Oregano is 10 to 20 days.  We had growth after only 3 days using the Aerogarden.  Big Success - Love the Machine.<br /><br />Take Care..

No trouble with bugs on the aerogarden, had some on other plants in the office taken care of with bug spray. When I thinned out the peppers I planted the excess in pots - while I am harvesting peppers now from the aerogarden, the pepper plants in pots are only a couple of inches high and a long way away from harvest.<br /><br />However - the one at my father's died during the second planting.<br /><br />Built my own for *much* less - Pump $10, Hoses $2, hydroponic media $3, nutrients $20 (but enough for many cycles), base was a used aquarium, and I custom cut a top for it. Lighting provided by a couple of all spectrum flourscents @$6 each with a longer life than the ones provided by Aerogarden in a $10 shop light kit lined with foil. Doesn't look as nice but works just as well and you can watch the roots.

review/summary: It actually does work....
review/text: I purchased the AeroGarden and set it up back in Febuary of 08' and just now the herb seed kit I used is finally at an end.  It's already June!  So, when they say you should expect four months of produce, I would say that is very accurate.  Here are some main points about the product:<br /><br />* It is very easy to set up.  Requires no tools, very minimal effort, everything fits together or snaps into place.  You plug it in and it's ready to go.<br /><br />*The "light" stays on for 16 hours on the herb setting (there are different settings for different seed kits).  When you set it up make sure that you plug it in according to when you would like to it to come on and turn off.  I had mine running from about 6:45pm to 11:45am the next day.  Makes a nice night-light too!<br /><br />*If the power goes out, or if you move it, it will automatically restart the growing schedule it was on.<br /><br />*Make sure to pay ATTENTION to the directions that come with the seed packs.  They suggest you place the herbs in a certain order so that they will all have the correct amount of light and water.  Don't just place them where you want them, they won't all grow properly if you do.  Also, do not remove the plastic covers on the seed packs until the plant inside has reached the top of the cover!!<br /><br />*As the plants get bigger (and they will!) they will require you to add water much more often so be mindful and check to make sure the water level light isn't blinking daily.<br /><br />*It doesn't say this in the booklet, at least anywhere that I can find anyway but if you are growing herbs, cut them frequently when its time to harvest because this encourages them to continue to produce.  Parsley, cilantro, dill and chives grow much better when harvested frequently.<br /><br />*Be prepared!  This product does work.  I have basil coming out of my ears!  You have to make sure that as the plants start to get taller you try and keep them away from the grow lights in the top of the unit.  It tends to scorch them if they are too close to the light, so try getting them to grow out a little.  Even the highest setting (meaning as far as it will go above the plants) sometimes isn't enough, they will keep on going!<br /><br />Overall, I have been very pleased with this product.  The herbs are very handy to have around, esp during the winter when you can't garden outside.  The unit is not heavy or bulky, I was actually rather suprised.  It doesn't take up much space, however, I have a very large amount of counter space and I opted to put the AeroGarden on an iron plant stand by the sliding door.  It's out of the way and gets the extra light from the window as well.  I don't have anything bad to say about it this far.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and it will work for anyone.  You do not need any sort of green thumb to run this thing.  ;-)

review/summary: Does what it claims. Very bright.
review/text: This is one of those nice things that you rarely find: a consumer product that does exactly what it advertises it will do. It's trivial to set up, requires almost no maintenance, and rapidly grows plants without you having to know anything about how to grow plants: just follow the very simple directions and the plants grow.<br /><br />I started mine with the Salad Greens kit instead of the included herbs kit, as honestly I don't cook with a lot of fresh herbs but I do like a nice salad. It's growing very rapidly and I'm pleased.<br /><br />The hardware seems sturdy.<br /><br />One important factor to understand before buying is that it's really, incredibly bright. Photos make it look like the unit emits a cheery glow... more like it emits bright daylight that fills the entire room about 17 hours a day. It's a bit like having the sun on your table. It's rather startling at first and takes a little getting used to, but after a day or two it's okay, as long as you've placed it somewhere that it won't bother you to have very bright light. I notice that they sell wall units on which you can place up to three Aerogardens. I can barely imagine how bright the room would be after installing three of these things in one place. I certainly wouldn't want any more lighting in the room. I might even put a screen in front of it to soften the light.

review/summary: low effort, high yield
review/text: We have two of these.  The white one is in the kitchen growing herbs, and the black one is in the office growing lettuce.  I finally feel like a successful gardener!  These come with explicit instructions and pictures so you can't make a mistake. There were only two issues: the lights weren't working correctly on the black one, and the customer service representative said to remove the battery and put it back in--that solved it in about two minutes.  The other issue was the water was not flowing to all the plants on the white one, and a different customer service representative explained very patiently, step by step, how to adjust the water flow; it took just 5 minutes to fix.  Both calls to customer service were answered within 5 minutes (during the holiday season in December!), both people were very helpful and patient, and both encouraged us to call back if there were any problems at all.  There have been no more problems, and the plants are growing amazingly fast.  The lights are very bright, so you may not want the AeroGarden in a bedroom, but it is very easy to time the lights to turn on and off when you want them to--as long as it's the right cycle for the particular plants you're growing. I'm excited about the different seed kits they have--we'll try Italian herbs next. Very little work, and lots of plants. Oh--when you put it together at first it won't look like the picture on the box because you raise the lights as the plants grow, so your Aerogarden will look short at first.  Also, check the booklet to see if there are specific places to plant each pod.  It didn't matter with the lettuce, but there is a plan for the herbs, so don't just put them anywhere. This is a wonderful garden I know we will enjoy for years.

review/summary: Terrible Product
review/text: I received the Aerogarden as a gift. I have a green thumb and can grow anything. I looked forward to having fresh herbs to cook with. There are several things that make this product quite bad.<br /><br />1.) The light is a beacon! The grow light has to be on 14-15 hours a day and is incredibly bright. This won't be a problem if you have a kitchen far away from your bedroom but if you have an apartment it will present a problem.<br /><br />2.)It does not work. I tried once to grow the herbs exactly as instructed. It didn't work. The plants grew only a little bit and then died after a few weeks. I ordered more seed pods to try again, trouble shooted using the FAQ's on the Aerogarden website and again the plants grew a little bit and died. I am a gardener the product does not work.<br /><br />3.)Complete lack of customer service. I called and emailed trying to get ahold of the company to tell them the product does not work and try to get some support. I got an auto reply from Aerogarden that said "we are experiencing a high volume of emails and are currently 3 weeks behind in replying" Well it has now been 2 months and I still have not heard a thing.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY! This product does not work.

review/summary: Energy Consumption
review/text: One reviewer mentioned that the AeroGarden costs $25+ in electricity per month to run.  That is DEAD WRONG.  The AeroGarden uses as much electricity as a 60-watt bulb.  A 60-watt bulb running 17 hours a day for 31 days a month will only use approximately 32 kwh of electricity.  Even if you live in an area with a higher than average rate (say 11 cents), that will cost you a mere $3.50 to run.  Split the difference (it runs on the herb mode for 4 hours without lights) and say it's running full power for 19 hours... that's $3.90.  If you can't afford an extra 4 bucks in electricity a month, why are you buying a $150 kitchen toy?? Check your facts before posting your reviews, people!<br /><br />This is a fun item to use to grow your own lettuce, herbs, tomatoes, peppers, and yes, even flowers! in your own home.  It doesn't take too much upkeep and it doesn't suck all that much power.  The replacement bulbs are expensive, however (and often only one of the two will work, I've found), as are the seed kits, unless you get them on sale.  I'm up in the air about this... if you don't have room for an outdoor garden or don't like getting your hands dirty, this little unit is for you.  Otherwise, you'll probably be happier with an actual outdoor garden.

review/summary: Great herbs, terrible noise
review/text: I got my Aerogarden, despite the many bad reviews on the faulty pumps.  I<br />figured that surely it wasn't a widespread problem.  I had about a week of happiness, watching most of my plants sprout.  A buzzing sound started within 10 days, but it was bearable.  In about 15 days, the pump could be heard in the kitchen AND the living room.  After 20 days, I had to move the Aerogarden to the only room in the house where there were no occupants most of the day - the utility room.  To say it is loud is an understatement.  I have called the Aerogarden help line.  They told me that they had replaced the pumps with a different kind, since they were having trouble with the old ones.  These new ones just weren't working out either, apparently.  They would replace mine immediately.  I have a black Aerogarden, but the customer service rep told me I could get a white replacement pump faster than a black one!!!  I agreed to the white pump, but now I'm not sure I can wait for even that to come in.  I am pretty sure I will have to pull the plug on my garden.  The noise is awful, and I'm willing to sacrifice my herbs for my sanity.  They agreed to send me a replacement herb kit for the herbs I will lose.  Another problem I have:  no cilantro sprouts at all.  They have apparently also had trouble with these, and the cilantro is now not covered under their guarantee of growth.  They WILL send you a different herb.  I guess it is my bad luck that I bought this mainly for the cilantro!!  The rest of the herbs seem to be thriving.  Too bad I am getting ready to sacrifice them for some peace and quiet.<br /><br />This is a very interesting kit, but you would be wise to assume that the faulty pump will happen to YOU too.  You would think that the pump problem would be ironed out by now - I have spent a lot of time researching this - most of my time spent AFTER I bought it - and this has been going on for a long time.  Not much quality for your money.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/27/07  Company has not provided a replacement pump as promised, however, here is temporary fix for the obnoxious pump noise.<br /><br />From your plumbing or home supply store, obtain plumber's silicon grease.  After removing the pump from the base, (using a small philips driver), remove the front cover and small diffuser plate from the pump.  Fingers will do.  The pump impeller will be exposed, then lift the impeller off of the spindle.  Using the plumber's grease, apply enough to coat the round magnet on the impeller shaft, making sure that there's enough to fill the gap between the magnet and rotor hole.  Re-assemble the whole thing and treat yourself to silence.  If the noise comes back in a day or two, then you didnt use enough grease.  This grease is not petroleum based and does not contaminate the water, its milky clear and easy to use.<br /><br />The basic problem with this pump appears to be that the rotor bearing surface is not hard enough to resist wear and just a small amount of additional clearance between the rotor and rotor shaft due to wear allows the rotor to chatter.  The purpose of the grease is not necessarily to lube the rotor bearing surface, but to dampen the rotating resonance effects inherent in the design.  The best fix is of course to replace the cheap pump with a better design.  You'd think that for $140, AG could spend an extra 75 cents for something that lasts.  Hey AG, though I may have tried, I could not polish this turd.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I just received my AeroGarden 6 days ago so yes, this is an early review.  But, unbelieveably, I already have one inch high basil and it looks like all my other herbs have sprouted.  So, I must say, the early results are impressive.<br /><br />However, do not underestimate the other comments about brightness.  This thing is like inviting a supernova into your home.  I mean, really...it's in my kitchen and even if I close the kitchen doors the light squeezing through the cracks looks like some sort of Poltergiest, trans-dimensional event is occurring in there.<br /><br />The one piece of good news is that you can set the lighting cycle so that it goes off at a certain time of day.  I set mine so that the unit turns off right about when I come home from work.  Now, that means that the unit comes on again in about 7 hours to fulfill it's 17 hour daily cycle, but since it pops on about 2 am I'm dead asleep in my bedroom and don't even notice it.  And, I kinda am forced to admit, I like wandering out of my room in the dark morning and having the glow of a small nuclear reactor lighting my way through the condo.<br /><br />So my early review is favorable.  I think this thing might just actually do what it promises.  And at the very least, I won't be getting Ricketts anytime soon.<br /><br />NOTE:  It's been almost 3 weeks now and most of the stuff is growing like crazy.  But, like I'd read from other reviews, my Cilantro and been a complete bust.  I called AeroGrow today and they're sending me a whole new herb garden kit.  Guess the Cilantro is being phased out because it's so fussy.

review/summary: New universal grow pods are awful
review/text: I have had several aerogardens over the last four years. I recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens (pro 100).  Up to this time I was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot.  Recently I received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models.  Despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod.  Worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod.  The new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination.  Up to this point I would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod.
