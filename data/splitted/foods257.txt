review/summary: Best maple syrup!
review/text: I have been using Grade B Maple Syrup for about 6 years now. I love the Coombs Family Organic one the best because of its rich flavor and a affordable price. It is great to see a company who does not charge arm and a leg for such a good organic product!

review/summary: Grade B so much better than Grade A - who knew?
review/text: One of the other reviewers explained how Grade B Maple Syrup means that it has gone through the refinement process twice instead of once as Grade A does.  It's so much thicker and mapleier than the Grade A I'm used to buying from stores here in Oregon, that I will never buy Grade A again; plus it's a great bargain, especially on the repeating plan here at Amazon.

review/text: This syrup is really delicious!  After using this maple syrup, I'll never buy anything less than 100% pure maple syrup. I  like this brand a lot, but the price was fair and we were able to get the extra discount in addition. If they continue to offer it, we would buy from them again. I did a bit of research in my goal to find a fair priced, 100% maple syrup. I settled on this one, and we have been so happy with it! When we serve it with company,  they seem to love it also.

review/summary: Great Syrup
review/text: I have been using this syrup for over a year, and it is the tastiest I have ever had.  When out of it, I tried some Grade A Dark Amber from Target (same price), and it just wasn't as good.  Full of maple flavor and none of the corn syrup junk of the table brands, this syrup really brought breakfast to a whole new level of yummy!

review/summary: Sweet Addition to my Organic Kitchen
review/text: Having spent the last couple of years working toward a whole foods and organic diet we still need a few more things.  Sometimes the price is very prohibitive, and we still don't know if it's worth the cost.  After looking at the reviews on this product, I went for it.  I'm very glad I did.  Making my own cheap version of maple syrup might do in a pinch, but it will never replace the great taste of this syrup and I will definitely buy it again.  I like the fact that if you must have sweets, something a bit more pure is well worth it.  Especially when it comes to children.  My little toddler grandson was very ill, including an emergency ambulance ride to the local hospital.  We had great difficulty feeding him anything.  I used a loaf of soaked grain bread to make an egg/milk mixture of baked french toast casserole.  Of course I topped it off with this great syrup.  Everyone was amazed that I helped him get his appetite back, but really, after the third plate, I think it was the syrup that did it.  Just a light drizzle swirled over the top made it perfect.  The only thing I would change about this is if I could buy it in a 20 gallon bucket.

review/summary: Organic maple syrup
review/text: This syrup is delicious!  I've never tried the grade B, but I wasn't disappointed.  It has a full, rich, mapley flavor and is wonderful on pancakes, waffles, and as a replacement for sugar in muffins, sweet breads and cookies. You only need to use a small amount on pancakes and waffles because it is so sweet.  Knowing that it is organic puts my mind at ease because I know there is no formaldehyde in it, as there can be in other maple syrups.

Grade b has more vitamins and minerals<br />that are good for you. My only complaint is with the container, it's so messy; you always will<br />have to clean it after every use. Anyways I order one bottle of syrup from Shady Farms which bottle<br />seems to perform better and after I finish it I will be putting my Coombs syrup in it! Shady farms is overpriced in my<br />opinion and Coombs Organic tastes great.

I'm many months removed from the mainstream packaged "syrup-type" substances, but some type of spout would be beneficial. We have to wipe down the bottle after each use... *sigh*

review/text: I thought I new what good Maple Syrup tasted like.  I was never too impressed with the brands we found in our local grocery stores. This is much thicker and has a stronger maple flavor.  One reviewer said it has more minerals than grade A.  That could account for the more complex flavor.  Perhaps it is because it is organic.  I am sold on this brand.  I was hesitant to buy online because of reviewers saying the caps cracked causing leaks. Since it now comes with Frustration free packaging I do not have to worry about that anymore.  I am a believer!

review/summary: Really Good Syrup
review/text: This maple syrup tastes very maple-y and I really love it. It's not as "thick" as some Grade-B syrups out there, but the flavor is just fantastic. I find I have to use less of it on pancakes/french toast because it has such a nice sweetness and flavor - this is a plus since all maple syrup is basically just sugar and using less is good for me. I prefer the Grade-B because it has a deeper maple flavor than Grade-A.

review/summary: The sweetest of the 3 I've tried
review/text: This is a good quality syrup and my least favorite of the 3 I've tried.  It is very sweet when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  If you like sweetness, this one is for you.  This may be a good syrup to use if you want to put in less syrup in your Master Cleanse lemonades in order to cut calories.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: Our family's No. 1 maple syrup
review/text: Our large family loves maple syrup and we have purchased this brand regularly for years.  We prefer Grade B over Grade A because Grade B has a stronger maple flavor, but Coombs makes excellent Grade A syrups for those who prefer their syrup a little "lighter."  This syrup is organic, which we purchase whenever we can afford it, but Coombs also makes delicious non-organic syrups that are slightly lower in price and just as yummy.<br /><br />Pros: This size is good for our family, and a much better value than the tiny little glass bottles in health food stores that cost a fortune.  The jug is easy to pour from and doesn't make a huge mess.  The flavor is great and works well in all applications: topping for waffles or pancakes, making salad dressings or barbeque sauces, baking cornbread or muffins.  I also love that the product is certified organic...when I am not buying locally and cannot personally speak to the farmers producing my food I feel more confident buying certified organic stuff.<br /><br />Cons: Obviously, this is slightly higher in price than non-organic maple syrup but not by much.  I would also love to see this available in half gallon or gallon sizes.

review/text: I purchased this because I was looking for an organic maple syrup in a larger size than what I find in my health food store.

This was delivered within two days (thank you Amazon Prime!) packaged well, and at a great price with the subscribe and save. It's really good, I love it. I also use it in place of sugar in a lot of recipes and to sweeten my husband's tea. My kids love it too, I have to stop them from way over pouring and drowning their pancakes. Haha!

review/summary: grade b is my favorite!
review/text: Worth the price for a great tasting, sweet, and healthful food. I bought twice in Amazon and both times it shipped quick, and was packaged well, with a tight thick seal. Grade b is the thickest, darkest, and sweetest, with a earthy caramel, molasses taste to it. It is relatively high on the glycemic index, giving health enthusiasts plenty of energy before a sport. It also has plenty of iron, and I think plenty of manganese as well, and is beneficial for reproductive health at least in men. I use it every morning in my oats or 'kashi' whole wheat biscuits, mixed into cowmilk or soymilk. I recommend this product.

review/text: Wonderful flavor. Grade B is richer and darker than Grade A which is lighter tasting. The price on Amazon is comparable to non-organic elsewhere. We never use the grocery store type syrups as they are mainly sugar. This must be kept refrigerated.<br /><br />I often make cleansing drinks either with raw organic apple cider vinegar mixed with a bit of maple syrup or the lemon (I usually use key limes or limes as I like them better than lemons), cayenne pepper and maple syrup recipe that many use for cleanses (master cleanse). So many micro-nutrients, and now that the honey supply is in question with honey bee shortage (see Dr. Mercola's recent article that 75% of our honey is actually a product coming from China, including that in big box stores)maple syrup is even more immportant to us as I am not comfortable buying honey.

review/text: If you haven't tried Grade B yet it is a huge difference. It is so good!!! We are in love. The company ships it nice and timely. I am chemically sensitive, can only eat organic and have no reactions to this. I add it to coffee, hot cocoa and of course pancakes. :)

review/summary: Pure organic maple syrup
review/text: Coombs Pure organic grade b maple syrup is a great addition to oatmeal, sweet potatoes, muffins, and cookies just to name a few. This 32 ounce jug is very economical compared to what I would pay in the local stores for pure maple syrup. It has a dark color and a rich flavor that keeps me coming back for more.

review/summary: You Will Never Go Back
review/text: After a lifetime of mediocre maple syrup, this is the perfect one.  Compared to Grade A, he Grade B has the heartier flavor which works perfectly for waffles and pancakes.  The amber color and consistency of the syrup are also just right for the breakfast table.  The organic designation, though nice, is not a personal requirement given that the product comes from the sap of trees, which really should not require herbicides anyway.  The price for this product, given the volume you are getting is almost 50% cheaper than buying something similar at your grocery store.  A must have for breakfast.

It's difficult to find Grade B maple syrup where I live, so having it available for purchase via Amazon is great.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good
review/text: I grew up eating "pancake syrup", not true maple syrup. Quite a few years ago a friend had mentioned to me how maple syrup is so much better. I bought the smallest bottle I could find at the store and I thought it tasted horrible and went back to my pancake syrup. This time I actually purchased this to use with the Master Cleanse. I haven't started it yet but decided to give this a try with some pancakes. Wow, I was pleasantly surprised. This actually tastes pretty good. It has a thin consistency though. Maybe because I'm so used to my pancake syrup that is thicker. Either way, I really liked this and I will order more in the future.

It makes a regular presentation instantly "gourmet".  Everyone who has tasted this absolutely loves it.

review/summary: A Serendipitous Event
review/text: I just happened upon this product as I was looking for finishing sauces and balsamic vinegars.  The four reviews were excellent, however, I have in the past purchased food products based on good reviews and have been disappointed.  I put this in my cart and tried to find additional information/reviews on the Internet.  I couldn't many reviews beyond the four on Amazon.com.  I was ambivalent but decided to take a chance & purchase the 6 bottles.  This sauce has met all of my expectations and has fully met the recommendations of the four reviewers who gave it five stars.  It will be delicious on vegetables, pasta, seafood, potatoes, etc.  This is a delicious sauce and I hope that unlike Trader Joe's, Amazon never discontinues the sale of this lemon dill mustard sauce.  It is delicious and very versatile.  I highly recommend the purchase of the "Food & Wine Magazine Lemon Dill Mustard Sauce Marinade." It is incredibly delicious.

I hate to waste so I really tried to see if it was just a coincidence.  Nope.

I use 3 pods to make 2 Senseo cups of tea.  I usually tear the pods open and use my CoffeeDuck, available elsewhere on Amazon.com, to make the tea.

review/summary: They're GREAT
review/text: Purchased several of these from various sellers including amazon, never any complaints.  Our baby loves them (55 lb. golden retriever).  She is a very aggressive chewer and the larger ones actually last her about half an hour.  She is always excited when we go to the pantry and she hears one of her many treat bags opening.  She escpecially loves these.  Sometimes if the isn't in the mood to go to town on it, I will let her lick it and that usually gets her juices flowing and she will finish it.<br /><br />She will be age 2 in April and the vet says here teeth look really good.  This has the most mechanical chewing action for an edible product I've seen.  Greenies are nice but they dissappear really quick and can get pricey.  I wouldn't reccomend a steady diet of these however I usually go every other or every third day and supplement with Checkups or Greenies and nylabones.  Way easier than brusing or the dangers of water additives and rawhide.

review/text: I have used CET chews for years as I worked at a vet. They work great to keep your dogs teeth in good shape if you can't brush their teeth. Make sure to only use them once daily and the chlorhexidine coating them will work to keep their teeth as pearly white as possible! And these were about 1/2 the price they are at a regular veterinarian.

review/summary: Doggie Crack....and they work
review/text: I have long known that if my dogs had to rank their love for treats against their love for me, I'd probably rank first.....but it would be close.  And then we discovered the CET chews.  Not only would the CET chews win over me, my dogs would not hesitate to sell me in exchange for them.<br /><br />Every dog in our extended family is addicted.  I think they lace them with something.  Put them up against a regular rawhide and there is no contest.  We all gave each other chews as gifts for Christmas.  (Which in retrospect was dumb, we could have just kept them and saved on shipping...but who knew?)<br /><br />They do work for teeth cleaning by the way.  I have one dog, a rescue, who has some damaged teeth (one broken, others degraded).  He came to me that way.  I've had them cleaned by the vet more than once but since we've discovered a heart murmur sedating him for a cleaning is no longer an option.  The CET chews have helped.  His teeth are still not great, but there is a noticable improvement in the amount of gunk.  My other dog has nice mostly white teeth and the chews have really helped keep them that way.<br /><br />These were also wholeheartedly approved by my vet.<br /><br />And one last benefit...if you want your dog out from under foot for a few minutes these are also handy for that.  I do use them occasionally when I need some quiet or am feeling like there are just too many german shepherds in the house crowding me.  They happily take them to the back yard and chew away quietly.<br /><br />So big thumbs up here (or paws up, or dew claws up or....you know what I mean)

review/summary: Our dogs LOVE these!
review/text: We have two 4 year old Great Danes, and our vet recommended these for their teeth - and they LOVE them! It's hard to find treats for them that are big enough for them to enjoy (rather than just eating them in one bite!), and these keep them chewing for a while.  We've been giving these to them for nearly their whole life, and their teeth are in excellent condition! Plus, I feel good about giving them a treat that actually benefits them in some way.

review/summary: Enjoy but supervise as needed
review/text: Arrived within time frame and as stated.  My dog loves these chews given once a day, and reminds me when it's time for them (I'm sure she would want them more often if I let her) and the vet notices cleaner teeth.  They should always have owner supervision when eating these though to prevent any choking/accidents.  Good to do business with.

review/summary: Excellent Choice in Dog Chews
review/text: Every evening, after the dogs (we have three) have finished their dinner and taken an outside romp, they know when they come in that we'll be giving each of them one of these chews.  They come inside, make a circle around whoever is giving the chews out, and sit politely.  As each is given his chew for the night, he'll go to his chosen spot and begin chewing on the rawhide.  It's funny to watch, but we know they are each getting enzymes they need and exercise for their teeth and gums.  An excellent choice, and sold by our vet, which is the best recommendation I know.  We buy ours through Amazon because we've searched the internet time and again, and only here do we find the best price.

review/summary: Watch your dogs
review/text: These are okay, but like other reviewers have mentioned dogs need to be monitored while chewing these. These are essentially rawhide, so they eventually get very soft and pliable, and dogs who tend to gulp food/treats may try to swallow these. My recommendation for the most effective care (albeit one of the more difficult solutions) would be brushing daily.

review/summary: Vet recommends; dogs love
review/text: My vet recommends these chewies for all my six dogs that range in size from a 4lb Mi-Ki to a 130lb Great Pyrennes to help with their teeth and the dogs love them. I give them to them at night along with their "sleepy time" treats when they go to bed. My Pyr loves this extra large size chew so much that he won't touch his treats until I give him the chewie, then he often takes it and hops up on the bed and chews the night away. I learned of these from my vet and bought the first couple of bags there but the prices are Amazon are terrific so I've been buying them here for the last year or so. Great product.

review/summary: Great for cleaning!  Great for choking!
review/text: Gracie's teeth started to show a slight build up of tarter, bought these and most of the tarter is gone. Her teeth are pearly white and her breath is fresh.  Saying she loves these chews is a grave understatement. A true golden (2yrs old), she is not picky and will eat most of what we give her, but with these, she will act foolish until she has one in her posession.<br /><br />Choking on the chews:<br />Every time she chews one of these treats, she tries to swallow a large, unchewed portion of the rawhide strip that never fails to get lodged in the back of her throat.  I keep thinking she'll learn to chew the entire treat, she is a smart dog in all other respects and only chokes on this particular treat.  Yet with every one of these treats given to her, I have to reach in to her throat and pull out that lodged piece of rawhide. May try cutting them in half.<br /><br />I am torn on these treats because they do such a great job on Gracie's teeth, she just loves them and they are affordable for daily use(unlike Greenies). Just wish they weren't rawhide.

review/text: Our vet suggested these chews to help our dog's teeth and my dog prefers them to any other rawhide chew. OK prefer is not the best word, more like she's addicted and must have one to "brush her teeth" every night. The product is excellent, her teeth look fabulous, and she's happy. I'm happy because the cost through Amazon is nearly half of what I'd pay at the vet's office, even with the cost of shipping thrown in. I most definitely recommend this product.

review/text: My 5-year old lab mix gets one of the X-Large chews every evening, and he loves them.  I've never had to have his teeth cleaned because the chews, combined with a little brushing every now and then, really work well at keeping build-up off of his teeth.  A bit of a warning. . .don't let the dog have one of these when you're not around.  More than once my dog has tried to swallow the last "little" piece which gets stuck in his throat and has to be removed.

review/text: These Cet Hextra Premium chews are the best thing to come along since toothbrushes for K-9s.<br /><br />I have 8 Australian Shepherds and brushing their teeth regularly does NOT happen around here.  We have over 100 other animals and its too bad we can't give them to ALL.<br /><br />When you open the package, they smell good enough for ME to chew on and all the dogs get them regularly.  Its their after-dinner minty toothbrush.  My dogs range from 14 months to 16 yrs and they keep the teeth clean and pretty much plaque free which cuts down on the dental visits.  Needless to say I must buy the Large to Extra large 30 pack which can get pricy if I go through my Veterinarian therefore I shop on line for the best deal.

review/summary: Truly great chew treat, teeth-cleaner
review/text: I've tried lots of treats, chews and teeth-cleaning products, but this is the best! My dogs love it. I have one large dog, one small one, and I cut the large pieces in half for the little guy. I wish this was around when they were young, it truly cleans their teeth well and would've prevented my big one's cavities! The brown coating will leave yellowish stains on your rugs, get your dog to keep it in a special spot while they chew, though. Even when mine sneak it onto the light carpet, I'm more than glad to clean up after, it's easy (Dawn and OxyClean!), and to keep cavities away with a chew that's so safe and digestible and they enjoy so much, it's worth it. Lasts long, too!

review/text: I have two beautiful large rescue dogs, Heidi Sue, two and Loosey Bell, 13 that love the Chews.  All I have to do is say chew-chew and the jumping and barking starts. Heidi finishes hers first and starts barking at Loosey to try to steal her chew.  It is quite a show and amazing such a treat can cause so much fun.  It is such a great product and is recommended by my vet. I only wish the price was lower as it is expensive and not always in my budget. I am glad that Amazon offers several places to buy the treats so I can compare prices. Thank you
