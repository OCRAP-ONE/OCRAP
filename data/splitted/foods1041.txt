review/text: I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that likes to chew bones.<br />they work wonders for their teeth and they are not messy at all. My dog goes through<br />a bag really quick, they work wonders on greyhound teeth they tend to have a lot of tarter build up...<br />Buy them on internet not through vet much cheaper....

review/summary: Dogs Love Them
review/text: I've been buying these for my two dogs for a year now and they LOVE THEM. I've also noticed that their teeth look cleaner. I feed my dogs twice a day and they want one after each meal. These are the only treats that they will remind me to give if by chance I do forget. Be sure to monitor your dog closely when given a treat especially if your dog likes to gulp large pieces. Also, my Vet sells these and several of her staff give them to their dogs. I have found the best prices through Amazon suppliers. Medi-Vet has been great. I buy a monthly supply each time I order. The last shipment I ordered on 12/1 and received them on 12/3.

review/text: These are fantastic.  Not dry or bland like some granola bars.  They're very chewy (kind of like Rice Krispy Treats!!) with lots of flavor.  I have these for a mid-day snack.  My 3 and 4 yr old love them too.  I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good.  I had been buying these bars at our local health food store.  Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for, but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon.

review/summary: good but not great
review/text: These are good bars, but I prefer the cranberry ginger combination more.  The real problem with Nature's Path granola bars is that the quality is inconsistent.  At the top of their game, these bars are healthy, nutritious snacks; lately, though, I have purchased several boxes in which the bars were stale and dry, not moist or chewy at all.  This is the reason that, although I like these bars, I cannot in good faith recommend them.

review/summary: Yummy Granola Bars!
review/text: I usually hates granola bars.  They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture.  My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars.  I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them.  Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash.  They are actually quite tasty.  My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about.  Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon.  And it's organic!

review/text: The apricot n' nut bars are really good.  We love that the bars have a generous amount of nuts in them and that the apricots aren't too dry.  We've purchased apricot bars in other brands and have found them hard over-dried hard to chew pieces versus the apricots in these bars which are moist and chewy.<br /><br />The only warning I have is to hide them if you're just intending them for lunch bags.  They seem to disappear!

review/text: First time trying this and it's delicious! It's super soft and chewy and tastes great. It's almost as good as a rice crispy treat, but it's better for you healthwise. And to top it off, it's organic!<br /><br />One reviewer asked, why add coconut? It's hard to imagine apricot and nut and coconut, but I love it. It's not a strong artificial coconut flavor. It's real, organic coconut. It's subtle and adds a nice smell and taste.<br /><br />I will add a closeup of the nutrition facts in the "customer images" link above, right underneath the main image. Make your own educated purchase.<br /><br />I haven't tried the other flavors, but this one's so good, I'll have to try a different flavor next. These are great as breakfast bars.

review/text: I am deployed to Iraq, so I needed some healthy snacks I could take with me, that were semi-perishable.  I ordered these bars and couldn't be happier!  They are soft, chewy and taste great!  The fact that they are organic and made from whole grains and other wholesome ingredients is a big plus.  These are a good substitute for a dessert, especially when you are craving something sweet and chewy.  The only negitive for me was that Amazon will not ship to APO addresses, so I had to ship these to my parents first, for them to ship them to me.

review/text: This review is from my 10 year old son...I'm the first review for Sponch! Sponch is a very good candy. You should try it. Sponch is more like a dessert than a cookie. If you like like strawberry, marshmallow and graham cracker then you will like this. It's a little chewy and the graham cracker flavor is not strong but the marshmallow flavor is. I can't read the package it comes it. It's written in Spanish. So overall, I think this candy is very tasty and you should try it.

review/summary: Pretty Good for Instant Oatmeal
review/text: I've tried several brands of instant oatmeal over the years and most seem like tasteless mush.  They are also so processed I doubt highly that you are getting much out of the meal.  I couldn't stand the stuff so I just went back to cooking steel cut oats.  Now, pressed for time, I find that I need something quick, hearty and healthy to eat.  Nature's Path Organic Instant Oatmeal is delicious and something I will continue to purchase in the future.  The texture is heartier than any other instant oatmeal I've tasted and its flavorful ... it isn't just covered up with high fructose corn syrup solids and fake cinnamon (lol).  Steel cut oats are still my favorite, but Nature's Path Instant Oatmeal will certainly do.<br /><br />Surprise - Surprise... I like instant oatmeal now.

review/text: My wife has been a fan of wafer cookies for many years.  When I noticed these sugar wafers from Keebler, I ordered some as a surprise for her.<br /><br />It seems the my wife is a fan of a different cookie.  She said these were good, but not the ones she had when she was young.  A disappointment for me, but she did enjoy the cookies. I am not certain the cookies she had as a child exist anymore.<br /><br />Keebler Vanilla Sugar Wafers are a nice treat.  These cookies taste good and make a pleasant snack.  I enjoyed them myself, but in limited servings.<br /><br />These wafers are 390 calories a serving, according to the rating website I found.  The serving size is a package, but that is 10 cookies - I limit myself to 4.<br />At four cookies I get 150 calories 21g of carbs, 14g of sugar and 20 mg of sodium.<br />So from a nutrition point of view, 4 of these cookies are better than most.<br /><br />I recommend Keebler Vanilla Sugar Wafers.  It is a nice treat.

review/summary: Superb Popcorn
review/text: Many years ago (too many) growing up as a kid we had no such thing as microwaved popcorn and my parents used to buy popcorn packaged just like this product which carried the brand name of TV Time popcorn.  After years of just so-so microwave popcorn we searched for TV Time but could not find it anywhere.  We were visiting family back in Virginia and happened upon a specialty popcorn store that cooked their own product on premises.  But they also had a rack of this Pop Weaver corn for cooking at home and we bought several.  It was great--as good as TV Time by my memory--and we found the supplier here on Amazon for a re-order.  This tastes as good or better than any in the theater, and by our standards far better than microwave.  Yes, there is a bit of labor involved cooking it the old fashioned way (agitating the pan while it pops, then washing the pan later), but look upon it as cooking rather than "zapping" your snacks!<br /><br />One hint that has always worked for us: keep this product in the freezer until you are ready to cook.  It will keep the oils in better condition, the oil squeezes out as a "stick" rather than a goopy blob, and--most importantly--cooking very cold kernels seems to result in a more energetic popping and far fewer un-popped kernels when you are done.  Enjoy!

This cola is for something else; perhaps is good for mixing with alcoholic beverages, or coffee, but definitely NOT for ice-cones. The taste is very strong, so I do not recommend this for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad syrup, BUT -- It is a syrup for adults to mix with "adult" drinks, not kids. I'm just giving it 3 stars because it doesn't specify anywhere that this product shouldn't be used to make frozen colas nor to add on icy-cones.

Actually, for those Vegan's out there (my spouse is one), you substitute Soy/Almond, etc., milk, and just use the above recipe.  Works great with Chocolate Milk or Soy too!

review/summary: Great snack, but be careful with smaller ones
review/text: I have a toddler, and she LOVES these.  They are very good, but the papaya pieces in the mix are too hard for her and are almost glassy.  I tried one and it cut my tongue, so I pick these out of the bag before giving to her.  All the other fruits in this mix are okay for her to eat.  She has multiple food allergies, so we are thrilled to find that these are allergy-free for her.  If you are considering these for a toddler, I suggest getting the ones that are all pineapple or banana as they are the easiest to chew.  Otherwise, they are great snacks.

review/summary: such a sweet treat.
review/text: Funky Monkey snacks are so yummy, I decided to try Amazon to see if I could buy in bulk. Now truth be told I always opt for the high calorie chocolate dessert, but these little treats let me mix it up a bit, and not feel so guilty when I do indulge. They are perfect for keeping in your purse or console in the car just in case the car ride home is longer then usual.  I am a fan!

review/text: I think this snack is okay, it healthy and not too sweet.<br />But my kids (1, 3, and 7) don't like it.  I thought they would since they usually like any kind of dried fruit snack but for some reason this just wasn't a big hit at our home.<br />I might try their other flavors to see if those are more popular with the kids :)

review/text: I love this stuff!!! It's a great snack : ) The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there is too little product per pouch.  I found out about this product from a friend of mine.  It's considered a raw food, 70% organic, gluten free, and contains one serving of fruit per pouch.  I like the fact there is no sugars added to it.  The pineapple is awesome!!!  It's better than eating some over processed candy and it's only 45 calories.

review/text: This is my first review ever, and it's in response to the only other review posted by Deb S. and putting this at a "2".  I have never tasted the brand which she describes and will plan to some day, but at this point I have tried several brands and place this at the top of them thus far. Therefore,<br />until I find better, I'll have to give this a 5. Let's face it, nougat by its nature is "too sweet" but that is also why we eat it. I agree there's a lightness about the Bellino, but this is exactly what makes it stand out: it accentuates all the subtle flavors under the sweetness...the honey, the almonds, and even the wafer itself. Quite the best so far! Enjoy!

review/text: Purchased a 4 oz. pack of these candies on a trip thru canada. They were excellent. Sweet and slightly hot. Very different from any other gummi candy.  Ordered these 2.2 lb bags of gummi candy and was disappointed that they were not hot but cherry flavored. They were good just not what I wanted. Why shape them into jalapenos if they weren't spicy or hot? Shape them like cherry's. I am just about to order the 4 oz packs to see if they are hot or not, will let you know.

review/summary: not what i thought it was going to be...
review/text: This salt is good, but it doesn't taste like garlic... i am not sure what 'wild garlic' is i guess, but it's more of a light seaweed-ish taste, maybe the green tops of the garlic was used - as you can see, it contains a lot of green. However there is no actual garlic clove/bulb in the mix which is what i was wanting. the salt is a good quality and i like it - but this was a lot to order for it not to be a true garlic salt like i thought it would be. Also it comes packaged in the seller's package w/their name - there is no reference to Falksalt on the packaging.<br /><br />I am revising my review -from 3 stars to 4... and mentioning that although it wasn't what i thought it was going to be - now i am addicted to it! so, not garlicy really (maybe a mild garlic taste) but it's still a great salt.

review/summary: A Christmas stocking filler
review/text: When I was a child, we used to get small boxes or bags of hard candy at Christmas.  This is a higher quality candy in small bags suitable for Christmas stockings or as small gifts for distribution within groups.  It is another of those hard to find items but can be found by searching on Amazon.  I was actually doing a general search under Baci, but the search brought up related products.<br /><br />Be advised that the product may not appear as illustrated.  I should have received 12 of the 4.5 ounce bags illustrateed (3 packages of 4 bags each).  I received 6 of the bags illustrated and 6 clear unlabeled bags of the same product.  They will do for my intended use, but might not work for other people.

review/text: They were OK. Not great not bad. The number of flavors were limited. Some were, for lack of a better expression, soggy, and the longer they remianed in the candy bowl the worse it got. Those that were not soggy were very good, but they were really a substitute. What I was looking for, and still cannot find, is a similar candy from my childhood. There was no name brand on the candies themselves, which is likely why I can't find them. They were wrapped in white paper, had pictures of the fruit on them and were shaped as a rectangular solid perhaps 1 x 3 x 6 cm? If you think you know what I referring to, please let me know. Thanks.

review/summary: Hope their regular product is better than the sample pack
review/text: In an ideal world, the samples you dispense for your business are the freshest and best version of your product.  After all, people get samples to see if they want to continue buying from you.  In the real world, often sample products are overlooked in favor of high-dollar purchases from repeat customers.<br /><br />Whether this is the case here I couldn't say, but I know for sure the sample pack was full of stale, dusty spices I would never use for cooking.  They were dry, lacking in smell and color, and due to the small sample size were often crushed up leftover bits no self-respecting cook would consider. (Who would use a quarter of a bay leaf?)<br /><br />After further shopping around I ended up finding 'Spices Inc.' and the difference was amazing.  The dill was a dark green instead of a putrid, dusty yellow-green color.  The scent from any one package of spice from there overpowered my entire sampler pack of 12 spices.  I am now pawning off my Spicely sampler pack on someone who just moved and doesn't have any spices.

review/text: This past Easter I decided to put an Easter basket together for my boyfriend.  I wanted to put a bunch of goodies he loved inside.  He absolutely loves lemon and anyhting lemon.  I found this recipe for lemon burst cupcakes I knew he would love.  Part of the recipe called for Lemon Curd.  I had not a clue what this stuff was.  I went to about 4 different places to find it.  I googled it for hours and could not find it.  It was about a week before Easter and I had nothing, until amazon.  I found it on amazon and quickly ordered it up.  I feared that it would not come in time,seeing as I only had a week.  It came in no time.  I had it days early and quickly went to baking.  It was a hugh success.  He oucldn't get them down fast enough.  He now uses the lemon curd on everytjing.  Thank you so much for making my Easter the best.

review/text: I can't put in words how happy I am to finally have found a genuine lemon curd product. I'm glad another reviewer mentioned some key words about the texture and flavor, because I was reading reviews for different brands.<br /><br />As soon as you get the jar, you'll immediately notice the colour ;) looks just right. It actually looks lemony. The best part comes when you turn the lid hearing that pop of freshness and actually smell it. Childhood memories instantly come to mind and you know you finally found the real deal.<br /><br />The taste is just right and the consistency is sort of like mushed apple baby food. I can't even say how often I have been disappointed by trying a store bought jar of lemon curd. I've seen every consistency from stuff that is slimy to a consistency of flan with liquid seperating out of it.<br /><br />I hope this product is very successful. I'd like to enjoy something that I feared I won't be able to replace in the future and because I don't think the American market has ever had a real product available. I'm sure it will finally catch on here.

I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat.

review/summary: Best gourmet raw chocolate bar
review/text: I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand. I've tried all the different flavors and they're to LIVE for. I feel really healthy after eating some of this chocolate. I would recommend buying it at a local health food store because they're quite expensive to order here. I have the same thing to say about their other flavors.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: These were selling in my gym and I decided to try this and the Caraeml (which I reviewed separately and gave two stars).<br /><br />I managed to eat two bites of the caramel. I spat out the first bite of this one. It tastes disgusting. Furthermore, despite it not being passed its sell-by-date (two months from now) it looks bad. The caramel bar looks like dark chocolate; this looks like medium brown sand.<br /><br />Definitely the worst chocolate I've ever had (and in a world full of Hershey's that is saying something).

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

review/text: If you have a Bialetti Mokka or Brikka, I would recommend this coffee. I personally use a stove top Bialetti Brikka, and this coffee makes a fantastically smooth tasting, yet strong espresso with the most crema of any commercially available canned coffee I have tried. And I have tried quite a few!<br />If you want a great cup of espresso, or cafecito as they say in Miami's "calle ocho", without using a commercial espresso machine, do yourself a favor get a Bialetti Brikka, and try this coffee. It is that good.

review/text: I have a 15 year old daughter who lives in Ohio and when she visited us here in Florida she tried my Cuban coffee and liked it. I purchased a manual espresso machine and this coffee for her and also ordered some coffee for me. Just about as cheap as I can get it in Publix. This is really a smooth and full flavor coffee with minimal jolt or shock of caffeine. It just picks you up and keeps you up without the shakes. Also does not upset my stomach like some other espresso mixes as this one seems to have low acids. I hope you enjoy like we have. Time for another cup. :)

There is no expiration date on the packages but I have the feeling they are old stock. Not chewy and moist but hard and crumbly. Seller said they are good but I could return them for full refund but instead of going through sending back and paying postage to do so I decided to dispose of them to local pet shelter and buy a new supply from my vet for the pill giving purpose.

Has Coconut oil helped? Maybe... I do know that there is an ingredient in coconut oil that is found in breast milk. Can't remember what it is exactly but I'm sure you can google it.
