review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker but my husband is.  I got a sampler pack that included this flavor, and he loved it, prompting me to buy a box it it.  We had a family party this past weekend and when people smelled this flavor coffee they wanted to try it.  Everyone raved about this Cinnamon Roll coffee.  ALMOST makes me want to try a cup, but I'll stick to enjoying the scent of this "new Favorite" in my house.

review/summary: One of my favorite coffee's ! Delicious great flavor !
review/text: This is one of my favorite coffee flavors. It's delicious. Great cinnamony flavor. I dont understand how other reviewers say there isnt enough flavor. Maybe they're brewing too big a cup ( too much water ) for their taste ? All I can say is I use a pretty big mug and I taste lots of flavor. I would have to say its all about personal preferences and what you're used to. I also dont get how some others say they dont taste cinnamon roll flavor, thats all I taste ! I love flavored coffee's but I also like dark bold coffee's, but if dark bold is all you like then this one probably wouldnt be the one for you as it's not a dark roast. Another reviewer compared this to Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry k-Cups....there's no comparison in my opinion, this Cinnamon Roll is much better. More cinnamon roll flavor and not as acidic tasting as the Timothy's. I highly recommend this flavor. My whole family loves it as well.

review/summary: More like essence of Cinnamon then Cinnamon Roll
review/text: I don't like coffee and this K-Cup is one of the reasons why. It doesn't taste anything at all like a Cinnamon Roll. I need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it.  It kind of reminds me of taking medication. I only bought this coffee because I am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all I can have in the morning. Maybe it is because I can't have any creamer, but just adding Truvia doesn't help the taste of this coffee. With that said if you love chocolate then you will LOVE Donut House Chocolate Glaze Donut Flavored coffee (with a couple packs of Truvia it taste like eating a Chocolate Glaze donut) and Donut Shop Coconut Mocha (OMG...this taste exactly like Hershey's Mound Candy Bar...I feel guilty drinking it, LOL).

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: I tried this, despite some of the negative reviews, since the positive reviews outweighed the bad ones. But it looks like the negative reviews have it. While brewing, it has a distinct smell of cinnamon, which got me excited. Note: it smelled like raw cinnamon, not a cinnamon roll. That's about the only positive. Otherwise, it kind of tasted like bad coffee with a hint of dirt. I tired it on all the settings, too - 6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz, and they were all terrible. I won't try this flavor again, or other novel flavors by Green Mountain.

review/text: The flavor and smell doesn't so much as hit you over the head, but elicits an emotional response through one's olfactory senses. Brewing the coffee creates the warmth and smell of a donut shop on a cold's winter morning. Mind you, this is not for those who are looking to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer of donuts. The flavor is subtle and elegant. It's flavored coffee - not a Latte, Cappacino, etc..

I must say it does taste very nice- smooth flavor- but if I close my eyes and try VERY hard I do  detect the slightest (and very distant) taste of cinnamon.  My friend could not tell me it had cinnamon in it when she had a cup.  Could it be that the flavor is only in some of the K cups? Simply, a nice cup of coffee (average to good).

review/summary: Cinnamon Roll?! Are you kidding me?
review/text: Yeah, NO. A big no to this one. After enjoying Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry k-Cups for some time, I decided to venture out and try a new cinnamon k-cup. Big mistake! This sucks so hard it's not even funny. There is absolutely no cinnamon here! It's like drinking burnt gas station coffee where you start hating yourself more with every sip, but for some reason you just don't stop. I usually add a little bit of half and half to my coffee and nothing else. Welp, not even half and half PLUS a packet of stevia could save this mess. Tell you what, go love yourself by not buying these hot messes of crap. Try Timothy's instead.

review/text: This is a light roast coffee, so if you are used to the larger brew size, you may want to reconsider.  The cinnamon roll taste is subtle, and leaves no aftertaste as some flavored blends do.  With creamer and sweetening, it is a nice brew with a great aroma.  Just don't close your eyes and expect a tasty cinnamon roll in your mind.<br /><br />Worth it, but with the right expectations.

review/summary: Smells great and that's about it...
review/text: I had never realized how popular Dunkin' Donuts coffee was until I saw all these "donut" k-cup coffee clones.  I've tried Dunkin Donuts, Donut Shoppe and Donut House varieties.  The Donut House flavor is the mildest/smoothest of the 3 with a muted bitter aftertaste and, of the 3, I like it the least.  The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a "cinnamon roll" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.  It did make for a stronger coffee taste but the flavor tasted the same, maybe slightly more bitter.<br /><br />It's not a bad coffee, and I kinda like the milder flavor for evening drinking but if I get it again, I'll stick with the Donut House plain flavor.

As a regular hot cup of coffee, this k-cup fell short of my expectations. But brewed and set aside to cool and then adding ice made this cup of joe much more delicious. The cinnamon flavoring really comes out. If you also felt this coffee was at first "meh", I would recommend trying it over ice and hopefully, it will become "yum" to you too.

review/summary: This is a great tasting coffee
review/text: I love this coffee.  It isn't a super dark roast and there is just the right amount of cinnamon.  Its a coffee you can drink everyday or keep around for that special occasion.  If you are in love with the darker roast or extra bold coffee flavors this isn't the one for you as it has that great coffee taste without the charred taste of over roasted coffee beans.

review/summary: cinnamon coffee
review/text: I found this particular brand to be very weak tasting.  Not only that, but I could not even taste any cinnamon.  At first I brewed the 10 oz. cup size, which was way too weak, and then I brewed the 8 oz. cup size, which did little to improve the boldness or flavor.  One of the weakest brews I have ever tried.

review/text: I LOVE the flavor of this coffee but my normal portion size on my Keurig Brewer must be changed to the next smaller size down or it's like drinking water.<br /><br />The flavor with the smaller portion is really delicious so it's worth having a smaller cup.  I would buy again but for a full size of similar flavor I will stick with Green Mountain Coffee Limited Edition Golden French Toast.

review/summary: Not So Good..
review/text: I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good. It smells incredible when it's brewing but I think that because this isnt a true flavored coffee you come in thinking its going to taste sweet. Its bitter to me and even the  undertones of the cinnamon seem a little tart. I tried even putting creamer and sugar and still found it to be too bitter. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not too good.

review/summary: Ginger Altoids
review/text: My review is regarding cinnamon and ginger Altoids. I began purchasing peppermint Altoids a couple of years ago. Recently, I became acquainted with the cinnamon version. While traveling, I noticed the ginger Altoids in one of the stores off the highway. Between the ginger and cinnamon, I don't know which one I like the best. So, I carry both in my purse and "consume" whichever I get to first. The flavors are so intense; yes, they leave my mouth (and tongue) "afire". However, I eat them until they are gone (no longer than 1/2 a day if I'm idle).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070P9ZE">Altoids Ginger Mints</a>.

review/summary: Ginger for the stomach
review/text: This ginger product is handy. It is easy to carry. I like the taste of ginger but I have found it is excellent to settle a stomach upset if said upset hasn't gone too far. Great for queasy stomachs. It will take several tabs; one or two won't do it. Powered ginger in the bottles at grocery stores work too, using a half teaspoonful of the power with water, but lets face it, powder is tough to carry.Altoids are a handy way to carry a good stomach medicine that tastes good too.

I've tried to stop many times before and it hasn't been worth the horrid side effects of the reflux coming back!  Amazingly they helped me so much that I have gone a month without medicine.

review/summary: Absolutely YUMMY!
review/text: While we were visiting Pigeon Forge, TN we went to the Apple Barn Winery, and they used these for mixing with the wine they made and sold there. I have to say it made the wine taste a lot better than it did without it. I personally am not a wine drinker, but when I tasted the wine mixed with these mixers I was alittle hooked. It gives the wine a nice slushy texture, and it gives the wine a nice strawberry flavoring without over powering the taste. I really liked the addition that this mixers gave to the wine. I have purchased several of these and would love to try other flavors that they have available. I would also suggest the peach flavor<br />for wine, it is also good.<br /><br />I have not tried the Margarita yet but plan to do so in the future. These are soooo good that it has got me to be a somewhat of a wine drinker now, which I have never been before. If you would like alittle bit of a twist to your wine then I would suggest trying these, I don't think you will be disappointed. They are cheap and very tasty.<br /><br />Amazon has the cheapest prices on these, that I have found thus far. The company sells them on their website, but by the time you pay for shipping its a lot more expensive than purchasing it here on Amazon.

It turns out that buying this online is about half the price of retail, so I win both ways (price & availability). I do not add sugar, milk or anything else to this tea. It is wonderful all by itself. However, just one bit of advice: Do NOT remove the bag after brewing. The tea is so mild, that I leave it in the cup the whole time I am drinking the tea.

You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This is the best tea I have ever had. It has a unique fruity flavor that is both tart and a tiny bit sweet at the same time. This is also a really good deal considering that if you buy 80 tea bags from the company's website it would cost 13.95 (not including shipping and handling which costs ~$8) and buying from amazon you get 108 tea bags with cheaper shipping.

review/summary: Love this when I'm sick
review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: Those of you who love black licorice or anise flavor - this is it! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic, it's intense. In my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary! Good for your daily diet but remember this is not a wimpy tea, it's full bodied. And great for your digestive system. Love, Love, Love this tea :)

review/text: I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!

review/summary: Really Great Tea
review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/summary: super yummy sweet taste!
review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/text: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tea! I don't even like licorice, my friend encouraged me to taste it, as she was so pleased with it. I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/summary: Hands down my favorite tea!
review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!
