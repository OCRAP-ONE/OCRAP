review/text: These dark mocha almond granola bars are my new addiction!  They really satisfy your sweet tooth without eating something really bad for you.  I usually have at least a couple of these everyday.  They do make a great snack and really pick you up and satisfy your hunger.  I highly recommend!  Amazon's subscribe and save price is similar to the price I get them at Walmart or Target.  You have got to try these!

review/summary: I LOVE these bars.
review/text: My sister and I are on the Flat Belly Diet from Prevention magazine. The Flat Belly Diet is loosely based upon The Mediteranean (SP) Diet.<br /><br />With that diet I have lost 11.25 pounds and these TLC bars have helped. With the Flat Belly Diet and the Mediteranean Diet you eat a MUFA (mono unsaturated fatty acid. MUFAs are calorie dense. One ounce of salted nuts, or 1/2 avocado have a MUFA, and have about 1/2 of the calories you can have at a meal. Dark chocolate has MUFA too. But Ghiradelli is about the only source for 60% cacao, but there is something in Ghiradeli chocolates that upsets my stomach.<br /><br />These TLC bars have dark chocolate which gives you a MUFA. the fruits and grains fills you up too. Best of all one Of these bars only has 130 calories, and it is much easier to fit in my diet than many of the other MUFA containing foods.<br /><br />If you are looking for a diet; I can Highly recommend either the Flat Belly Diet, or the Mediteranean diet. They are the easiest diets I have ever been on, and best of all the diets are virtually pain free.<br /><br />I am sure you have seen the infomercials that say "eat all of you favorite foods"<br /><br />With this flat belly diet; I really do eat all of my favorite foods. I still have potato chips, ice cream, CocaCola, lasagna, etc within reason, and as long as I eat a food containing a MUFA, and keep my caloric intake down to 1600 calories a day I lose weight. This crazy sounding diet works because of the MUFA. MUFAs provide your body with healthy fats, and these healthy fats keeps you satisfied between meals.<br /><br />I paid $2.99 for a kindle version of the Flat Belly Pocket Guide. I have shed 11.25 pounds and feel much better.

review/summary: On my Bariatric WLS Shopping List
review/text: I had RNY gastric bypass 08/2010.  Once I passed the 6-month milestone, I was able to gradually add back in foods like granola and items with 6g of sugar or less.  I was over the moon happy to have found Kashi.  This is a great flavor, but I also love Trail Mix, Peanut Peanut Butter, and Honey Almond Flax - these 3 are sold in a variety pack together.  The protein content is great, ranging from 5 to 7 grams of protein per bar, with low sugar, and very healthy ingredients.  These bars are a staple on my grocery list.  Very WLS friendly for the Bariatric lifestyle.  I mean, an egg has 7g of protein, this is an amazing product. I have been using this item since Feb 2011 and have experienced no adverse health issues and they have not derailed my progress.  I even wrote Kashi and thanked them for being so dedicated to what they believe in.  Go Kashi, I support you!!!

review/text: These have to be the best chewy granola bars by kashi, the best in my opinion.  You can taste everything that it says it tastes like.  You taste mocha, dark chocolate and in every bite there is a piece of yummy crunch almond.  It is just bliss in your mouth.  130 cals a bar and 3.5 grams of fat is not bad at all, better then a candy bar and healthy as well.

review/text: After reading the reviews you would have thought this was a great tasting product! Right? It's a step above a plain rice cake with a few mini chocolate chips! That's it! I read all the review and thought this was a no brainer and I purchased 4 boxes. I gave a few to my office associates and got their opinion too! When you open of package it smells like dark mocha. When you bite into it we thought it had no flavor and at best was like a plain rice cake!  One person thought it tasted like "dirt". And after thinking about it a while I agree! Dry texture and dry mocha flavor. Well, you be the judge. I think all the positive reviews were from those who have been locked up for a while and recently released or those who think rice cakes are delicious!!

review/summary: Helpful in Recovering from C. Diff.
review/text: Praise God for this wonderful tea!  Overuse of antibiotics led to the development of a horrible intestinal infection called Colostridium Dificile, or C. Diff. for short.  Along with probiotics, I found this tea to be immensely helpful in easing digestion discomforts associated with post-infection symptoms of C. Diff.  I have kept the tea in the house since when I eat something that makes me feel a little too full or not quite right.  It helps to soothe my tummy, eliminate any bloating or discomfort, and allows me to get to bed easily.  I would highly recommend this tea!  Sometimes you can get it much cheaper, though, when it goes on sale at Kroger or other stores.  I last purchased it with a coupon and on sale for around $1.50/box.

I use it for occasional relief of bloating or mild heartburn especially if I have eaten a little too much spicy food. It has a calming effect on my stomach. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes to brew depending on how strong you need it. Even though it has a pleasant taste on its own I like to add a little honey to enhance the favor. Highly recommended for occasional upset stomach.

review/text: I had a half package of Garofalo Farfalle Whole Wheat Bow Tie Pasta in my pantry and It's so old I can't remember where I got it. Probably it goes back to when I shopped at Trader Joe's (about 5 years ago) and used to buy lots of their whole wheat pastas. No problem. The pasta was sealed in an air-tight container and showed no signs of age or deterioration. It's good to have things with such long shelf lives! In any case, it cooked up well in about 15 minutes and I mixed it with some creamy portobello mushroom soup. Mmmmm good. Nice mix. Delicious. Real good pasta, although I'm going to have to admit that I prefer the white to the whole wheat.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Weird, but tasty!
review/text: I was at Central Market looking for an energy drink when I came upon several six-packs of Canfield's sodas (Chocolate Fudge, Swiss Creme, and Chocolate Cherry). Feeling adventurous, and knowing that since the sodas are calorie-free I really had nothing to lose, I bought one of each. I had heard horror stories about them mixed in with raving accounts of them, and I wanted to see for myself just how bad (or good) they were.<br /><br />This is the first one I tried. I just don't understand anyone calling it "the most terrible thing I've ever tasted;" the chocolate flavor is light, almost subtle. The best way to describe it is "carbonated Yoo-Hoo." I hear it tastes especially good with a splash of milk or soymilk...I might give that a shot. Even if you can't agree that it's tasty, you at least gotta concede that it's *unique*.

It tastes exactly as I remember, chocolatey but not too strong, and it's not overwhelmingly sweet either. I think it's pretty darned good, and I don't normally care for diet soda. If I had to liken the flavor to something, it reminds me a bit of chocolate tootsie rolls. If you like those and you're looking for a diet soda to help to satisfy your sweet tooth, give these a shot.

review/text: I love this stuff.Unfortunately you can almost never get it in California(the 99 cent store had it for a short time,but sold out quickly and hasn't had it for several months).Fortunately.I was able to get it through Amazon with free shipping.I now have six cases and I'm a happy camper.Shipping was pretty quick too.This soda satisfies my need for a chocolate taste but has no calories.Paul Koenig

review/summary: canfield's soda chocolate fudge diet
review/text: delivered well packaged and protected in easy to store flat.  gread choc. flavor not leaving any after taste. contains aspartane......and NO sodium. I am pleasantly suprised because i thought diet rite cola's were the only diet soda without sodium.  WW friendly for sure and takes the edge off for the chocolate taste. i will also try a ice cream float using sugar free ice cream. the can says low cal. the nutritional info on the can shows zero calories and of course zero nutritional value. will purchase again if the price is right.  i was also suprised the contents was fizzy and not flat. this is my 3rd can since delivery and i am still pleased with the purchase. MY DAUGHTER JUST TRIED A CAN AND GIVES IT THUMBS UP AS WELL.I'M GOING TO TRY AN EXPERIMENT AFTER READING MULTIPLE COMMENTS ABOUT ADD HALF AND HALF ECT.  I'M GOING TO ADD SOME FAT FREE OR SUGAR FREE COOL WHIP TO A COUPLE OUNCES OF SODA, MIX IT UP, THEN ADD THE REST OF THE SODA TO THE GLASS...DONT KNOW HOW IT WILL TURN OUT LOL

review/summary: Have always loved this drink
review/text: I ran into one six pack of Canfield's diet fudge in the local market and grabbed it; hadn't seen a can for years since it is no longer carried in my town. The market had no idea how it got on their shelf but the computer checkout system was able to generate a price. Yum! And nostalgia. Market had no way to order more so I checked Amazon and they had it. Not only that, it was less than three dollars per six pack and that included shipping. I am now the proud owner of sixteen six packs but the supply is diminishing rapidly.<br /><br />I chill the cans in the refrigerator and pour in a glass to drink. I put some heavy whipping cream (not yet whipped) in the glass first. It takes the fudge drink from superb to stellar. Of course it plays havoc with the idea of diet.<br /><br />I hope you all order this product and lots of it. We need to convince Canfield's to get six packs back on the shelves of local stores so we can grab some whenever we need to. The price is higher than when I bought it so I'm going to have to pace myself. I can only hope that my re-acquired addiction doesn't drive me to the poor house.

review/summary: Fantastic! (especially with a little half & half)
review/text: This chocolate soda is absolutely fantastic.  It fends off the cravings for sweets very easily with its smooth taste.  Mix in a drop of half & half (or light cream) and it tastes like a carbonated chocolate milkshake with 1/5th the calories.  Wonderful stuff - hard to find though.

review/summary: Diabetic Friendly + Makes a GREAT Ice Cream Float
review/text: I have type 2 diabetes and love chocolate but it's very hard to find a  reasonably priced chocolate that I can eat without feeling like I'm slowly killing myself.<br /><br />Awhile back I remembered that Shasta brand used to make a chocolate soda when I was a kid that I really liked so I looked around and found this brand.<br /><br />I like the taste of this cold from the can but add a half a cup of no sugar added vanilla ice cream and it's really delicious! Better to me than a rootbeer float.<br /><br />It's beyond wonderful to be able to indulge and not have my blood glucose spike or feel like I have to slog through an extra half hour on the treadmill.<br /><br />So long as I can get my hands on this, I'm going to keep buying.

Other than that, because i am on a healthy diet with exercize, the Canfields diet chocolate fudge soda provides the  sweet that i need in the evening when i am craving it the most.

My husband had never heard of it and was very negative. Then very shocked at how good the flavor was. It works plain on ice. I use it for a ice cream float and also as a mixer for Medifast in a blender with ice. Perfect way to get a chocolate fix without the calories.

review/summary: Lots of things are DIET and CHOCOLATE
review/text: This rates so-so. It tastes like mineral water with chocolate syrup.<br /><br />The pros:<br />No salt<br />No calories<br /><br />The cons:<br />Little flavor, I mean..fudge? No. I don't even think the flavor is heavy enough for me to use it as a mixer with vodka, which is how I usually dispose of my least-loved diet sodas.<br />No caffeine (though I could see how for some that might be a plus?)<br /><br />If you want chocolate, it's seriously worth it to get 70% or higher dark chocolate and quench your craving. Sometimes I eat a couple of my daughter's M&Ms and I want to turn to the bag like some sort of crazy ravenous chocolate eating beast. But. If I go to the kitchen and eat a square of dark chocolate, all that ends. It's done, you know? It's just over.

Little by little I can say that I am addicted to the texture and taste of these bites.  I hope that they keep up the quality of this product.  Gluten free is not a need for me but does not hurt the flavor at all and so a plus for me.

review/summary: Seneca> Quaker
review/text: I've been eating Quaker oatmeal all my life and have tried almost every flavor.  About three months ago, I went to the grocery store to get some more Quaker instant oatmeal bowls.  I then spotted Seneca Farms oatmeal and noticed the "just heat up, no need to add water" message on it.  This really peaked my interest because with the Quaker bowls, I had to go to a coffee maker at work in the morning to get hot water into it from another office to make my oatmeal.<br /><br />Since I had never heard of Seneca before, I grabbed a couple cases to give it a shot.  Let me tell you that the very next day I went back to the grocery store and stocked up on them and have not touched Quaker since.  Yes, its that good.  What really sells is it just goes straight in the microwave for less than a minute.  The apples in the Seneca bowl are a lot chunkier than the ones in Quaker.  I usually have two bowls every morning at work.  This was without a doubt the best oatmeal I've ever eaten.  Absolutely no complaints and only having to heat it up in microwave makes it better.<br /><br />I've also tried their new flavors Apple Cranberry and Maple & Brown Sugar.  The Maple & Brown Sugar doesn't seem sweet enough for me and taste sort of bland, but Apple Cranberry is their best flavor. Apple Cinnamon is awesome, but Apple Cranberry will knock your socks off. I don't know if those two flavors have reached any stores yet, since I had to order mine online from Seneca's website.  I've inquired the local grocery that I visit to get the oatmeal to add the two new flavors and I'm happy to report that they are in the process of adding it to their shelves.<br /><br />Hopefully more stores in my area get Seneca on their shelves because it is really good oatmeal.  So far, only one grocer (Shoppers) stocks it but I'm going to spread the word to my other local grocers.  I have to drive a good distance to get to the only stores that do sell them.

No aftertaste and the black cherry flavor is sweet and unique. Makes you want to turn away from diet coke forever. Good in the can but even better ice cold in the bottle.

I recently had to order more as my son is home from college and has also discovered their great taste!

review/text: I LOVE the 100 calorie packs!My favorites are the Sunchips,the Teddy Grahams,and now the LD shortbreads!<br /><br />In my town,it's hard to get any of the popular 100 calorie packs,like the Cheetos,Sunchips,or Hostess carrot cakes because they always sell out.But the Teddy Grahams and Lorna Doone shortbreads never seem to sell here,so I always have plenty.<br /><br />I try to limit myself to one pouch a day,but somedays I might have 2 because they are so good!

I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either. You should try them. They taste great without the extra junk in them.  My kids love them 2 :)

review/summary: Do not feed to kids
review/text: They have changed the ingredients from the original 1900s recipe to using today's refinery based ingredients. My 3.5 year old son was fed these for a snack at church and he became incredibly irritable and violent the rest of the day. He was hitting other kids and his parents for no reason the rest of the day. He also had a horible sleep that night. He has a known corn sensitivity but no one expected that "shortbread" would have corn in it. It has the worst kind of corn which is high fructose corn syrup. That stuff is horrible for kids and based on my experiences with my son I think it causes a large amount of the behavior problems that kids have. Avoid this product until they remove the HFCS and go back to cane sugar.

review/summary: Mary Washington Asparagus Seeds - Asparagus Officinalis - 2 Grams - Approx 120 Gardening Seeds - Vegetable Garden Seed
review/text: I purchased these seed from Amazon to start an asparagus bed.  I planted 40 seeds (approximately 1/3 of the package) one each, in peat pellets and then placed them in an old aquarium 38 of the 40 germinated. I did a lot of reading online and was expecting a very low germination rate as most website said it was practically impossible to grow asparagus from seeds at home. This was a far better germination ratio than I expected they are all continuing to grow and thrive, Although I did lose about 15 plants to my wife's cat,(he ate the green tops).  He heartily approves of the asparagus and enjoys the flavor.<br />The price very good as most online nurseries would have charged of $150 for the number of plants I have now grown at a cost of 3 dollars.

review/summary: Perfectly TERRIBLE
review/text: My office has been using a Flavia Fusion machine for a number of years now, maybe longer. During that time, we ordered our coffee from a company in North Carolina that sold us Flavia brand coffee. It was perfectly passable, and we never received any complaints from our guests.  Recently, however, Flavia suspended their name brand production and out-sourced to a company called "Alterra," which none of us had ever heard of.<br /><br />I am convinced they are either selling us coffee that has gone bad, or that is absolutely of the worst possible quality. It is difficult to belief that what they have sold us can even be called coffee. It is sour, flat and frankly painful to drink. Needless to say, we've thrown out our old Flavia machine and switched to a different model.  We've probably invested $75 in coffee that we are throwing away without any hesitation.<br /><br />To the folks at Flavia, and especially at Alterra: you aren't fooling anyone. I hope you don't trick anyone else into buying this junk. You should be ashamed.

review/summary: Makes a surprisingly good cup of coffee. Simple and good.
review/text: We have friends and when we go there for dinner, the meal is always amazing. However, at the end of the meal, the coffee and tea were always uninspired - weak, lukewarm and flavorless. Then one day they served coffee from the Flavia machine and things changed for the better. The coffee was smooth, hot and full of flavor. We immediately went out and bought one of these wonderful coffee machines and have been using it ever since. In fact, I bought a second one for work. And while the big, big boss made fun of my "instant coffee machine", he often came by with empty cup in hand to "borrow" a cup.  QED...<br /><br />This blend is one of their best. It is a mild roast with lots of flavor and doesn't have a lot of acid so you can safely drink a few cups during the day.<br /><br />It has a good coffee aroma, gives a nice caffein lift and is dark and rich looking in teh cup.<br /><br />No, it's not on par with Starbucks' best but it is quick, simple, inexpensive, cleans up immediately and that should be all anyone needs from a morning cup.

review/text: We have two small Yorkies. They are like our children, and we sure do pamper them, most of the items I buy on Amazon and are on my list are doggie treats. We first bought these for a higher price at a well known pet store. We bought the filet mignon flavor.<br />Then I went online to see where I could get them cheaper.  Thank you Amazon, you are always there when we need you.<br />We want to give our girls nothing but the best and only treats that have good ingredients and are made in the USA this is very important to us.<br />We buy the regular size pack of 6 and then I easily cut them into thirds. Boy does it help, the treat is a great size for them, and they love them. They even smell good to us!<br />Thanks Amazon for carrying these wonderful healthy treats for those of us who love our pets.

review/summary: Basic Orange Herb Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****

review/text: I've been backyard sugarin for several years and this filter clears the syrup like nothing else and is reusable.  It is large and you do need to figure out a home set up, it's easy enough to use and washable/reusable.  Our syrup was the best it's ever been this year!  Filtering throughout the process is key and for $14, it's well worth the investment.  We set it over a coffee pot with spout, work in small batches so the syrup doesn't cool and you have a spout to fill jars.  You could use a cone colander/sieve/strainer as well, probably could pick up in an antique store cheap.

review/summary: Nice Filter
review/text: This past season was my first sugaring experience.  I was happy with this filter, it took out a lot of sediment and crystals for a pretty nice syrup. I would wet the filter with warm water before running the warm syrup through it and it worked effectively. This is tall and skinny and I didn't have anything to really hold it up, so actually filtering took a bit of coordination.  I somewhat wish I had a shorter fatter filter, but haven't seen any out there. I cleaned it quickly each time I used it, but by the end of the season with the darker syrup it did get some staining. I will consider getting the filter liners for next season and maybe something that will hold it in place for me (if that exists).

review/summary: Homesteading your own, a must have.
review/text: I ordered this filter after using cheese cloth and other methods of making my syrup clear and free of debris. I didn't want to spend any money on a product that won't help me be self sufficient. So I bought it, and I was amazed by it with my first small 2 quart batch. So I washed it in the washer, bad idea, it held onto some soap and my next batch tasted soapy. So I suggest always wash this by hand, and don't use soap every time. Be sure to clean it out very good as it will hold old debris if not cleaned well. It does hold onto a cup or more of syrup, I dip it back into the next batch of syrup gently to transfer some of the old syrup sugar back into the new batch. DO NOT REVERSE it or turn it inside out to do this. Gently dip it in... Glad I made this purchase, it has helped me make a great end product. Modern Pioneer

Also, I'm gassier when I eat these than with other similar products. Dr John's xylotol-sweetened hard candy does not have these problems. I hope Xyla sorts out these issues.
