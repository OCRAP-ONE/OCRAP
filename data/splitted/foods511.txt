review/summary: Great tea once you acquire the taste for it
review/text: One review said this tea tasted like dirt which, in all respect, tastes more like grass that has been in dirt.  As funny as that review was, Oolong tea is an acquired taste much like coffee or other teas.  Once you've acquired the taste, it's actually one of the better oolong teas I've tasted and probably one of the most genuine.  You get 100 bags for under $10; you can't beat that.

review/summary: Great tasting & good quality
review/text: You can find this tea for just over $5.00 in many Asian food markets.  It is well worth the cost.  This is a great tasting tea.  I have had some oolong/wulong teas that tasted like steeped twigs.  This is not one of them.  If you steep this tea for less than 3 minutes, you can still get a good tasting cup of tea from a second brewing with the same tea bag.  If you don't microwave (or boil) your tea water with the tea bag in it, you can even get a pretty decent third cup of tea!  You'll find that when you are brewing a pot of tea for yourself & friends, you will only need 1 or 2 bags to make a whole pot!

review/text: I found this tea at my health food store about a year ago. I bought it to make kombucha but I enjoy drinking it as well. I recently looked for it at the store and it was missing. I'm glad I found it at Amazon. The price is close to what I paid at the store.<br /><br />I have tried many different oolongs from an online tea company. This tea is characteristic of the biscuity quality found in many oolongs. It isn't astringent. Sweetener is not needed. It is a very good tea for every day.

review/text: I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, and Chai tea. This tea is nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on Amazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being the lightest. I've never had oolong tea in a restaurant so I can't compare to that but I didn't find it to taste like dirt.

review/text: Prince of Peace has hit it out of the ballpark with this economical organic Fujian Oolong tea in unbleached bags.  This is consumed throughout the day in my home and we are not in the least bit jittery as often happens with the semi-fermented type of tea that nears black in its caffeine content.  Amazon offers the best price so far and we highly recommend the Prince of Peace Organic Oolong in the 100 count box!

review/text: I purchased this tea a few months ago, and have been loving the flavor of it. However, of the 40 tea bags I've used, 4 have not been completely sealed along the side of the tea bag, causing tea to spill everywhere when I open the package or to leak pieces of tea leaves into my cup. With the price and taste, the tea's certainly still worth it, but you may need to be careful when you open the individual tea bags!

review/text: Uh, this tea takes some getting used to.<br />At first I was a little disappointed in the taste but it does grow on you.<br />It has an 'EARTHY' taste and that's just the nicest word I could come up with to replace the word DIRT.  It actually tastes like dirt.<br />(I guess what I mean is that it TASTES the way dirt SMELLS.)<br /><br />Except for the dirt that I've actually eaten and it does taste a lot like that.<br />Nah, it just needs something.<br />Like honey or some other sweetener and then it's pretty good.<br />Then it tastes like SWEET dirt.<br />I swear I'm not trying to be funny.  It's just an interesting flavor.<br />I have steeped it several different ways (sometimes with another flavor of tea) for variety.<br />Like I said, now that I'm 'used' to it, it's actually pretty good. But my senses always take me directly to DIRT when I take that first sip.<br /><br />Enjoy! :)

review/summary: Best oolong tea ever
review/text: I love this tea, it is awesome. I actually was sick and the only tea I had in my house was green and oolong tea. I decided to take the oolong tea and I was shocked that I was feeling better internally and externally, my clothes was fitting me differently. My appetite was curbed alot. I hardly was hungry. I honestly drink 4-6 cups of this tea a day and still drinking it till this day. I haven't hopped on the scale yet I am going to wait until next month to see how much weight I have lost. Since my cold is over with I will start back going to my Zumba classes this week and I am pretty sure the results will be more outstanding. And of course eating clean that is the most important factor when losing weight. So I decided to have 2 cups of oolong tea before each meal. I will have oolong tea in my diet forever. It is a must especially if you want to lose weight and don't forget the fabulous health factors also.

The pricing on this product was too good to pass up, so I thought I would give it a try.  It is not bad at all.  The aroma is not as rich as a good loose leaf tea, but this tea is very flavorful.  Quite delicious actually.<br /><br />One tea bag provided several cups of good rich tea.<br /><br />I am very happy with my order, and I would highly recommend if you are looking for an Oolong bagged tea.<br /><br />Thank You!

review/text: I was expecting this tea to have somewhat of a bitter taste to it just because of its name.  Boy was I WRONG!!!  This tea can easily be consumed with or without sugar.  I prefer it without sugar, but when I want a sweet taste to it, I'll just add one packet of Sweet & Low.  My energy picks up in about 30 minutes (after drinking the cup of tea) and lasts for approximately 2 hours!!!  You can't beat that at all!!!  Doesn't give me the caffiene jitters that my coffee does.  Now I just substitute one cup of coffee for one cup of Oolong Tea!!!

review/summary: Good oolong for the price
review/text: This review is for PoP Oolong tea bags. My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly.

review/text: I was so immensly disappointed.  I was hoping to get the same tea that they serve in the chinese restaurants and kept being told that it was oolong tea.  I finally found it on Amazon and to my disappointment it did NOT taste the same!  Actually it was a bit bitter and now I have all of this tea I know it will take me forever to drink because of the flavor..  Was not happy..  :(

review/summary: terrible
review/text: If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic!

review/summary: Moist , Tender, and Tasty!
review/text: I've tried other brands of sun-dried tomatoes and these are definitely the best! They are moist and tender strips of tomato with a nice sun-dried taste. I use them in cold summer salads and as a tasty addition to pasta dishes and casseroles. The contents of one package is just the right amount for most recipes, but the resealable pouch allows you to use as much as you want and save the rest.

review/text: These are delicious sun dried tomatoes and a better value than those in jars in the grocery. We use them to add bold flavor to pasta and salads. We even eat them right out of the bag. And the bag makes them portable. I take them to work and we can throw them in our picnic basket or backpack without the weight of a jar. They are moist from the bag and not heavy with olive oil as most are packed. I strongly recommend them :)

review/summary: Best I've found
review/text: I've tried about every sun dried tomato product I can find locally. And these are by far the best.<br /><br />Far better than the imported brand at the big box store.<br /><br />For a different twist, make your own sun dried tomato in olive oil recipe, don't buy the pre-mixed variety at stores. Simply mix these with a little Newman's own olive oil and vinegar dressing, place in a container in the fridge and apply to pasta, salads, etc.. for a tangy tomato taste you'll rarely get with just pasta sauce alone.<br /><br />But then they are also wholly adequate, moist and tender right out of the package.

It's only 5 points+ for a whole bag (for you WW fans). And it's great in pasta.  These are tender, bright and full of great tomato flavor.  It has the texture of a sundried tomato in oil without the grease. Enjoy!!!!

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: For starters, Amazon's ingredients list is wrong about this bar in particular. The chocolate protein bar is completely nut free, so the other two reviewers are incorrect. It's made from sunflower seed butter, brown rice flour, brown rice syrup, chocolate liqueur and coconut sugar. Secondly, it's dairy, gluten, and soy free as well, so of course it'll have a more bitter taste. It resembles dark chocolate more closely; a similar taste to a chocolate powerbar. This bar is amazing. I have many different food allergies, so finding pre-made snack bars that can cater to all of my needs is extremely difficult. The chocolate protein bar fits all of them, and provides me with an easy to grab snack that'll help me get through the day without a nasty sugar crash.

review/text: Thought these would be like a brownie with crunchy nuts but I was wrong! These don't taste like chocolate but like bitter cocoa powder instead. Mine had tiny pieces of nuts unlike their other bars that have bigger nut pieces. My husbands had medium nut pieces. We both are vegan and consume only organic foods so we know what to "expect" but these are awful. They're not even a little bit good, just bad! The peanut butter chocolate chip by this brand is yummy, especially if it's been sitting in a hot car or out in the sun for a bit :)

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I drank Lipton's regular black tea for years before all these gourmet tea happened and looks like Lipton's has finally come to the gourmet tea party.<br /><br />I bought this mainly to see how the pyramid tea bags performed, and they performed great. The problem with flat tea bags is that it's difficult for the tea leaves to infuse freely due to the constraints of the shape, but these pyramid bags work great! Only problem is that each pyramid is not individually wrapped, therefore you must put them in a tight container to prevent leakage of flavor or drink all 20 bags quickly.<br /><br />As to the tea, it's advertised mainly as Bavarian wild berry flavor, and there is a lot of that, but actually you can taste a lot of hips flavor as well. Not surprising since the ingredients also contain rosehips, chicory root, cinnamon bark and licorice root. Just to let you know that it's not all berry flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I like this a lot and would buy it again.

They arrived today, and i've already had a cup of each (hey, it is snowing, so a great day for them!)....great flavor, great deal and even plan to give a few boxes to tea loving friends.

review/text: the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag.

Wonderful tea flavor, great black tea flavor, it's not overly fruity or very sweet, it has just the right balance of a fruit/black tea.  The tea pyramids never lose their shape.  It's great iced.  It has real pieces of fruit and big tea leaves inside the pyramids.  Definitely one of the best teas I've ever drank (but the very the best teas are very expensive hand-picked leaves ordered from specialist tea websites and brewed by spoon-full.)

review/text: In attempts to cut down on my soda and coffee intake, I have decided to drink tea. Not only is it more healthier for my body, but there are so many more choices and flavors to choose from! I originally found out about the Lipton pyramid tea bags and I was totally intrigued with it. I then found out about all the many different flavors they had. I took a chance with the Bavarian Wild Berry flavor even though I have never tried it before. Amazon offered a good deal so I couldn't pass it up. After a box completed (5 more to go!), I can definitely say that I have made the right decision.<br /><br />This tea I mainly drink cold. I find the flavor to be too strong when I try to drink it hot. It is one of the best ice teas I have ever drank in my life. Also, you do not have to add sugar to this tea if you are drinking it cold.<br /><br />I'm definitely relieved because if all teas taste this good, I'll never have to drink soda again.

review/summary: May Be Your Cup of Tea
review/text: I love this company's green tea.  I use the tea bags twice and have 2 cups of tea a day.  Some of their flavored green teas are wonderful, too like the raspberry and decaf mandarin orange.  Green tea is so healthy for you and it's great to enjoy an afternoon or after-dinner hot drink.  Love the artistry of the boxes--that's what caught my attention.  I tried some and have stayed a loyal customer enjoying sampling their different teas.  It's good with a drop of lemon in it, too, and may enhance its benefits.

review/text: If you need these cherries other than close to the holiday season, e.g. to make an English Christmas Cake and give it time to mature, Amazon appears to be the only source. I now have enough of these for several years' worth of cakes, but I would have preferred to buy just one tub. Even better would be to have a grocery store that stocked such cherries year round. Sigh!

review/summary: My new favorite snack
review/text: I purchased a bag of the Butter flavor at an Ocean State Joblot store.  I loved them.  I went back a few days later to purchase some more and they were sold out (they had a few cases of them, surprised they were all gone).<br /><br />Luckily, I hadn't finished the bag at home and went to the website and it told me they were available on Amazon.<br /><br />Best part was that they gave a free small bag of the Kettle Corn flavor in my Butter flavored case and guess which case I am ordering next?  Yup, the kettle corn were even better than the butter.<br /><br />My kids love them.  They are a mix of popcorn, tortilla chips and rice/corn cakes.  Not messy or greasy either.<br /><br />Definitely my new favorite snack. Thanks Medora Snacks.

review/summary: Good flavor, not my favorite
review/text: The San Francisco Bay Colombian Supremo has a noticeable coffee flavor to it. If you're like me you doctor your coffee with cream and sugar and sometimes (I'm talking to you, Chock Full of Nuts) that comforting coffee taste and aroma can be overcome by the C&S. Not so here. The flavor stands up to the competition in the cup and tastes just right any time of day. This isn't my FAVORITE coffee, but it could be yours. It's absolutely worth trying.

review/summary: Best black licorice there is!
review/text: This 16 ounce order from SweetGourmet surprisingly came in a transparent, thin plastic bag, like it was packaged from bulk or something. Gourmet licorice contains licorice oil that smears the inside of the bag, so it looked pretty ugly by the time I opened it (I had intended to give it as a gift to someone who loves licorice). However, it was the SOFTEST of this brand that I had ever had, even softer than the ziploc bags that have the Kookaburra name and logo on them. I think SweetGourmet has the best price to weight ratio for this item, too. I will certainly order from them again.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is. This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture. I would not buy Kookaburra brand again.

review/summary: Tasty, but
review/text: It does taste good, but like others, I had an issue with the packaging.  The bag and label have no nutritional data--at all.  I'm on a diet and one of my kids has food allergies.  So I'm guessing at the calorie content, and won't give any to my licorice-loving son because I don't know exactly what's in it.  I have no data on where it was made or packaged. You have to be ridiculously trusting to start eating. But it looked good, so I tried it.  The taste is what I was looking for, but without ingredients or caloric info, I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: One of the best licorice
review/text: I don't like any kind of licorice, I got this item for my girlfriend because since she travelled to Spain many years ago, she tasted a true black licorice and in Mexico it's really hard to find. So as usual amazon was my solution and bought this, and I she loved it, and even I tasted it and it has a great taste, it changed my mind about licorice.

review/summary: Contains wheat ingredients
review/text: Not a treat for anyone who is sensitive or allergic to gluten. The first two ingredients are wheat flour and wheat glucose syrup. (My wife was soooo disappointed when I told her the rest of the bag was hers!) That being said this is a soft, chewy licorice with a definite molasses undertone. I find the combination of flavors interesting- not my choice of an "everyday" licorice but I'm keeping this one on my Food wishlist.<br /><br />NB:  The packaging is confusing but within Amazon's disclaimer (whatever it is, it's not our problem). Sweet Gourmet apparently buys Kookaburra Australian Black Licorice in bulk then sells it in "store brand" packaging. This seems to have upset some other reviewers but there're no conspiracies here, just business. Also note the company's web address is simply &lt;...>.

review/summary: Kookaburra Australian Licorice,
review/text: I find that this licorice, is one of the most delicious that I have had in many years.  The only thing that ever came close to this when I remember buying it back in the 1950s which was produced by a different company.  The only drawback that I see is that I think it's quite expensive.  As I figured each 16 ounce bag comes to about $10.50 each I myself purchased four of those bags.  And of course let's not forget the shipping that is not included.  I think in the future I'm going to look for a company that sells in larger quantities, because sometimes it's cheaper to buy in bulk as opposed to little individual bags, and also many times shipping is included.

The licorice arrived in an unlabelled plastic bag, but the bag was clean (unlike what another reviewer received), and the product arrived four days after I ordered it.  I will definitely be ordering Kookaburra licorice again!
