review/summary: There aren't even real oranges in here.
review/text: And the tea lacks a citrus-y scent unless you add water to it. When water is added, the scent and taste are slightly reminiscent of canned mandarin oranges. This tea is better than your usual Lipton tea, but only by a little: The leaves are bigger, and not as oxidized.<br /><br />There are no oranges in this tea, just peaches and mangoes, with natural mandarin orange flavor. As others have mentioned before, the teabags are indeed made from plastic, and if you drink with your teabags in, you risk drawing out a plastic taste in the tea. I have, and it made the rest of the tea undrinkable.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, and skip this tea. Find another brand instead of giving Lipton money for this joke of a tea.

review/summary: Best. Green Tea. Ever!
review/text: I *love* this tea - it's delicious. There's the right delicate green tea flavor (without tasting grassy) and a gentle orange overtone. I've put it on subscribe and save, because I drink it every day. Hot in the winter, Iced in the rest of the seasons.<br /><br />DELICIOUS! Lipton hit a home run here! It's MUCH better than Lipton's previous traditional tea-bag version of an orange-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Try it. Love it.

review/text: I'm trying to replace my diet soda with tea. I've decided that artificial sweeteners are likely to be bad for my health but I drink a lot of fluids and am not a fan of water. Juice and milk are too high in calories. So I decided to drink iced tea. After months of plain iced tea I decided to start trying flavored teas after my son mistakenly used some to brew a pitcher of iced tea and I found I loved it. (He's a good kid) So I bought this and it is great! I can't tell you how happy I am to have found an alternative to diet soda that works for me without adding to my calorie count!

review/text: The tea tastes great, no complaints there at all.  Actually, the tea is delicious, and probably a good way to introduce friends that otherwise might be reluctant to drink green tea.  My only concern is whether the tea bag itself is recyclable and/or can be composted.  It would be great if Lipton or someone could respond to this review.

review/summary: Utterly delicious!
review/text: Fantastic flavored tea, green or not!  I have it every morning and never get tired of it with a little honey and lemon.  I actually mix it with the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZPO">Lipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gives it more body for the AM to make a kind of chai tea mix similar to Constant Comment but with the greater benefits of green tea.  I must be square:  I confess I really depend on the flavor of Lipton tea.<br /><br />Here's a tip: we used to drink expensive coffee in the morning which would almost always let us down about 11 am.  The switch to green tea has been wonderful and permanent.  I still like having coffee sometimes at about 3 in the afternoon, but in the morning tea works infinitely better for the middle-aged set.  Still gives us a nice caffeine kick for breakfast this way.

review/summary: Bleh...
review/text: Immediately after opening a box of Lipton Mandarin Orange tea, I had a feeling it would not be good.  The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?).  I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells.  I was correct.  The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL.  I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better.  It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies.  I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.  If you enjoy eating orange Tums and drinking tasteless tea, go ahead and purchase this one.  Otherwise, stay away!

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: Bought this in lieu of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OJC">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Tangerine Orange Zinger, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> when the store was out of it. The Celestial Seasonings' Orange Zinger is an herbal 'tea' that has such a great orange tang flavor, and even smells nice right out of the box. This Mandarin Orange green tea replacement from Lipton doesn't have that nice smell in the bag. When brewed even a long steep yields a pretty clear cup of hot water with a pleasant orangy aroma but virtually no flavor. When sweetened it tastes like sweetened hot water. The nice smell made me really want to like it, so I tried two of the pyramid bags in a regular cup. With the two bags and a good 5 minute steep it actually came out halfway decent - better, but not great.<br /><br />Also didn't care for the inclusion of Modified Corn Starch in the ingredients nor the plastic material of the pyramid bag. It might even be the plastic bag hindering the proper propagation of the tea while steeping. This is my first experience with Lipton's pyramid teas and will be the last unless another flavor comes along as a freebie and can change my mind. I'll stick to Twinings and Celestial Seasonings, both of which I highly recommend.

review/summary: The Elusive Mandarin Orange and the Search for the Last Great Panda King
review/text: Mandarin Orange, such a remiscent joy, reminds me of our search for last of the Great Panda Kings.<br /><br />It was the Winter of 1935, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, our regular liaison with the Crown, informed us of an outlandish tale relayed to him by one of his Chinese servants.  Pyung Li, who in his formative years, had traveled up the Yangtze River to Wuhan, a small provincial village established during the Han Dynasty.  Pyung Li recalled stories the locals told of an ancient race of "Bear-Men", (silly Pyung Li, as all educated men are well aware that the Panda is not a bear at all, which is why Pyung Li was a servant), who lived further along the banks of the Yangtze River.  Pyung Li spoke in abject horror of the actions the so called "Bear-Men" (stupid Pyung Li) perpetrated among the locals, sordid details of which decorum prevents in such a noble forum as this one.  Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, as many nobles, a fine swordsman, a notorious womanizer and a lover of treasure, was seduced by the tale of glorious fortunes held on by the Bear-Men.  "But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale", Pyung Li quivered, "the one call 'Panda King', he no return traveler alive, they say, Panda King make suit out of inside of traveler".<br /><br />But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale would not be persuaded, as the great treasure he sought, would definitely be his.<br /><br />Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale offered us Pyung Li's as a our guide for our perilous journey up the Yangtze River.  I requisitioned my usual crew, Boson's Mate Micklegal and First Mate Tignor, the most trusted of my crew.  We packed up the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendhish and so it was that we set sail for the Far East.<br /><br />Many weeks later, we found ourselves alone on the River Yangtze, seeking the treasure of the Great Panda King.  Pyung Li shivered in horror as the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish inched further up the river, her hull softly swaying in the friscilating dusk.  "Boson's Mate Micklegal", I shouted, "all hands on deck!".  "Gather the crew.  Brew us up one of your fine cups of Earl Grey, a tea fit for Kings."  (Everyone knowing well, that Earl Grey, "The Earl", English of course, being the finest of all the teas.).  With the warm deep taste of Earl Grey in our bellies, we almost did not hear the noises along the banks.<br /><br />"Panda King and Bear-Men, he near", Pyung Yung whispered.  "Dammit Pyung Li", bellowed First Mate Tignor, "you are on her majesty's H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, you are in the presence of fine Englishman, will you please speak the language of the Kings in proper grammatical form".<br /><br />"Great Panda King, he know we close, he send scout, he track us!", Pyung Li warned.  And out of the blue, the starboard side of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took on a full assault against it's hull.  The crew of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took up their battle positions, ready for a full on naval assault against the Great Panda King's army.  Boson's Mate Micklegal almost didn't realize the fresh liquid running down his arm until it was too late.<br /><br />"They're throwing bloody fruit at us!", yelled First Mate Tignor.  "Bloody Citrus!"  No one noticed Pyung Li scurry below deck.<br /><br />Before anyone realized, we were all on shore, sitting in front of the "Bear-Men".  In fact, the "Bear-Men" were not bears, nor men, they were cute cuddly Giant Panda bears, chewing on endless reeds of bamboo.  The leader of the Giant Panda's, in fact, the most Giant of them all, was The Great Panda King, the last of his species.  The Great Panda King dropped his bamboo.  With his paw, the Great Panda King rolled the small rounded orange citrus to me.  In his paws, the Giant Panda King took a bite from the rounded small orange citrus and motioned for myself to do in kind.  I did, and I let the luscious citrus run down my throat.  In return, we gave The Great Panda King the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish's only copy of the King James Bible.  We exchanged pleasantries and with that, we were gone.<br /><br />Later on the boat, Boson's Mate Micklegal, always the young ing&eacute;nue, set the green tea leaves given to him by Pyung Li into the kettle along with the zest of three of the small round orange citrus.  We decided to call the small rounded orange citrus a "Mandarin Orange", after the name of First Mate Tignor's favorite style of Chinese cooking.  After four minutes, the entire crew filled their bellies with this delicious green tea concoction.  That night, Boson's Mate Micklegal was supposed to sleep next to the small rounded orange citrus protecting it.  Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal, with an unhealthy addiction to Glen Fiddyich that he found smuggled within the hold, got plastered and did not notice Pyung Li stealing the citrus and sneaking off the H.M.S. Pergrine Cavendish and into the night.<br /><br />When morning came to, we realized we no longer possessed the small rounded orange citrus of our bounty so humbly given up by the Last Great Panda King.  But ever the swift thinker, Boson's Mate Micklegal whipped out the green tea leaves, found some remaining peach and mango from our previous voyage up the Nile, one summer prior and steeped us a damn fine cup of tea.  It was divine.  We loved it so much, we decided to continue calling it "Mandarin Orange" even though we had no "Mandarin Orange's" left.<br /><br />So I thank the hack's at Lipton, for recreating this little masterpiece for all to enjoy.

review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit & Whole Grain Combo, Peach - Oatmeal - Banana<br />This variety was a huge hit with my son and was given to him most every day until about a year and a half. My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go. That's why I'm giving it four stars as opposed to five. Although, I would say this flavor is definitely worth a try for any child who has moved passed the basic stage one foods.

review/text: We call this P.O.B. in my household and it's a standby for a quick snack.  My son is crazy about it!!!  I only wish it came in larger jars.  We'll probably have to move up to one of the 6oz. muesli or oatmeal blends soon.

review/summary: Thicker consistency is much appreciated
review/text: The first prunes are good, but much too runny past 6 months.  The prunes with the oatmeal are much better for older babies who can use their hands to flail around.  These stay on the spoon much better!  It also skips the step of adding cereal grains to the food to make it a different consistency.  Older babies will appreciate the different tastes as well!

review/summary: Must have in every baby food cupboard
review/text: My 3 1/2 month old was eating all the time and reconstituted rice cereal with breast milk just wasn't doing the trick.  After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food.  My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner).  Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far.  It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!

review/summary: Good product, misleading description
review/text: The description clearly states "variety pack", but you only get one flavor- banana apricot mixed grain. Hopefully your baby likes it.<br /><br />The good thing is, my baby, who is quite picky, and would only eat "carrots" and "tomato & carrots" out of the whole line up of earth's best flavors at the local grocery store, actually likes this.<br /><br />What I love about the fruit & whole grain combo (or other things & whole grain combo) is that this is the only way I've found to give my baby some grains without it being fortified with lots of stuff.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!

review/summary: An Ok Berry Gum
review/text: This gum is SUPER TASTY at first and the flavor lasts for a good 10 to 15 minutes, which is beyond typical for most fruit flavored gums.  What keeps me from giving it more stars is the fact it crumbles when you first start chewing, however, it does seem to re-unite it's self again once thoroughly wet.  Also, when the flavor is all chewed out it begins to take on a chemical-plastic-like taste that lingers in your mouth a bit, even after chewing.  I think I will stick with Trident fruit gums.

review/text: LOVE this flavor, and I'm usually a mint-only gum fan (though I did cross the line a few times with mint mojito - still minty but flirting with fruit). Nice berry flavor, good texture, long lasting - I usually end up throwing it away long before it breaks down or loses flavor. I find I can use this flavor as a dessert substitute.<br /><br />I didn't have the crumbly, plastic tasting problem that the other reviewer had with this flavor, though I HAVE had that experience with a spearmint pack that I left in the car too long. This makes me suspect that their gum was exposed to extreme heat and then "re-set" leaving it crumbly and plastic-tasting.

review/summary: Goya Zulka unrefined sugar
review/text: This sugar in my opinion is the best of the unrefined types on the market.  I bought it off the shelf in CA  but after moving to NC  was unable to locate a vendor  so was quite happy to find it at Amazon.com<br /><br />I love the smooth creamy taste of this sugar  and the fact that it doesn't leave my mouth coated  or  burn my gums.

review/summary: Delcious!
review/text: This is a very finely granulated sugar. It works great when creaming sugar and butter together. The sugar has a wonderful aroma. It has a very pretty light beige color. You can't really see it in a picture, but you can tell side by side with refined white sugar that it is light beige. The price is great and the flavor is excellent. It's a very subtle flavor in the foods that no one can really pinpoint. But if you do a side-by-side comparison with a baked product with this sugar and another with refined white sugar, there is just something more "delicious" about the baked good with this sugar. I highly recommend it!

review/text: Purina is the cat's meow.  Seriously.  Any cat I've ever owned has turned its nose up at any other brand - I had to buy Purina or else they would go mouse hunting.<br />Anyway this bag is huge, much bigger than I thought.  Had to share it with other cat owners and still have a huge stash of it.<br />Purina rocks.<br />I didn't buy it from this vendor - my cost was half the price because it was prime shipping (free).

review/summary: Delicious on Caprese Salad
review/text: I drizzled Blaze Balsamic Glaze on caprese salad (fresh sliced mozzarella, fresh Jersey tomatoes, and a little bit of basil) and the Blaze made this salad absolutely delicious and so much easier than making my own balsamic reduction.  I like the easy pour top and can't wait to try it on other dishes.

review/text: I ran across Balsamic Blaze in Target one shopping trip. They never had it again.  I am so addicted to the balsamic glaze for cooking that I had to get more and not wait for Target.  I don't cook with it all the time but when I want some simple balsamic chicken or pork this glaze makes my life so much easier. Trying to make my own reduction glaze always took too much time.  Don't have much time any more.  This simplifies my cooking.

I realize that people have different coffee tastes, but I believe this to be a wonderful product with superb flavor.  I would encourage you to try it.

review/summary: Great taste, seems to be lacking in flavor.
review/text: I was a Senseo user for 7 years plus.  When they went through all there turmoil and the senseo pods were not available anymore I began trying some other brands.  I purchased a top of the line Mr. Coffee and tried store bought coffee.  It was just ok.  Then I looked some more on amazon and realized I could buy the same coffee used in the senseo pod system.  So I tried the Douwe Egberts Rood brand.  I like it.  It has a smooth taste and is very pleasant.  I recommend this highly if you like a smooth taste with no bitterness.  It works well with the old fashion mr coffee maker and sure is a heck of a lot cheaper than senseo pods were/are.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: My family is from Holland so we enjoy many Dutch and German foods.  On a recent trip to visit family, my cousin had Douwe Egberts Coffee in the house.  It's the only brand they drink.  My wife and I loved it.  Great flavor, no bitterness, smooth.  Just what you want in a good cup of coffee.  Great anytime of the day.  The aroma when perking is also great.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  The Aroma Rood is the only one we have tried, but I'm sure the other types are good also.  As you can imagine, Douwe Egberts is very popular in Holland.  Glad we can get it here.  Amazon has the best deal on this coffe that I have found on the internet.

review/summary: Great Cakes!
review/text: These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that.

review/text: Oh, sure.  It's terrific in cookies but, if you really want a treat, try using Ghirardelli's Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips to make a truly delicious hot chocolate!<br /><br />You can take 1/4 cup of chips and melt them in a microwave in 1/2 cup milk.  Stir.  Then add another 1/2 cup milk, although the truly decadent will use half-and-half.  Add a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of red pepper (yeah, you heard me), and two pinches of instant coffee.  Wow!!<br /><br />Ghirardelli has been making exceptional chocolate in the USA for over 150 years.  They take it from the beans all the way to the finished product. Their chocolates are smooth (not grainy).  Very nice!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
