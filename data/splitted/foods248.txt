review/summary: Good raw Snack
review/text: This thing is actually tasty if you can afford it. Each bar costs more than 3billion people in the world's daily income (which is 2 dollars a day). So if you cool with that, which I am, I'm American I have to be. Get the bars. Otherwise your spending you hard earned money for processed food, which is behind that 2 dollar a day income. I haven't seen a superfood bar with better ingredients. Treat your body right for a change with snacks. Like i said, if you can afford it.

When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA is a toxin that INDUCES LUPUS!!! Beware!

review/text: I regularly purchase the power to put in my shakes. That's not the greatest tasting, but it's masked by the other stuff I throw in. But the Chocolate Whole Food Energy Bar is so discusting! Because I bought it and didn't want to waste it, I did eat the entire bar. It will perk you up and give you energy, but I don't think it's worth the horrible taste. I will NOT be purchasing this product EVER again.

review/summary: Dog toy that REALLY entertains!
review/text: I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy.

I only have had it for  a day now but the toy is still in once piece and the disc is still partially there.  He really likes the treat.  I think this is good for dogs who are pretty destructive, I hate spending that much on a toy but if it keeps him from eating the walls I'm happy.

review/text: My 2 year old inteligent Red Heeler had this treat out of the puzzle ball and devoured in about 25 minutes.  However, my 12 year old "not that smart" Chow mix couldn't get the treat out of the puzzle and licked the treat for hours, until the Red Heeler got a hold of it.  So, if you have a "not so smart" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.

review/summary: keeps an aggressive chewer busy
review/text: Update:  Sadly, my pup figured out how to get this treat out of the holder.  He chews with his back jaws and is able to flatten it pretty quickly and then somehow gets it out.  This used to last a day or two but is now only good for an hour or two.  If your dog is not a problem-solver, it can still be a good product but if he figures things out, then it quickly becomes a very expensive 1-2 hour event.<br /><br />Previous Review:  My young dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys (not people!).  He can deconstruct almost any kind of stuffed toy and he can EAT any size of rawhide treat.  Rawhide is a disaster for him because he chews off big chunks and then swallows them.  The rawhide doesn't digest well and the big dummy gets diarrhea.  I was actually worried he was going to get an intestinal blockage from rawhide so we banned the rawhide when we found this product.<br /><br />It is very hard to get the discs into the rubber treat ball.  I have to stand on them and even then they don't seat in very properly.  However, the dog has an equally difficult time getting the treats OUT.  He has to chew sort of sideways on this rounded treat using his back molars.  They must be tasty too because he keeps working on these and they last for days.<br /><br />We will continue to buy this product.  It keeps our pup busy, seems agreeable to his stomach, and compares very favorably to other chewy treats.

review/summary: Our dogs second favorite everlasting treat
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.<br /><br />Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1/4" was demolished, that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.  Takes him 5 minutes to eat three of them now.  Good while it lasted! :)

review/text: I have actually stopped buying these because they are so hard to insert.  I had to use a screwdriver to get it into the toy!  Even my husband had problems getting it into the toy.  We have 2 of these toys-a large one and a smaller one-and the smaller one has already been chewed on by one of our dogs.  Our big dog lost interest after the first couple of times and I just gave up on them.  They do keep the dogs busy, but 20 minutes to insert one treat seems a little too time consuming.

review/text: If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp.

They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat.  These things last about 10mins MAX with them.  I have two types of "holders" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done.  For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else.

They are obviously very tasty because my dog can't get through them fast enough, though it does take him about a week just to finish one of them.

review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans.

review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: The Goodlife Indoors!
review/text: I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

review/text: My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any "throw up" with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the "throw up queens" but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend.

Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!

review/text: I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again.

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/text: This is the second Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday season I have ordered these.  Came quick, good price, taste is excellent and very fresh. The metal box arrived in perfect shape.  One thing to look for is the shape of the cookies changed from last year or from one box size to the other; I don't know which.  Last year I ordered the next smaller box and the cookie shapes were fancier.  In this larger box two of the four "varieties" of cookie are just plain discs.  One of them has a touch more crispness and more sugar according to the literature but it is very subtle.  On the smaller box the illustrations on the side are of snowy scenes by the way.  I would order these again.

review/summary: The very best Shortbread Cookies, IMHO
review/text: I don't generally think of cookies much, but for some reason I have to have these excellent cookies several times a year.  Especially for Advent and Christmas, it just doesn't seem right not to have a lot of these around for everyone to nibble on.  I've tried a lot of different shortbread cookies but these are by far the best.

review/summary: Wonderful tradtiional Scottish Shortbread!
review/text: Wonderful Walkers Premium 'traditional' Scottish Shortbread! Almost the same as my mother's home made Scottish Shortbread. This item was well worth the price for the size. Loved the tin too. Nice way the shortbread was packaged and sealed in individual portions. The shortbread did not last long however too good to not enjoy it with a good cup of tea.

review/summary: Wow this is a ton of yummy cookies....
review/text: First and for most 4.6 lbs of cookies is A LOT of cookies. There are 12 individual packages of cookies 3 of each type in a very nice large tin. Walkers cookies are always yummy and the cookies in this tin are no exception. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was amazing to me during a hospital stay. The tin is very sturdy and is tasteful in its decoration. This would make a perfect gift for any occasion!

review/summary: That's a lot of shortbread cookies
review/text: This Walkers Premium shortbread selection is a huge tin of shortbread cookies. Luckily, they are wrapped in many packages, so they can stay fresh longer. If one is absolutely in love with shortbread cookies, I suppose this would be a good gift. Personally, I thought it was too much shortbread cookies. There are four different ones, but they all taste the same to me. I served them up to a bunch of kids and they didn't like them. I thought they were okay, but I wasn't in heaven over them and certainly don't have a craving for them. They are very buttery, but I find them bland and flavorless. I guess maybe that's what shortbread cookies are all about. These were a gift to my husband. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy them. I'm not too embarrassed to serve them to guests, so that's how we'll get rid of them. Not bad, but not great.

review/summary: A Hit With Half Of The Family
review/text: A friend recently mailed us some of these USDA certified organic fruit strips. My wife and my six-year-old are not fans of this Archer Farms pomegranate product, but my nine-year-old and I gobbled them up. My wife prefers salty snacks, and I think my youngest child just doesn't like pomegranates. Each 14 gram strip contains only 45 calories and has 0 grams of fat, saturated fat, and trans fat. No artificial flavors, synthetic colors, or chemical fertilizers are part of this healthy snack. My only knock against this food product is that they are a bit pricey for such a small item.

review/summary: Bigelow Green Tea Pomegranate K-Cup
review/text: This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea.  It is fruity.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf, tea bags and k-cups. The k-cup makes it all the more enjoyable because it is fast and there is no clean-up.  I think the tea tastes fresh with every cup because it isn't like opening a box and having it sit around waiting for me to use the rest of it. I will definitely purchase this tea k-cup again.

They were packaged in an Altoid-like tin and were the same size, shape and texture as Altoids.<br /><br />I wanted to find a cheaper place to purchase, so I came to Amazon and found these. I assumed they would be the same - just in a roll.<br /><br />They are not the same! The flavor is spot on, but the texture is very chalky and they are as big as life-savers.<br /><br />I would purchase again, but I think I will try to do some more research and find the ones in the tin.

It's like they didn't stir the batch enough, or it settled or something.  One will melt in your mouth and not have much flavor and the next will be rock hard, but have more of the ginger "snap" that I look for.  The Altoid brand is better: more flavor, and more consistent.

review/text: The other, 5-star, review, must be from a shill who is the underlying peddler of this awful product, or else he's an idiot who doesn't know his a** from a hole in the ground.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that this stuff is repulsive.  It has little genuine spicy-pepper flavor or aroma, instead when ground it smells like nauseating dish soap. Plus it comes with about a quarter-inch of the stalk still attached to each berry, which when ground into your food is obviously not helping matters any.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO RECOMMEND ITS USE IN COOKING, which is why the real gourmet spice outlets like Penzey's or Dean and DeLuca don't even bother stocking this garbage.<br /><br />Plus, Amazon will not refund your money if you find it as disgusting as you likely will, so, again, you'll be well advised to steer clear.  Stick with a quality source for Tellicherry or Szechuan.  You're absolutely, positively not missing anything other than throwing away almost $20, like the 5-star moron's review from 3 years ago has caused people to do.

review/summary: My cat loves this
review/text: My cat not only has a sensitive stomach, she's also a very picky eater.  What she loves one day, she'll hate the next.  At one point, I was having to feed her on a schedule of four different types of cat food.  Since discovering this product, however, I only have to feed her two brands (this brand and Whiskas purrfectly fish variety pack).  My cat hasn't gotten bored of this product yet, and eats every last bit out of her bowl.  She seems happy with it, and best of all, it doesn't upset her stomach and make her vomit, as many products that I've tried seem to do.<br /><br />Buyers be warned though---this product is somewhat overpriced from Amazon.  There are other stores online where you can get this for cheaper, and many of them offer free shipping if you don't mind buying two or more cases of 24 cans, in order to raise the order price to reach free shipping.  Check Petco, PetSupplies, PetcareRX and PetSmart as alternative places to buy from.

review/summary: My Favorite, Too!!
review/text: I also grew up eating Worthington and Loma Linda products, and these were my favorite too.  Try breading them with Brewer's Yeast.  Very different taste, but sooo delicious.  Many other foods have been discontinued -- I'm just glad these are still available.<br /><br />Does anyone know why the 20 oz can of Skallops are $18, while the 50 oz can is $11.75??  In the store, a regular-sized can costs about $3; it would make sense if this $18 price were for a pack of 6 cans of Skallops.  As it is, I don't dare to order it--$18 is way too much for one can of anything.

review/summary: Great tasting but confusing cost/size ratio...
review/text: These are great tasting meat substitutes !!<br />What isn't great is that a 20-ounce can costs $18.58.  A 50-ounce can costs 11.55 !!!  Something is really messed up in the comparative pricing.<br /><br />Other than that, these are great.  I hate that we have to buy a 50-ounce can (which is way more than we need) in order to be financially prudent.

review/summary: Vegan/Vegetarian Skallops Are Great!
review/text: This was my favorite meat substitute as a child and I still love them. My two vegetarian grandsons do also. They are good in casseroles as well as breaded and pan fried. They are supposed to simulate seafood but can be used as a substitute for chicken as well. I prefer now to buy the lower fat variety but will buy the classic Worthington Skallops if that is all that is avialable.

review/text: I like to switch foods for our dog, but having these on hand for mornings when I'm short on time is wonderful!<br />Our dog really likes them and serving it up is fast.<br />No mess.

review/summary: Decent, but extremely mild
review/text: Quality and purity appeared fine.<br />Very, very mild taste.  But effective and pleasant aroma when used heavily.<br />Don't know if I'll re-order.  NO comparison to their other, BLACK peppercorn; the Lampong(?).
