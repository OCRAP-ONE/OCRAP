review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).

review/summary: weak Earl Grey
review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/summary: A lovely tea
review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/text: My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke.

review/summary: Good tea.
review/text: This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase.

review/summary: Follow the directions
review/text: This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.  In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

review/text: This is a high quality green tea from Stash that makes some excellent tea.<br /><br />The first time I made the tea, I steeped it for a little too long, so there was some bitterness.

review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

You still have control over all the important parts (beans or not, heat level, meat type, but this provides the "cooked all day" flavor in a few seconds.  Be sure to brown this base with the meat and don't add it later. Awesome!<br /><br />Even though the jar was sealed, the lid was very slightly loose and a few drops leaked into the bubble wrap that well protected the jar, requiring a quick rinse of the jar.

review/text: Picked this up after enjoying a cup of coconut tea at a local Thai restaurant. This one is nice, pretty coconutty, but not too much so, but the black tea in it does get bitter pretty quickly, so make sure you set a timer for 3 minutes so you don't walk away and forget. Doesn't need much sugar but a little helps boost the coconut taste. I find honey distracts from the subtle flavors in this tea.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is much more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate, rather sweet and somewhat milky for a dark chocolate, though it contains no milk. In fact, "organic evaporated cane juice", better known simply as sugar, is listed as the primary ingredient by weight.<br /><br />There are no unusual or notable flavors detectable other than chocolate and a hint of vanilla but the ingredients taste fresh. The tablet is not too thick nor is it too thin.<br /><br />Overall, a good but not notable and rather nondescript 54% cocoa bar for people who enjoy a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate but who don't like the taste of 70%+ dark chocolate.<br />Comment

review/summary: Good Chocolate, But a Bit Pricy
review/text: Ever since I saw on TV how much work the cocoa farmers have to do to get their product into the sack and to market I have tried to purchase chocolate that treats the farmers more fairly. Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa used in Newman's Own Organics products meets this requirement.<br /><br />As for this product, 54% cocoa is a nice step up for people who normally do not like dark chocolate. While it may be a bit tame for those who like really dark chocolate, I thought it was quite good. It has a nice smooth texture that didn't have the waxy feel of standard store-bought chocolate. It melted smoothly without any off flavors or nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The price is a bit steep even for premium chocolate. Given a choice, I will stick to Divine (certified Fair Trade) for the few times I give into the chocolate urge.

review/text: I was always a fan of Froot Loops and so when I stopped eating all that crap and started eating more healthy I really missed my froot loops.  I came across this cereal at Whole Foods and even though it was more money then I wanted to spend I thought that it sounded very good.  I went in thinking that I was going to get something similar to froot loops but this cereal is nothing like them.  I cant stress enough that if you want to try this cereal dont go into thinking you are going to get a healthy version of froot loops, this cereal is in its own category.  The best way I think I can describe what this cereal is simpilar to would be the taste is more like Trix only not as sweet or flavorful, and they have the consistancy of Honey nut cherrios but much crunchier.  They are so crunchy that it is almost bothersome, to me anyways.  They dont get soggy in milk and are very filling for just 3/4 of a cup.  I couldnt really taste one fruit flavor over the other, to be honest I cant detect any fruit flavor when eating this.  I will not be purchasing it again but I can imagine that children would like to snack on this.  I will be giving this to my newphew, I am sure he will like it.

I have to admit, when I give these to him, I sneak a few myself!  I think they are yummy.  They are reminiscent of fruit loops but are very lightly sweetened, which I like.  They are also a little harder in texture, which my 16 month old loves, since all he seems to want is crunchy foods.

review/text: I definitely agree with the positive reviews.  My daughter (3 yrs) loves this.  She thinks it's a treat!  I suppose if she were used to mass-produced sugary cereals already, she might not be as impressed.  But she doesn't drink soda or eat candy or McDonald's, etc., so her taste hasn't been ruined by junk food.  Mine has though (LOL!), and I still think these taste good.  So...if your kid is set on Fruit Loops, these might disappoint.  Otherwise, he or she will probably love them!  EDIT:  I just saw the negative review below, and I sympathize with the experience...I am certain he/she got a box from a bad batch, because the ones I have had truly are delicious, no dirt taste.  I hope that reviewer gets a chance to try a good batch, and maybe it's not too late to get a refund on the bad one?

It has a good taste and it is natural.It is sweet and crunchy. I don't know why somebody said that it tastes bad,maybe she bought one that it is expired. Believe me you won't regret buying it for your child.

review/summary: Tastes good but lower price would improve it's rating.
review/text: I found this cereal to be very close to Froot Loops in taste, closest to Froot Loops that I've ever tasted in healthy organic cereals, and I've tasted most of them. And when you consider they are organic and have much healthier ingredients, I feel they are better for me and especially better my family and for children.<br /><br />One review mentioned if a child is spoiled by junk cereal they probably wouldn't eat it, but I feel that means the parents are not doing as much as they should for their children's health and all the more reason they should get the kids off junk cereal like Froot Loops immediately. Everything from diabetes to cancer is linked to junk food,  and food coloring is becoming suspect more and more and possibly being linked to ADD and Autism. And health issues don't even take into consideration a child's probable weight gain that comes from eating junk cereals and will make their lives miserable as they grow up.<br /><br />As far as higher price, high price is common for nearly all organics, but yes, this particular cereal is a little more expensive (by weight) than even it's organic competition. Maybe they can ask more because it is one of the tastiest organic fruit oats around? Maybe the healthier ingredients are more expensive (they don't use cheap unhealthy food coloring for example). Not sure. But if you're on a budget just be sure to consider the price, it's only 11 ounces per box. Most cereals are 15 - 24 ounces.<br /><br />If your children simply won't eat cereal unless it's colorful, then sadly you might have to pay higher prices to get them to eat healthier cereals like this one. But if your kids are not yet spoiled by Froot Loops and similar unhealthy cereals NOW IS THE TIME to give them other (more affordable) organic cereals, before they develop bad habits that last a life time. There are many organic cereal's on the market, many of them much cheaper than this one, even by the same manufacturer. I highly recommend getting something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E06U">Kashi Organic Promise Cereal, Autumn Wheat, 17.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> (consider the low price of subscribe and save), adding fresh fruit like blueberries and raspberries. If your children are not yet spoiled rotten and have an open mind they will love it and be much healthier for them and when they grow to be old and healthier than the generation before them they will thank you for it.

review/summary: My kids like it
review/text: This cereal is not as good as froot loops, like the way raisins aren't as good as m&ms.  You really shouldn't compare the two.  If your kids are already spoiled by all the junk cereals out there, you might have a hard time getting them to like this - my kids haven't had the other stuff and they like it just fine.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it's overpriced- but so are most cereals.  I can see why Apple Jacks, for example might price their cereal higher - they have to pay for all that advertising, but this company doesn't advertise this cereal, so what gives????  Anyway, I would give it 5 stars, but the price knocks it down a couple.

review/summary: Good Cereal
review/text: Mine arrived today on March 3, 2011. The expiration date says September 28, 2011. I opened up a box and just ate two bowls. The cereal is great, but the fruit favors are difficult to distinguish. I'm not really sure which fruits I'm eating to be honest. The box mentions apple, pumpkin, and elderberry. Either way it's fresh and tastes great. I use Organic Valley milk.

review/summary: Your kids are NOT going to eat this
review/text: I did not buy this product from Amazon, but did purchase it from a local grocery store. I typically buy organic, whole grain cereals and prefer their taste over sugary over-processed stuff. Not the case with "Fruitful O's"... this stuff tasted so bad it was inedible. It has a bitter taste, nothing "fruitful" about it. It left a nasty after-taste that lingered, kind of like eating dirt (not that I have done that lately). My goats did seem to enjoy it though, so I guess it wasn't a total loss. My goats also enjoy eating cardboard, so... go figure. I can't imagine any child liking this. I think I'll stick with Kashi.

review/summary: good whole wheat pasta in convenient boxes
review/text: I'm not extensively experienced in the matter of whole wheat pasta, but within my judgement, this is good stuff. I've been fully content with the taste, and the texture.<br /><br />And notice, it's from Italy, the true home of expert pasta.<br /><br />The AMZN price seems pretty good. After the discount when they ran the grocery promo, it came out to just barely over $1/box. A box makes for an ample amount, at that.<br /><br />One particular feature I like in this product is the box packaging. Receiving a whole case, it's satisfying to be able to get these stacked in neat, clean rows in a kitchen cupboard. (In contast, dealing with a big number of unwieldy bags of pasta makes for a really clumsy filing predicament.)

review/summary: The Spaghetti wasn't the Only Thing Soaked!
review/text: Whole-wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.<br /><br />One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!

review/summary: Finally!!! A sports drink that doesn't use corn syrup or artificial sweeteners!
review/text: Positives:<br />* Doesn't use artificial sweeteners or corn syrup<br />* Affordable - this costs so much less than buying Gatorade or Powerade!<br />* Better for you! Lower in calories than the more popular sports drinks.<br />* Tastes good as far as I'm concerned. I like it better than the other sports drinks I've tried. Tastes like regular Crystal Light from what I remember.<br />* Doesn't require you to purchase plastic bottle after plastic bottle of product, thus reducing your carbon footprint! BONUS!<br />* Not much packaging and it's really convenient to carry in your purse if you're a female.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Yes it does use sugar which kind of sucks, but I find that it does cut the Stevia which can have a bitter taste sometimes. And the amount of sugar used really isn't that high.<br /><br />Tips:<br />* Make sure to read the instructions as I didn't and put the entire packet in a 16.9oz bottle my 1st time. It's very strong when you do this. The packet's intended for 2 servings.<br />* I've gotten used to drinking nothing but water over the years so you could play with this a bit and use more water than they recommend. I use a 33.8oz bottle per packet typically but intend on buying some BPA-free reusable bottles and just keeping them premade in the fridge for a moments notice.

review/text: Finally a mainstream company using stevia. I hope other large companies take note of this success and create sodas etc with it.<br /><br />At first I was put off by the sound of strawberry and kiwi together, but it's actually a nice perfumy experience. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think the diabetic should have knocked down it's score with 1 star. It never claimed to be entirely sugar free. Go look for a product using only stevia or buy unsweetened powders and add your own stevia (Stevita is the  most reasonably priced)

review/text: I stopped drinking products with aspartame after reading up on their side effects, I also stay clear of Splenda as it was derived from a pesticide.<br /><br />This flavor is rather tasty, it lacks the "slippery" sweetness the original Crystal Light comes with.  The flavor is not over powering and mixed with cold water makes a great refreshing drink as well as offering an alternative to the high calorie soda's or juices.  For someone trying to improve their health and eating habits this drink mix is a must have.

I had to cut the packet open - the little corners don't always tear<br />too well.<br /><br />It dissolved fairly easily, and makes your water a shade of pink.<br />It tastes really good, even though I had room temp water, not cold water.<br />It is a little bit strong in the 16.9 oz bottle (since I took a drink out of it before<br />adding the powder), but nothing outrageous or overwhelming.<br /><br />All in all, I'd buy it again.<br /><br />Crystal Light - I hope you'll start making more flavors in the Pure Fitness line.<br />I'd buy your products all the time if you didn't have them stuffed with aspartame.

review/summary: It's...........okay
review/text: Certainly drinkable and a good choice when it comes to flavored water packets but it's really bland for me, not as sweet as the other Pure flavors, tastes watered down and sour (When I put a whole packet into a 16.9oz water bottle)........not much like Kiwi strawberry. And it might sound weird but I can TASTE the electrolytes, I only suspect that's what I'm tasting because the taste reminded me of Gatorade right away. I didn't know this had electrolytes when I bought it so I think if you're low on options and need electrolytes this is a good choice. If you just like the Pure flavors I 100% recommend Tropical Blend, it's the best I've tried so far (Out of Tropical Blend, Kiwi Strawberry and Mixed Berry).

review/summary: Strawberry Kiwi Yumminess
review/text: I have been enjoying this great drink mix for a little over a year.  I was drinking powdered drink mixes and adding Sucralose to make my sugar free drinks.  I am not diabetic, but I live with a person that has diabetes, so we have very little sugar in our pantry.  I mostly try to keep my calories to a minimum; but the artificial color and flavor in the drink mixes, and the questions we are all having about artificial sweeteners are making me uncomfortable with this type of beverage.  When I was younger, I loved Snapple Strawberry Kiwi juice; this drink mix is very close to that without all the sugar calories.  There is sugar in the mix, but not as much as all the other drink mixes.  So how can you lose?  It tastes great, low calorie  due to low sugar content, (I don't know if I would recommend it to a diabetic though), and it is great for working out as it replaces what gets lost by sweating.  My only problem now is, the local stores are phasing it out, I am having a real hard time finding it locally.  If they stopped making it, I would have to stop drinking beverage drink mixes and just drink water; I like water, but not all the time.  If anyone knows the status of this product, as in if they are discontinuing it, please let me know.  Hopefully it will continue to be available here on Amazon.

review/text: For whatever reason, the sugar in this product isn't mentioned in the advertising. If you check the ingredients, the 1st one listed is evaporated cane juice, which is sugar, although a natural form of it, and sugar (the regular kind) is also listed a few ingredients later.  I was excited about buying this product because I believed it was a Truvia-only sweetened product (which i prefer to artificial sweeteners).<br />However, I definitely won't be purchasing it because it contains sugar and Truvia.  A 70 gram container (a whole box) contains 210 calories - all from sugar.  To some people this may not seem like much, but to others who consume lots of drinks sweetened with Truvia or artificial sweeteners, it can be a problem not knowing about it.<br />Why the company decided to do this is beyond me - Truvia tastes fine on it's own.<br /><br />Here is the nutrition information for this product from their website:<br />crystal light - fitness drink mix - strawberry kiwi pure fitness on the go 0.31 oz<br />Ingredients: EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, CITRIC ACID, MALIC ACID, MALTODEXTRIN, CALCIUM LACTATE, SUGAR, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF DRIED KIWI JUICE, NATURAL FLAVOR, REBIANA (TRUVIA BRAND SWEETENER), POTASSIUM CITRATE, MAGNESIUM OXIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SALT, DRIED PURPLE CARROT EXTRACT AND DRIED HIBISCUS FLOWER EXTRACT (FOR COLOR).<br /><br />[...]
