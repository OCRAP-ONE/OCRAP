review/summary: Best Candy in the world! LOCALLY
review/text: Torrone is awesome in any form. It's seasonally made at my local Italian baker in Providence, RI.<br /><br />And I even just found it at our local Walgreens!  The package says it's imported from Italy and made there, and it tastes like the same stuff we're all ordering from Italy direct!<br />Although I still prefer the fun individual boxes they come in from Italy, these ones at Walgreens are a whole box of little indivudually wrapped torrone in vaccum sealed plastic wrappers like all other regular candy. And if you love Torrone you know that this is NO REGULAR CANDY!<br /><br />They may not have it at every Walgreens Pharmacy across the nation, but at least if you're craving the taste, not necessarily the experience, you can get it locally instead of paying international shipping why not?<br /><br />And yes it stil has the wonderful wafer film on the outside of it!

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: I don't like these candies.  I bought them because I have heard how great they are and I love nuts and nougat.  However, these candies have a white film around the nougat that has a paper consistency.  Almost like the covering on some Brie cheese that makes you wonder if you should be eating it or removing it.  At first I thought that maybe it was a fine wrapper that I should have removed.  But, the film on this candy can't be removed easily even though it tastes much better if you do manage to scrape the outside off.  I wouldn't recommend these candies unless you are a fan of eating what tastes like a thin film of paper on the outside of nougat!

review/summary: " Crema For Idiots" ( Lavazza Espresso Super Crema)
review/text: Just purchased the La Pavoni Espresso Machine {Manual Pump). So of course I had too purchase coffee!!! So I bought like six pounds of this stuff. The Machine came a couple of days before my coffee so I ran to the store and purchased Pete's French roast whole beans. I would have purchased Italian roast but there was not any in whole bean.<br /><br />With the Pavoni there is a learning curve because you have to get the right grind and Pull your own shot..... Blah, Blah, Blah. Well I eventually got it right. I remember my first Capuchino in Italy...Maybe you have been there before???? It tasted like they put chocolate in it???? Of course it did not have chocolate in it but it tasted almost like Hot Cocoa at least to me. In retro spect to my home brew I went thru half a bag of beans to get it right but I did and it was the first time in the States I ever tasted Capuchino that had that chocolate type flavor.<br /><br />Now today I received a box of this stuff(three huge bags) so my journey begins.... This coffee is a medium roast(brown in color) and the Beans look very fresh... Also what the name implies is that you will get Crema. That is completely true. You will get a Crema even if you do not know what you are doing. Why is that???? Well probably because the roast is lighter and not very oily???<br /><br />As far as flavor goes? Everyone has their own taste.. I like certain things like hot spicy food etc. some people do not, so I hate to judge flavor according to my taste Buds. So what am I trying to say???? Obviously I do not like it but that does not mean that you won't. The quality of the Beans look great but I feel that the taste is Bitter and not because I over heated my Machine. I still have a very undesirable taste in my Mouth.<br /><br />Bottom Line.... If you want that Chocolate type Flavor??? I doubt that you will ever get it from this Roast.... Yes you will get Crema and I am not pushing the other brand that I mentioned but I think you have to go with a Fresh Dark Roast... Even when I was playing with my new toy and did not get a good crema the coffee still had that great flavor.... So as far as I am concerned... They should name this Coffee.. " Crema for Idiots"  So do not order Three large Bags of this Stuff. Controll your impulse. Order one bag at a time of different types until you find what you like. Now I have Three Bags of this Coffee!!!!! Not sure what too do with it??? Not sure if not liking it is cause to return a product????<br /><br />Anyway hope this helps

review/text: After buying this product, I have to say it is the best thing.  Plus it is not loaded with salt, to which is an added benefit.  You get the iodine requirements and benefits easily.  I add 1/4 teaspoon to my protein shakes.  I have been using this product for a few weeks now and can definitely tell it works on my metabolism wonderfully and the iodine assists with thyroid & pituitary function.  I am very pleased with this kelp! It would benefit anyone having hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism as well.  For those having hyperthyroidism, I would consult with your doctor.  People are so low on their iodine requirements, why not do it naturally instead of a pill??  I'm keeping this product in my spices for a long time...

I am addicted, my body is obviously craving minerals. Each batch is different since it is fresh from the sea. So expect a slight difference from order to order. I love it so much I eat it straight, I love the crunchy granules in my mouth. Crazy fiber when I eat it like this and almost nothing in terms of sodium. I highly recommend! I go crazy when I run out, my local store has it for $4.45 per 1.5oz. So I try to keep a pound around all the time.

review/text: I got this thinking it will be a very fine powder like the Japanese organic kelp powder. Instead it's granules... and when I sprinkle it on top of food, I get the crunchies (did I just eat salt crystals or sand??)  Anyway, I'm only using it for cooking now, so it can somewhat dissolve.  But I prefer the Japanese organic kelp powder, which is EXTREMELY fine, and suitable for sprinkling on top of food.

The "mouthfeel" is untrusty, unless you like to chew tiny bits of shell. These bits are not sand, they can be chewed, but it's unpleasant, IMO.  For iodine I'll stick to natural liquid kelp. Sorry.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This may be my favorite flavor of instant soup.  It contains natural and mostly simple ingredients, is easy to make (just add water, microwave 2 minutes, let sit 8 minutes) and tastes delicious!  I always expect products like this to be bland but the tamale flavor is excellent.  I always like more spice rather than less, and while it could use more, I was pleased with the flavor.  The corn flavor and texture is good, as well.  It gets somewhat goopy as the soup sits and thickens, but I like that and think it makes this flavor a LOT more filling than many others that are mostly broth.  It is also slightly lower in calories than many other flavors, including another favorite of mine, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTD2">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Pad Thai Noodle Soup</a>.  AND it's gluten-free and vegan.  It's a winner.

review/text: I bought 2 varieties of Dr McDougall's dried soups, the black bean and lime, and the tamale. The tamale soup is crazy gritty and gross. You can let it sit and rehydrate as long as you want and stir forever, and it is still like eating a mouthfull of tortilla chip flavored sand. I went back to the bean soup just to make sure my stirring technique was correct, then tried one more of the tamale. Nope, still gritty and gross. If you can get past that though, the flavor is alright. My boyfriend's son tried it too. I found it in the fridge with one spoonful missing. He said he put it in there "in case anyone else wanted it". Yeah right. Straight into the garbage.

review/text: I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.<br /><br />The taste is okay, although it doesn't taste like Tamales as I've ever known them.  If you plan on pouring it over pasta, rice, etc., you may want to fill the cup a bit higher than the fill line, as it can tend to get a bit thick otherwise.

review/summary: Excellent coffee when prepared well.
review/text: It took me about 4 days to figure out the best way to prepare this coffee in my Senseo machine.  These pods are too large to fit in the single pod holder in my machine, but they make delicious coffee using one pod in the 2-pod holder.  But, the double pod holder needs to be hot and wet, and the pod wet with a bit of hot water, in order to make a strong cup of coffee.  I think it's important for the pod to be wet and squeezed into the pre-heated holder.<br /><br />I say all this because it took me awhile to figure out, and I knew to keep trying because the other reviews of these pods are so positive.  If your coffee isn't delicious with the pod, or it's a little weak, it's not the coffee but the machine.  The coffee is excellent.

Now that I know the pods work in my c. maker, I will try other flavors.<br /><br />Note: these pods are fatter than the Senseo pods and will only fit the Senseo "two pod" attachment!<br /><br />Because I do not want a really strong cup, I can run the machine with one pod for "two cups" into my 8 oz. mug and when it stops brewing, then I run it again for "one cup" and I get a full 8 oz. from one pod.<br /><br />The taste is perfect for me.

review/summary: Better than Senseo pods
review/text: Pod coffee is as good as the pods used. Senseo pods are good and widely available but Baronet taste better. Baronet are also fair-trade and organic, Senseo are not. The automatic order option guarantees I get the best price and never run out of pods (unimaginable).

review/summary: Mis-leading title WARNING THESE ARE SOUR SQEEZE POPS NOT THE SWEET ONES
review/text: I ordered this for my sister because we used to eat these when we were little. Three months after she gets them, I visit her and see that she only ate about half of them and was planning to give the other half away part of xmas gifts.  Why you ask? Because I purchased them on Amazon, not knowing that they were sour squeeze pops.  Everyone likes the sweet ones and the sweet ones were the original squeeze pops.  All the other vendors title the sour squeeze pops "sour squeeze pops", but these guys didn't even have the decency to put the word "sour" anywhere in the description.  The only way to know that you are ordering the sour version is to enlarge the picture of the item and hunt for the word "sour" on the box.  I felt deceived, and would rather do business with another vendor for a buck or two more than a dishonest one.

review/text: This stuff is great for my non-black tea drinking friend.<br />Very nice balance of a spicy blend. Perfect or the cooler weather, autumn, winter, early Spring.  Fireside name changed to Firelight but both images are perfect for imagining sitting by a fire sipping this, or just warming your hands around the cup.  The bagged version must be ground; this version has whole cloves and kind of prickly pieces of spicy leaves, but is fine to steep as is.  Really worth the cost.

review/summary: Tastes as good as traditional chai
review/text: This is the only herbal chai I can drink. All the others are too thin in the flavor department and just make me ache for black tea. (I have to avoid black tea because caffeine doesn't have a positive effect on me.)<br /><br />I prepare this by steeping with freshly boiled water for five to ten minutes. Strain, then add a tablespoon or so of half and half and a scant teaspoon of raw sugar.<br /><br />Milk and sugar are essential to balancing the flavors in this tea. It tastes just fine without either, but the milk gives the spices something to stand on (especially complementing the black pepper) and the sugar accentuates the cinnamon and orange peel.<br /><br />Not only is this one of my favorite teas, it's also 100% organic and full of antioxidants from the rooibos.<br /><br />Happy sipping!<br /><br />By the way: I started out drinking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6UX8I">Zhena's Gypsy Tea, Fireside Chai, 22-Count Tea Sachets (Pack of 6)</a>, but I found the loose tea is far more affordable.

review/summary: Doesn't Zig or Zag much at all
review/text: This zig n zag ball, from what i can remember from the advertising, claimed to have self-propelled zig/zag action.  All it really has is a weighted ball inside a larger plastic ball, which occasionally causes the larger ball to veer off course.<br /><br />However, it does not zig or zag for very long, either on carpeting (which the instructions suggest against) or hardwood floor (so if it works great on marble or perhaps concrete, i don't know)<br /><br />I found that if you get the inner ball rolling inside before you let the big ball loose, the zig n zag action is more pronounced, but still not very exciting.<br /><br />However, because of the inner ball, it makes a noise that attracts my cat to it, who uses it anyways.<br /><br />However, it just didn't live up to what was promised.

review/summary: Excellent ginseng tonic
review/text: Superior herbal tonics are among the best I've tried so far. I was introduced to this particular brand by a woman I dated years ago. She insisted that I have to be consistant with taking ginseng...instead of taking it once in a while (which is what I did before I met her). I followed her instructions and found that ginseng can affect not just basic energy levels but can also help fortify the immune system and boost the libido as well. I recommend drinking one of these packets daily for at least a week and you'll start to enjoy the benefits. I myself like to sweeten it with honey. I also like to mix it with another tonic called Shou Wu Chih. They make an incredible combination.<br /><br />NOTE: Some find that Korean ginseng is too harsh and can make a person overly aggressive and can cause restlessness. If that's the case try Chinese red ginseng instead. It's less "yang" in nature than Korean ginseng is.

review/summary: OK, but not a tea
review/text: The title of this web page is misleading because this is not a tea but a "ginseng extract in a lactose base", as described under ingredient on the box and somewhere in this web page. It turns out that "tea" in Chinese includes any hot beverage made from herbs--something is lost in the translation.  You tear open one of those foil "tea bags", dump the granular content in a cup, pour on the hot water, and you get an herbal beverage.  It tastes sweet from the lactose, followed by a mildly bitter after-taste from the ginseng root. Does it taste good?  No, it doesn't, but you may learn to like it.  It is an acquired taste.  To appreciate the favor of ginseng, you need to drink the beverage with a clear palate.  In other words, you don't eat cake and drink the beverage at the same time, like you do with coffee.  Furthermore, it may be good for you.  According to the Korean and the Chinese, ginseng roots have all kinds of medicinal benefits, including increase in libido, but, like in all herbal medicine, one should take the claims with a grain of salt.  There may also be unpleasant side effects, such as insomnia, because ginseng is a stimulant.

A little bit pricey but for the online convenience I cannot find a better price or place of purchase. You should know these are easy to prepare as they are in powder form and do not need to soak like tea leaves. Personally I use 2 bags per cup, and try and drink 2 cups per day and I recommend this to feel the effects. Good health to everyone, cheers.

review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is "dense" rather than "crumbly" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?

If you are on a salt-restricted diet -- as many people with cardiac problems are -- these kinds of condiments pose obvious risks and take exceptional care to use safely.<br /><br />  I spoke from memory and inaccurately in a late evauation of Deep's Hot Mango Chutney, so let me correct that here: 2 tablespoons contain 1400 mg sodium, while Priya Mixed Pickles, in the same amount, contain 1360.

I ordered it direct from the company, so it wasn't spoiled. I have to give it 1 star because neither of my cats would touch it.

review/text: This flavor is the closest thing to Central American coffee. Almost all other (not just instant), coffees are roasted to the American palate which has a tinge of chicory flavoring. This is smooth and almost sweet in the roast.<br />After decades of good sales it puzzles me why Nestle would discontinue this product to push others.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I have been drinking the Nescafe Classic for over four decades. There were occasional diversions and taste tests, but I always returned to the Classic. Locally we were buying the coffee at Gelsons, as they were the only local store to carry Nescafe. We had it down to a science, we bought the coffee on the day Gelsons received it, as it was very popular and sold out in two, three days. Then Gelsons closed the store.<br />We called all stores within reasonable distance to find that not one had Nescafe. We were delighted to discover that we can buy it on Amazon. Even though Amazon sells the coffee at $8.75 a jar, which is almost $2 more than what we were paying locally, their price is the lowest online. Then I read in one review that Nescafe will discontinue the Classic. I could not confirm that information, but just in case, I ordered enough for a couple of years.<br />Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Royal Crown Cola
review/text: I've always liked Royal Crown Cola, better known as RC Cola.  It's the alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  I first tried this stuff when I was a little kid in the mid-'70s and liked it.  It definitely has its own distinctive flavor.  If I were to participate in a blindfolded taste test with Coke, Pepsi, and RC, the oddball one as far as taste goes would be RC (and I mean that in a good way).  RC is harder to find these days.  Of course, every product I like is either discontinued or hard to find.<br /><br />If you can find it, I recommend RC as an alternative to the big name colas.

review/summary: Me and my RC
review/text: A company called Chero-Cola Co. had a line of sodas called Royal Crown in 1905. They reformulated one of their products in 1934 and "Royal Crown Cola" was born. Consumers called it RC Cola for so long the company finally made it official. "ME and MY RC to taste mighty good to me" was a popular commerical in the 1970's. It is not available everywhere, so some people are lucky to find it this way on Amazon. A very popular cola in the south, I have heard southerners swear by drinking a glass with a few shelled peanuts in the soda, say it tastes great that way. I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950's but sounds like too much suga for me. Either way the 1950's was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda. Four years later, they introduced the first 16-ounce bottle.<br />Dr. Pepper/7Up company owns this now, and they in turn were bought by Cadbury Schweppes a British company in 2000, who seems to be buying up all the soda companies in the country with the exception for the big 2. Check out their web site.<br />Update: As of June 2, 2007, Cadbury Scweppes is selling off their soda division. Let's hope someone keeps the regional sodas alive.

review/summary: BPA lined cans means not really organic anymore once processed
review/text: I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining.<br /><br />With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels of the chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams (from infants to the elderly), I don't think the product can still be called organic!<br /><br />BPA leeching into our food is no better or safer than products sprayed with pesticides.<br /><br />At least pesticides can be washed off many foods (not all, but some). Most people, though, just empty cans of foods, like beans and tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash soup?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods. They believe it is safe to use the foods as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed.<br /><br />I know I quit adding salt to my own recipes containing canned foods many years ago, because the canned goods already had salt in them. The canning process is supposed to kill bacteria and preserve nutrition, just as home canning does. It wasn't until the information came out about BPA in our bloodstreams, and from where most of us are exposed to it, that I realized there was a problem using such foods as is. There are still many Americans who do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful.<br /><br />Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.

review/text: I was generally pleased with the quality of this product. I did not realize the individual spice containers had no lids of their own but that was not a show stopper.  Just a warning: do NOT wash the lid as water seeps between the clear portion of the lid and the stainless steel rim. It took me some creative use of a hair dryer for about twenty minutes to remove the moisture. Since moisture and dry spices are not a good mixture I wanted to pass this along.

review/summary: A very nice stainless steel masala dabba
review/text: UPDATE (1/30/2012):<br /><br />While traveling, I discovered a couple of Indian shops and went in to check out their wares. I wanted to see if they had other styles of masala dabbas. They both had only one type, similar to this one offered here, but smaller, which I liked and the price seemed just right ($12). However, the quality was very poor. They were made from thin metal that I'm not even sure was real stainless steel because it had some rough black spots here and there so I didn't buy.<br /><br />I appreciate this one offered here a lot more now. I wasn't very happy about the price (I paid almost $27), which seemed a bit steep, but the quality is far superior to what I found in those shops.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />A dear friend saw my masala dabba and fell in love with it. I don't know where mine was purchased because it was given to me as a present so I came here hoping to find one for my friend. I like this one even better than mine because of the see-through glass lid.<br /><br />Very nice quality, an easy-to-open yet snug lid (you won't break a nail trying to open it), and the seven containers have straight sides and smooth edges. It came with one smooth stainless steel spoon.<br /><br />I gave this to my friend for her birthday and she really appreciated it.<br /><br />Now that I know how nice these are, I will order two more for myself, one to store the savory spices I use daily and the other one for spices I use in baking (my current one holds spices for Indian dishes, which stay quite fresh even though I only use them once or twice a month).<br /><br />Incidentally, if this is your first masala dabba remember this: Store it where it will always stay horizontal and never tilt it because you'll end up with instant garam masala! Yep, speaking from experience. :)<br /><br />Very nice spice box, highly recommended.

review/text: The masala Dabba is well constructed of good grade stainless steel, convenient in size and even has a measuring spoon for precision in spicing recipes. The glass insert in the cover makes it easy to check at a glance which spices are immediately available and which need to be replaced or refreshed so one is never caught short in the midst of a recipe. The construction allows stackability and diversity so a variety of spice mixtures can be conveniently kept in a single spot in the kitchen. The seal tight lid keeps the spices fresh and pure. The price for the quality is excellent in today's economy. All in all, a terrific buy, I would not hesitate to purchase more should I find a need or expand my culinary palette into other areas be it India or elsewhere. Excellent job Nagina! Continue the excellent work. Thank you!

review/summary: Very much a cocont flavoring
review/text: I have purchased this emulsion before and decided to reorder through amazon. This emulsion is amazing. I have used it in a frosting as well as in homemade whipped cream, it is very very good. Don't let the smell fool you. Yes I agree with the previous reviewer who said it smells slightly like pina colada but it does NOT taste like pineapple at all. My husband has started using it in his smoothies and is the reason why I had to reorder. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not Really a Coconut Flavoring
review/text: As I said in the title of my review, I think naming this emulsion "coconut" was a creative liberty - this is more of a "tropical" flavoring.<br /><br />I bought it because I wanted a nice, warm-tasting coconut flavor for baking, but when I opened it and sniffed, the acrid smell of fake pina colada assaulted my nose. You know that certain artificial pineapple that is on the same continuum as industrial lime-scented floor cleaner? Yes, that's the one. I tasted a tiny bit of it on a water cracker - same deal. I admit, I could bake something with it and see if it mellows, but I kind of don't want to waste good ingredients. Also, another experience with the contents of that bottle would just be a bit much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the place from which I bought it doesn't accept returns on opened food products, so I'm now stuck with a bottle of nostril-burning ersatz pina colada flavoring.

review/summary: Are you gonna eat that?
review/text: I had been buying whole fancy cashews for a bit more money. My kids love them and they disappear at an alarming rate. I got to thinking; do the whole cashews taste any different? No they do not.<br /><br />So... If they are just going to be eaten anyway, why not save the extra cost?<br /><br />So now I get the larger and less expensive can of halves and pieces, and guess what?<br />No one is complaining!

review/summary: Great value and taste
review/text: These are a very good value for money and very satisfying taste.  A quite sizable container, but it does keep them fresh.  Taste is very good, crispy, only very light salt, very minimal oil.  Though these are labeled as halves and pieces there are a number of whole cashews.  Overall very satisfied and will reorder.
