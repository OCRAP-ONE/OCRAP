review/summary: tasty and so easy
review/text: While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff.

review/summary: Thick paste with robust flavor
review/text: A Taste of Thai has become increasingly my favorite brand for pastes and mixes. Their Red Curry paste is thick with a rich, robust flavor. Excellent in curries, it is also great as a marinade for grilled chicken or beef. I've also used it in a blend with soy sauce, Lee Kum Kee's premium oyster sauce, and lime juice for fried noodles. Depending on your palate, you may find the level of spice mild or a touch spicy. Being Asian, I find it on the mild side. A few American friends who have tried my curries and fried noodles made with this paste have declared the spice has just the right amount of zing. Your mileage may vary.

review/text: I'm quite picky when it comes to my curries. I've tried many American products and found them bland and washed-out. I've also tried many curry pastes imported FROM Thailand that I had picked up at my local Asian store... but this is by far the best out there.

review/text: Love this curry paste.  I have celiac disease so am thrilled that I can buy a gluten-free mix that can make authentic Thai dishes at home.  Use it to make curried chicken, soups and veggie dishes (check out the Taste of Thai website for great and easy recipes). I've also tried the panang curry, coconut ginger soup base, pad thai, and spicy peanut and they're all good.  Red curry is my favorite.

review/text: Being a Foodie and Food Pusher, I like having these to offer to my friends b/c I like it so much. The price fluctuates on this as with so many items on Amazon, but if you catch it when it's low cost, grab it.  I did at just a tad over $1 a packet for 12 packets.  I have a great recipe for Thai Red Curry Mussels (foodnetwork) that is easy and delish. But I have also used this with "non recipes" such as adding a tablespoon to my mac & cheese to kick it up, or a tablespoon to my plain white rice.  Just doing that makes you a food genius.

review/summary: Simple to use, fantastic taste....
review/text: *So* simple to use. Makes one of our favourite easy home cooked meals. Cut up chicken (breast or thighs) into cubes, then fry up the paste briefly, add one or two tins of coconut cream, stir, when that starts to simmer add in the chicken. Leave to simmer until chicken cooked - maybe 15 or 20 mins. Use more paste for a hotter dish, less coconut cream if not making a lot.... use the 'lite' coconut milk if you want it to be a little less heavy..... add in vegetables if you want..... a red capsicum/bell pepper goes well with it.... if you have some fresh corriander, throw that in as well. If you don't use the whole packet of paste, just keep it in the fridge - it lasts for a while. Serve on basmati rice with some corriander on top if you have any. At this point I'd also note the wonders of an automatic rice cooker - throw in a few cups of rice, match that with the same amount (or possibly a little more depending on the cooker) and press the 'go' button.<br /><br />Basically, ten minutes of effort at most and you end up with a beautiful tasting meal within 30 minutes. Both the rice and curry left overs freeze well too [in separate containers].<br /><br />We can't get this curry paste locally any more. We now buy it in bulk, getting enough to last us for a year or so. Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better!  Has a very pleasing spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a fair amount of heat.  It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to "spice it up".  We wish it had a lower sodium content.  While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing!  Really good with shrimp, imitation crab/lobster, chicken, beef, pork and veggie dishes.  Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals.  We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it.  Will buy again!

This paste is easy to use and cook with, resulting in authentic yummy Thai curry!!  I use half the packet for one dish that serves 4.  I refrigerate the other half and use it 1-3 weeks later with no problem.  Absolutely delicious, and having compared prices at the grocery stores in my area, this is my preferred place to buy.

review/summary: Great solution to pilling your cat!
review/text: I love pill pockets. They are a much more pleasant way (both for me and my cat) to give my cat her pills.<br /><br />I have two qualifications, though. First, I would recommend using the chicken flavor over the salmon. Recent lots of salmon pill pockets have contained fairly large pieces of bone, which might have caused problems if I hadn't caught them and my cat had swallowed them. I contacted the company, and they were very nice and refunded my money, but they did say it was due to the salmon meal and didn't seem to be very worried about it. So, I stick to the chicken now.<br /><br />Secondly, I think the pockets as made are too large. If I put a big pill in the full pill pocket, my cat just eats around the pill pretty easily. So I usually break the pill and the pocket into smaller pieces, so my cat just pretty much swallows them whole. Not a big deal, and a solution if your cat figures them out as quickly as mine did.

review/summary: BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING
review/text: I ordered a six pack of Greenies Pill Pockets from EntirelyPets in 2010, from this page in Amazon (I know it was this page because it pops up one of those "you already bought this" notices), and received the Greenies brand.  Since then, however, the photo has been changed to a generic brand pill pocket (I can't enlarge it enough to see what brand, but it isn't Greenies), and EntirelyPets is no longer on the vendor list.  The Greenies photos are from a customer uploading photos, probably from back when the official photo was also Greenie brand.  The reviews, I am almost certain, are from when this page sold the Greenies brand name.  The description no longer calls these "Greenies"-- it doesn't say what brand they are at all.  These generics may be just as good, I don't know.  But I do know that as of April, 2011, there are less expensive 6 packs, which are definitely Greenies brand, on other Amazon pages.  Just wanted to give a heads up in case people didn't know what the Greenies package looked like.

review/summary: Easy to give even large pills; how to increase its appeal
review/text: I've never bought a six-pack - I buy four at a time from an amazon.com store. But I've used this product regularly for well over a year, and it will usually administer even a large pill (Azodyl, which is very large for cats) without a fuss. My cat simply gobbles it up, pill and all.<br /><br />I admit that I have to doctor it a little. My cat isn't attracted enough by the Pill Pocket flavor alone, even his favorite Salmon. I powder a little of the soft variety of Whisker Lickin's (kitty junk food, but the vet says a little won't hurt) in the palm of my hand and roll the filled pocket in it. His Majesty will then eat it willingly, nineteen times of out twenty.<br /><br />In fact, I have to cut this short because he's pawing at me. He has food, so no doubt I need to get an Azodyl and fix him a doctored Pill Pocket.<br /><br />Good stuff!! Thanks for making it, Greenies!

review/text: I have a black Toy Poodle that has been chewing on beef rawhide bones practically since the day he was born.  However, his tummy always got a little upset from it and I heard the pork is easier for them to digest, so I switched to these Pork Chomps.  He loves them just as much (if not more) and now his tummy is more settled.  Plus, just like all-natural beef rawhides they do not stink or break into smaller pieces or discolor my blankets/sofa, like many other kinds of treats/bones .  They are odorless, they have no color and they stay in one piece until eaten in full.  Conclusion:  They ROCK!!!  My other "can't-do-without" dog supplement is called "Missing Link."  That product is A-MA-ZING as well and, along with a diet FREE of grain/flour/soy/sugar/preservatives, it has completely stopped him from scratching himself and knawing on his paws).

review/summary: Excellent Quality Saffron
review/text: I was about to run out of some very good saffron from Spain when I ordered this product. I looked up the company that packages the saffron before ordering it, "Bahraman" saffron, to make sure it is a legitimate company (it is).<br /><br />I would say that this saffron is about 20% darker, and the threads about 30% longer than the one I had from Spain, which was a very nice surprise. The threads are all a deep brick red and there are no cheap yellow threads to lessen the cost for the supplier or the quality for the consumer.<br /><br />The aroma, flavor, and coloring ability are all excellent. I could even smell it slightly through the packaging that it was mailed in.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is for it to be packaged in a hard acrylic case or glass bottle (as long as it didn't raise the price more than a dollar). It comes in a sealed bag, which must be transferred to another container once opened.<br /><br />There is no reason whatsoever to buy old and bad saffron from the grocery store for many times the price of this one. This would last most people at least a year (unless you make paella or Persian food frequently).<br /><br />Salud!<br /><br />P.S. Just a tip, never buy powdered saffron unless you have bought whole saffron from that company before. Not only will it lose its aroma sooner, but there is a reasonably high probability that it has been adulterated and isn't pure saffron. Also, if you sneeze, there goes $20 all over the kitchen counter!<br /><br />P.P.S. If you want to make a serious "foodie" happy, buy this for them but transfer it to a nice glass spice jar. They'll think you spent many times more than you did. I know it would make my birthday a great one.

review/summary: Wild Raspberry & Hibiscus--Great!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: If you like lime you'll love this mild sauce
review/text: This is my favorite sauce and I use it frequently. Piri Piri is a lime-flavored hot sauce. You will enjoy it if you like hot sauces for their flavor. It does have the vinegary, salt, chile flavors one associates with hot sauces, but do not look to it for heat because it is not very hot.<br /><br />I would rate this product 5 stars if not for its packaging. Individual bottles are very small, although this particular product comes with six bottles. One good thing about the packaging is that the top has a small opening so not too much comes out at one time. The cap stays relatively clean.<br /><br />I seriously cannot get enough of this hot sauce and I put it on everything. I hope it becomes your favorite hot sauce too!

review/summary: A good hot sauce with a lemon twist
review/text: Piri Piri sauce is like tabasco sauce with the addition of a few ingredients, in the case of this item, lemon, onions, garlic and "spices".  Piri piri can be used for anything you would use tabasco or any other hot sauce, especially if you wanted a little lemon zing.  I especially like to use it in gumbo or rice with beans and especially seafood.  Take a can of coconut milk, a can of drained pineapple chunks, two chopped tomatoes, a finely chopped onion and one finely chopped clove of garlic, bring to a simmer and add a pound of shrimp and piri piri sauce to taste.  Simmer until the shrimp is done -- when it turns pink.  Serve over white rice.

review/summary: Not a fan of caramel...but I love me some Rolos!
review/text: This pack of Rolo candies comes with four 12-ounce bags with each bag containing 56 Rolos.  I wasn't able to find a better price online for this many, so I really think they're a great deal.<br /><br />Rolo's have always been one of my favorite candies.  Surprisingly, I don't like caramel but these candies are an exception, the caramel in Rolo's is very light and not overly sweet.  Although they're great at room temperature, I highly recommend refrigerating them and eating them chilled...the firmer consistency and taste is addicting.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!

review/text: Words of a soon to be famous WWE wrestler, haha.  Anyway these rolo candies are really good!  The one candy I can compliment for the fact they haven't changed much over the years.  That's a remarkable feat in todays ever changing world.  It means the company that makes them is loyal to their customers.  Even the packaging has remained more or less the same.  If there's a difference I can barely notice.  I guess the rolo candy itself has become slightly smaller.  Then again, I'm a grown man now.  Maybe things just appear small to my full-grown eyes, haha.  An entire bag of these will last a couple weeks in my household though.  Then again I live alone so things last a while.  Kids will munch on them while playing video games or doing homework, and well, I guess a few before supper won't spoil them *too* much. :)

review/text: If you are perpetually dieting as I am, or should be, then don't read this review or buy this product.  These things are good.  They provide a slightly more sophisticated candy experience than the usual one you get at the checkout line, with chocolate forming a small "Reese's" type of case around caramel.  If they have a shortcoming, it is you will want more than what's in the package.  Which brings us to this, a larger package.  If you are not on a diet, then buy and enjoy.  If you are on a diet, then this is still OK, presuming you can put them in a jar and take one at a time....sure...

review/summary: Updated: Broken pieces, no returns, but some salvalgable
review/text: I've tried Tiger Tiger's "Puppodums" before and enjoyed them. They're fun to nuke, tasty (though not really spicy) and pretty healthy as snacks go. I was psyched to find them on Amazon, especially with a subscribe and save option. Unfortunately I received the first box with each of the 12 packages crumbling around the edges, cracked and broken. If you've tried these before you know this makes them pretty useless. You need the whole 'sheet' to be intact to oil on either side, then bake or nuke. Small pieces are really no use, and large cracked off pieces are a pain. I'm so used to Amazon being great about returns, I was rather shocked to realize (somewhat understandably) food items are on the No Returns list. So I'm stuck with this big box that I'll probably just toss out. And out twenty bucks.<br /><br />Although I get why food can't be returned, given that this is dry packaged imported goods I wish Amazon wouldn't blanket ban returns. In fact, I'll probably think 3 or 4 times before ever ordering a grocery/food item again.<br /><br />Sorry to say I suggest skipping this item. If you receive it as I did, you too will be out a twenty spot with a box of perfectly good useless food to throw away.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/12: As I didn't want to actually throw away this big box of poppodums, I've been slowly working through them. There were a few packages in the middle of the larger box that were unbroken. The broken ones, mostly around the edges, so they've lost 10 - 20%. But I'm still enjoying them. Changed to 3*. Still tasty and a good protein substitute for a starch.

review/summary: Convenient and reliable
review/text: When microwaved, puppodums provide a nice savory snack without too many calories!  We like them with dips of various kinds or chutneys but they are good with many kinds of Indian foods<br /><br />Yes, these are quite expensive, but compared to the retail price locally (if we can find them at all), they are extremely reasonable -especially on Subscribe and Save.  They taste every bit as good as the ethnic sort.  To me, a great advantage is that these Tiger Tiger puppodums puff up beautifully in the microwave (a little spray of olive oil or cooking spray is all they need)which is something that the cheaper equivalents from ethnic stores do not do reliably. I think that the smaller package size may keep them in better condition.

review/summary: LIGHT ROAST KONA BLEND ("City" Roast)
review/text: This is a light roast Kona blend, known as "city roast".<br />Light roasted beans have no oil on them and they smell a bit different - that is typical and normal.<br /><br />Dark roast is what everyone is used to drinking - dark roast is used to hide how old and rancid the beans are.  They began to only sell us old coffee in 80s and they began to roast it all dark then, to hide the fact that all the coffee was old, stale, rancid, etc.  If you get a good fresh coffee that is lightly roasted, its a whole different cup of coffee!  This is what I remember coffee tasting like, before they decided to feed us all only 1 type - old rancid dark "french" roast and worse.<br /><br />This is Good Coffee!  I highly recommend this.<br />Check their site (coffee bean direct)for the correct info.<br />Buyers are not always informed or correct, so check the site.

review/text: We loved the KONA we had in Hawaii last year and subsequently purchased some at home. When I saw this product, it seemed like a good deal . First of all, when we opened the box, it smelled terrific; fresh and flavorfull. Our disappointment is in the taste. Though we have played around with the water: ground bean ratio, it still does not have the body and flavor we expected. Again, should have paid attention that it was a KONA blend. Its good but not great.

review/summary: Love this Coffee!
review/text: My husband and I went to Hawaii for our 30th anniversary and loved the Kona coffee that was offered in every restaurant! After returning home, and missing the great coffee, I decided to check on Amazon to see if they offered it. Much to my dismay, the "real" Kona was outrageously expensive. After reading the reviews about "blended" Kona coffee, I decided to try this one...and I'm glad I did! We just love getting up to the fresh aroma of this Kona Blend and feel like we are back on the Island enjoying the sun and surf and relaxing time! I have this on auto ship so I will never run out!

review/summary: Great Price, and good aroma
review/text: I have been buying this brand for the past 3 years. I am a Kona Lover, but have issues with spending 200 dollars for a 5 pound bag (I have the money but I much rather give it to charity than drink it). This brand almost gives you the Aroma of the higher quality Kona, even though it is a Blend, but for a lot lower cost. It has a perfect medium brew. Recommend it highly.

review/summary: Not Good
review/text: First, I will say that I have bought plenty of good coffee from Coffee Bean Direct.<br /><br />That said, this is terrible coffee (for Kona or otherwise).  I have had many different variants of Kona, ranging from pure to similarly labeled blends - none of which were so bad.  This is dry, bitter and bland - probably the worst of all worlds.<br /><br />To put things into perspective, Costa Rican from the same vendor is an infinitely superior coffee that I have as a subscription mainstay for my house.<br /><br />Again, I like this vendor, but despise this particular coffee.  Don't waste your money . . . After Eight from your local grocer would be 100 times better.

review/summary: Rancid and undrinkable
review/text: We just opened our 5lb bag of coffee and the first thing we noticed is that the beans had no oil left on them. Not a good sign. The smell was a bit off and you didn't get that enjoyable aroma that you do from fresh beans.<br /><br />Then we brewed a pot.<br /><br />Rancid is the kindest word I can use. Flavorless but for the sour taste, we couldn't stand to drink a cup. We immediately went and bought a bag of something else NOT from Coffee Bean Direct as the thought of drinking this stale bean for a month made us sick. You can't return groceries to Amazon so we're out $40 :(<br /><br />We've ordered from this vendor previously with good results but this bag has us turned off for good. We've had good results with The Bean Coffee Company, Le Bean but they seem to be running low on inventory. Time to search again.

review/summary: Watch out for the Rocks!
review/text: We normally use the Bioitalia canned lentils, but they have been out of stock here on Amazon for quite a while now. Since these seemed to be a very similar alternative to our usual lentils, we went ahead and ordered a case.<br /><br />However, we have not been pleased with the results through the first three cans. We have found tiny rocks in two of the  cans and the third was spoiled, tasting sour and making a loud pop when opened. This company definitely needs to work on their quality control. The lentils themselves taste fine (when not spoiled), but you better watch out for the rocks if you want to avoid a trip to the dentist... As for us, we will stick with the Bioitalia lentils from now on, even if we have to track them down an hour away from our house at Whole Foods, as we have been through a few cases of those now and found no rocks as of yet...<br /><br />Edit 9/27/11: I added a photo of our "rock collection" through 4 cans to the main product page.

review/summary: Scarlet Runner Beans need spices
review/text: the Scarlet Runners were exciting to see when they first arrived and cooking them turned out to be a bit challenging.  Seems they require severe spicing or cooking with additives to help soften them or lighten the darkness of their broth.  Have not quite cooked those scarlets perfectly and will eventually find a better additive to give them a good flavor.  Have tried both stove top and crock cooking, but not oven baking.  But I won't give up until I can say these scarlets are delicious when prepared with care.  Thumbs up for now!

This is the same chemical that is present in acid rain, which can eat the paint off your car, deteriorate buildings, etc.  This product is the only one I've ever seen that doesn't contain this chemical.  This product tastes better and fresher than any store-bought dried pineapple and the fact that it contains only natural ingredients is a big plus.

This came packaged nicely in both peanuts and bubble wrap, so it's safe.  Arrived on time.  Excellent.

review/summary: Best horseradish money can buy.
review/text: This stuff is awesome. It has the best flavor, consistency, and heat of any horseradish I've ever had and it beats the hell out of the store bought stuff. It's plenty hot and will get some tears going, but admittedly the heat can vary from jar to jar. Make sure to keep it refrigerated and sealed as often as possible as warm temperatures and air can deaden the heat fairly quickly.<br /><br />This particular brand is often only used in restaurants (I found out about it when I ate at a steakhouse not too long ago), so it's nice to be able to use it at home.<br /><br />To those who don't think this is hot enough, the only option left for you is Nasal Napalm, which is unequivocally the hottest stuff out there. You can search for it in Google.

review/text: When I opened up the box, I was greeted with the smell of horseradish, not exactly what I wanted after purchasing sealed containers. I do not like the flavor of this horseradish. I've opened 2 of the 4, and both tasted overly salty and hot, but with very little horseradish flavor. I enjoy hot horseradish, but not when it comes at the expense of flavor. It ruined a batch of horseradish mustard I made at home.<br /><br />I'm going to stick with Helluva Good horseradish from now on. It's not very hot, but the flavor is there.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.

review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect.

review/summary: This tastes....familiar
review/text: I got a couple of these jelly-filled pods in a variety pack from a third party vendor.  My first impression was, quite simply, how could this possibly be good?  Boy was I in for a shock.<br /><br />The fact that I'm giving a five-star review on a coffee pod should speak volumes.  I like my coffee freshly roasted and ground, but when some flavors are added to coffee, the experience takes on an entirely different level.  I had no idea that the flavor of jelly could be infused with the flavor of coffee to create such a blissful experience.  Let's just say that it's a good thing that my variety pack only came with two pods of this flavor.  Otherwise, I might have drunk the whole package in a single day.<br /><br />The flavor and the aroma are somehow familiar, but I can't quite place them.  What I do know is that they both just simply put a smile on my face.  I would gladly go the rest of my life drinking no other coffee but this.  That's how much I like it.<br /><br />And the other thing I think needs to be pointed out is the fact that when I use Senseo pods, I have to use two pods on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.  With the Donut Shop coffees, I can use a single pod on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.
