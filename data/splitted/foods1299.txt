review/summary: These glazes are excellent...
review/text: I started using Blaze glazes in Portugal and found them a delightful twist on fruit, meats, and even veggies. I've purchased a number of flavors, using the sweeter fruit ones a little more sparingly than the truffle and plain flavors. As they are a thicker balsamic glaze, I don't use oil with them - just straight out of the squeeze bottle.<br /><br />I highly recommend! Yummy!

review/summary: Best Meatballs!!
review/text: Hands Down, best meatballs I have ever had!! They are light and full of flavor, I have yet to find a product or restaurant that comes close in comparison, and so easy to make, my only suggestion is make sure you follow the instructions (it is important to let the mix sit and absorb the milk and eggs for the instructed time before mixing meat and cheese. The size of the meatballs can easily be adjusted as long as you adjust your cooking time with it (small tweaking)<br /><br />I first discovered this product at a local market where a vendor was giving out samples and I bought a few of them. The 45min drive to this market forced me to see where I could purchase this online. Discovered I could get this cheaper here at Amazon, using their Save and Subscribe program (free shipping)than it was driving and buying it at the local market.<br /><br />Looking forward to other products by this company!

review/summary: Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!
review/text: Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?

review/summary: Not actually Amish popcorn...
review/text: I just want to point out that this is not actually "Amish" popcorn.  Look at the company's website-this is "Amish country" popcorn, meaning I guess that Amish live in the vincinity.  Note the lack of any mention of organic popcorn on it.  This is good popcorn, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're getting an organic/chemical free product, or one raised in small batches by Amish folk.  Clever wording strikes again!

review/summary: We hate to leave this kind of review......
review/text: We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past.  Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all.

review/text: Ok- I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy 12 lbs of popcorn. We just like to eat it a few times a week. I have to say, I'm usually a butter lover when it comes to popcorn. But, not with this. No butter is needed with these tasty kernels! The kernels are very white when they pop and small so they have a great mouth feel. All of them popped and the crunch was tender, yet crisp. All I did was toss on a little popcorn salt and I'm not sure it even needed that. I've never had popcorn so good! This is worth a try!

review/text: This is by far my favorite popcorn of all time. Petite, fluffy kernels are delicious and light as air. I pop this several times a week in my Back to Basics popper. One thing to keep in mind: the kernels pop up quite a bit smaller than ordinary corn, so you should measure out more, to fill up the popper. For instance, normally I measure out nearly a half-cup of ordinary corn, but for the Vintage Red I usually use almost 3/4 cup. Happy popping!

review/text: I appreciated that this popcorn wasn't full of big hulls like regular popcorn is, and that it is more dense and crunchy than "movie style" popcorn. After eating the Vintage Red, regular popcorn seems kind of like styrofoam. The only thing I noticed that you need to watch for is that with some of the gourmet popcorns, shipping is more expensive than the popcorn itself.

review/summary: Ok, but will look for something better
review/text: This popping corn is a mix of pros and cons for us.  It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time.

review/summary: Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers
review/text: I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I  do not find the popcorn fluffier or less "husky". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)

review/text: I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning "butter."  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush.

review/summary: Not what I was expecting
review/text: Full disclosure I am a do it yourself popcorn newb.  Made this in a wok with canola oil (no fancy machine).  Not what I was expecting for the fancy description and price.  Kernels popped up a lot smaller than I was expecting.  A bit tougher chew than I was expecting.  Maybe I'm just a newb but I prefer the supermarket bought Orville to this stuff (and so does my family).

I think I'll keep them long for the bouquet if I decide to use them for this.

Have looked here before, glad to finally see it listed!<br /><br />Like this product much better than Baker's Joy (which seems to get clogged and you can no longer get the spray out of the can, even with cleaning).  The Pillsbury spray also smells wonderful -- like you're about to bake something luscious!  That's silly, I know, but... oh well!  The good smells are one of the things that make baking so much fun! :)<br /><br />I use this even in my cornbread pan; have never been able to master the "pouring it into the hot pan" trick -- mine always stuck.  This spray releases it from the pan perfectly, every time.

review/summary: Takes me back to when I was a young Mexican boy working on the granja
review/text: Of course, back then everyone drank the good stuff. This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead. (+ History Lesson included below)<br /><br />It was never a taste or health decision, purely cost. Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)<br /><br />Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary ("All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible"), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.<br /><br />On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.<br /><br />REFRESCO indeed!!!<br /><br />P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open next Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.<br /><br />[+ History Lesson follows]<br /><br />By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: I've started buying Go Raw products. I'm not vegan but I don't eat most commercially processed foods because they're no longer natural. However Go Raw produces what I consider properly processed foods and for that I'm very grateful. I'm not fond of the two types of chips I've bought but I love, and will continue buying, their seeds. I use the Go Raw products for traveling since I won't eat in restaurants or eat what most grocery stores carry.

review/text: i read the reviews. and i just think every baby is different. i love em! Cyless did NOT like them at first, but after a few more times he warmed up to them. he is 7 months and eats them like any other food now. just have to try it a couple times before giving up. the thickness is good. i idnt have to add water but for younger babies i would. like i said he is 7 months nad i have been spoon feeding since 4 months so he is used to a thicker consistancy but i recommened these products they now sell them at walmart which is nice. also try them warm instead of cold they might take quicker.

review/summary: Tastes like peas!!!
review/text: Once I opened the package it smelled like peas.  Smelled very fresh and tasted good!  And yes, I tried it.  I taste test every new baby food before I feed my baby and compared to the other brands, this is the best tasting pea.  The packaging is wonderful, especially for on the go!  No more jars breaking and it has a "ziploc" type closure for leftovers.

review/summary: Great
review/text: All of the Sprout brand baby foods we have tried so far have been a big hit with baby, and he likes the peas.  I do try to make homemade baby food when I can, but organic peas are difficult to find and every frozen bag of organic peas I have found has added salt, so these are a great option.  And compared to other brands of peas we have gotten, these are actually the colors of peas instead of some greyish green slime.<br /><br />I am not really big on the pouch design because when they are little & not eating entire pouches early on, it is a mess to spoon out & reseal leftovers.  It is also difficult to get all of the food out because of the way the pouch is designed.

review/summary: Baby's favorite food but the packaging is messy...
review/text: My little guy wouldn't touch any other brand of peas when he was about 7 months old.  However, he loved the Sprout sweet peas and happily finished a whole package in one sitting.  Unfortunately, I don't like the Sprout packaging at all - it's hard to get all the food out (and who wants to waste any of it at these prices!) and if you need to re-seal to save in the fridge for the next feeding, it's very messy.  For that reason, I only give it 4 stars.  I definitely prefer the Plum Organics packaging but wish they have veggie-only flavor options....

review/summary: ooooo...comfort food in a cracker!
review/text: First, I must say I'm not a HUGE fan of the regular cheez-its. It's not that I dislike them, it's just that I don't find them "cravable".<br /><br />These, however, are a different story.<br /><br />mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br /><br />so hard to put down!!<br /><br />The white cheddar is such a smooth, light, and cheesy taste and complements the crisp airiness of the cracker. White cheddar is more smooth and creamy than sharp and that taste absolutely DOES make this cheddar/cracker duo "cravable".<br /><br />the crackers are small and easy to just pop in your mouth.<br /><br />great for kids or adults alike as far as taste.<br /><br />Better yet, although it's not billed at a low calorie or low-fat item, it's nutritional stats are actually very reasonable for such as yummy taste. 25 crackers have just 150 calories and only 8 grams fat which makes this an obvious pick over any other side item such as chips for such an indulgent taste that doesn't indulgently cost you too many calories in spite of its great taste.<br /><br />Conclusion: cravable indulgent yummy snacking goodness for less fat and calories than you'd expect for such a treat. That's not to say it's really LOW fat...but it sure tastes more indulgent than the stats dictate!

review/summary: Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!
review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!

The only problem is that in shipment (during the summer months) the chocolate all sticks to the paper and the container that the cookies are in.  If they could be put on ice packs for shipment, they would get to the customer in much better shape.

review/text: These are very good, but in the very warm weather the filling can go soft.<br />So I keep mine in the freezer.  Try and keep them sealed to avoid moisture -<br />all I do is fold the silver packet over - and they are really good. There<br />is not enough to them to taste cold - but they are crisper.  I only keep<br />the packet I have open in the freezer.  See what you think.
