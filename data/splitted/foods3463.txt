review/summary: Good, recommend
review/text: I bought the Ostrim while looking for a lower fat alternative to a Slim Jim. This is one of the best beef sticks that I have tasted. It is not oily or greasy like a Slim Jim.  It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it.

review/summary: Tasty but why dairy?
review/text: Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg (which I am allergic to), I thought this would be a great snack.  It tasted awesome - but I read the label (my fault for not doing sooner) and saw it contains milk.  Would get 5 stars if I could eat it.  Ingredient list is missing from Amazon website, and that information would have been nice to know before I ordered.  However, at least the guys in the house love the taste.

review/summary: Good protein snack
review/text: I got these because I don't usually like the grainy protein chocolate bars and these are better but high in salt.  My favorite flavor by far is bbq, it doesn't taste like bbq chips it takes like a mild slim jim.  The worst in my opinion in the teriyaki, basically because its too salty and not very sweet like you would want a teriyaki.  Original and pepper are ok but I actually look forward to eating a bbq

review/summary: OK Tasting "Protein" Snack
review/text: I bought these as an alternative to protein shakes, tuna, or cold cuts when I wanted a quick protein-based snack.<br /><br />I have only tried the Natural flavor.  They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.

review/summary: Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events
review/text: As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

review/text: Ostrim beef and ostrich snacks are pretty tasty. I expected them to be a bit spicier, but they are good as they are. I needed another protein snack to supplement protein shakes and protein bars. The whole ostrich thing piqued my curiosity so I bought them. They are convenient to carry in my pocket while at work and the price is right. I will almost surely buy more.

review/summary: Pretty tasty for what it is, maybe a little too big?
review/text: High in protein, low in fat, not greasy but you know you're eating a meat snack.  Smoky flavor is pretty good but I find that about 3/4 of the way through I'm about done with it, it starts getting just a bit too dry and a bit too bbqy.  I've been breaking them in half and eating the other half later.  My dog was quite thrilled with it when I left it on the table.  After reading that it was the #1 sports nutrition meat snack on the label, my 7 year old son started requesting them for his school snack, then began asking for extras for his friends.  I wonder if there is a #2 sports nutrition meat snack?<br /><br />I use these and several similar products to boost my protein intake on days when I'm running a bit low.  Perfect as one of a handful of tools suitable for that purpose.

review/text: I like this product a lot and I think they're very tasty, but SO SALTY. I'm one of those people who love a lot of salty foods and will always add salt to everything I eat, but even I think these are way too salty. Luckily I like them enough and the nutritional stats are great, so I'm going to stick with them. My only other complaint is I just got my second order and the outside of the stick is SO tough, like it's stale. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with the one box, but if it continues, I may have to cancel my order, as it was pretty bad.

review/summary: Great Tasting and Satisfying!
review/text: I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those.

review/text: I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly! Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect.

review/summary: Jerkee not jerky
review/text: Maybe I should have picked up on the name "Jerkee" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says "nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist "jerkee."  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand.

Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.

review/summary: Tropical Get Away Matcha!
review/text: By the smell of this one I was really iffy as to wether I would like it or not.<br />It smelled just like green bananas! Tart really strong smelling green bananas to the point of smelling like artificial banana flavoring. HOWEVER ... wait for it ... this stuff is AMAZING!<br /><br />Oh and also when I was mixing it my daughter asked "what is that??" as she had smelled it from the other room! I asked her "what does it smell like?" she answered "bananas"!<br /><br />Okay no, I am not confused, I realize this is not banana matcha and in fact once you get it mixed it does not taste like banana matcha at all!<br /><br />This is yummy papaya! Like the passion fruit matcha I reviewed earlier today there is a rind like flavor to the matcha but its not quite as strong as the rind flavor was in the passion fruit, this is a very nice, fresh, ripe papaya tasting matcha and I LOVE IT! This is a very sweet tasting matcha too!<br /><br />Honestly, I never would have thought I would like this as much as I do based on the smell of the dry powder. Also this is one of the last matcha I have on hand that I have not yet tried or reviewed! Actually while I have not done my review yet on the brandy matcha I have had it and loved it. Just need to get the review done, so in fact, this is my last matcha to savor and oh yes I am savoring it!!<br /><br />I mixed this in my typical latte fashion and with the milk and creamer the flavors are incredible! I feel like I am drinking something on a cruise ship or at an island resort! The only thing missing is my lei and some island music! Gad this is for sure on my re-order list once this 30g is gone!

We went out of our way to order the MARKET SELECT and Ozbo shipped us the TENDER FAVORITES. Both Ozbo and the manufacturer insist that they are the same product, using the exact same 'formula' and 'recipe'. They are not the same. Meow Mix has stopped producing MARKET SELECT and isn't distinguishing between the two. If you specifically order MARKET SELECT, as I did, you will receive TENDER FAVORITES. If your cat doesn't care, that's fine, but be warned that they're not the same product and Ozbo was not helpful in this regard. They will issue a refund but you'll have to pay for return shipping. If you do decide to purchase it you may want to choose a different seller.

I use kava kava for public speaking and found that the Yogi tea didn't do much--even using three tea bags.  This brand does.  I still need three tea bags in one cup to calm me down, but it does work.

review/text: I do a lot of natural supplements and don't get sick too often, but this tea is on the TOP of my list for beating colds, sinus issues and chest congestion.  Both my daughter and I notice immediate difference with the first cup.  Just have to put something sweet into it to get it down! Vanilla stevia is the best cause then you won't have sugar feeding the problem. You can also brew with other teas to change the flavor a bit.  My daughter doesn't think it is as bad as I do so maybe you won't agree with me on the taste issue.  Buy 2 boxes- it goes fast if there are several people who are sick in the house. I had 4 cups a day when I discovered this tea in the middle of a bad chest cold last year that nothing else would help.  Thank god I got 2 boxes cause now my daughter is using it and woke up this morning better after a cup last night.

review/text: The chip attached to this bottle is one you may not want to cash in if it means losing your bottle.  I have a pantry full of hot sauces and this is my current favorite.  If you like Tabasco sauce this is similar yet with a thicker consistency and richer flavor.  It will keep you coming back for more.

review/text: Passion fruit concentrate has become my favorite "secret ingredient"...I use it to make a citrus sauce for halibut steaks (water, sugar, cracked black peppercorns, honey, lemon and orange juice and zest, and passion fruit concentrate)--serve the fish on a bed of arugula, pour the sauce over, garnish with julienne strips of cucumber and slivered almonds, serve alongside jasmine rice, and your guests will feel they've landed in Hawaii...I also add it to Italian Cream Cake, replacing a couple of tablespoons of liquid ingredients with concentrate, and add it to the buttercream frosting as well in place of milk.  I've used this approach to make everything from a three-layer cake decorated with orchids to bite-size mini-cupcakes dusted with orange sugar.  My husband puts it in martinis with pineapple, and I mix it with Hypnotiq for a gorgeous aqua cocktail.  Everyone always wants to know what that exotic flavor is, but I only reveal the secret to my best friends...

review/summary: I'm passionate for passion fruit
review/text: After having passion fruit (lillikoi) gelato on the Big Island, it was love at first bite. I couldn't get my hands on enough lillikoi things. When i returned to the mainland, I was very disappointed to not be able to find the real stuff anywhere. You can find the juice (cut with other juices) in some grocery stores, but finding food concentrate is impossible. To my delight I found this company. The packages were sent frozen and well packed (but starting to thaw so they must be put in the freezer the moment that they are delivered - I would recommend that you buy during the cooler months to help with this).<br /><br />The pricing is pretty high - and I thought twice about it because of that, but when something is hard to find, that usually drives the price up. I have made a couple of things with it and they have been wonderful. I use it sparingly (but you really don't need much to make things since it's real 100% concentrated passion pulp) and it is SOOOO good. I will definitely buy again.<br /><br />Tip - if your budget can swing it, buy 3 lbs of pulp (I got 2 Lillikoi and 1 mango) because the shipping is much more reasonable that way. It appears to keep very well so it's worth buying more when you can.

review/summary: The Absolute Best
review/text: I have tried different brands of passion fruit puree and this is The Best by a clear mile.  Unlike the cheapo brands (Goya) that are bland and lemony, this packs real, bold passion fruit flavor.  I use it for passion fruit ice cream base, custard cakes, souflees, pies, creme brulee, and passion fruit curd.  You can substitute slightly diluted concentrate for lemon juice in many fruity desserts to add sophistication and pizzazz.  We got hooked on passion fruit on an extended trip to Bali and have bought the fruits imported from that corner of the globe at supermarkets here, but at $4 a pop and with varying quality, I think this concentrate is as economical and more convenient.  Also love their prickly pear cactus puree.  Close your eyes and click Buy.  You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Great Cincy Chili Knock-off
review/text: Alright, for those who are not in the know, Cincinnati style chili has almost nothing to do with the firey bowl of red that most people think of when they think "chili."  In some ways this style of chili has more in common with a stew called "burgoo" then with Southwestern Chili.<br /><br />What does it taste like?  Well, for starters it is savory rather than spicy.  It is also sweeter, which generally comes from the spices used (cinnamon, allspice, and cloves are not uncommon) and the use of chocolate.  If you are familiar with the chili at the Steak & Shake chain of restaurants, it bears some similarities.  (I dont want to over do the comparison, but I want to give people a frame of reference.)  The resulting concoction is very flavorful but it doesnt really stand up on its own.  As a result you rarely find people eating a bowl of Cincy chili by itself.  Most often it is combined with other items to make the famous Chili 3-way, 4-way, 5-way's etc.  For example, "chili 3-way" means Cincy chili over spaghetti, topped with a large amount of finely shredded cheddar cheese.  Add raw chopped onion to that and you've got 4-way (my favorite).  Add kidney beans to 4-way and you got 5-way.  And that is the beauty of this stuff, you can dress it up the way you like.<br /><br />Now, in Cincy there are a number of places that sell this stuff...and I never lived there.  I did live in Dayton for a year and came to love this stuff.  Skyline is the chain most people are familiar with and they make my favorite chili for 4-way.  Gold Star is another chain many people prefer.  I'm a little weird as I think the Gold Star coney is superior to the Skyline...but in general I like the Skyline product better.<br /><br />However, making this at home was often a problem.  The Skyline mixes and frozen products always disappointed.  Gold Star had more success with their frozen chili, but when I moved away from the area even that wasn't an option.<br /><br />Enter Cincinnati Recipe Chili.  This stuff works really well.  It is absurdly simple to make (all you need is water, ground beef and a can of tomato paste) and the resulting chili is pretty close in taste to Skyline.  Now, you can find recipes online to make Cincy chili from scratch and they can work as well, but for ease of use and good flavor I most often use this mix.<br /><br />So, if you are an Ohio ex-pat who wants a taste of home, or someone who just wants to try something different this is a good place to start.

review/text: Skyline chili based in Cincinnati, OH has the best Cincinnati style chili available. Unfortunately, there are not that many Skyline Chili restaurants out there.  You can find their products in the frozen food section of your grocer (at least here in Ohio) but not all of them carry it and it is somewhat expensive.  Enter Cincinnati Recipe mix.  Cincinnati Recipe is the closest in taste to Skyline Chili and is easy to make.  The packet contains all the seasonings and spices to create the great Cincinnati style chili taste.  I used to be able to find the Cincinnati Recipe mix at my grocery store but unfortunately they stopped stocking it.  I was extremely happy to find it thru Amazon and bought the six pack.  My craving has been satisfied.  I love the 5-way with spaghetti, Cincinnati chili, kidney beans, onions and shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!!!

review/summary: Is this really Sky *Line* ??
review/text: I have a box of frozen Skyline from the grocery, and a pack of this stuff (which is pretty good.)  The manufacturer on the back is listed as "SkyTime" at "4180 Thunderbird Lane, Fairfield, OH 45014" which is ALSO the address of the real thing, "Skyline, Inc."<br /><br />So is this stuff really Skyline?  Why not advertise as such?  Oh well;  it's good and I can make my own low-fat variation my body tolerates.

review/summary: Cincinnati Chilli
review/text: As far as I know there is only one supermarket that carries Cincinnati Chilli and that is Krogers (and not all Krogers).  We do not have that chain here in Florida.  I've driven to Georgia to buy it and I've also ordered it by mail.  I'm so glad that Amazon.com carries this.  It's so easy to make; just add the seasoning packet to tomato paste and water, crumble a pound of ground beef and serve it over spaghetti.  Thanks Amazon.com.

review/text: I have searched everywhere in my town for this Chili Mix when suddenly a lightbulb went off in my head--search the internet. I found it. Got it quickly, made some the next day, and satisfied my horrible craving! What got me started on this was a business trip I had made to Cincinnati (where my home office was located).  After that, I got a friend in the Cincinnati office to buy it for me and send it in the company mail :)<br />When I quit working for that company, there went my chili. UNTIL NOW

review/text: There's nothing more wonderful than the nostaligic taste and smell from your childhood....<br />For me, this Cincinnati Recipe chili mix brings back fond memories of growing up in Cincinnati and visiting the various "chili parlors"<br />Now that I live outside of the Tristate area, I never thought I could recapture that portion of my youth, but this seller sure helped a lot!<br />I'm still looking for LaRosa's pizza, Graeter's ice cream & Mama's cookies ;)

review/summary: Tastes like home.
review/text: I love Cincinnati Chili, but for the uninitiated, I have one recommendation: don't think of it like chili.  My friends who expect "chili" are usually very confused when I make it for them, while the friends who expect a distinctive pasta sauce are generally more receptive.  Therefore, I try to avoid using the word "chili" to describe the sauce before I introduce someone to it.<br /><br />You might not like it at the outset, but some time later (sometimes a month, sometimes more), most people start craving it again.  At least, that's my experience.<br /><br />As my mom used to say, I get a yen for it ever couple of months, and when I do, it's insatiable (until I cook it again, of course!)

Cincinnati Chili Land has been great with their super fast delivery and great prices. I will be ordering plenty more in the future. Thanks for the great customer service!

review/summary: Pretty darn close !
review/text: This is very close to what you'd get back in Ohio or Kentucky ,"Cincinnati style chili".... served over spaghetti with lots of shredded cheddar on top, or on a hot dog (called a "Coney dog"). Delicious !<br /><br /> I made up some of this mix for a west coast crowd at a football party recently,suggesting that guests try it "3-way" style, over spaghetti, with shredded cheddar. I got some strange looks until the first bite ,then rave reviews after that.There was a ton of other food available, but that big crock pot full of chili was gone in about 15 minutes. One of the guests was from Cleveland, and she was pretty darn happy to scarf up a big serving of this old favorite.<br /><br /> If you aren't familiar with this type of chili , or are more of a traditional texas-style chili person, you could be in for a big surprise when you first try this ! It's completely different than traditional chili , and bears little resemblance. It's not particularly spicy, and has a sweet, aromatic flavor that is notably absent of chili powder and the other spices that define traditional chilis. It's not even designed to be eaten by itself, although a few people do.<br /><br /> I love that we have Amazon available , it's makes trying out delicious, quirky regional favorites like this both cheap and easy.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: My husband bought this after growing to love this dish after living back east. We currently live in the western US, and I have never had this dish prior to him making it for me. So I cannot offer any comparison.<br />However, I do thoroughly enjoy this dish. When my husband called this Cincinnati CHILI, I got stuck on the chili part, so my taste buds were confused when I first tried this dish, because it doesn't particularly taste like the chili I am used to. After adjusting to the "sweetness", I really enjoy this dish more than my husband! It is NOT your typical chili with beans and "spicy-ness". It has a smoother consistency and the cinnamon, cloves and allspice give it a different taste entirely.<br /><br />It is a very easy meal to make. We have it "4-way" on top of noodles, with grated cheese and chopped onions on top. I should also mention to others not familiar with this dish is that it is not very substantial on its own. It is also delicious on top of turkey dogs.

review/summary: Not your average chili!
review/text: We are in Houston and I used to buy Skytime Cincinnati Chili from Kroger.  They no longer stock it so I order it by the case...can't go without it!  My daughter lives in Austin and drives in on the weekends I make the chili.  One packet is perfect for a mid-week meal or make several in a stock pot for Sunday football.  We have it on angel hair pasta, top it with finely diced onions, diced jalapeno bread & butter pickles (the sweet heat compliments the cinnamon in the chili) and shredded cheddar cheese.  ***I reduce the water from 6 cups to 4 and I use very lean ground meat to reduce the grease on top.  You know it's good when your kids still ask for it 15+ years later!
