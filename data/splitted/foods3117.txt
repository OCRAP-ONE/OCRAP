review/text: good product. decent shelf life. at $10 or less for 4 containers with free s/h is a bargain. the packaging is horrible- such a big, plastic container, with plastic wrapping for 6 tiny packets of powder- i wish the packing was more environmentally friendly. remember when milk came in strong cardboard coated in wax- environmentally friendly and worked just as well as plastic....i use 1 packet to make a gallon (4 quarts) instead of 2 quarts- it still tastes good and lasts twice as long.

So you can make about 24-32oz with one of the packages...great if you carry a 1 liter bottle and want to just make one that way...otherwise it's kind of an awkward size.<br /><br />If you've tried crystal light then know that this one is solid...slightly tangy (lemonade) but quite tasty!<br /><br />If you've never tried crystal light then know that the aftertaste is nearly non-existent and this flavor is a good one!

review/summary: Less sweet and tastier  than plain Coke!
review/text: I have been looking for Mezzomix Stateside for years!  Fell in love with it while stationed in Germany.  Has a very refreshing, less sweet taste with a very pleasant, somewhat "peppery" aftertaste (for lack of a better term).  I haven't ordered any yet, but if they have not changed their formulation in the last 10 years, it is a great "adult" soda.  If you're into the really sticky sweet colas common to the American market, this is not for you. Don't get me wrong. It isn't tart.  It has plenty of sugar in it, about 107 Cal/250 ml worth, but less than the average American variety.  Can't wait to get my hands on some!

review/text: Saw these sodas profiled on a Travel Channel show recently and they sounded pretty good so decided to order them and give them a shot. Really good! They taste like Coke with a shot or two of orange. The orange isn't misplaced or overpowering and compliments the Coke flavor very well. They're also made by Coca Cola. I'll definitely be ordering more. If I can find them locally it'd probably be a lot less expensive though.

review/text: I had a chance encounter with this soft drink. I too was in Deutschland but on a vacation with my family. My Brother and I had gone into a fast food place, I guess you could call it that. It was a Donner Kebap, anyways they had cola lite which is much better than the american version of diet coke and mezzo mix, I had wanted to try it and I was impressed. This stuff is way better than any orange type soda produced in the states. The one I had was bottled not canned so there may be some slight taste to this the canned version.

review/summary: Mezzo Mix - Unique German carbonated cola
review/text: Having lived in Germany for almost eight years, Mezzomix was the choice cola to drink.  On the military base, you could only get the ,33l cans, while off base you could get bottles and tap Mezzomix.  Due to the blend of cola and orange taste, many people will find the sweeter colas in the US more to their liking.  Mezzomix is a solid cola, but is one that is selective.  Though isolated to a smaller crowd, this cola brings similar loyalty as Dr. Pepper with its followers.  Buy a few cans, see how it goes, and order from there.

review/summary: best tea ever...if you like a strong tea!
review/text: I first tried this at a small tea house in the suburbs of Chicago at my friend's bridal shower..I could not get it out ofmy head a few days later, that's how good it is...I just had to find out the brand. I looked on the tea house's site and found it!! It's about twice the price of what I (being a cheapo) would pay for tea but it's so worth it! But if you think about it...for 50 teabags...It's about 20 cents a serving so it's actually pretty cheap. the flavor is so rich, and the tea is a bit strong tasting so only get it if you don't mind strong tea. The bergamont is not overpowering which almost always is the problem with earl grey....It's so good, really helps a person unwind and relax...Even in today's 88 degree weather I drank it and enjoyed it! It even tastes amazing after it has cooled down...best tea I've ever had in my life.

review/summary: Harney & Sons are top notch
review/text: Harney and Sons blends some of the best teas we have tried.  It is clear the company takes care in using top quality tea (whole leaves, no dust), flowers/blossoms and flavorings.  Over the years, we have tried several of its teas and it's hard to pick a favorite.  The packaging is nice, with each bag sealed in its own foil pouch to ensure freshness.<br />This tea have a very rich and complex black tea flavor with no bitterness upon cooling. We brew it for six minutes to extract the full flavor.  The bergamot taste is mild, however, so if you are looking for a hearty citrus flavor, you may want to buy a small amount and give it a try.

review/summary: Great flavor, relatively mild
review/text: This is a very good blend of spices and does give a good "cajun" flavoring to dishes, though not nearly as spicy as our family tends to like food.  A couple things to keep in mind:<br />1) The jars are not round, but square with rounded edges -- make sure they'll fit in your spice rack!<br />2) They aren't kidding when they say "no salt" ... you'll probably find your dishes don't quite taste the same if you're used to cajun seasoning that includes salt.  If you don't like the new (and healthier) flavor, you'll need to add some additional salt yourself.<br />3) Rating something's spiciness is hard as the comparisons tend to be rather personal, but we at least find this blend to be on the mild end (a slight kick, but definitely less than medium spicy).  Adding some additional paprika, chili, etc may be necessary (side note: try smoked paprika, it's excellent!)

review/summary: a very tasty substitute for salt
review/text: For lovers of spicy food, this is an excellent replacement for salt (not an addition to it). It's better suited for cooking than sprinkling on prepared food, or the yummy but not that hot on the tongue taste may be contradicted by an annoying tickle at the back of your throat. I discovered this eating it on popcorn, and I like food so hot no one I know can tolerate it. In fact, I bought this spice(a case of it) after reading a review that described it as insufferably hot. It wasn't that way for me, at least on the tongue, yet it was yummy. I'm not sorry I bought it. It's salt heavy, so people who like salty but hot food will love it as a salt replacement.Use it for cooking, not to sprinkle.

review/text: EdenSoy is a brand that I have come to trust. We try to only eat organic and natural healthy foods, and all of the EdenSoy products are pantry staples in our home. They adhere to the highest standards for both product and manufacturing processes, far exceeding the requirements for organic certification. This is the most delicious soy milk we have tried, and I like that it is enriched with vitamins. Our daughter loves the vanilla. I use it to mix up my protein vitamin shakes - YUM! Great to have milk in a shelf-stable package -- just chill a few for school lunches, toss them in your picnic cooler, or pour over ice when you want to enjoy a healthy delicious drink. I used to order cases directly from EdenSoy (at high shipping cost due to weight!) Now I am SO happy that Amazon is carrying this soymilk (and other EdenSoy products) with free super-saver shipping!!

review/summary: Just Right
review/text: If you are allergic to milk or just trying to add more soy milk to your diet, the Edensoy milk is the best I've found. It is not too watery and not too creamy, just right.<br /><br />Many smoothies contain fruit which has been blended with yogurt and milk. The use of soy milk in this smoothie is a nice change and actually makes the smoothie more creamy. Soy milk contains Isoflavones which fight cancer and inhibit free radical damage.<br /><br />1 (15 oz.) can peaches in light syrup, drained<br />2 T. frozen orange juice concentrate<br />1 c. soy milk<br />2 T. vanilla-flavored protein powder (GeniSoy has a Vanilla Protein Shake worth looking for!)<br />6 ice cubes<br /><br />While peaches are my favorite in this recipe, you can adapt this recipe for use with similar soft fruits such as mangoes. Smoothies have so many possibilities. With a scoop of protein powder, the smoothie becomes a healthy breakfast or post-workout shake. To Make: Process the peaches, concentrate, milk and protein powder in a blender until smooth. Add the ice and then blend until smooth. Variation: Substitute fresh fruits for the canned peaches.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

My child won't drink it, and I must admit that I don't like it either. It has a very strong malt flavor, which I have never found in any other soy milks. I think the strong malt flavor is what turned my child off. I do enjoy chocolate malt drinks, but I don't like the malt flavor in this soy milk either. There is very little vanilla flavor in it that I could detect, and it's much less sweet than a typical vanilla soy milk. This lack of sweetness may be a plus for some people. I tried adding extra sugar and a tiny drop of vanilla to some of this to make it more palatable for my family, but it didn't work. This stuff is going to end up donated to the food bank because no one will drink it here!

review/summary: Gobble it up anytime you want!  A great product.
review/text: I know it's the off time for smoked turkeys and the such but it didn't deter us from trying this 6-8 lb smokehouse bird.  Old tom came packed correctly and cryo wrapped.  It is tender, easy to carve and cooked all the way through.  It took us maybe 30 minutes to carve the bird and stack the meat up high.  A complete bird ready to go without the fuss.  Order with confidence and expect it to be shipped within a reasonable amount of time.  Gobble gobble.

review/summary: Delicious! The best mustard I have ever had. And surprisingly cheap.
review/text: I vow to NEVER buy another bottle of the bright yellow stuff again (it was never that good to me anyway). I seriously never knew mustard could taste soooo good. My local grocery sells this, which is where I purchased it, and I will purchase more for Thanksgiving. If you love mustard, I imagine that you would love this. It has a very natural flavor, does not taste artificial at all, and also has mustard seeds scattered throughout (dont worry - they are not hard and crunchy). As an added bonus, the outer label comes off the jar when you open it, so it looks nice on the table! This is what mustard should taste like!

review/text: I wanted to try Cameron's Velvet Moon.  I ordered Velvet Moon, Vanilla Hazelnut and Donut Shop, and also a couple of flavors from San Francisco Bay brand.  I liked the idea of the more environmentally-friendly pods for the Keurig and the price was certainly right.<br /><br />I tried the Vanilla Hazelnut first.  I wasn't impressed with it.  It was rather bitter and I won't be ordering it again.  Last night, I gave Cameron's another shot and opened the factory-sealed box of Velvet Moon.  To my surprise, it wasn't Velvet Moon at all.  The box was filled with Donut Shop pods.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, that's two strikes for Cameron's.  The first box didn't taste good, and the second box was packed with the wrong pods.  If I like the Donut Shop coffee, I guess it's no-harm-no-foul.  But it certainly doesn't impress.  (The San Francisco Bay coffee, on the other hand, was superb and I highly recommend it.)<br /><br />UPDATE:  The Donut Shop coffee turned out to be pretty good coffee, although I do still prefer the SF Bay.  It is certainly better than most of the K-cups I've tried.  I am still annoyed about the packaging snafu, but might just try the Velvet Moon next time.  I'll watch to see what other reviewers think.

review/text: Open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles. The taste is even better. A little goes a long way. I add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent. Like another review, I also love this salt in popcorn. I add a pinch to my oil (usually clarified butter) before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle. A nice change of pace.<br /><br />This salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper. The truffle flavor is infused throughout. The salt I received on 5/31/2010 has a 'best before' date of 10/28/2012.

Zooming in on the picture I saw that it said 5% truffle, but the actual product I received in the mail was labeled 10% just like it says in the product name.

review/text: I have tried 8 different truffle oils and 4 different salts, this one stands out by far. The scent is so good it will have you repeatedly opening the jar for a "sniff", and later smelling your hands if you used your fingers to pinch some onto food.<br />Great with pasta, pizza, baked potato, anything that you put olive oil on-sprinkle this on too. See others comments for what they put it on, it is heavenly.<br />  I tried the fungusamongus brand, side by side there is no comparison, this one is the real scent.<br />  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I am waiting for a 20 or 25% product, so i can cut down my salt intake.[This one is 10%]<br />Enjoy ! you wont be dissapointed.<br />steve

review/summary: would buy again -- with caveats
review/text: Ah, the sensual taste of black truffles. This salt includes generous bits of black summer truffles, not winter truffles, but that's good enough for me. At least you know that you're getting actual truffle substance, in contrast to truffle oil, which often contains synthetic compounds (truffle "essence").<br /><br />I received this package last night and already sprinkled this truffle salt on mashed potatoes and on a veggie burger. I'm looking forward to adding this to my scrambled eggs every  morning and creating a blend with unsalted butter. As far as the truffle salt itself goes, I only wish that this were available at an even higher concentration than 10%.<br /><br />The main problem is the packaging. The lid does not keep in the beautiful aroma of truffles -- I don't mind the smell in the kitchen, but all that wonderful flavor won't end up in the food. I've portioned out some in a camping (screwtop) salt shaker so that I can keep the main stash in a ziploc bag. But to reiterate, the lid itself is really a bad packaging job. In fact, the jar was open when it arrived! I'm not sure whether to blame the manufacturer or Amazon, but this meant the truffle salt spilled all over the inside of bubble wrap and the cardboard box. I recovered most, feeling somewhat pathetic about the effort, but this is expensive stuff and easily 10% to 20% of the product got lost in transit. I guess that tells you how good the stuff is.

review/text: This truffle salt has excellent flavor and big chunks of black truffle in it. You can smell the truffles before you even open the jar. I find myself sprinkling it on everything. If you are used to using truffle oil or even real truffles, this won't taste the same. It is meant to be used as a seasoning, not to infuse full truffle flavor in dishes. I just ordered my third jar and realized that it's supposed to be refrigerated after opening. We just leave it on the counter and it's never gone bad. *shrug*

It's more of a finishing salt. I also tried it on sweet potato fries and plain popcorn. Amazing! I will definitely reorder this again, as it's going to be used frequently. Would make a nice gift, too.

review/text: I bought this truffle while visiting a specialty truffle store in seattle. I paid about $30 at the store. The salt granules are small and therefore adhere to food much better than the other types of salts with larger salt crystals. The 10% truffle content lets you know exactly how much concentration of truffle you get. While 10% doesn't seem like a lot, it really is! Best out there. I use the salt on potato chips, scrambled eggs, risotto, mac and cheese, and the list goes.

review/text: I've seen mixed reviews on truffle salts.  Some people love 'em.  Some people hate 'em.  I will say that, when cooking with this salt, there is a definite "flavor"... and it's good.  But the smell... oh man, the smell.  When you open this jar, anyone in a fifty foot radius will know it.  The jar holds it in well, and we don't have a problem with the smell leaking out into anything else in the vicinity... and maybe it's just us... but it's so potent.  It smells awful.  I don't know how something that smells so bad can taste so good.  It's a cheap enough luxury item that it's worth a shot.  If you can't stand it, someone is bound to take it off your hands.

review/text: If you like Acacia honey, you will like this honey. Acacia honey is a light flavor. I was getting very disappointed that Meeks honey has been getting darker and darker. They have lots of dark Meeks honeys for sale, but no light honey. I think Acacia honey has to come from Italy. I used to buy another brand of Acacia honey in a gourmet shop, but they stopped carrying it years ago. So, this stuff is really the best. Once you get spoiled by Acacia honey you won't want to go back to dark honeys. Clover Honey is ok, but kind of bland compared to Acacia honey.

When a friend informed me that there were different grades of vanilla beans and that Madagascar grade A-1 vanilla beans were the best, I thought is it really that different?  Vanilla is vanilla right?  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These Bourbon vanilla beans are flavorful, fresh, and vital.  I "tested" them in a tapioca vanilla pudding recipe for which I had previously used vanilla extract and the difference was night and day.  I am now pulling out recipes for vanilla honey, vanilla maple syrup, vanilla coffee drinks, vanilla bean cheesecake, and more.  I was amazed at the uses of these beans also.  This product is highly recommended.

You can go from freezer to microwave to your dinner table in 3 minutes as they are precooked! I serve them over rice with salsa or make nachos or tacos with them. WARNING! If you purchase these you'll become addicted. GOOD STUFF!

review/summary: I love these, but I've never had LU's Pim's
review/text: I saw another review for these and I wondered how they got 3 stars, but apparently there are better options out there for the true connoisseur. Given 3x the price tag for LU's Pim's, I'm probably going to stick with Delicje and not ruin my expectations...

review/summary: The price is right......
review/text: These LU brand cookies are produced in Poland as a joint project between Cadbury and Kraft and are very reminiscent of the LU Pim's cookies produced in Belgium. At approximately $1 a pack they are considerable cheaper than Pim's which are currently $2.99-$3.99 on supermarket shelves in the US (~ 1.15 Euro at Monoprix in Paris) for approximately the same amount by weight. There the comparison ends - the orange ones from Poland have less filling (about 25%) than Pim's and the filling,  per the label contains no orange pulp and they are thus significantly less tasty than Pim's. In the "Jaffa Cake" field, these cookies are quite comparable to McVitie's version of this treat - but neither holds a candle to the superior taste and texture of LU's Pim's. Since it appears that Amazon may be adding the "real thing" to its Subscribe and Save program in the future that may be a little cheaper than the store price you may avoid having to work your way through 24 packets of calorie rich substitutes. I only have 19 more to eat from my 99 cent/pack local purchase!

review/summary: Dixie Fry
review/text: I have used Dixie Fry for years and have always bought it locally. When the company sold out in January 2009 every store that carried it said they couldn't get it. I called the new company and they said they could get but the stores didn't order it.<br /><br />This is an excellent product for frying fish and I also use it with flour added when I fry chicken. Everyone always seems to like my fried chicken and want the recipe.<br /><br />The only thing was that they charged more for the shipping than what I paid for the six boxes of Dixie Fry.

review/text: If you are familiar with regular mini wheats, these are like those, except chocolatey and smaller. Absolutely delicious, and they don't turn the milk a different color. There is something unique about these: it feels like there is chocolate in the center. These are so great, you could just eat them plain.<br /><br />Because they are filled with fiber, they keep you full unlike those other "cocoa" cereals. If you prefer that super-sugary, artificial chocolate taste, then you might not like these as much. If you have kids, these are perfect for them, and relatively healthy (unless you can get your kids to eat Grape Nuts). As a side note, Grape Nuts with frozen blueberries -- try it.<br /><br />These are relatively inexpensive compared to purchasing them in store (if you can even find them), but the boxes are pretty small.

review/text: The kids love these and such a better price than in local grocery stores. The chocolate flavor is very good (this is just chocolate cereal, after all), they love the way it makes "chocolate milk" after they're done eating the cereal, and good ingredients (whole wheat, sugar (not HFCS), and no artificial colors.) Highly recommended!

review/summary: great chocolate fix!
review/text: I work in a school kitchen and one day I was having a chocolate craving. I had seen this cereal (in the serving bowl pack) and grabbed one. 100 calories for 28 grams is reasonable for a snack. Now I buy them by the box when it is on sale and repack them in snack-size bags at 28g. It is a good size serving and better than eating a bowl of chips or a candy bar for an evening snack. I don't even add milk, I eat it dry. Per 28g serving (about 21 pieces): 21g of daily recommended 48g of whole grain, very low in fat, 6g sugar and 3g of fiber.

Frosted on one side and a crunch of chocolate in the center.  It even makes a good snack straight out of the box.  Despite the frosting and the chocolate, it doesn't taste overly sweet.  I like it, and so do my kids.  We always seem to have a box of it around the house.

review/text: For all you health conscious people who still need your chocolate fix, I'm sure this is a great cereal for you and your kids.  I guess we are just too used to thinking chocolate is supposed to taste like cocoa pebbles or chocolate frosted flakes.  (Yes, super chocolatey and super sugary).  I know I'm not the only one who loves that.  This was too bland for us, but still o.k.  I wouldn't buy it again, but will finish off the 4 boxes and go back to our tried and true :)  S&S was a great deal for this though.

review/summary: "EDITED" .....Really a chocolate cereal
review/text: Guys, if you like sweetened mini-wheats and you enjoy chocolate flavored cereals, this is the one.  Now as other users noted, this is NOT like eating a creamy chocolate bar or eating chocolate ice cream. Let's face it, folks, IT'S mini wheats CEREAL, OK?!?!?!  To me though, it's a good mix of the sweetness and the cocoa; it's not an over abundance of chocolate, but the chocolate flavor is definitely there. And what's even better is that it's not the same "chocolatey-flavored" cereal that has no cocoa and just chemical flavorings. There is real cocoa and chocolate in this (hence the label "chocolate" cereal, and not something like "chocolate-muffin flavor"), however it does include on it's label artificial flavoring  after the cocoa and chocolate ingredients. I also find this to be much better than the other flavored mini wheat cereals (blueberry, strawberry etc.) which are over the top sweet and chemically tasting.  I also like the "little-bites" size of this cereal...they're smaller than the regular mini-wheats so you can get the proper amount on your spoon without dribbling milk all over the place.<br /><br />I munch this healthy snack right out of the box in the mid morning or late afternoon.  The price is right, too if you get the pack of 4 and select "subscribe and save"

review/text: I hope that Kellogg's doesn't stop manufacturing these wonderful chocolate treats, because that's how highly I think of them.  I usually eat Frosted Mini-Wheats for breakfast as I know they are healthy and I enjoyed the various types that were available in my local supermarket.  But, when I saw that they were available in chocolate, well I was delighted and subscribed to have them delivered by Amazon on a regular basis.  By the way, if one likes just a taste of chocolate in the evening, without the calories, these fit the bill.

review/text: We've been purchasing these choc. mini wheats for a couple months. They are a sweet, filling, late night snack for me in a bit of milk without too much fat, plus a nice serving of fiber & whole grains. My 7yr old son eats 1-2 bowls before school in milk. My two year old occasionally enjoys them also. We've gone through 1-2 boxes/week -- they come only in a smaller 15.8 oz size box at this time. I have not seen them lower than the $3.18 / box price I paid yesterday. The Amazon cost & their subscribe n save prices are great, I just ordered my 1st pkg. Kids can "switch off" as quickly as they "switch on" to a product, this is fine because you may cancel subscribe n save anytime.

However, I think that you should probably be aware that you can buy these sodas from drysoda.com in the same quantity for $32 right now, and that isn't on sale!  There is also a place on the site to see if someone carries it in your area.  I was just a few clicks away from purchasing this here, and decided to do a quick check on the website which is where I will buy it until the price is equal here.  Just to be clear, if it was just the soda I would give it 5-stars, but because the price is essentially doubled, I am driving the point home that the pricing is outrageous and hopefully giving it 1-star will get people to read this.

Burlap is a product of a fibre and I think this smell was a chemical used in the production of the cloth.  I certainly do NOT want my expensive green coffee beans ruined due to cheap (actaully not so cheap) storage bags.  I washed the bags and hung them in my garage to dry.<br /><br />I think I'm going to purchase COTTON coffee storage bags from a place called Sweet Marias.  Hopefully they'll be less stinky and better for clean storage.  Too bad Amazon doesn't handle merchandize from Sweet Marias.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This is good. I remember my parents taking the Dinty Moore beef stew with us when we went camping. It was good in the outdoors where we got extra hungry after hiking. This is the first time I've tried the turkey stew and it is "good stuff". I was surprised how good it is. I won't have any trouble eating the 6 cans once a month with the subscription plan. Often canned food like this is too salty but not this. The seasoning is perfect, the texture, the chunks of vegetables are so good. I don't think I'll ever make stew again.
