I love coffee and have traveled a lot, and this is as good as I have ever had anywhere...(of course you have to take in the ambiance of the location (kitchen vs Italy) there is no way to create that....yet.

review/summary: senseo coffee pods
review/text: Columbia is our current fav flavor.  Wish they would bring back Brazil.  It surprises me that Senseo doesn't focus more on the environmental impact of their paper pods as opposed to Keurig's plastic pods.  Would think that would be a great selling point.  Service from Amazon is great, and reliable.  We use the automated delivery and it never fails.  Thanks.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I've been using a Senseo coffee maker for 2 years. Last year, fewer of my local stores have carried any Senseo coffee pods. Fortunatly, I am able to purchase my dark roast and decaf on Amazon through automated shipping. Once a month I get my delicous dark roast and every 3 months I get my decaf. I save time and money and don't have to worry if the supermarkets or gourmet shops even have have my Senseo in stock.

review/text: This is not gourmet coffee.  No single cup coffee maker is.  But this IS serviceable, quick coffee.  Which is why I get it.  For what it is, it's nice.  It's also fairly cheap, and the subscribe and save option is very nice.  I like the medium roast much better than either the breakfast or dark roast, as it seems to have a nicer flavor.  If you have a senseo, this is the one I would recommend.

review/summary: A little disappointed!
review/text: I have been a Senceo coffee fan for quite a few years and have loved the rich taste, aroma and flavor of the "SENCEO" brand coffees. Lately the pods I have received are covered with coffee grounds and invariably each pack of pods has 1 or 2 pods that have separated enough to allow the grounds to leak out. The orifice through which the coffee passes as it is brewed becomes clogged with these grounds and your cup is empty at the end of the brewing cycle. The vacuum that is created during the brewing does not allow you to open the machine until the pressure subsides. The pods must then be removed once the pressure releases and the pod retainer must be removed and cleaned. "I must have the cleanest pod retainer because I am cleaning it after having tried to brew every cup of coffee lately". It seams that the quality control needs some attention! I will continue to use "SENCEO" brands of coffee because there really is no better pod coffee available. I have tried them all. They either do not fit in the pod retainer or the quality of the coffee is suspect!<br />I would love to know when the delux coffee maker will again be offered, I loved the ability to use a taller coffee cup with the adjustable coffee spout.

review/text: I was a fan of Senseo coffee for many many years. It is a fourth coffee machine in my house, many of my friends bought senseo coffee machine on my recommendation.<br />I loved senseo medium roast coffee for the taste, which was very similar with Starbucks latte, my favorite.<br />What happened? I bought 6 packs of Senseo Medium Roast, and it tastes very strange. Like old, cheap and poorly preserved coffee. Unfortunately, I already scheduled next delivery of 6 packs (I drink a lot of coffee).<br />What is I am going to do, is to cancel next schedule and go to internet to find another good coffee company.

review/summary: Senseo coffee opinion
review/text: I have owned my Senseo coffee machine for eight years now. I use it almost exclusively. I purchased a second machine for my home in Puerto Rico and then found I could not buy the coffee there. I have found that I could buy the coffee through Amazon so I set up a subsciption and I am very happy with it. I looked at Wal-mart, target, and several grocery stores. I know it would be popular if there were a place to buy the machines and the coffee.

Luckily I have bought the the Senseo Supreme coffee maker which allows me to adjust the amount of water for each cup.<br />If you make 2/3 cup of coffee the taste is really good and nothing to complain about. If the pod are too weak for you than get Senseo supreme coffee maker.

I admit, McDonalds Special roast, or whatever they call it, is good, but not nearly as good as Senseo.  I have tried all their unflavored roasts, (mild medium and dark) and they're all good.  I've just really taken a liking to medium roast.  When I go to a restaurant now, their coffee is like colored water in comparison.

review/text: Amazon allows me to enjoy my Senseo coffeemaker thoroughly...  Our local stores don't always have the pods, and so the simple and easy way to handle that is to order them from Amazon!!!  It's so easy and convenient, and I can always put a rush on the order...  Thanks for having these pods available...

review/summary: awesome coffee
review/text: I purchased the Senseo coffee machine after a friend recommended it and I am so pleased with it and all the flavor choices of coffee that are available.  My favorite is Breakfast Blend which is perfect for that first cup in the morning.  It's smooth and flavorful.  The Senseo machine and coffees can't be topped!! Kona blend is also awesome!!

review/summary: Rich, strong coffee
review/text: My husband is the big coffee drinker in our household, and he loves the Senseo coffee pod system and the coffee that the pods make. We have the Senseo coffee maker, and he brews the Expresso coffee using the 8 oz setting, because the 4 oz setting that he uses for his Columbian and Sumatra is too strong for the Expresso brew. He loves the flavor occasionally but it's not his favorite -- the Columbian ranks first and the Sumatra second. The great thing about the pod system is that he can brew different flavors and have a cup of each without having to brew a whole pot of any one flavor. The Expresso is very rich and very strong, and a nice change occasionally when he is in the mood for a real coffee "high". If someone added sweetener and creamer, it would probably work to brew the 4 oz cup, but my husband drinks his Expresso blend black, so the 8 oz setting is better for his taste.

review/summary: Great roast, great taste
review/text: I use Senseo coffees at least twice a day. We have several flavor and roast varieties. Senseo is a Dutch roast coffee but the pads are made in Belgium. The medium blend is a very good tasting coffee and just right for me. This is the pad we use most often, and when making two cups at a time in the Senseo machine, we combine one medium roast with one decaf pad.... gives us a half-caf cup with great body and flavor.

Only one drawback...I think the price per pod is too high. I looked all over the Internet for the best unit price and found none...EXCEPT for Amazon's. Thank You Amazon! What you offer in your subscription for the Senseo coffee pod makes the pod price livable. YOUR'S IS A GOOD DEAL!

review/summary: my personal experiance with medium and dark Senseo coffeeI have been enjoying
review/text: I have been enjoying medium and dark roast Senseo coffee for several years. I find the quality cosistant and excellent taste. The Senseo coffee machine is simple to use and creates a cup of coffee very rapidly. I particulary like the foam that the machine automatically creates on each cup of coffee which adds a special taste feature to the early sips. Over time all of our guests have always enjoyed and complimented us on the fresh and good coffee. I purchase all my Senseo coffee from Amazon. Their pricing is more favorable and delivery is always efficient.

review/summary: Serves the purpose!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Senseo DARK ROAST coffee pod was acceptable as an alternative to brewing my usual Sumatra beans from Starbucks. I made the transition ONLY because I was having shoulder surgery, and knew I would have very limited use of my hand to make coffee. I am surviving better than I thought I would, but at some point will go back to brewing. One thing pod-coffee-making lacks is that "wonderful aroma" of the brew! But this works fine for now. Warning--if you crave the aroma as well as the taste of your coffee in the morning, then this is NOT FOR YOU!

review/summary: Hassle Free Coffee!!!!
review/text: This product loses one star because it tastes a bit like instant coffee, but you get used to that flavor fast as the months roll by without need of maintenance. Gone are the days of pulling out a filter, a filter tray, a coffee pot, and for some a grinder for daily washing. You merely take out the tiny pod tray and rinse it off when you're done drinking coffee for the day. If you use filtered water, there won't be any calcium deposits. The only thing you have to watch for is green algae growing in the water reservoir, but that takes a really long time to develop. This coffee and it's hardware are effortless to make and maintain. A little pricy, but such a time saver!!! I would definitely recommend SENSEO.

review/text: I am not a "coffee connoisseur" but I do enjoy morning coffee.  The local grocery stores in my area refuse to carry the Breakfast Blend, which I enjoy the most.  But they did sell the regular, medium roast blends of Sensor and other brands.  The Sensor pods have worked great for me - especially as I usually only have one or two cups in the mornings.  However, now that Amazon offers the Sensor Pods in Breakfast Blend, I have been very happy, and love my morning coffee now.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product; and, THANK YOU to Sensor for offering it on Amazon.

I don't know why anyone would would drink coffee from the behemoth, Keurig, when a Senseo makes a a crema-laden, absolutely delicious cup of the same...for less than half the price. I am not a coffee snob...I just enjoy (OK...let's be honest, I NEED) coffee...(HATE Starbucks...except for the relatively drinkable breakfast or Pikes Place blends)...otherwise Starbucks is what we used to call "BURNT" coffee in my youth (Started with 1/2 coffee, 1/2 milk in the 2nd grade...today that'd be considered child abuse)....if served a cup of mud like that...we'd send it back.

review/text: I was having a hard time finding coffee pods for our Krups coffee maker in the stores in my area.  I purchased these Senseo coffee pods and they are wonderful.  We usually make the 7.5 ounce cup so the coffee is flavorful (medium roast) and not too strong or bitter.  The pods fit nicely in the machine, unlike some that we've tried that are too large so that the machine leaks water everywhere.  I order by the case and it comes every 3 months, so I don't have to worry about hunting them at the store - plus, the price is nice.

review/text: Everyone I know that uses a pod brewer at home or work loves it. Fresh coffee made to order, endless variety, no waste, etc. It is a shame that so many settle for the coffee pods made by big commerical roasters like Melitta and Douwe Egberts. The blends used by these big companies are bland and boring compared to all the great coffees offered by smaller roasters. Having had the opportunity to taste a variety of pods, I hope the list below of my favorites is helpful. Many of these are also much better coffee at a lower price!

Now, I checked my Subscription account and see that the price has increased to $30.02 for this plan!!  What's up with that?<br /><br />This increases the price per package to $1 each!!  I'm not having luck finding this product in stores anymore, so I'm kind of stuck with this increased subscription plan as well--since I'm not ready to give up my Senseo machine after a 7 year habit of drinking Senseo coffee.<br /><br />I just want to know why Amazon increased the price on this subscription plan, and why did they not send any emails to inform subscription customers about this?!!  If had not logged on to check my subscription account, my next auto-billing would've come as a surprise and I would not have deducted the correct amount from my bank account for the next shipment!!<br /><br />But yeah, the Senseo machines and Douwe Egberts/Sara Lee pods are the best!!

review/text: At my Christmas dinner, one option is Egg Nog latte.<br />Use one pod of espresso, press the button on the Senseo machine for a 'small' cup.<br />Add 1/2 cup of egg nog, add 1/4 cup 2% milk, add 2-3 tsp of sugar.<br />Heat to desired temp and stir to dissolve sugar.  A dash of Nutmeg on top.<br />It's close enough to Starbucks for me.  :-)

review/summary: Great coffee/Damaged packaging
review/text: The Senseo Dark Roast coffee is wonderful.  However, when I opened the first of six packages of pods it turned out that many of the pods were open and some of the coffee had come out.  I hope it is just a fluke and that the other five pods' contents will be in good shape .....

review/text: At least 3 of the packets had broken pods and I foolishly thought I could just shake off the loose coffee...actually the fine stuff just got into my coffee machine and it took me hours to get it cleaned out. (I actually thought it was ruined and got another Senseo machine.) What should I do when I open a packet and find it full of coffee??

review/summary: One of the best balanced Senseo Pod Blends
review/text: It is only 10% Kona, so if you are expecting a true Kona taste you may be disappointed.  However, as a general blend, this is far smoother and has a more full flavored (but not full bodied), not burnt taste than most of the Senseo Coffee Blends.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded if the coffee was a bit stronger or full bodied, but still, as it is, it is my go to blend for my Senseo.

review/summary: Great Coffee..  Great Price
review/text: I've spent the last 5 years or so trying different coffee makers and types of coffee. Jura-Capresso Super Automatic to a Rancilio Silvia a "true espresso lovers" machine. While traveling I needed a small easy coffee maker that would be an easy set up and inexpensive. After reading reviews I purchased the Senseo machine for $50. on Amazon and have tried several different Senseo pod samples..  settling finally on the espresso..  It is truly a wonderful cup of coffee..  Strong, not bitter and very close to the "real thing"  Any coffee lover will appreciate this product after trying several of the coffee varieties.  And although the unit has gone up to around $65. it is still a bargain in my opinion. I now purchse the Senseo Espresso monthly on Amazon and receive a 10-15% discount. A real bargain. Buy it.. you won't be dissapointed!

review/text: Being from Chicago area, I love good strong, full bodied coffee.  And this product is just that.  The Senseo brews it well but these little pads of coffee give you only one European size cup not the big hit-you-in-the-eye cup. So don't go cheap, push the demi-tasse button and drink a real but small cup of coffee.

review/summary: This is so convenient, and I LOVE fresh coffee!
review/text: Imagine having a freshly-brewed cup of coffee every time you want a cup? No more icky, old, disgusting coffee that has been sitting on the warmer for an hour - and you feel you ought to drink it because after all, you made it. Well, this is your answer. These are a nice balance between the old standby can of coffee, and the (very) expensive (for me, anyway) Keurig coffee pods. I only drink one big cup of coffee in the morning anyway, so these are so perfect for me. If I really crave a half cup more, just slip in one pod and make a half cup. It is a little more expensive for me because I use two pods at a time to make my coffee really zing. No more wasted coffee! And a fresh cup every time. I don't think it gets any better than that. Unless you can afford to go to Starbucks every morning - and up here in cold, snowy Michigan, who wants to do that???? I love this coffee!

review/summary: Senseo subscription
review/text: Received fairly quickly.  I have been using pods for years so not a new concept.  I bought for use with solofill which is another review.  Did not work that well.  I am now using the pods in my Starbucks French Press mugs with my Keurig.  Just throw the pods in, dispense the boiling water, put the cover on, pump a few times and you can either pour into another mug or just start drinking at your liesure.  I will have to see how the subscription works.  I had enough purchase for free shipping so I will see in two months when the next shipment arrives.  The medium roast is not strong at all.  No floaters to strain through your teeth.

review/summary: Great seneso pods!  Use 1 for the "2 cups" button on Senseo.
review/text: I like regular strength coffee and cappuccinos/lattes...So, I use one of these dark pods while pushing the "2 cups" button on my Senseo maker.  It costs 1/2 to do this rather than use 2 of the regular Senseo pods, and it's still very yummy!  The flavor is strong, but not burnt, and is a great everyday coffee.

review/summary: Senseo dark roast coffee pods
review/text: I have used this product before and am very pleased with it.  The coffee maker was a gift a few years ago and it makes better coffee than any in home appliance I have ever used.  I would highly recommend the Senseo Single Cup coffee maker and coffee pods to anyone who likes a quick, easy and very good cup of coffee whenever it's desired.  There are several coffee blends available to suit about any taste, so everyone can enjoy his favorite.  I also enjoy the subscription option for ordering products such as these.  The cost is very reasonable and it's easy to ensure that there is always a supply on hand.

review/text: This coffee is bold, and delicious.  Any day that I don't feel like getting a bold Sumatra from Starbucks, this is just as good (if not better).  To make your coffee even more delicious using the Senseo machine, always remember to run the machine once without any coffee.  After doing so, immediately brew using this Sumatra coffee, and it will be extra foamy and delicious.

review/text: I initially bought the senseo machine because I wanted a machine that could brew one fresh cup at a time for my office.<br />I don't like the idea of hot water running through a plastic cup as you get with the K cups from Krupps.<br />Additionally, the Kcups are very expensive in comparison.<br />I have tried probably all of the senseo coffees and I love them all.<br />The only recommendation that I have is that they put an organic coffee on the market.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a one cup machine, get the senseo.

PLUS if I really want to use the coffee outside of the pods; I simply empty 3-5 pods into a old school paper filter and I can make a entire pot of drip brew just as easily.<br /><br />I cannot understand why this system is not as popular in my area (North Eastern US)<br /><br />O-Well I guess that is OK; as I can get good deals on the pods when it is time to replenish my stockpile ;-)

review/summary: Awesome Coffee
review/text: This is by far our favorite coffee to use in the Senseo.  We discovered it in a variety pack we often ordered, and decided that we liked it so much that we needed to start ordering it by itself in bulk.<br /><br />It's awesome that both my husband and I like it so much, because he leans toward bold coffees while I tend to go a little bit mild.  I think this one would qualify as being on the more bold side of the spectrum, but not extremely so.  It also has a slightly chocolaty flavor to it somehow...  Just barely.

review/text: I use this in a Keurig coffee maker, using the adaptor cup.  It works fine, and the coffee is good.  Although the Keurig is nice and convenient, it is not the cheapest way to get a cup of coffee.  Using these pods cuts the cost about in half.<br /><br />I like this dark roast and will continue to buy it.  The taste of coffee, like the taste of anything else, is a personal preference.  I like it, but you might hate it.  The pods, though, are reasonably-priced and work well with my Keurig.
