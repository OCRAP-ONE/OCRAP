review/summary: This stuff is the BEST
review/text: I'm am not one to be pimping for corporate processed food - but I gotta make an exception this time.  It's awful to have to try and make do with the fluorescent orange chemical version after you've gotten used to the organic.  I don't entirely trust that it is in fact organic, but it really is good.  I would buy it locally, but it seems I'm the only who likes it in my neighborhood, so the grocers yanked it.<br /><br />Oh, and the yellow cheese version is also really good.

review/text: Not all that expensive when purchased in bulk.  Flavorful enough that I subscribed for even more savings.  Grinding your own beans just prior to brewing is the single best improvement to coffee I know of.  I'm often asked at work "What smells so good?"  It smells a tad like chocolate, even to my tin nose.  ( ;- D )  Happy camper!

review/summary: fantastic taste but . . .
review/text: I love the taste of this tea.  I love it so much that I was drinking four or five cups of it per day.  After three or four days of this however, I started getting terrible abdominal cramps.  Initially, I didn't connect the two, but thought I might be getting a flu.  After two weeks, I stopped drinking the tea.  It took about five days for the cramps to stop.  I then started the tea again, just to see if I got cramps again.  Well, I did.  So, although I love the taste of this - I can only drink one cup on occasion.  This doesn't mean that you will have the same problem - just be aware of it.  But, again, it tastes great!

It brews nicely and can be weak or strong, depending on how many bags you use, I prefer it strong.

review/text: Find myself using two bags for just 1 cup of tea and letting it steep for the full 15 minutes (which means the tea's at roughly room temperature by the time it's strong enough to drink).  Otherwise it literally tastes like water.  Alvita ginger tea has a much bolder ginger flavor using just 1 bag and letting it steep for half the time.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing Triple Leaf product again.

review/summary: Weak!
review/text: Reading reviewer statements about its full flavor and strong taste etc was very surprising to me. As a few other reviewers had mentioned, this tea,while nicely priced when buying in bulk, has almost no flavor even when I use a bag In a quarter cup of boiling water. I've tried simmering in a cup of water as well as adding a coue of tea bags to a half cup of piping hot boiling water into a pre heated ceramic mug so as not to lose the heat from the water into the coolness of a room temp mug. All to no avail. Maybe the few of us who can't taste the flavor just ended up with weak ginger product in our tea bags. I'm open to any possibility,but I'm gonna have to find another stronger tea for my ginger cravings. Any suggestions people?

My pizzas take about 10 minutes to prepare and 15-20 to cook and are cheaper and tastier than those at the pizza chains.

review/summary: Pretty good alternative to store olives
review/text: Currently, I can buy a 6-ounce can of jumbo pitted olives at Food Lion for $2.49. These are a bit more expensive per ounce, even on a subscription basis. However, I've weighed a number of factors and just now ordered a second lot of these ahead of schedule. Aside from price, here are the things I considered:<br /><br />1. These are at least as good as any other black olives I have tried.<br /><br />2. The sizing is much more convenient. Using an entire 6-ounce can at once is often not very convenient. Suppose I just need smaller amounts for stir fry or salads? In the end, using one of these cans serves my purposes better and is more economical than the bigger store-bought cans.<br /><br />3. While I can certainly chop whole olives myself, this product saves me the trouble. And there IS a certain elegance to having neatly sliced olives, especially when presentation makes a difference.<br /><br />4. I'm pretty lazy, and it's hot outside. Sometimes it's nice to just push a button and wait for UPS to drop things on my doorstep.

review/summary: Unbelievably good
review/text: There are a million different snack bars out there. The ones from Divinely D'lish are unique and in a class by themselves. I discovered them at the farmer's market in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. One taste and I was hooked for life.<br /><br />Since then, they have found their way into local shops here on the peninsula in the Bay Area. But now that they are available online at Amazon, anyone anywhere can enjoy them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is simple, straightforward, healthy and impressive. No GMO, no trans fats, unsulphered dried fruit, an emphasis on organic. They look like someone took tons of different kinds of grains (but they're wheat-free), seeds and nuts and mashed them together with dates, raisins, syrup, coconut. You can see every seed - nothing is pulverized and there's no flour filler. They're soft, but the nuts and seeds give them an oh-so-satisfying crunch.<br /><br />I heat them up very slightly and they taste like the most heavenly fresh baked cookies imaginable. My husband's favorite is the Cheeky Cherry Chocolate but since I try and steer clear of chocolate, my favorite is the Haute Diggity Date. He packs them on long business trips to help him over jet lag. I pack them as gifts for my east coast friends instead of the See's candy I used to bring. People seem to really appreciate something good to eat they don't have to feel guilty about.<br /><br />The only negative - and it's a big one - is it's almost impossible to exercise moderation with these things. Even if you can buy them locally here in the Bay Area, you might as well buy them online by the box. They'll be gone in a flash.

review/text: 18 Rabbits makes the best granola bars in my opinion.  My favorites are the Haute Diggity Date and the Nibblin' Apricot.  The fact that it is simple and organic is important to me, but I wouldn't eat it if it didn't taste good, too.

review/summary: Holy Moly
review/text: I like quick easy breakfasts, to the point that for awhile I was just skipping breakfast because I'm too lazy to fix anything.  So I've gotten myself into the habit of grabbing a bar of some sort on my way out.<br /><br />Problem is, 99% of the bars out there are either bland, or dry, or overly processed garbage.  I found that I quickly got sick of whichever one I was currently on and reverted to just skipping breakfast.  Tried Fiber One for awhile, then Cliffe, then a friend turned me on to KIND bars which were a big upgrade taste wise but quickly got old (I also suspect they've been changing their formulas as all their bars taste more and more like all peanuts), then Larabar which was good but a bit too sweet and guey.  All the bars, even the better Kind and Larabars, had one thing in common in that I was basically forcing myself to shove them down my throat on the way to work each morning so I wouldn't skip breakfast.  They were all "ok" as a quick convenient snack and when compared against similarly convenient food that's not an outright candybar, but none of them were really what I'd consider "good" in a broader sense.<br /><br />Then I stumbled on these 18 Rabbits on Amazon - holy moly!  These things are awesome.  I would eat these willingly over a lot of cookies or candy bars or other snack foods.  They are legitimately good when judged in the broader category of "food", not just good when compared to other bars.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but I don't really care because they're worth it.  And kind of high in calories, which doesn't really matter to me because I'm using these as more of a meal replacement than a snack.<br /><br />They are by far the best of the convenient, prepackaged bars that I've tried thus far, and I'm not sure I have any reason to keep trying others now so will likely be the best I find period.

It was the best<br />nutrition decision I have ever made.  These wheat free bars are delicious!  Since I deleted gluten from my diet by my own choice, my system cannot handle anything<br />with gluten.  Also, Uno Pizzeria has a gluten free pizza which is delizioso.  Buon appetito!!

review/text: I love the 18 Rabbits product.  I tried a couple of their flavors and I like the ones w/ dates and raisins and the other with dried cherries.  Their bars are very simple, not overly sweet.  It's truly like eating very good granola that is held together with honey.  They aren't very filling, but make a nice in between meal snack.

review/summary: No Sugar Rush Amazing Taste!
review/text: I tried these bars yesterday for the first time. They're delicious and I don't get a dreaded sugar rush. I recently gave up eating candy and sweets and could not eat granola bars before. The other brands don't compare to this one, I'm ordering three boxes and placing them in my car, desk at work and kitchen for the family. I live in San Francisco and read about the owner the company is doing great work. Spreading the joy of healthy whole food. I recently had a baby and eating healthy is hard, if your tired of cardboard tasting granola bars and corn syrup, then try these bars.

review/text: I had these bars before in a Dallas coffee shop and they were wonderful.  I was happy to find them on Amazon, but when they arrive they were hard as a rock.  After chewing them about a minute they softened up - but they were not very fresh tasting.  They were within their expiration date, so not sure why they were so stale.

review/summary: Great Potato Soup
review/text: I think this is a really good potato leek soup.  It's creamy/pureed (like most if not all the Imagine soups), it's organic (which is preferable when it comes to potatoes with their high pesticide count), and it's pretty nutritious, with a fair amount of vitamin C and iron.  I also like that they are in recyclable cartons, and I assume w/o the unhealthy BPA plastic lining that most tin cans have, including most organic soups (the inside of the box is lined with a foil- looking type of liner, though not sure what it's actually made of).  So, it's not a chunky potato soup, if that's what you prefer, but I think it's a really good-flavored creamy one.  And the whole 32-oz carton is only 400 calories, so if you eat half (and that's a big bowl), it's only 200 calories a meal.  They also come in 16-oz cartons.

review/summary: Great soup
review/text: This is a delicious, low fat, nourishing soup that I use a lot -- hence my ordering a six-pack from Amazon. In addition to eating it straight, I use it as a substitute base for high-calorie cream soups (e.g., saut&eacute; a lot of mushrooms in butter, add a carton of this soup -- et voil&agrave;! -- creamy mushroom soup with calories in the butter, yes, but no heavy cream); I also add some curry powder to hot soup or serve it cold with chopped scallions and cucumbers -- and on and on.  HOWEVER, Aja is absolutely right in saying the packaging is bad.  So, five stars for the soup, but a separate, less complimentary review for the packaging.

review/summary: Some Tough Bits, But Tasty, Not Mushy, Fresh Taste
review/text: These are pretty good.<br /><br />The cans are well filled with product, and not too much water.  The cans have a pull-top which is easy to open.<br /><br />The artichokes do appear to be young, smaller ones and, rather surprisingly, the gentle aromas and flavor complexities of that still comes across, even in the canned product.  They all have an even, healthy color without bruising or other blemishes.  While it's true that all canned foods are going to taste "canned", these are much less noticeable in that regard than any other artichokes packed in water that I've purchased.  The flavor is good, as is the texture.  They are quite tender, not mushy, but you can easily smoosh them for puree or bruschetta or what you will.<br /><br />They are quartered pieces, easy to use as-is or chop as desired.  I have had to remove what I consider to be some tough bits and outer leaves.  Maybe these weren't bad enough to bother other people.  I've had much worse from canned artichokes!<br /><br />They do not lend a canned/metallic flavor to other ingredients, nor are they too salty, oily, vinegary, bitter, stale, or any of the other unpleasant flavors that one often gets with canned artichokes.  Cooked as an addition to other dishes they contribute appealingly.

Finally, the company is not very responsive and took 11 to 12 days to ship the product after they had the order. The deficiencies are in this product and not with Amazon!!!!!

review/summary: Great Mint - Hard to Find
review/text: These are great ice-cool mints with a sweet peppermint flavor.  They don't sting or assault your senses, but they do freshen your breath. They are a little stronger than the generic white and red peppermint hard-candies that restaurants set out in bowls, and these give you a nice cool sensation like a york or junior mint. As these mints age (say a year), they also mellow.<br /><br />With so much mint gum, it's hard to find a good mint tablet.  Many alternatives have caffeine, crunchy shells, or are uncomfortably intense.  Not these. They are just perfectly balanced.<br /><br />I stumbled across these mints about two years ago on a 3000 mile road trip.  Since then, I've purchased several 9-pack boxes.  I've never seen these at stores since my original purchase.  Dentyne has a companion flavor to these "ICE" mints, called Fire. I have seen the fire mints in stores.<br /><br />As far as use, I keep these between my bed and bathroom.  I used to have a habit of waking up hungry and "sleep-eating" when I'd get up to use the bathroom.  I've retrained myself to grab a mint instead.  Since they are sugar free, they don't rot my teeth.  And, since they aren't too strong... they don't wake me up too much.  I just suck on the mint until I fall back to sleep.

The 1.8 oz. size contains 6 canisters, and the 1.2 oz. size contains 4 canisters.  I subscribe to the 1.8 oz. size when it's available.  The only complaint I have is that periodically the 1.8 oz. size becomes unavailable, but Amazon notifies me when this happens, and you can sign up to be notified when it's available.  The price per 1.2 oz. container is $2.79 when you use Subscribe & Save.  Shipping is free.  I used a coupon cope as well and got the 1.2 oz. 6-pack at $2.14 per container (4 canisters/container).  I've been pleased with Amazon's Subscribe & Save overall and use it for various different items.

review/summary: BEWARE!  Used to be good, now full of FILLERS!
review/text: I've used this product for 9 years, ever since we went through puppy training with my dog.  Since then, it's been a relatively healthy treat and a good tool for behavior reinforcement.  I say relatively healthy because so many dog treats are full of wheat and other grain fillers.  The Amazon product ingredient listing is for the OLD formulation.  Let's examine the first 8 ingredients of that formulation:<br /><br />Lamb, Lamb Hearts, Lamb Kidneys, Lamb Lungs, Whole Wheat Flour, Rice Flour, Lamb Fat (Preserved with mixed Tocopherols and Ascorbic Acid source of Vitamin C) Sucrose.<br /><br />The first 4 ingredients are lamb, and so the inclusion of wheat and rice flour as the fifth and sixth ingredients, while not optimal, is allowable for texture.  The lamb fat is perfectly good for a dog's diet, while the eigth ingredient, sucrose (table sugar) is not healthful at all.  Presumably it was added for palatability, but as the eight ingredient overall, it might be an acceptable concession.<br /><br />Now, check out the new formulation's first 8 ingredients, from the Natural Balance web site:<br /><br />Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour.<br /><br />Only 3 of the first 8 ingredients could be considered optimal for canine health: the rest is filler or worse.  Wheat flour and sugar displace two meaty ingredients in the top 4, and SUGAR is now the third ingredient overall.  SUGAR.  Folks, this is NOT good for your dog.  They've taken a mostly healthy treat and made it sweeter, pumped up the filler grains, and even increased how much salt is in it.  This isn't a MEAT roll any longer, it's basically meat-flavored Doritos.  AVOID this at all costs if you care about your dog and keeping him healthy for a long time.<br /><br />It's too bad that my dog loves this so much, because now I will have to buy a better, more healthful product, or make my own treats.  SHAME on Natural Balance for junking up their product at the expense of the animals' health.

review/summary: Best. Meatlog.  Ever.
review/text: Agree with previous description of this item as "puppy crack".  We have a 5 month old mini schnauzer mix who is happy to ignore us on walks, tugging on the leash with perceived strength of a small grizzly bear in order to reach the "OMG I HAVEN'T SMELLED THIS ONE YET" leaf 10 feet away.<br /><br />We cut up pieces of this lamb roll (about 5mm cubes) to use as treats, and once he smells it he transforms into the "OMG OMG. GIMME. I'LL BE GOOD. GIMMEEEEEEEE!" dog we all wish we had. He'll follow right next to us on walks, eyes upward in hope/greed.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Satiate yourself before you handle the meatlog, lest you be tempted to try it!  It smells delicious.<br />- Cut off only as much as you think you need that day, as smaller pieces tend to dry out (even in tupperware in the fridge) and lose their ultra-attractive smell. Alternatively, cut larger pieces and tear off smaller ones as you go.<br />- Consider the 2.5 lb or 1 lb versions if you have a small dog.  We have a 15 lb pup who goes on 3+ walks a day and we estimate the 2.5 lb log will last us several months.<br /><br />I have no experience with using the meatlog as his regular meal as I would prefer it stay high-ranked on his list of "OMG AWESOME STUFF".

She could be picky about the treats, but a few weeks into class one of the trainers tried giving a small piece of roll to her.  She LOVED it and would do ANYTHING for it!  After that I immediately went out and bought one, and have used it to help train my second dog, too.  The best way for using it as a treat is to cut off a small slice (maybe a quarter-inch thick), then cut that into small squares to make them bite size.  Perfect for dog training!<br /><br />Another way I use it now is with the dog food.  I don't use it as a straight feed for my dogs because it would cost me too much.  I found what works great is adding it to their dry food.  I feed my dogs Natural Balance Ultra Premium Dog Food and I use a grater/shredder and shred some of the roll and mix it in with their food.  Even the pickiest of eaters will probably eat their food then.

review/summary: Best Dog Food
review/text: I have a very picky eight year old dauchand who would never eat regular dog food. We tried everything from Iams,Science Diet,and Eukenuba and Gretchen would have none of it. She hated "dog food". I read about Natural Balance while on the internet and went to the pet store ASAP and bought her a beef roll. When I got it home and opened it I was surprised that it actually smelled good just like a summer sausage. Gretchen loves it!! For the past three months this has been her primary food and she really loves it and it does not end up in the trash like all the other dog foods that she has tried that she would have nothing to do with. This really is a great product for a picky dog.

review/summary: For a treat, perhaps
review/text: My dog, who has a sensitive stomach, tolerates this product well and really likes it.  In consistency it is like soft pepperoni sausage, which makes it more convenient to handle than canned food under some circumstances.  For example, I can cut a slice of it and send it with my dog to dog care in a plastic bag, whereas sending canned food can be a problem if I want to give him a portion less than a whole can.<br /><br />The roll is shelf stable for a period of time, but once opened must be refrigerated, and if you are not going to use it for a while, should be frozen.  This is a large roll which will take up space in the fridge.  I put a plastic grocery bag over the open end and held it on with rubber bands.<br /><br />Three stars because of the ingredients.  The ingredients are listed differently on the roll than they are on this or any other website that I've found.  The first three listed ingredients are: lamb lungs, wheat flour, and sugar.  Many dogs are allergic to wheat, so this is not a great choice; and I can't imagine why there should be sugar in anything claiming to be a dog food.  Maybe in a dog treat.

review/summary: Amazon's ingredients list is VERY wrong
review/text: I am so disappointed that the manufacturer has drastically changed the formulation of this food.  It can no longer be considered a healthy food.  Amazon has not changed its info, which is irresponsible because customers are buying based on the info presented here.  The real ingredient list is:<br /><br />Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour.<br /><br />So basically, it's like feeding your dog a lamb-flavored doughnut. Sugar as the third ingredient?! More sugar than actual lamb?  Why not just label it "lamb candy"...?<br /><br />Sad. My dog loved this food.  Well, no wonder, I guess.  I love doughnuts, too... but I don't eat them.

review/text: We use this to supplement our puppy's kibble, we grate it and mix it in. We also cut it into small cubes and use it for training. He loves it!<br /><br />The only thing I wish I'd have realized before we bought it is that if you're only using it as a treat or meal addition (and not as the main meal), and you have a small breed dog (ours is a Havanese puppy) it will take a LONG time to go through the 4 lb roll. In the future, I'll buy the 1 or 2.5 pound roll just so that we use it up and are opening a fresh roll more often.

review/summary: Yummy in your dogs tummy
review/text: I am a dog trainer and this is one of the tricks of our trade.  While I feel it's a tad overpriced, dogs love it and so do cats.  I, like most posters here, cut it into bite sized training nibbles and use it as positive reinforcement during training.  Red Barn has a 4 lb food roll which is a tad less expensive, but I have seen NB's roll in pet stores for $11-and some change.  The good thing with this roll is you can cut the pieces as big or as small as you want, but once you open a package you must use it.  I have never done so, but I assume you can freeze this stuff for future use.  The 4 lb roll lasts a pretty long time if you use it as a training aid.

review/summary: Dog loves the taste
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />I cut one 1/4" slice into 30 treats for my puppy. He loves the taste, and I only use them in situations where a high value treat is needed, like when training around distractions.<br /><br />Also useful for administering pills. Puppy recently got stung by a bee, and needed to take half a pill of allergy medication. I placed the pill inside a little chunk of sausage and rolled it around it until the pill was hidden. He gladly ate the pill thinking it was just a treat! Very useful.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Quality of ingredients. Although 'lamb lungs' are the 1st ingredient, wheat flour and sugar are the 2nd to 3rd ingredients. Not healthy at all.

review/summary: BEST DOG TREAT EVER!
review/text: I purchased this based on the reviews and it did not disappoint.  Since I have a german shepherd, I used it as a treat and not dog food which would work for smaller dogs. My dog loved it!<br /><br />I wanted to offer it as a special treat only but the large space it took up in my refrigerator made it more of a daily treat.  Offering up a thick slice almost daily made it last around 2.5 weeks.  My dog would go crazy whenever I brought it out.<br /><br />Given my dog's obvious enjoyment, I think this dog food roll is worth it.

review/text: I've been feeding my 2 maltese this food and this brand for over 5 years now.<br />They love it and so do I because its completely & nutritionally balanced with the vitamins and minerals dogs need. There's no fillers or garbage in it.<br />AND the best part is I get it cheaper thru Amazon. All I do is click order it and it comes to me 2 days later. I live in a part of South Dakota where nothing is close to me and Amazon makes it easy. Without Amazon, I'd have to drive over 200 miles round trip to get it or order it online somewhere else and pay more.Lets not forget the high cost of gas too. It's an excellent product bought thru an excellent merchant. It keeps me and the boys happy. You just won't go wrong buying thru Amazon. When you do it, your wallet stays fatter longer...and I like that part.

review/text: My Boston Terrier Toby recently had to have his teeth cleaned and wasn't feeling so well after - and he had to take pills to heal from a few extractions he also had.  I wasn't able to get him to take his pills and eat his dinner UNTIL I grated this into his bowl and used it to disguise the antibiotic pills.  This dog food roll is amazing because it's a food and a treat - and it's nice and soft so you can mold it around a pill if your dog is on meds.  Oh - and he goes crazy for this stuff - I think he totally forgot he had his teeth pulled after I started giving him this - that's how happy it made him!  Love this!

review/summary: Good Product, but cheaper at Pet Store
review/text: I use the Natural Balance Dog Food Rolls low level training treats for my dogs. They seem to like them really well and it doesn't cause the same stomach upset as some of the other treats out there. When you're doing a lot of training, this is kind of a big deal. Also, since I have large dogs, it starts to get pretty expensive going through the treats. I give this product my highest recommendation, but would advise people to just buy them from your local box pet store. This exact same Lamb Roll was only $11.99 at the pet store.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: When I bought this roll, I have to admit I was very skeptical. I have a smalandsstovare and a very finicky german shepherd, and she hates everything. I've had a very difficult time getting her to eat any dry dog food, and I've tried them all. I bought this along with our first bag of Natural Balance lamb and rice dry food, and the results have astounded me!  She ate the dry food immediately, and ate every bite, as did Tidas. An hour later, I decided to give the roll a try as a treat. The second I sliced into the roll, both dogs were pacing the kitchen. They ate it like I had just given them prime rib! I'm a new customer, and I will be a lifelong customer. The food smells good, the roll smells better than some of the summer sausage rolls I've bought at the holidays for people, and its an allergy formula. Win, win, win. If you have a fussy eater, or a dog with skin allergies, I strongly encourage you to give this a try.

We do know that after enriching our lives for the past 11 years, he has slowed down considerably with a lot of graying.  We are mixing the Natural Balance with his dry food in the morning.  If the amount of speed a dog can digest food is a measure of how much they like their food, then Natural Balance is a big hit with our Lucky.  The ingredients are excellent.  He's at an age where training is no longer a concern; we just want to pamper him in a healthy way.

review/text: I bought this for the first time a few months ago for my 7 year old pound rescue since Amazon stopped selling Chicken soup for the dog lovers soul. I am really pleased with the quality of the product, as Lamb meal is the first ingredient and it does not have corn (grain free). The crude protein is 31% and fat is 15%. My dog is 70#, and they reccomend feeding 5-6 cups/day!!!! But even within the first week I noticed she was packing on the pounds, so adjust feeding as needed for your dog. The kibble is smaller and darker than I am used to, but she seems to like it ok. I usually buy the chicken and lamb together and mix them to give a more varied diet. Overall I am pleased; you just can't find high quality foods for this great of a price these days.

review/text: My 21-lb mixed breed does best on grain free food. The transition to Hi-Tek was uneventful and he gobbles it up. After one bag, I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Outstanding kibble
review/text: I have a young adult male yellow lab that I've had for about a year (a rescue), and he gets lots of exercise through playing ball many times each day. I recently switched him over from Blue Buffalo Wilderness grain-free, which he liked a lot, to this food, which he absolutely loves (I think even more than the Blue Buffalo). I was initially attracted to this one because it's grain-free and much more reasonably priced that BB, and the rave reviews and comparable nutritional values convinced me to try it, and I'm very glad I did. Making the transition was easy--I fed a mixture of both foods for about a week, going from mostly BB to mostly Hi-Tek, and he had no digestive issues whatsoever in making the change. His stools are a bit darker than before, but also more well-formed, so cleanup is very easy. And most importantly, he's truly thriving with this food--has tons of energy, excellent muscle tone, and beautiful coat condition. The fact that it's also much more affordable is a great bonus, too. In short, I would recommend this food unconditionally.

review/summary: High-quality, good value!
review/text: I switched to this food from Go! Endurance after they stopped selling that food on Prime. This stuff is cheaper (slightly, since they raised the price, but it's still a bigger bag) and my medium-sized medium-active dog does great on it. Not too fatty like Taste of the Wild or Blue Buffalo Wilderness, so digestion is great. Solid all-around.

review/summary: Good value.  My 3 German shepherds LOVE it.
review/text: I have been feeding my three German shepherd dogs raw meat for the past four years.  My dogs are healthy and fit because they run at least five miles a day and also go swimming fairly often.<br /><br />It's a bit of a hassle feeding raw, getting the balance right, having to keep a "dog meat" freezer, etc.  Also, I'm beginning to wonder how safe it is to feed them the meat of animals that have been injected with antibiotics, hormones, etc.  So I was motivated to change their diet.  You might imagine that it would be difficult to get dogs who are accustomed to eating raw meat to change to dry food, but there was no hesitation in my shepherds' acceptance of this food.  (I add water to the kibble so that they don't inhale the pieces.)<br /><br />My dogs are each about 95-97 pounds (and they aren't one bit fat!), which means they need to be fed about 3.5 cups of this dry food a day.  I have been buying the 30-pound bags.  To find out how far a bag would stretch, I measured out 3.5 cups of the food and weighed it.  It came to 0.914 pounds for 3.5 cups.  So a 30-pound bag will last for about 32 meals.  I will need to buy three 30-pound bags a month, which turns out to be not a bad price, to feed three 96-pound German shepherd dogs for a month.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the list of ingredients on the bag, as well, so I'm not as concerned about my dogs getting all the nutrients they need to be optimally healthy as I was when they were eating solely raw meat.<br /><br />Hope this review has been helpful.

review/summary: Great for dogs with food sensitivity!
review/text: One of my dogs can't eat any grains or rice.  I've tried lots of grain free dog food and this one compares to the others well.  what I like best if the price (since I feed this to all four of my dogs), which is less than other brands (especially when I don't pay taxes or use gas when I buy on Amazon!)

review/summary: Great Dog Food, No Empty Bread Filling!
review/text: As soon as I read that this was actual lamb meal and had no grain? I had to try it, I can say Im really glad i did.<br /><br />The bag is big and lasts a long time, dog loves it, her coat has become shiny and I feel good knowing im giving her actual ground up lamb particles, bone, etc. and NO BREAD!<br /><br />Its actually chicken beef and pork meal in there too, and ofcourse the sweet potato.<br /><br />Overall I recommend getting this lamb hitek food and "Solid Gold Seameal Mineral and Vitamin Supplement for Horses, Dogs, and Cats" its a powder vitamin that you mix with water and pour over the dog food. This is agreat combination to boost the dogs immune system, the food and vitamins together! My dogs coat has never ever been shinier the thing has sheen! also its appetizing to the dog.
