review/summary: VERY Strong... but feels good on sore throat
review/text: I looked at the other reviews for this drink, noticed that many said the ginger was way strong. I thought "Well, I really like ginger, so it'll be ok." But, really, it's STRONG. Mixing with the instructed 240ml (1 cup) of water leaves a very gingery drink. However, diluting it with about another half-cup of water brought the ginger down to a nice level. At this point it was just SWEET, like ginger tea with 2 packets of Splenda. Way too sweet for me.<br />The lemon is of course overpowered by the ginger. This wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I really did like was drinking it with a sore throat. Swollen, aching throat loves ginger, lemon, and hot beverages in general. The Gold Kili drink felt quite nice on my throat and I didn't mind the sweetness or strength of the ginger as much as I probably would normally.<br />Also, it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor. By the time I was almost finished it didn't seem nearly as strong.<br /><br />Coming upon a packet of this, I wouldn't turn it down, but I probably wouldn't buy it. I'd much rather just get tea, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea</a>, and sweeten it with honey myself.

review/summary: One packet might be better off making TWO cups
review/text: When I opened the pouch, I sniffed the contents and found the aroma to be intensely complex and inviting! I tried a little pinch of it raw -- and it excited my taste buds -- very enjoyable. I even think that the contents would be spectacular if sprinked over vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream -- this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix is VERY gingery and sweet --- and with a nice lemon tang.<br /><br />So I dumped the remaining contents of the pouch into a cup and added hot water -- It steamed up very nicely, mixed VERY well and the first few sips were intense, delicious, just great. But THEN this mixture started burning my throat so intensely that I had to cut it with Soy Milk to turn off the overpowering heat -- turning the remainder of the contents into a refreshing, sweet, but mild experience.<br /><br />Now some people might LIKE all that extra heat-- I couldn't handle it. For those who like the Ginger/Lemon experience but are not fans of spicy hot-ness, then perhaps divvying up the contents of one pouch into TWO cups of tea would be a better way to enjoy this intense experience.

review/text: This was a pretty good drink however I barely taste lemon.  Ginger is strong and it is very strong in this drink so it is not suprising that the lemon is overpowered.  If you really like ginger I would recommend this product.  I like ginger but I was expecting a nice lemon/ginger mix.  It is not bad but I would not purchase.

review/summary: Strong Drink...
review/text: This instant ginger lemon drink by Gold Kili is meant to be served warm to hot.  The taste presents initially as lemony, with a strong gingerly aftertaste.  Those familiar with similiar hot drinks served in the Far East are likely to find it appealing.  For those not familiar with the taste, it is a little like hot spiced cider.  The concentration can be diluted to reduce the ginger aftertaste if desired. It is recommended as a no-caffiene hot drink alternative to coffee or tea.

review/summary: Excellent home remedy, not a beverage
review/text: Some other reviewers seem to have expected a pleasant drink, or a tea. I think this product is intended more for people who drink ginger infusions for their sinus-clearing, throat-cleansing effects. I realize the manufacturer cannot sell it as a remedy, but if you drink ginger and honey anyway, this product is a decent substitute that is much more convenient than finding fresh ginger then simmering it yourself.<br /><br />For years I have relied on ginger infusions when I get mild coughs or stuffiness in the winter. It cures the symptoms and I believe (without any formal evidence) that it stops things from progressing into a cold. Anyway, it's comforting. Unfortunately, it's tricky. Finding fresh ginger is not easy and you must infuse it precisely. It must be sliced very thinly (grating is not as good) and put into water just below the boiling point. If the water is too cool, you don't get the most important volatiles. If the water boils, or if you leave it simmering too long, the good stuff denatures or evaporates. When it's just right it has a very strong flavor and aroma, which I find pleasant but is quite pungent, and it leaves your mouth and throat tingling. A small amount of honey seems to enhance the effects.<br /><br />This packet appears to have the right mix of fresh ginger and honey, treated in some manner to preserve potency in its foil packet. Shockingly, however, there is no ingredient labeling (only the claim that it contains no caffine). The Amazon page shows only ginger, honey and "natural lemon flavor"; but then warns you not to rely on that information. So anyone with allergies has to steer clear of this product until the manufacturer puts the ingredients on the package. However, I chose to live dangerously and drink it anyway, and had no problems. Like the real thing, you should use extremely hot but not quite boiling water, and drink it immediately after mixing (yes, that's hard to do without burning your tongue, but if you wait for it to cool, you lose a lot of the effect). The package recommends 250 ml (about one cup) of water, I think that makes the drink too weak and also it's hard to get that much hot liquid down quickly. I suggest about two-thirds of that amount.<br /><br />I don't know if this product will keep you healthy, but my guess is it can make you feel better and it likely doesn't hurt. Other ginger/honey beverages I have tried are usually far too sweet and lack the punch from plenty of real, fresh ginger.

review/summary: Good flavor, settles the stomach
review/text: I really like the taste of this instant ginger beverage, which I've been drinking hot, like a tea. A little of the powder goes a long way, because the flavor is strong. It's good as an everyday drink, and for me, it also worked to settle my stomach when I had a stomach ache. I'm going to try ginger as an alternative to over-the-counter motion sickness meds next time I go on a cruise - MythBusters showed that it works, and it doesn't have any side effects - ginger doesn't make me sleepy.

review/summary: Year of the Dragon Beverage
review/text: The sample packet I received of the ginger/lemon/honey granules had very simple instructions on it (in 3 languages) which simply said to pour the packet contents into a cup, add boiling water, and stir.<br /><br />It didn't specify how big a cup, but knowing the power of ginger I pulled out a 16 ounce megacup just in case 12 ounces of water wasn't enough to dilute it to a tolerable state.<br /><br />Good thing I did, as I kept adding more boiled water, stirring, and tasting, until the megacup was within a half inch of the top. Still the liquid was a deep color resembling strong black tea with honey and lemon added (rendering a cloudy look.)<br /><br />The ginger was frankly harsh, no matter that I diluted it beyond normal cup size, nor how much I let it cool. Certainly it was sweet enough, and the lemon flavor was detectable.<br /><br />However, after swallowing just a couple of ounces my mouth and entire esophagus developed a burning sensation that didn't subside for more than half an hour. That's when the irony occurred to me that we're in the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese calendar, and I felt that I had just breathed fire.<br /><br />Now, I happen to like most commercial lemon/ginger teas, especially the one from Bigelow, with the Probiotics. I add my own honey - just a teaspoonful, and my husband and I enjoy a cup often before bedtime for a good night's sleep. I was hoping this product would be equally as enjoyable as the Bigelow and without the mess of the honeypot, but apparently not. If you thrill to the burn of strong ginger root down your throat, then this product may be for you.

review/summary: Ginger Drink with Bite
review/text: There is no question that Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from ginger. The smell and taste is strong. I would suggest you start off light and continue too add the mix until you reach the strength of flavor you desire. I could not imagine how strong a bite this drink would have if not cut with honey. I do agree that with the advertisement that this is a strong ginger drink with a unique taste. My first sip shocked my taste buds that I almost did not continue to drink any. I did continue too and as I started too adjust to the flavor. The drink was not bad and it still had the ginger bite I wanted but this is not a blend I would seek out. I would drink but never buy it. Though flavorful; I did not find the experience enjoyable. The crystals do instantly dissolve to make this spicy beverage. And with the taste...I hope it is good for you.

review/summary: very intense
review/text: I love the taste of ginger - in foods, soda, dried and jam. The thought of a refreshing and relaxing ginger drink aroused my interest. My single sample arrived in a huge box. The "green" in me cringed; first warning. Then the packet had only the instruction of "mixing with 250 ml of water". Second warning.  How long should I steep it? no idea. When the drink was, what I thought was ready,i.e. mixed with the correct amount of hot water, I tried it - wow, the ginger taste was intense! I added 1/2 again the amount of water and reheated it. This was better, but still very powerful. I went back to the packaging to see the make-up of the product -no information was provided; a description of some of the ingredients does come on the full supply box but I did not have that to see. (I went back to the listing for this fact). Strike three. Then I checked the caloric content - still no details. Maybe that is on the box, but that was nowhere to my knowledge. The fourth and fatal blow. I cannot recommend this product as it tastes too strong, has no indication of specifically what it is made of and no caloric details. Too bad, the concept was good.

review/summary: Definitely a unique taste
review/text: After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to use only half a packet when adding hot water, as I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the strong ginger taste.  However, I noticed that when I only used half a packet, it tasted too sweet, so I added the rest of it - and that's when I could really taste the ginger.  You would definitely keep feeling the ginger taste in your mouth after you stop drinking.  For me though, it wasn't so much the ginger as it was the drink just being too much on the sweeter side for me (I rarely add anything sweet to tea). I probably would try another product by this manufacturer, but I don't think I would try this particular drink again.

review/summary: ALL CAPS Ginger!
review/text: The little silver pouches are a ginger lover's dream. Whether served hot (as I drink it) or cold, the crystals dissolve instantly, emitting only a slight hint at what lies in store at the first sip. The ginger will strike the back of your throat and make itself known, overwhelming any hint of lemon in the drink. The strength of ginger is not something that most people are ambivalent about, you either enjoy it or not. If this is to your taste you will like this tea as you long as you adjust the relative strength by adding more or less water to the mix.

review/summary: YUM... but VERY gingery
review/text: I found this ginger/lemon/honey drink to be refreshing and delicious.... but with 2 caveats:<br /><br />1.  I love ginger... the gingery-er the better.  I like fresh ginger, pickled ginger, crystallized ginger, ginger candy, ginger beer... you get the idea.  And I mix grated ginger with lemon & honey (and vinegar & cayenne) when I have a cough.  So I thought I'd love this drink... and I was right.  But be aware, the ginger is very strong.  You have to be a gingerphile.<br /><br />2.  I drank it cold.  The directions say to mix it with hot water, like a tea, but personally I like my hot drinks to be sweet (like a latte) and my cold drinks to be refreshing... so I made this with cold water & ice cubes.  It was great!  As a tea I can see it being quite soothing if you have a cold or nausea (ginger is a natural antihistamine in addition to being an anti-nauseant).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  If you love ginger, you should love this.... enjoy it hot or cold.

review/summary: Lacking Information, Lacking Taste
review/text: I received one packet as a sample and followed the directions. All you have to do is pour hot water over the contents and serve. I split it with my daughter to get her input on flavor,and neither of liked the flavor at all. We both love ginger and lemon, and can even handle strong tea brewed from fresh ginger. It had a strange medicinal flavor, and was sweetened somehow, but the package had no ingredient list and no other information whatsoever. The lack of information with the sample had me considering tossing it into the trash since I always like to know exactly what I'm using. Without information, I decided to base my rating on taste alone. The lemon was mild, and I assume the sweetener was honey. It wasn't too sweet, nor was the ginger too strong, but that outstanding medicine/fake taste was overwhelming. It did dissolve easily, and it's nice not to have a tea bag to deal with, but not worth it when it tastes so bad. If you like ginger for its health benefits, take a piece of fresh ginger, cut it into a few pieces, and boil in a pan to desired taste. Add lemon and honey also to taste and you're set.

review/summary: Spiced drink, sugary flavor messes the balance
review/text: This drink has a very distinct taste of ginger as advertised, along with subterranean hints of lemon that are overpowered by ginger. What messes up the balance flavorwise is the sugary flavor.<br /><br />The serving suggestion for a hot drink is one pouch with 250ml of hot water. (250ml of water is just under 8.5 oz).<br /><br />This is a rich drink (compared to tea), so if you prefer something more lightweight, you can use one pouch to make two cups instead of one.<br /><br />Since the nutritionists say ginger is good for you, it raises its rating. As just a drink, it is closer to 3.5 stars.

review/text: I was interested in this product because I've enjoyed the health benefits of lemon and ginger in other beverages. The first thing I noted was that when you mix the product with hot water, according to the package directions, the powder does not completely dissolve. Secondly, the product was overly sweet for me. The sample I received to review was the actual packet so I don't know what information is given on the box the packets come in. However, the packet gives no information on the ingredients other than lemon and ginger. The listing states that honey is used as a sweetener. There's no other apparent information as to any other possible ingredients, though. Disappointedly, this product didn't even make it to first base for me.

review/summary: Far too spicy
review/text: I was anxious to try this item because I hoped the ginger would help quell my morning sickness.  The packet directions stated to mix the entire package with 250ml of water, or approximately 8.45 oz.  I used hot water and mixed up the drink.  I was a little nervous to try it, as it looked like muddy river water. The first sip wasn't so bad.  The lemon taste was nice, and not artificial tasting.  The ginger taste was ok at first, but left a "hot" after taste in my mouth.  The drink was very strong, so I poured the drink back into the water bottle that I had gotten the water out of, to "water it down" so that it wouldn't be so strong.  That improved it slightly, but the after taste of the ginger was still too hot for my taste.  Finally, I decided to put the bottle into the fridge to see if I would like it better cold.  Two hours later I pulled it out and shook it up (It still looked like river water to me)  and took a drink.  This time, the lemon flavor, which had been pleasant before, was completely overpowered by the ginger taste, which seemed to be even more "hot" and lasting than before.<br /><br />Needless to say, I did not finish the bottle, and I have no intention of buying more of this.  I felt that the lemon flavor was nice, and perhaps a "plain" lemon drink would be fine, but the ginger in this beverage was far to spicy for my taste.  I have no idea if this beverage would be beneficial for those suffering with nausea, because I was unable to finish one package.  In my opinion, it would only aggreavate the stomach of someone who is already feeling ill.

review/summary: More ginger than lemon and slightly sweet
review/text: This instant ginger lemon drink has a very strong ginger component with with a lighter lemon flavor.  It is a sweet drink, though not quite as sweet as many sodas.<br /><br />I prepared the powdered drink as directed with 250ml (1 cup) of hot water.  The granules in the packet dissolved quickly and the resulting beverage is actually a tannish brown color.<br /><br />I am just getting over a sore throat and I can see how a hot drink like this might be soothing and clear our my nose when I have a cold.  I certainly felt the ginger making a spicy burning sensation in the back of my throat.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get this drink again, but it's not bad, either.  Those who are big fans of very strong and spicy ginger flavor would probably like it.<br /><br />Usually I'd probably prefer something like a ginger ale, or if I have a cold, hot tea or broth.<br /><br />One funny aspect about receiving this drink was that Amazon shipped me my packet of ginger drink in a giant box something like 20"x16"x8" (with air padding packs).  This is for a small packet of drink that could easily fit in a padded envelope.  I'm not sure if this was because they were out of smaller packing or if they thought I needed a large box for returning something.  It was pretty comical when I opened a huge box and saw the small packet of drink mix in the middle.

review/text: I suppose this drink isn't tea. It just says that it is a beverage so I am assuming that the tea aspect is not going to be the major factor in the drinking of this. Still it tastes like lemon tea so I am going to review it from the fact that it is a hot drink that is suited for making you relax and think about your life or something.<br /><br />Still, I am not the biggest fan of ginger in the world. For someone who does not like ginger, this drink is too reminiscent of the "cinnamon gum" I used to attempt to chew as a kid. It's too sharp to be tasty and I am drinking it thinking "why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?" only to realize that I had made it in the first place. It tastes like lemon tea that got a very sharp and spicy kick that doesn't entirely please me.<br /><br />I think if I had time to drink many cups, I would learn to love it. I didn't like coffee when I first had it either. Still I am uncertain that I can fully recommend it since it is too ginger and too lemon and it doesn't feel right.

If you like Gold-kilis other products, or if you like very strong ginger flavored drinks, this is for you.  If not, you may wish to try another product.

review/text: I sampled Kali Ginger and Lemon drink mix on a cold wintry day when my throat was a bit inflamed and sore.  I drank it hot as directed on the foil pouch.  To be honest, the first few sips burned quite a bit as they went down due to the ginger, but as I continued to drink, the lemon and honey flavors came to the fore.  After finishing the whole cup, my throat felt a little bit better, and I realized that overall, I had liked the beverage.<br /><br />That said, the big question is: did I like it well enough to order more?  And my honest answer is: probably not.  Gold Kali Ginger & Lemon is one of those products that I might enjoy on a rare occasion, but not one that I'm tempted to stock up on and make part of my regular diet.  There will definitely be a group of consumers that this spicy drink will appeal to, and to them, I heartily recommend it.  But as for me, a man who enjoys more traditional warm and cold beverages, let's just say that it really isn't my cup of tea.

I drank it warm, and it was a nice and soothing beverage on a cold day. I use ginger a lot for its anti-nausea effects, and I could see trying this to help combat motion sickness. That said, even watered down slightly, the kick was still a lot for me and it was rather hard to drink the entire cup in one sitting.

review/summary: Hot And Spicy
review/text: This tea is very hot and spicy.  The directions say to pour the contents of a pouch into a cup of hot water.  This was way too strong for me, and I had to add another cup of water into it in order to drink it.  I was hoping that the lemon would be the dominant flavor with just a hint of ginger, but it is actually the opposite.  If you enjoy ginger or teas that are hot and spicy, you may enjoy this.  For me, it was way too much ginger.

review/text: It's very easy to prepare.  Just pour the powder into a cup and add hot water.  The ginger taste is very strong and spicy.  There is minimal lemon flavor.  For my own taste, I had to add more water to dilute the brew to make it less strong.

review/summary: Horribly spicy/hot, overpowering ginger taste with no lemon, followed directions exactly
review/text: I was happy to try this tea out, hoping it would help with my occasional morning sickness.  I've had success with lemon tea or with ginger cookies in the past, so had high hopes.  But, I can't stomach this tea when well, and there is no way I could manage it if nauseated!<br /><br />First of all,  I followed package directions as to the amount of water to add, so it was as strong as it was supposed to be.  I tasted no lemon, nothing but ginger, lots and lots of ginger.  It was very spicy hot.  Enough that it burned my mouth for a minute or two after taking one sip.  Same thing with the next sip.<br /><br />Do not buy this tea unless you have drunk STRONG ginger tea before and know that you like it.  And expect this tea to be very spicy hot.  And don't expect any lemon flavor.  Personally, I thought it was absolutely horrible.

review/summary: Tastes like the "real" thing
review/text: A while ago, a Chinese friend made me ginger tea using slices of ginger root and honey. She raved about the medicinal powers of ginger, and I enjoyed it, but I knew I would never take the time to replicate it myself. So I was interested to try Gold Kili's instant ginger & lemon drink to see how it measured up to authentic Chinese ginger tea. Amazingly, it tasted exactly like the tea my friend made for me!<br /><br />It's pretty strong, but that can easily be regulated by adding more than the recommended 250 ml (approximately 1 cup) of water. I couldn't taste any lemon at all, and since I only got one packet without any ingredient or nutritional information, I don't know if there's really any lemon in it.<br /><br />The ginger "kick" is pretty strong, and the tea tasted medicinal, so probably the only time I would use it would be for a sore throat. Still, I'd recommend this product to anyone who enjoys ginger tea--this is certainly easier than making it from scratch, and you get the same result!

review/summary: A Hot Drink With Some Bite To It
review/text: The Amazon Vine program only provided one small packet for reviewers to sample.  That's a shame.  I would have liked to indulge in more hot cups of this delightful beverage.  Being a tea drinker, it was refreshing to sip something a bit more potent.  The intense ginger flavor might not appeal to everyone.  I compare its taste to Chimes, a delicious ginger candy.  Unfortunately the small packet did not relay any nutritional facts, and none were posted on Gold Kili's own website (for this particular product).  That's an important issue as I'm a carb counter who shuns sugary products.  Based on Gold Kili's other ginger drink products, I can only assume this one is similar--Carbs/17g and Sugar/16g.  Perhaps Gold Kili might consider making a sugar-free version?  I loved its  gingery sweet flavor and warm sensation.

review/summary: For true ginger lovers
review/text: The ginger in this drink is almost overwhelming. It is so strong that when I would go to take a sip, I would almost choke before I even had the drink in my mouth from the fumes of it.  Then, after swallowing, my tongue and throat were still burning. The ginger tastes like actual ginger root, not artificial. Under the very strong ginger taste, you can taste a little bit of lemon and the drink is sweet.  I can't say that I would buy this drink in the future, but if you really like the taste of ginger, you won't be disappointed in this drink.  It was easy to prepare and dissolved nicely in hot or cold water.  The ginger taste was much stronger when the drink was hot.

review/text: I love ginger, so I was looking forwards to giving this a try. If you like ginger, you'll like it. It has a strong ginger flavor and some of that good old ginger "bite." I've read some reviews where people says it's bitter. I certainly did not find this to be the case, but taste is a pretty subjective thing.<br /><br />I do feel like it's overly sweet for my taste. I'd like less sugar, but I can understand why they add so much when even with as much as they add there are still complaints of it being bitter to some people. You can't please everyone. Still, I enjoyed it and would get it again.

review/summary: Overpowering ginger
review/text: The instructions on the packet say to pour hot water over the drink mix but it doesn't mention the amount. I used a typical coffee mug size cup full of hot water and poured it over the mix in a separate cup. The ginger odor is highly evident the minute you open the packet. The mix dissolves immediately as soon as the water hits it. The drink itself was way too powerful for me to drink. The ginger was overpowering and it burned my throat. I think the drink might be better with less mix but as the instructions were rather vague, I wasn't sure how to use it. Like many of the other reviewers, I did not detect the lemon flavor.

review/text: Wow! As soon as I poured some hot water over this instant drink mix, the smell of ginger was very noticeable. I thought the aroma was very pleasant and enjoyable. As for taste, you don't notice the lemon, but the ginger is very strong and packs a very strong spicy bite! If you love ginger, you will enjoy this drink, but if you dislike the taste of even a ginger snap cookie, steer clear.<br /><br />Although I liked this drink, I was disappointed with the nutritional information. Although it's all natural, 1 sachet equals 73 calories and contains 16 grams of sugar! That's a lot for a cup of tea! I'll stick with either Tazo Green Ginger Tea or The Mate Factor's Yerba Mate lemon ginger. You still get that ginger flavor without the added calories and sugar!

review/text: I would totally drink this if I were sick.  It has that natural medicine taste, almost reminding me of lemon Theraflu. I'm not sure if that's an insult to this product, or a compliment to Theraflu.  It has a strong ginger flavor with an under-taste of lemon.<br /><br />The instructions are in English, French, and Spanish.  Note, 250ml is equivalent to 1 cup of water - all the instructions are in metric.  The drink is just mixed  with hot water, not unlike instant coffee.<br /><br />I received this sample from the Amazon Vine program.  The sample did not come with ingredients, or any marketing information.<br /><br />I would be more likely to drink this product if it were marketed as a health drink.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't drink it for pleasure.

review/summary: Strong Ginger But It Works
review/text: If you don't like ginger then don't pick up a ginger drink, but if you like ginger then I do suggest Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage. It has a very intense ginger taste to it, much stronger ginger flavor then I was expecting and a very very mellow lemon flavor that is so mellow because the ginger just takes everything over.<br /><br />The smell of the drink when you first open the package it ginger overload, to me smelled like a gingerbread cookie with some lemon on top. Getting your drink just right is very easy, just open and pour your contents into a cup and add your choice of water and stir. Easy as 1 2 3 and your done. No need to sweeten your drink as it is already sweet with honey already inside.<br /><br />Can be served two different ways: hot & cold but I have to say I would prefer the hot way as it is very soothing to drink. Ginger is a wonderful way to settle your upset stomach and the fact that this drink mix is caffeine free is another bonus for that means I can drink it at any time and not have to worry about it keeping me up at night.<br /><br />If you like ginger check it out, for as a fan of ginger drinks/teas I have to say this has to be one of the better ones that I have tried.

I gave this a try, not thinking about it having healing effects, but I did find it very soothing.  It soothed my sore throat and calmed my stomach.  It isn't advertised as a healing product, but I think it did make me feel better.  It is also very easy to make (just add hot water), and it tastes good.  I'm definitely going to try it again and I'd recommend it if it's cold outside, you aren't feeling 100% and you want to curl up in front of the fireplace with a good book, or any other time you just want a drink that tastes good.

review/summary: intense ginger flavor
review/text: A single pouch of this tea makes a small very strong cup of ginger flavored tea. The small grains dissolved instantly. I could not taste any lemon flavor and very little if any honey flavor. The Ginger was almost medicinally strong and somewhat bitter, though it did not sting the throat like fresh ginger does at this intensity, nor did it clear the sinus. I think this is too strongly flavored to accompany most food, though it might go well with some cookies or possibly cheese. I do not know if it would be effective for motion sickness or other nausea and so far as I can tell this is being marketed as a beverage. It is not particularly sweet but also has none of the tartness one expects from lemon. The strength reminded me of  a very strong ginger ale without the fizz.  I can see that this might be convenient to take on the road  but for day to day use I think I will stick with making my own ginger, lemon and Honey drinks with fresh ingredients.

It made everything taste like medicine. My wife refused to drink it at all, so repelled was she by the chemical odor. Although I generally like a lemon flavor, and use ginger in cooking, this combination as presented by Gold Kili is not meant for human consumption.

review/summary: Whoa!  Too strong for me!
review/text: I enjoy tea.  I enjoy ginger-- ginger bread, ginger cookies, ginger in certain food recipes.  I've heard it has alot of nutritional benefits.  So I thought I'd give this tea a try.  The instructions say to mix it with 250 mL of hot water.  I followed the instructions exactly.  Took a sip.  WHOA!!!!  Really, really strong!  I waited it to cool a bit, thinking maybe the hot temperature was affecting my opinion.  When it was warm (not cold), I tried again.  Still too much.  So I added water.  Still too strong.  Added more water.  Nope.  It got to the point that I just gave up.  I didn't like the flavor, and I didn't like the intensity. I'm sure there are those who are experienced ginger tea drinkers who might like this, but I won't be joining them.

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: Ginger, honey and lemon are all good for you and taste good... just not so much together.<br /><br />To drink you pour the individual package into a cup and fill with appx 8.5 ounces (250 ml). The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the amazingly strong ginger fragrance - it was so strong it was off-putting. I got my first whiff of lemon once I added the water. After stirring it up the fragrance mellowed a bit.<br /><br />The first sip was reminiscent of when I was on a juicing fast (fruits and veggies only) when I used Ginger in a drink recipe that I read online. It was strong and had a terrible after taste. This was exactly that. At first you can taste the lemon, and then you get the spicy kick all the way down your throat. I tried a few more sips to see if I could acclimate my taste buds but I just couldn't hack this. I'm just not good with ginger in my drinks.<br /><br />If you want something spicy (and especially ginger) and you enjoy flavors from the Far East you may enjoy this drink. It's natural and the ingredients are good for you. It just wasn't for me.

review/summary: Warming Beverage
review/text: I received one packet of this instant beverage for review.  That package did not reveal much about the contents--for example, I suspect there is some sugar in the beverage, but there was no ingredients list.  The packet shows ginger and lemon and says to add 250 ml (about 1 cup) of water, stir and consume.<br /><br />I used water that was the temperature I use for green tea--about 170 degrees Fahrenheit.  Immediately, I noted a lovely floral scent wafting from the cup.  The water dissolved the tan granules quickly and turned a muddy yellow-brown color.<br /><br />Sipping the beverage, I noted the warm ginger notes, that lovely spicy burn on my tongue.  I love ginger, obviously.  I only get a hint of lemon from this beverage.  The drink is slightly sweet.  I added no other sweetener and didn't need to.  It was lovely on its own.  I don't think ginger is this sweet on its own, so I suspect there is a small amount of sugar here.<br /><br />I would say this would be something nice to have when you are feeling ill with cold or flu.  Ginger has antiseptic and mild stimulent properties.  I wouldn't drink it before bed, for that reason--but I'm a sensitive individual when it comes to stimulents.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice instant beverage that is warming and soothing.

review/summary: Okay, But a Little Overwhelming
review/text: I wasn't for sure what a warm ginger flavored product would be like, but I wanted something with lemon for fighting Spring allergy symptoms.  Often during the Spring I get sore throat & congestion issues - the best remedy is warm liquids.  Since high caffeine drinks like tea & coffee are not ideal for nighttime, then I've explored many lemon based drinks like this to use.  I can say among those I've tried this is not as lemony as many of the others and the ginger taste is a little overwhelming.  I like ginger ale and eat ginger flavored items, but as a drink this was a little much.  If I was sick, this might help but the taste would make me not want to finish a whole serving.  So all and all, make sure you are a fan of the spiciness of ginger - this is key for knowing whether Gold Kill's Ginger & Lemon Beverage is right for you.

review/summary: Not For Me, thank you!
review/text: First, being the age that I am, I certainly do remember my father making ginger "tea" and putting lemon in it with sugar (actually, he used molasses) and drinking it warm. As a child I thought this simply weird and dreadful!<br /><br />Later, with maturity, etc., I came to like this as a warm beverage on cold rainy wintery type days, etc. I use my dad's "molasses" frequently in many things because of its nutritional properties, and sometimes I use honey, but seldom refined sugars.<br /><br />I ordered this product from Vine to try out, and was surprised when only one packet arrived in a very large box, making me think I was getting a decent sized trial sampling. Of little consequence, however, as after some really heavy searching and investigating online, I finally found the list of ingredients. This list is posted below for your inspection and consideration.<br /><br />My father had it right, and nutritionally better, also. I found this to be very intensely sweet as I use very little sweetener of any kind anyway, so that was my first impression...too sticky sweet. Further tasting in my tongue, pallet, and upper throat found the gingery flavor "not quite right" like it was old or off somehow. Again, probably not too surprising as this is a powdered mix and flavor and texture loss are to be expected I would guess.<br /><br />After reading the ingredients with my searching I naturally made the immediate decision to stick with my dad's "old way" and feeling really good about it.<br /><br />I would urge you to make up your own at home like I do vs this excessively sugary and flat tasting concoction imported from Singapore. It just seems so crazy to go this route when you can be drinking something made fresh, and with better ingredients, yourself!<br /><br />The information from their website (after I was able to find them) are:<br /><br />[Instant Ginger Lemon Drink<br />Code: 1935 (10 sachets per box)<br /><br />Ingredients: Ginger, Glucose, Sucrose, Honey, Fructose and Natural Lemon Flavour<br /><br />Instant Ginger Lemon Drink is made from top grade fresh ginger, honey and lemon. Modern and hygienic manufacturing techniques are used to preserve the natural taste, goodness and fragrance. It is an ideal drink for everyone whether taken hot or cold, in any occassion and season.]

review/summary: One Mighty Powerful Ginger Punch
review/text: First, the packaging.  What exactly is a "gold kili."  I was hoping it would be some kind of mythical Asian flower or something interesting, but no.  My quick look-see around the Interweb revealed only that it's the name of this Singapore-based ongoing business concern, involved with Tasty� Singapore, which is an initiative of the government-sponsored International Enterprise Singapore, an effort to promote Singaporean food businesses worldwide (which has a very colorful and very loud website).  And Tasty has got a nice, smiley kind of logo, too (see image).<br /><br />If the good folks at Gold Kili want this and their other products to take off in the US, they really need to work on their packaging.  The copy on the envelope is not very good, a bit awkward, coming off as having been developed by someone whose first language is not English (like Singapore Chinese).  The instructions open with "For hot serving..."  Well, I figure that has to do with heated water, but the 8th grader in me also instantly recognized a distinct yet seriously divergent possible type of serving method.  But I digress.  Knowing most Americans, the preparation text needs to be much more clear, with very concrete instructions, like starting with, "Pour contents into a cup..."  Second, the only measure of how much water to use is in metric.  I'm down with the metric, yo, but most Americans are most definitely not, so you've got to actually tell them to put 8 � ounces into their coffee mug.<br /><br />Note that 8.5 ounces really isn't that much.  It's more or less a standard coffee cup, but in bigger-is-better America, that's only half a mug.  I recommend Gold Kili up-size their portions for the US market.<br /><br />Man, that ginger scent--strong--comes barreling right out right away when you open the envelope, and then when you stir it up, a very distinctive aroma.  The scent is quite good, a very nice alternative to coffee; brewing up a lot of this would be a very nice aroma throughout the house.  And so how did it taste?  Well, it was sweeter than I expected, which was a relief.  That unmistakable ginger taste is really strong, that pungent, stinging taste, spicy and quite insistent.  If you've had Asian ginger candy and can take it and like it, this product will work for you.  I do think that most Americans will not take to this, as it is a most definitely foreign and highly specialized ethnic taste, something they've only gotten the slightest hint of at their local bland Zap Wok restaurant.  The lemon flavor is there, albeit rather subtle.  You get the lemon mostly in the aftertaste.  You do get a very distinct and lingering ginger aftertaste of the drink, and that unmistakable low-level burn of ginger at the back of your throat.  It stays with you for some time, even after drinking or eating something else.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty good hot, but is NOT good cold.  For testing purposes, I added nothing to the drink, no sugar, nothing additional; I think doing so would ruin it.<br /><br />My experience with the drink's color was not what you see on the package, which appears to be a kind of semi-clear green tea.  It is very unclear if this is in fact some kind of tea.  All the envelope tells you is that it's ginger lemon drink, and that's all.  There's no more info on the packaging.  The actual color is a kind of ruddy brown, much like a tea.<br /><br />And hey, in the grandest tradition of Indians, Chinese and Malays (and generations of colonial descendants) living so peaceably together in lovely, sterile, boring yet successful Singapore, this product is in fact halal.  Yay.  There are no kosher markings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've spent time in Asia, and are up for something more than the ubiquitous, overpriced fare at Starbucks, this one will work for you as a morning drink.  For those not used to full-on ginger, this make take some adjustment.  The ginger taste is powerful, so is a good pick-up, although this product is caffeine-free.  It'll be a welcome product for Asians and those used to strong ginger products, but will take some getting used to for most Westerners.

review/summary: Ever want to drink a ginger root? Here's your chance.
review/text: Ginger isn't the kind of thing that I eat regularly, or in big doses when I do, but I like the flavor. After one sip of this drink mixture though, I think I'm good for the rest of the year. The thing is, I knew I was in for trouble as soon as I opened the packet and saw just how much power came out of it. You'd think that one packet is meant for an entire gallon and not just a little over one cup.<br /><br />Making the drink is simple- add the packet's contents to a cup, add hot water and drink it when you're ready. The smell is great, and I couldn't wait to try it out. Good god is the flavor bold. I only suggest buying this drink if you REALLY love ginger. I mean...if you go crazy like Taz when someone even mutters the word, then you will probably like this stuff. I could barely detect any hint of lemon, the other flavor featured, because the ginger sucker punches you in the mouth relentlessly. Take a big ginger root, blend it, and that's how this tastes.<br /><br />Even now, 5 hours after trying it out, I can still taste it. And this is after having eaten dinner and lots of water and milk. 'definitely won't be giving this another shot.

review/summary: Very good, but not for everyone
review/text: This is a very tasty and spicy beverage, which may not be your cup of tea, so to speak. The smell of ginger is strong when opening the pouch and the taste is rather strong and piquant. For many people not used to a strong ginger flavor, this may be off-putting and even unpleasant. If your idea of ginger stops at Canada Dry ginger ale, you will probably not like this product. I grew up with ginger in my foods, so I love this! The closest thing I can compare this to is Indonesian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VZP6Y">Ting Ting Jehe Chewy Ginger Candy</a>. This is basically a liquid version of the candy. Very sweet and spicy, it tickles the throat going down. I've juiced fresh ginger root (with other ingredients) and this tastes like the ginger-infused juice I've made. The pungency is not diminished during manufacturing.<br /><br />Served hot, it is perfect when you're sick. I often make ginger tea with honey when I'm under the weather, and this is a more convenient way of having a tasty hot beverage. Ginger and honey both have been used for thousands of years throughout the world for their health and medicinal benefits. The lemon flavor I couldn't detect however.

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: I only had one packet to test of this product and I put it into a 8oz. glass of hot water. It is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon. The ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down. Perhaps, it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea, or only used a bit of the packet in the water because, the ginger is very overwhelming. I was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger. This probably is good to settle the stomach, IF you can stomach the flavor....so this won't be a product that I'd use again.

review/summary: Odd aftertaste is the deal-breaker
review/text: I really don't know what to compare with this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon drink, which will adequately describe the flavor profile I'm getting when tried at full strength per the package directions.  The aftertaste of cough drops, perhaps, or that chemical/sodium taste you get as a minor note with club soda, only -- unfortunately -- amplified.<br /><br />Dry ginger granules can't really be expected to taste "fresh" - and indeed the Gold Kili ginger calls to mind the kind you'd buy to make pumpkin pie.  Now, I expect I've savored plenty of chai teas that had ginger powder in the spice base.  So after determining that full-strength Gold Kili was too strong for me, I decided to try it as a drink add-in, mixing it with a quart of tea from the fridge.  It wasn't bad...except for that chemical aftertaste again.  Rats.<br /><br />1.5 stars, rounded up -- recognizing the convenience of the product and the fact that tastes do vary.

review/summary: Spicy ginger flavor, but not enough lemon
review/text: This beverage is pretty easy to prepare - just add hot water to the powder and stir.  The drink smelled wonderful - a nice spicy ginger with a lingering bit of lemon and just a touch of sweetness.  I expected it to taste similar, and was a little disappointed that there seemed to be less lemon flavor than the smell suggested.  After a several sips, I decided it was a little spicy for me to enjoy as it was, so I decided to add a couple of lumps of sugar.  Sweetening it up a bit made the drink a success for me and I really enjoyed the remainder.<br /><br />The major downside to this for me is the price.  At a little under $4 a box, I will probably opt to stick with a much less expensive ginger tea and add my own lemon.  While this drink has no steeping time, I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes to save some money.

review/summary: I am a BIG fan of ginger, but I'm not quite sure what, exactly, to make of this drink mix!
review/text: Perhaps Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon beverage mix is better suited to a true, traditional Asian palate, as ginger is a very popular spice in many Asian dishes. I, myself, happen to be a BIG fan of ginger. I enjoy eating pieces of candied and crystallized ginger on a regular basis both for its breath-freshening properties, as well as to make my mouth sweeter (and more kissable!), and to soothe my stomach. My favorite granola is one from Trader Joe's that contains slivers of candied ginger. Ginger is just something that I miss when I go for too long without it. On that note, this drink DOES have an initial potent kick of ginger, at first sip, but the flavor after that first sip seems to be pretty weak and ambiguous. Is this supposed to be kinda like the ginger beer that I grew up seeing my mom enjoy on a regular basis? Is it supposed to be similar to a ginger ale, but with a little (well-nigh undetectable, and synthetic-tasting) lemon to punch it up? I really wasn't quite sure.<br /><br />The drink isn't sweet enough to really count as a soft drink, and overall, aside from a drink with a bit of punch and somewhat waning - or at least perhaps slightly old-tasting - ginger kick, I couldn't quite figure out what Gold Kili was trying to present here.<br /><br />I had my pouch cold, as I'm most likely to drink most of my beverages that way. Not sure if it would've been better hot, but I just wasn't a fan of this. Potent ginger flavor, odd, almost absent lemon flavor, not sweet enough, and I feel that I should be able to enjoy a product straight out of the package, as it's sold. If I have to do a bunch of gussying up of it in order to make it palatable, it needs some tweaking before going out on the store shelves, at least as far as I'm concerned...

review/summary: It's Been Awhile Since I've Tasted Something This Vile...
review/text: I am a huge lover of ginger.  I regularly drink ginger tea brewed from fresh ginger root (very inexpensive, yet tasty) and tea brewed from dried ginger.  Both those things are good and enjoyable.  So, when I saw this product I thought it'd be a great chance to enjoy ginger in yet another form.  I imagined it would taste very pleasantly enjoyable...  DID NOT HAPPEN!  This is one of the most disgusting and vile things I've tasted in a long time.  It had an incredibly overpowering bitter flavor to it - so much so that I re-checked the instructions to make sure I had added the correct amount of water (I had).  I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said "enough of this madness!".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!  You'd be far happier just making some tea out of fresh or dried ginger root, an option that's cheaper than buying this crap anyways.  Ugh...that taste lingers in one's mouth, too...

review/text: Considering the manufacturer only sent one packet through the Vine program, it's hard to give you a review based on a tea that can be instantly served hot/cold.

Taste was slightly too bitter for my total liking, but I'd give it a second chance if a packet landed in my mailbox, haha. If I would've tried it hot, I may have been a bigger fan, especially since it's so easy to make, like mixing Emergen-C on the go.

review/summary: Great Ginger Taste
review/text: I wasn't sure about this drink mix when I first poured the powder in the glass. I love ginger, and I was actually afraid it would have too much lemon and not enough ginger.  However, the ginger taste is definitely the high point. It is VERY strong ginger and really hits the back of your throat in a good way (if you like ginger).  It's actually not very lemony at all, but instead the sweetness is a bit over-powering for the lemon. I actually had to go back and double check the ingredients because the sweetness almost tastes fake as you are drinking it (like it's a fake sweetener). I enjoyed the drink and I would definitely drink it again. It's a nice eye-opening drink for first thing in the morning or would be great if you were suffering from a cold or sinus issue.

But alas it was downright terrible. I heated the right amount of water as per its directions and found it extremely strong and bitter.  So I added more water and mix and this time added some honey for flavor and still found it too strong, and very unsatisfying.  Finally I cut it with extra water and that was all she wrote, it was still bad.  Worse I feel than the taste of this stuff when actually drinking it was the terrible aftertaste that lasts for some time.  An hour later I could still taste some of it lingering, and it was not at all pleasant.  I do not, and cannot recommend this drink at all....

review/summary: But It's a GOOD Kind of Burn
review/text: Some reviewers here have complained that the Gold Kili Ginger Lemon beverage is too hot - and I can readily see that it might be for some tastes. This stuff has a peppery burn that you WILL feel...although that's actually a quality I like (my favorite soda is Blenheim's Red Cap ginger ale, which is basically like the acid that runs through the creature's veins in "Alien.") So I've got no complaints about the ginger in this drink, but found myself unhappy with the other two flavors: lemon and honey.<br /><br />The ginger is so strong that it could really be matched well with tart lemon...but the lemon flavor was almost undetectable. There was no problem tasting the honey, though (although it wasn't super strong). Unfortunately, I don't usually care for the taste of honey in my drinks, so even a little was a bit too much.<br /><br />Overall, I found it a thin and watery beverage which was peppery hot, but otherwise lacking in flavor except for the slightly cloying sweetness. I'm giving it 3 stars because the same tastes I found unsatisfying might be exactly what someone else is looking for (and ginger IS good for you).

review/text: Well, it seems theoretically impossible that this induced an asthma attack. So perhaps THAT was a coincidence. I may of course be allergic to an ingredient or preservative in this. I inhaled, my throat constricted...attempted two sips...and couldn't breath. I don't have many food allergies either. Perhaps it was just the strength of this brew. Do check out the ingredient list if you're alkergy prone (the single packet sent by Vine didn't include ingredients).  I like lemon. I like ginger(find it wonderful for settling an upset stomach), I love hot teas (usually very asthma friendly).  But this...was very, very strong. Tastewise, it not bad just strong. I would suggest diluting it a bit. It looks kind of like apple cider when mixed, rather like little bits of a fibersupplement when not, lol. But ive never felt so wheezy with a tea or ginger or lemon! I'm giving it 2 stars because I cant honestly say I like it, even though I like things in in its category.  I felt the taste would be much improved by dilution, though. Also, only two stars Bc I'm suspicious about the respiratory issue that prevented me from trying it further. Ok ok, that couldbe coincidence.....  so three stars.

review/summary: Wow this stuff is strong.
review/text: I've never tried a ginger tea before.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but wow this was an eye opener.  I brewed it hot as the directions suggested.  I never thought about adding sugar (I normally do with tea) and that's a good thing because it is already sweetened with honey. I waited for it to cool down a bit and then I took a sip.  My first impression was that I had messed up and this wasn't really a product intended for consumption.  You get a quick medicine taste followed by a burning sensation very similar to a hot salsa with a lemon tang to it.  The initial shock probably made it worse than it should have been.  I continued (much more carefully) to sip it and it's not undrinkable.  I went three stars because I understand that I just tend to not like very strong tastes like this, but others may.  Also, reading a few other reviews I'm getting the impression that ginger teas do tend to have a bite...  that said if you like ginger and like VERY strong tastes you may very well enjoy this tea.  (At this time there are several 5 star reviews) Just be warned, this sure isn't lipton.  If you buy, I hope you enjoy and thank you for taking the time to read my review.

I tasted no lemon whatsoever, and the ginger was totally overpowering and bitter. As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a lemony golden color in your cup, as shown on the package...it's a dark swampy color. Like coffee with a lot of milk in it. I guess I was hoping for a light gingery lemon flavor that would be soothing, but this was far from it. I'm always on the hunt for new teas other warm beverages, so I'm glad I got to try this.

review/summary: Bitter!
review/text: Everyone's taste is a little different, so let's try looking at this more logically by breaking down statements from the official description:<br /><br />=========><br />Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from top grade ginger and honey to give a unique taste, providing goodness and fragrance when consumed. Enhanced with tangy natural lemon flavor,the taste is certainly refreshing.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />It certainly is fragrant. It may not be as good as burning a lemon-scented candle, but it did give a fresh, lemony smell to the area -- better than lemon-scented cleaning products.<br /><br />But I couldn't *taste* the lemon. There's an undertone of sourness, but bitter ginger dominates. The honey apparently keeps it from being too bitter. It does NOT have any sweet flavor.<br /><br />And actually, the bitter flavor reminds me more of black pepper than it does ginger.<br /><br />=========><br />Traditionally, ginger is used as-a spice to flavor food, however, people from many countries around Asia e g. India, China, Indonesia, etc, consume ginger products for motion sickness, to aid digestion and to restore the balance in the body. The inner foil envelope contains instantly dissolving crystals that make a spicy beverage. You can control the depth of favor by how much you add to you cup.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />While it is strong, I'm not sure making it weaker by adding more water does any good. You either like the flavor, or you don't. I suspect I would like it better if I had a cold, as this stuff really cuts through! It feels good in my tummy, too.<br /><br />But, again, this is not a "refreshing" beverage. This is a slap-you-in-the-face bitter cup of something.<br /><br />The crystals did dissolve instantly when the hot water hit them. There was nothing to stir. No sediment.<br /><br />My first reaction was, "This is horrible," but I decided to sally forth, and drink at least most of the cup before making my judgement. It did grow on me, but not enough that I'm likely to buy it. It's just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />But if you like a bitter mix of ginger flavor (that I still think in this case tastes more like black pepper, even though I can smell ginger) tempered with a little sour lemon, and, presumably, enough honey to keep it from killing you, this might be for you.<br /><br />The hotter, and spicier you like your foods, the more appreciation that I'm sure you'll have for this. But if you're looking for a sweatish, lemony beverage that's refreshing in the way that lemonade is, this is NOT something you want to try.<br /><br />eh... maybe I will get a couple of packages to keep around for when I get a cold, and I need something powerful to taste.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is at best an acquired taste. Bitter beyond what most people would call refreshing -- but that may just be what you're into.<br /><br />Edit: One day later, and out of nowhere I have a craving for this stuff. I really didn't like it, so I'm not really sure why I have this craving. Wow.

review/summary: Needs an acquired taste?
review/text: I am a tea drinker, and I like both lemon and ginger, but I didn't find this drink to be terribly tasty. I followed the directions for making it hot and could only drink about half of it. The ginger is very strong, so if you're not a real fan of ginger, I would suggest you not bother with this product. I would like to have tried it cold as well to compare the two, but the Vine program only sent me one packet. I agree with another reviewer who commented on the large packaging that was used for such a small item. It seemed very wasteful.<br /><br />If I find this product in the store, I might give it another try cold and update my review.

review/summary: Unique flavor
review/text: This tastes like sweetened lemonade that has been heated up and heavily doused with ginger.  There is more sweetness than tartness to the lemon portion, and the ginger is very strong.  It makes your whole mouth and throat tingle.  I really was not impressed with this hot drink.  I'd much rather drink an herbal lemon tea or  ginger tea, but not this.  I couldn't even finish the cup, and no one else in the family would try it either.  The combination of its muddy tan color and its smell turned them off.  On a positive note, the powder completely and quickly dissolved in the hot water.

review/text: It seemed easy enough to make. Basically just dump the little granules in a cup and add hot water. Stir to dissolve it. Then attempt to drink...<br /><br />Not sure what I was expecting. Maybe something like tea or like lemonade. It was neither. It was lemony, sure, but it was also really spicy. Like 'hot' spicy. A bit like drinking chili pepper water.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea, as it were. If you really like drinking spicy ginger, perhaps you'll like this. Guess I'm not much of a ginger fan...?<br /><br />For me, I'll stick with green tea or peppermint. This just didn't sit well with me.

review/text: I make my tea the classic way; the Turkish way. In which I put the pouch inside a little container with 3 cups of water brought to boil, and another larger container underneath it that has only water. This process in Turkish is called "demlemek", or to brew. The concentrated tea is then mixed with water with a proportion of my liking. The result is the proper way of making tea, and the Ginger & Lemon taste bursts to your delight.

review/text: I love ginger in general & I really like ginger tea, so I expected good things from this drink mix. I was disappointed. The mix dissolved instantly, which was great. The first sip was almost okay, but the flavor seemed to get stronger and less pleasant with every sip. Neither the ginger nor the lemon nor the honey came through. All of thr favors were dark and muddy. The  drink itself was murky, cloyingly sweet & medicinal. It really reminded me of Thera-Flu, which is fine if you have a bad cold and will suffer a kinda awful drink because you know it will knock you out right away. But I wouldn't drink Thera-flu for pleasure, and the same holds true for this drink. I couldn't even finish the cup.

review/text: First, this product package is about the size of a Cool Aid package, approximately 2" x 3". It comes in a sealing foil package similar to Cool Aid. I ordered this through the Vine program and to my amazement, this small package of powdered drink mix came in a box big enough for 20 books! It came in a 19" x 14" box, stuffed full of protective air bubbles. While I appreciate good packaging, the waste here completely turned me off! It was incredible. The product itself was so-so. Not terrible, but not really good either. It is definitely not something that I would replace my green tea or peppermint tea with during the day, so I don't see myself drinking it or desiring it. If you something a bit different, you may want to give it a try. But I was not very impressed with either the taste or the waste associated with this product and will not be using it again.

Unfortunately, this drink ends up being entirely unappealing -- it is a dirty brown color, it smells musty, and the taste is too strong and powdery. The only real positive is that at least the dry pellets dissolve quickly and completely in hot water, so the consistency is nice and even. I could not stand to take more than a couple sips.

I can conceive of only using this as a medicinal drink for upset stomach, nausea or vomiting. I don't dislike the flavor of ginger, in fact I like it as a mild seasoning when cooking, or as a light flavor in sweets, but this was totally overpowering, to the point where I could hardly notice the lemon and honey flavors.<br /><br />In my line of work I routinely recommend ginger for GI upset, this drink is so overpowering, though, that I would have to caution users to use it for extreme cases of nausea/vomiting only, unless they have a strong tolerance for the flavor.

review/text: I am always a little cautious with beverage mixes so I used half a packet in the recommended 1 cup of hot water (50% recommended strength)<br /><br />It was so extremely ginger bitter that I couldn't take it.  So I added another cup of hot water.  I managed to keep drinking it but only about half way (this is at 25% strength).  I ended up just dumping it.<br /><br />I haven't drank any more - if you like chewing pickled ginger or something like that maybe you'll like this but it is NOT like ginger tea - it's not subtle and it's extremely bitter.  Could smell the lemon - could only taste ginger.<br /><br />Not at all for me.  I'll try to pawn off what I have left on someone else but my boyfriend won't take it either.  He tasted a sip of mine said "it's okay" and then refused to drink any more, so I'll assume that regardless of what he said, he doesn't like it either.

review/summary: Ginger good for sore throats...not much in the way of Lemon...
review/text: I don't have a cold right now but since I often take ginger and honey for a sore throat, I thought this might be a nice alternative.<br /><br />It might be, in a pinch.<br /><br />The ginger is strong.  Strong in a good way if you have a sore throat but you may not be that accustomed to it.  When I make ginger tea I use perhaps 3-4 thin slices steeped in a cup of water for about 5-10 minutes with a tablespoon or two of honey.<br /><br />I used about � cup hot water for a pouch instead of the cup.  The ginger is nice and strong, lingering in the mouth and back of the throad.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's a bit sweeter than I would prefer (even when brewed to the recommended level) and there's really no lemon taste- just an aroma.<br /><br />There's also a somewhat bitter aftertaste that I'm not so fond of.  This taste is not chemical, more like an herbal bitter note.  I'm more of a coffee person so you tea drinkers out there might actually prefer it.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time deciding between three stars and four.  It's good, not great.  Probably 3 for flavor (It's OK) , four for convenience (I like it)

review/text: The package instructions are in ml, for a quick conversion to ounces, you would use approx 8.45 ounces of hot water to make this drink.<br /><br />If you have never tried hot lemonade, this might be a bit of a surprise to your taste buds.<br />I'm not sure where I learned to use hot lemonade for sore throats, but we have been doing it for over 20 years at my house.<br /><br />The warmth and the acidity of the lemon combine to make your throat feel better, it might be partially because lemon contains vitamin C.<br /><br />Ginger is a traditonal remedy for upset stomachs, and this combination is very good for that yucky feeling you get when you are stuffy and the postnasal drip is upsetting your stomach.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend, the individual packages keep the product fresh until needed and they are prefect for throwing in a purse or a backpack to take to work if you have to work when you don't feel well.

I took two sips of this tea and shivered from the horrible taste.  I love ginger but this was way too strong - I would have had the same effect if I'd stirred a tablespoon of ginger powder into hot water.  I didn't taste any lemon at all, and it was also too sweet.  I added a little ice to cool it down and tried again.  Nope, still noxious.  I poured it down the drain, and fixed some mint tea to counteract the aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />This vile concoction tastes like an experiment gone wrong.  I won't be buying it, ever.

You can definitely taste the ginger, but it's offset by the lemon and honey blend.  Although ginger, lemon and honey are considered healthy ingredients and may have medicinal qualities, this is not a diet drink.  According to the label, there are 73 calories per serving, so please keep this in mind.  However, it is caffeine free, so it would make an ideal evening drink alone or with a dash of milk.  My only concern is the price, which I believe is a little steep.

review/summary: Too Much of a Good Thing?
review/text: Ginger is a naturally healthy remedy that is used for calming the stomach, seasickness, stimulating circulation/metabolism and is even good for arthritis. It's lingering spiciness is not appealing to everyone. Ginger Tea directions recommend 350 ml  (about 8.5 ounces) of hot water per packet. One mouthful at that strength was TOO STRONG for me. Too spicy initially and lingering spiciness for awhile afterwards. It did make me sweat so I can see using it as a cold remedy to naturally break a fever, calm the tummy and a worthy addition to the medicine cabinet. I did add an additional cup of hot water to the mix to make it palatable but the spiciness still lingered.<br /><br />I didn't find the tipping point where sipping this Ginger Tea became a pleasureable experience I'd enjoy on a regular basis. This is definitely NOT for the BLAND crowd. I  didn't discern lemon OR honey with either the original version or with the additional hot water, just spiciness. Although I can see the medicinal benefits of Ginger Tea, it's NOT my cup of tea.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/10/2012 After Dr. recommended I cut back on caffeine I needed a warm drink that didn't leave me craving another like my "coffee treats". The flashback of this beverage returned. I ordered the pack of 6 and drink ONLY ONE A DAY compared to the 3 coffee treats a day - sure the calorie reduction will show eventually. The lingering spiciness is not conducive to munching any snacks either = less caloric intake. I've even used the mixed beverage with soy sauce and a splash of vinegar as a base for veggie soups. The lingering spicy ginger flavor leaves me feeling satisfied and minimizes my "grazing".<br /><br />***STILL 3 STARS so not to sway readers that it's the best thing since sliced bread. It's OK and works for me and my purpose :)

review/summary: Extreme Ginger & Very Sweet
review/text: I really like fresh, hot ginger in food, tea or candy but this ginger is extreme.  It leaves a burning sensation in the throat similar to eating horseradish; not pleasant.  I made it following the instructions which is with a cup of hot water.  I did not care for it & neither did my spouse.  So then I added several ice cubes to make an iced version; that was better.  But even iced, it's still too sweet for my taste.  However, if you like southern iced "sweet tea", you may like this.  It really reminded me of that flavor & sweetness.  There is a nice hint of lemon. The ginger burn was also minimized by drinking it iced.  But even so, I ended up dumping the rest down the drain.  It's just not my kind of drink & getting a sore throat is not enjoyable.<br /><br />The flavors of this drink do taste real - not icky fake tasting which is good.  If you like hot, burning ginger & sugary sweet taste, you may like this.

review/summary: It was ok, must like ginger
review/text: Since I decided to drastically reduce my caffeine intake as well as my sodium intake, I have gotten a little bored with what I can drink.  There is too much sodium, not to mention other nasty stuff, in diet soda to keep drinking it as much as I was, and coffee has too much caffeine, so it has been a lot of water and decaffeinated teas.  Coffee and diet soda have been occasional at best.  So, when I got the chance to try Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Drink, I was intrigued.<br /><br />The drink comes in premeasured packets, but you can add as little or as much as you like.  The drink mix is made up of little granules.  The first thing I noticed was a very overpowering smell of lemon.  While the drink says it is all natural, the lemon smell was very fake smelling (think furniture polish) and it was hard for me to get past.<br /><br />I added the mix to hot water.  I added about half, and it seemed weak, so I added the rest.  Again, the lemon smell was overpowering.  I had a hard time getting past it enough to taste the drink.  I expected the lemon taste would be as powerful, but I was wrong.  It was the ginger taste that was very strong.  VERY strong.  Not awful, but definitely powerful, and it made the drink taste very spicy.  My tongue tingled after the first taste.<br /><br />All in all, this drink was not bad.  The ginger taste was strong and spicy, so you will need to like ginger (a lot) to really enjoy this drink.  This is way different from the ginger ale taste that most people think of when they think ginger drink.  It is similar to a ginger beer we recently tried.  I think if I was sick, this would be a great drink.<br /><br />The thing that most bothered me was, as a reviewer, I only received a single packet of the mix.  I was given absolutely no information regarding nutrition values (calories) and ingredients.  Without this information, I am very hesitant to recommend the product.

Usually when you get something with ginger you barely taste it but this product has quite a big punch of hot spicy ginger with a touch of lemon and just sweet enough but not too sweet. Also no artificial sweetener which is a must for me. I just so happened to be coming down with a stomach bug when this arrived and it was just what I needed to fight the nausea and upset. I will buy this again, it was a nice convenient  way to get a cup of my beloved ginger tea without having to grate the root myself or squeeze the lemon. This tastes just like I did all the work but all I did was boil the water! If you find fresh grated ginger too hot and spicy this is not for you, it is very spicy and wonderful!

review/summary: Wow! That packs a punch!
review/text: I expected this to be a watered-down, oversweetened drink with little ginger and lemon flavor. I was wrong! The ginger is particularly powerful, with a lovely natural bite to it. The lemon is definitely there, though not as strong as the ginger. And while it is very sweet, the sweetness is honeyed and has a very nice flavor. It dissolves immediately with almost no stirring. There's a fluffy texture to the granules that makes them dissolve faster than sugar crystals.<br /><br />It was delicious as a drink by itself, though due to the sugar content, I'd probably use it in smaller doses to sweeten up a chai tea or something where that gingery bite would be appreciated.

review/summary: Could not finish
review/text: At first I was a little disappointed that I only got one pouch to try, but after tasting it I'm glad. The ginger in this drink is so strong that I can't bear to finish it all. I drank about half of it hot (it makes about 8 ounces)and it did not taste right. I let it cool down and drank a little more, then proceeded to dump the rest of it out. I feel that was torture enough. It's SO strong. I normally like teas and other things with ginger flavor, but I cannot recommend this drink.

review/summary: Decent Instant Ginger Tea
review/text: Co-workers introduced me to instant Ginger tea. I've purchased a few different brands locally. I prefer the instant in this case because tea-bag varieties I've tried tend to lack flavor and be quite tame. I like my ginger with a kick to it!<br /><br />Gold Kili's Ginger-Lemon drink has that kick, though it isn't the strongest I've tasted. That honor goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035UI0H2">Instant Crystal Honey Ginger Tea</a>.  The Gold Kili brand drink is almost as strong, yet its sweetness has a slightly artificial flavor. Not totally off-putting, but noticeable. The lemon flavor is there too, but very subdued. I prefer the honey taste of the other brand.<br /><br />The Gold Kili instant ginger drink can handle more than 6-8 oz. of liquid without tasting watered down, and I recommend 10-12 for most folks.  I can see it mixing well in various cocktails as well. Medicinal effects of ginger are well documented, though I don't know how effective they are in this formulation. Just be mindful that this is an instant beverage and not the same as one made with fresh ingredients. You get it for the convenience.<br /><br />3.5 stars for a tasty ginger drink.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: While this has a good taste, it was too sweet for my taste. It makes a good warm drink on a cold day, I suppose, but I prefer tea.

review/summary: Interesting But Too Spicy
review/text: I must say I was excited to try this product because it sounded like a unique and tasty combination of flavors, but it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped for.  I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together, although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities, a mix of bitter, sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger, they'd be onto something, but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected.

review/summary: Strong Ginger Taste, Weird Aftertaste.
review/text: This had a really nice aroma when I opened the packet -- a mixture of the lemon and the ginger. I can taste the lemon, particularly if I hold it in my mouth for a moment, but the ginger taste is the really prevalent flavor. It has that kick to it you get when you eat fresh or pickled ginger. I enjoy it as I drink it, but there is a weird and -- to me -- unpleasant aftertaste. I would like something like this, but this actual product probably would not make it into my grocery cart.

review/summary: Not bad tasting if you enjoy powdered beverages
review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Beverage mix (Ginger & Lemon) is an all right drink-in-a-powder.  I have drank similar types of drinks in the past (Chrysanthemum, herbal and tea) and I thought I give this one a try.  I wasn't turned off by the taste but it wasn't lip smacking good either.  Its an acquired taste and if you enjoy drinking instant beverages (just add water) then you'll want to try this one out.  Veterans of powdered drinks need not apply.

review/summary: It's okay...
review/text: The Gold Kili is just okay to me. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor, it too bold for me. It will settle a stomach, as the other reviewers stated. For that alone, it would be perfect for those sick days or hangover days or any day you have a little stomach bug!

review/summary: not that tasty
review/text: I drank a little with cold water and with hot tea.  Later my sister and I tried it made like a tea with hot water.  She really likes ginger while I am not so keen on the stuff.  Neither of us enjoyed the "tea" as it was kind of harsh tasting.<br /><br />I have heard that ginger helps with nausea but I never did get a chance to try it before it was used up.

review/summary: Disgusting.
review/text: I have never had a drink with such a strong aftertaste and odor. And to add insult to injury -- it's hot and perfumes the air with an acrid smell. I seriously had to open a window after brewing this. I didn't get a hint of lemon or of ginger, I imagine this is what battery acid must taste like.

review/summary: Intense, strong ginger, with a little sweet lemon
review/text: I really liked this ginger drink, but I'm also a huge fan of ginger. If you don't like real ginger, I would guess that you won't like this drink. It's also pretty spicy for a ginger drink.<br /><br />The drink comes in these cool granules that dissolve completely in water. You could sprinkle a little bit of this on a salad, to give it a nice, gingery taste. This tastes like it's made completely from real ingredients, from real ginger, from real lemons, and from real honey. I'm not sure if it is or not, but I couldn't tell anything artificial about this. There are 72 total packets in this item, 6 boxes with 12 packets per box. They recommend one packet for 1 cup (250 ml) of water, but it's intense enough that you could use one packet for two or three cups.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Has a real ginger taste<br />+Very strong<br />+A lot of stuff in each pouch<br />+Dissolves completely<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May be too strong and spicy for the uninitiated to real ginger

review/summary: Hot and Sweet
review/text: This ginger and lemon instant beverage is hot -- in more ways than one.  The drink is made with hot water, but the real heat comes from the ginger.  The spicy flavor stays in your mouth long after you've finished the drink.<br /><br />I found the drink quite pleasant and not overly sweet, just the thing for a cold winter's evening.  Whether it has a good effect on digestion, I cannot say because I usually have very good digestion; however, I would be happy to try it again when I have an upset tummy.<br /><br />As spicy as it is, I cannot think I would enjoy it in the hot Texas summer, but for a cold weather drink, it will be great.<br /><br />So, will I buy it for winter use?  Absolutely!

review/summary: Too much ginger, weird aftertaste
review/text: Normally, I love ginger, honey and lemon in drinks.  Unfortunately, I found the ginger in this drink overpowered the taste of the lemon and honey.  I also felt like it was not a true ginger flavor, seemed somewhat artificial, which is probably where the odd aftertaste came from.  Can't quite explain the aftertaste, but it did seem almost chemical.  Not a drink I would purchase.

review/summary: Interesting, but not a destination
review/text: This drink certainly has a nice and spicy ginger kick.  That made it interesting.  Other than that, it is honey sweetened.  I didn't notice the lemon flavor though - probably because I was too busy enjoying the ginger.  People that believe in that sort of thing think that ginger has some sort of curative effect.  I can't speak to that as I didn't have any ailments needing a cure.  Purely on conjecture, I think this drink would feel good on a sore throat.  I'd add whisky though.<br /><br />So, overall I found this to be an interesting drink but not one I'd push on friends, even if they're sick.  I have better recipes.
