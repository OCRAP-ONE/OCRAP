review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The stores all carry either the Arnold Palmer Lite(most common, better tasting), or the Zero(less calories, but less flavor).  This mix produces an iced tea that tastes like neither of them.  Somehow the settling that occurs with this mix, makes it either come out too sweet, or too sour.  For one thing, it's sugar based, not splenda like the lite in the stores.  The amount the directions say to mix do not give the drink enough flavor, you'll use more than the directions say.  I bought this once, but will not buy again.

Though I wouldn't buy it for this list price. it is 4 something at Walmart.<br /><br />Though I probably drink this drink way to much but it is a great drink.<br /><br />i make normally around 12oz of water to 3 generous teaspoons with some ice cubes and it is some of the best things. I personnally rather drink this than the canned version.<br /><br />I used to make raspberry arnold palmer when ever i go out to eat. sense most the fast food around here have a ice tea and a raspberry lemonaid. though this is a great product i suggest you try it out.<br /><br />-local tech repair admin

review/summary: I actually found a use for chopped dried burdock root!
review/text: I bought this for first time late last summer or early fall or whenever.  I was looking for anti inflammatory herbs.  The dandelion root which I also tried though bit bitter was soothing to drink as hot herbal tea.  Not the burdock... YUCK!<br /><br />But I had bought the stuff, dont like wasting money, so got to experimenting with it.  Found the perfect use.  It perfectly complements old fashion rolled oats both in taste and texture.  I used to have heck of a time getting oatmeal choked down without boatload of sugar and cinnamon and stuff.<br /><br />Now I put cold water in pan along with pinch salt and small handful of the burdock root.  Bring it to simmer, toss in the old fashion rolled oats, and let it do its thing for few minutes.<br /><br />I can eat it with nothing else added.  And I actually enjoy it.  Couldn't say that about bowl oatmeal before now.

review/summary: hum... not sure.
review/text: I bought a book about home brewing soda pop. Several of the recipes call for this.  We tried them out.  The flavor is new to us and we still don't know if we like it.  We will try a few more batches to see if we get use to the flavor.  We don't drink regular soda very often.  I usually drink seltzer water with a splash of lemon in it so soda drinking isn't really on our menu.  We thought we would try home brew soda because we like the idea that soda originated healthful "tonics".  This made the batch of root beer taste medicinal.  I am not saying it is "bad" just not what we imagined.

review/text: I haven't bought these through Amazon, but I have had these. These are my favorite granola bar, On the rare occasions I do buy them I hide them from my kids so I can eat all of them. I could probably sit down, eat a whole box and still want more. The great thing about these is that there is less sugar than in their regular chocolate chip granola bar, but I think they taste 100x better. After writing this review I am craving them again.

review/text: I just plain like green peppercorns. I have been buying Napoleon brand from my local grocers - but due to the economy they've dropped many low-volume products. The Napoleon peppercorns are from Spain and are definitely PUNGENT! I like 'em!<br />However, these Roland peppercorns are from Malaysia and are quite mild. You can pop five or six of these in your mouth and crunch them between your molars for a pleasant peppery taste. (Try that with just one of the Napoleon's and it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your soul.)  So, if you want pungency these are not for you. If you prefer a milder product you may be pleased with these.  Personally, I like the sharp piquant taste of the Spanish peppers by Napoleon.  I will not be buying these again.<br />[Recipe suggestion: Get green peppercorns in brine (not vinegar). Drain, and pop a handfull into a small food processor. Blend the crap out of them until you have a green paste. Lovingly massage the paste into a steak. Grill the steak & enjoy.]

review/text: If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.

review/text: I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

review/summary: This food is a lifesaver for my cat!
review/text: Found this food by accident one day while at a pet food store out of town.  Gave it to my cat when I had run out of her regular food and she devoured it!  She had been developing some breathing issues and then we found she had severe dental problems.  After a long surgery she came home and despite being a bit wobbly from the anesthesia and having had three extractions, she ate three 3 oz cans over the course of a few hours.  I was amazed!  (Had to mash the food up a bit as the shredded pieces were a little too much with her having such a sore mouth..but she got it down.)  With this food, prior to surgery, the breathing problems (vet said maybe early stage asthma or due to decayed teeth--a situation that can kill an animal because the bacteria from the teeth weakens all bodily parts and functions) lessened and vanished unless she begins running around like a happy,joyful much younger cat. I swear by this product and don't know what I would have done had I not found it.  If it is a bit too much for your adult cat to chew, I just use a fork and mash it up.  The liquid is great for cats with kidney problems as well (I used to sneak an eye dropper full of water into the food and blend it in when I though my cat wasn't getting enough water)All in all, I highly recommend this cat food...and my cat seconds that!

review/text: My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart.

review/summary: My dog loves it, so do the cats
review/text: I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.

review/summary: My senior dog looks forward to her meals again.
review/text: One of the problems senior dogs often face is a decreasing appetite. This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.

review/text: I've been using Harmony Dry Dog Food for the past 2 years with great success. However, the last bag had a rancid oil smell upon opening. Not sure if the Texas heatwave OR a recipe change was the cause. BUT my pooch ate it, just not with his usual gusto. Making gravies to enhance it pushed me to find some healthy "mix-ins". Searching the internet for reviews and pricing of various brands, led me back to Amazon and Pedigree on sale. I've been mixing this with his Harmony. He eats the combination heartily without digestive issues. Based on his favorable response I've purchased other Pedigree brand items (dry and wet) on sale through Amazon's Warehouse Deals with equally favorable response.  I won't give up on Harmony Dog Foods BUT I'll have other options as well so my fur-baby doesn't burnout on it.

review/text: Got this for 2 months at my local stores retail price with the Amazon subscribe and save program. Then like many other items in the program the price doubled??? That got me looking around. Way to pricey and not really a very healthy dog food from what I have read lately. The dogs ofcourse have liked Pedigree for over a year now, But for this kind of money I want something healthier.

review/summary: GARBAGE
review/text: Don't take offense, I fed this brand for years. But, a look at the ingredients shows that it is garbage. No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as "wholesome" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? "Food Pets Die For", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it.

review/text: My cats are food snobs - they only eat seafood and will refuse to eat almost every brand you can find in a supermarket.  In looking at the ingredients in those other brands, I understand the sentiment.  That stated, my cats LOVE natural Balance.  The ingredients are great and they eat multiple flavors without hesitation - great option for the more finicky eaters...or those owners trying to limit the amount of poison they feed their pets!

review/summary: A healthy wet cat food at a reasonable price
review/text: After the second cat of three cats in my household started having problems with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, I got serious about researching cat foods and decided to try Natural Balance. They make a totally grain-free hard cat food that I decided to supplement with their wet food. My cats love the Natural Balance wet cat food. The taste is obviously good to them and nutritionally it is a much healthier choice than Science Diet or Iams. Because Natural Balance contains more protein than cat foods that are loaded with grains and other fillers that cats do not need, it is slightly higher in calories. Thus, you may need to feed your cats slightly less than you are used to if you make the switch or consider the Reduced Calorie version. I am very pleased with the results of this cat food. Within a very short period of time, there was almost complete resolution of the vomiting/diarrhea/GI issues of my cats and their stool is less foul smelling. While two of my cats have always had lovely coats, one did not and his coat is now wonderfully soft in a way that it has never been. I will never go back to other wet foods.<br />Amazon has the best prices I've seen for Natural Balance (a little over $1 per can for the 6 ounce cans of wet food) and it's convenient to have it delivered to my door rather than trekking to the pet store. One 6 oz. can is dense enough to feed all 3 of my cats for one meal and they seem full for about 8-12 hours. So far I've tried the Indoor Formula and Ocean Fish. My cats did not love the Duck and Green Pea hard food so I've avoided feeding the wet food version of that flavor and can't vouch for it. The cost is a little more than Iams or Science Diet but my cats are worth it and I am probably saving a little because they require less hard food overall.

review/text: From the name and the description, I was expecting a creamy drink.  This is just coffee with a little caramel flavoring, barely enough to taste.  I'd rather have plain coffee than this.  I was looking for something really creamy with a nice caramel flavoring.  I finally found it - Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino.  It is exactly what I wanted.  It's sweet and creamy and I don't have to add a thing to make it taste the way I want it to. Great for a special treat to myself. And if you like that kind of drink, I also recommend Cafe Escapes Chai Tea Latte.  It has a wonderful aroma and flavor too.

review/text: Even though there are several hundred different blends now in the K-cup line I have become fond of the Green Mountain brand.  This new one to me has become one of my favorites.  I always drink it black so adding flavored creamers is not something I do.  There is just enough vanilla cream in this to give it some taste and the caramel adds just enough to make it special.  If I am having only one cup, no matter what time of day, this is my choice usually.<br /><br />My wife isn't really a hot coffee fan but we drink it iced, this is one of her favorites on ice also.

review/text: At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

review/text: My 12-year old daughter and I have just found tea flowers, and wanted to try a tea that wasn't heavy with black tea leaves.  This tea is very refreshing and lovely tasting.  The strawberry flavor is truly delicious without being overpowering.  We did use some honey to sweeten it a bit, but the second cup I drank was unsweetened, and it was nice too.  The flower opened up nicely and was attractive, which is important when you buy tea flowers, as the visual is part of the ceremony.  I would buy this tea flower again, and will.  I recommend this as an afternoon tea with cookies or a morning tea with a light breakfast.  It won't be strong enough to stand against a heavy meal. It is also good as just a tea without a side at all.

review/text: My Labrador Retriever just LOVES this plush, over-sized bone-shaped toy,  although it is NOT A CHEW TOY as my Lab has 'opened' it a couple of times over 6 mos. and we've had to sew it back closed.  In spite of this, she LOVES the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it.  In terms of value,  it is certainly worth &lt;$10, but when you add 50%+ more for S&H it becomes borderline in terms of value.  So I would give it 3-stars (OK product for $$) but my Lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with.  But we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain.  For tugging with a big dog,  try 3 Knot Tug Rope Bone - White (24 inch) which has been very durable for tug play.

review/text: Same principle as a juice box, so just imagine what your children are gonna want to do with these...no straw, but the spout is quite conducive to squishing the apple out everywhere....a kid could almost (and perhaps would rather) play or paint with a "tube" of this stuff versus eating it...afterall playing with food like applesauce is much more fun than actually consuming it, and these pouches make it ever so tempting...keep in mind too that the lid is technically a choking hazard for little ones, so unless your say 6 year and up child really wants to consume his/her food from a squeezable tube that seems intended for younger kids, I'm not sure how effective this product is. The applesauce tastes fine, standard low sugar applesauce, but for the high cost, both on amazon and in your local store, as compared to the price of a standard jar or even cups, this seems kind of crazy! I mean, unless your child really, really needs portable applesauce, I'd say stick w/a jar or cups for sooooo much less money, I don't really think this is the best product, and yet another thing to throw in a landfill! Not recommended!

This coffee has little to no flavor, is watery and......when you add more beans to compensate........the coffee turns bitter.....EXTREMELY BITTER.<br /><br />Also! Notice that it's being sold as "San Francisco Bay Coffee" brand.  False advertising.  Look at the picture of this coffee again and you'll notice that it's made by "Rogers & Family Coffee".  Hmmmmmmm.....don't you wonder why it says one thing and is another??<br /><br />I would STRONGLY DISCOURAGE anyone from buying this coffee as it's lousy and not worth the money.

review/summary: DELICIOUS SOUP
review/text: I get this soup from a local Asian supermarket (!  The Assi Plaza in Lansdale, PA) and it is just delicious.  It only costs $3.29 in the store.  BUT it is incredibly flavorful and satisfying! It's a big can and makes 2-4 servings.  I got into Pozole when I lived in New Mexico, it's a big tradition for New Year's Eve.  Juanita's also makes a Chicken Pozole which is just as good.  They are my favorite of ALL canned soups.  By the way, the Chicken Pozole is $3.49 in my grocer's.  Try them!  You'll be hooked.

review/summary: Disgusting unrecognizable pork and hominy
review/text: I wish there was a review out there I could've read that would've steered me away from buying this before I wasted $3.  I don't expect much out of canned food, but at least a spicy Millennium old Mexican soup could have more than a monotone, bland flavor and the texture of beans and franks, with unrecognizable hunks of pork and what was once hominy corn.  Just figure out how to make it and cook it yourself, unless you're just a Pozole addict and far from home.

review/text: I buy both this and the chicken variety at a local super discount grocery on a regular basis. They are equally delicious although I prefer the pork myself. I also add some shredded chicken or pork to thicken it and serve it with some flour tortillas. You will get two decent sized bowels of very hearty soup.

review/text: This has IMHO a nutty flavor. I purchased this at my local Japanese store $$$$$ & what I'd like to find is a more economical way of purchasing this in bulk. I typically mix brown rice, wild rice etc, to try and produce a nice rice blend. This does it wonderfully. I cook it (in my rice cooker) for a meal & then the next day make an amazing stir fry. I adore this rice & will continue to buy it at my local market (sorry Amazon, but they're less expensive!) It's outstanding.

review/summary: I really like it
review/text: I bought this at my local Japanese store, and the shopkeeper told me that she likled it but that it was difficult to eat "straight".  I tried it and it was difficult to eat.  so I took her advice and I mixed it 50/50 with some good Indian rice and it is wonderful this way. I got on the Internet to see if I could get it thru amazon, but the shipping cost is a tad high...if I ever had trouble getting this rice locally I would probably buy directly from amazon's vendor and buy a lot to keep the shipping cost down.<br /><br />The rice has mild flavor, but it's got great texture.  I usually mix it with basmati rice and eat it with lentil based Indian dishes (dal variants).  Good stuff!

review/summary: Fizzies great for diabetics
review/text: I bought the assorted pack of fizzies as an alternative to the constant water I've been drinking since being diagnosed with diabetes. I think they taste great. They are made with sorbitol and splenda so there is no aftertaste and it doesn't make your blood sugar go up. My favorite flavors are orange, lemon-lime, cherry, and sour apple. They also offer root beer and fruit punch but I think the fruit punch tasted more like bubblegum. I didn't get sick drinking it unlike another person's review. I think it would be a great alternative to diet soda which I can't stand.

review/summary: Fun alternative to soda, water, Crystal Lite, or Kool-Ade
review/text: My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a "normal" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.  However, as an alternative to Crystal Lite, Kool-Ade (which I can't stand) or plain water, these are fun and make a good drink.

review/summary: Has Flavor But The Fizz Is Weak
review/text: Unlike the Fizzies of my childhood, these did produce a favorful drink, but you need to wait a rather long time for the fizzing to work. Don't know if it is because the formula is now diet conscious but I had planned to surpise some older family members with them. Glad I didn't because the rapid fizzing is gone.

review/text: I found these in a candy store while on vacation and my daughters love them. I just put one in with their bottle of water and they chug it like its koolaid. Its alot better for them then koolaid or pop so I'm all for it. They are pricey but well worth it to get my kids to drink more water. I tried them, not so great to me. I think they taste like flavored water minus the sugar. But the kids like them so whatever works.

review/summary: A Flash of Nostalgia
review/text: I was suddenly possessed by an attack of nostalgia and looked on amazon to see if fizzies even still existed. They do! So I ordered a mixed flavor package, and a rootbeer package. They really hit my nostalgia-bone perfectly!<br /><br />Well they taste a little bit like Cool Aid which isn't the best drink in the world, but for something quick and fun, and best of all for a diabetic who needs such treats to be sugarless, I've enjoyed the fizzies beyond the mere nostalgia for childhood. I will probably get them again, because I find them additionally good as ice tea sweeteners.<br /><br />I also appreciate that they contain no aspertame, the cheap artificial sweetener that gave me severe joint and muscle pains throughout my body until the cause was at long last discovered. I gave up Coca Cola Zero and sugarless gum and within a week the long anguished months of nonstop pain ended! Fizzies uses sorbitol and sucralose for sweeteners. Even if I might have preferred stevia for being completely natural, it's fizzies for crine out loud, so be grateful.

review/text: I found these Fizzies soda drink tablets at the Cracker Barrel Store ($2.49 for a 12-pack) and I'm hooked. I've been drinking diet pop (soda) for a while, but the fizz is way too much for me. I like that these don't have sugar in them and only have 5 calories.<br />I bought the root beer flavor and I wasn't expecting much. I was hoping that they didn't taste weird and surprisingly they don't (they actually taste like a root beer, albeit not a very strong one). The taste isn't overwhelming, but I did make my first cup with 12oz of water (instead of the recommended 8oz of water). The fizz is there, but it's not so bad that you have to burp or anything. I love these and I will certainly be buying more of these again. I want to try all of the different flavors!

review/summary: My thought of fizzies before and now
review/text: When I was growing up in the early 60's my mom would fix my siblings and myself a fizzies. They tasted great which they were not a diet fizzie. I even enjoyed watching them fizz.<br /> When I seen that fizzies was still around on the internet I was so excited. I decided to order some cherry flavor. I wished a many times that I had only ordered one box of them. Instead I ordered a case of them which is 6 boxes for I didn't see how they would last very long, with me as crazy about them as I was. When I received the shipment through the mail, I was so excited. I went by the directions on the box and boy was I disappointed!!! They tasted to me like soap.I poured it out,and thought if I try another one except using 2 tablets instead of one that it would be better. The taste was stronger but it tasted no way like it did when I was growing up. I only wished that I had ordered one box of it instead of a case of it. Now I am going to have to throw what is left of them away after paying $15.98.

The tea leaves itself are pretty high quality, they taste pretty good, bu don't overwhelm the other flavors.  There is quite a bit of tea, I think 25 cups per flavor is about right.  They come in nice tins, those could be reusable.  I think the tea is on par with what I get in the bulk section of the co-op- good, but not knock-your-socks-off-fantastic.

review/summary: No cherry???
review/text: A couple of years ago, I found fish-shaped hard candy at Marshall's.  It was delicious and tart, and the cherry fish were my favorite.  They disappeared until I saw them last month at a gift shop in a Las Vegas casino, of all places.  The packaging was different, so it might have been a different manufacturer, but the taste was just as good as I remembered.  I attempted to find the candies here on Amazon, and I bought this one pound bag of Gone Fishing hard candy.  When I opened the bag, my first thought was, "Where is the cherry???"  This was clearly not the same fish candy I'd purchased previously; not just the colors, but the taste was also less tart, and the texture was different.  It was more powdery and it didn't have the same hard crunch of the other candy.<br /><br />In this pack, the green and orange were my favorite as they were the only ones with a bit of tartness.  I don't care for banana-flavored candy, and the yellow fish tasted just like yellow Runts.  The blue and pink candies were OK.<br /><br />I think some people will enjoy these candies, but if you're trying to find a replacement for the ones I described, this isn't it.  I think these might be the ones I was looking for: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O46950">GUPPIES, 30 LBS</a>
