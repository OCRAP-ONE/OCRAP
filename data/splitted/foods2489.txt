review/text: These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy.

review/text: These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++

review/text: thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips.

review/text: I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

review/text: I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.

review/text: I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.

The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.

review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

Kettle still advertises their products as containing "No MSG" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.

review/text: I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!

review/summary: Excellent Tortilla chips
review/text: These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!

review/summary: Black Beans Never Tasted So Good!!!
review/text: These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)

review/summary: Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE
review/text: Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of "Yeast Extract".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/summary: Yummy natural bar
review/text: I was not sure what to expect from this bar.  The wrapper looks quite unassuming and banana/cranberry seems to be an unlikely combination, but I decided to give this bar a try.  It essentially only has 3 ingredients - dried banana, dried cranberries and chocolate (which of course contains multiple ingredients, but is German made, so good stuff and no GMOs).  The center of the bar is banana/cranberry and then the bar is dipped in chocolate.  The banana and cranberries are ground up/mushed together, so there are no large pieces, and the bar is very moist and soft inside (when I think of dried banana, I think crunchy, but that is not the case).  The banana/cranberry part is also flavorful, and tastes of fresh banana with a hint of tartness.  The chocolate is also good and not too "crisp"/hard and not too melty and is just the right coating thickness.<br /><br />One thing I love about this bar and other Seitenbacher bars is that the package contains 2 individual pieces (not one big bar).  I often just want to eat 1/2 of an energy bar (or even 1/4), so having it already portioned is a huge benefit for me.  I also found it to be fairly filling and satisfying, even for the 80cal 1/2 portion.<br /><br />Nutrition facts: 160cal (15 from fat), 5mg sodium, 37g carbs, 3g fiber, 32g sugar, 2g protein.  Not the healthiest product (depending on what you are comparing to), but it is a decent source of fiber, all natural (no preservatives) and minimally processed (cold processed).  It does not contain any "fake fiber" that is becoming common in so many bars.  The label says that is is a raw food and is gluten-free (but the viewpoint for my review is in comparison to all products, not just those gluten free).<br /><br />I recommend this bar as a smart alternative to candy and as a nice treat (it is chocolate-covered, after all).

review/summary: I like generally how i feel better with this stuff.
review/text: Im skeptical on the whole acai berry weight loss issue. However, i do have to agree that it makes me have more energy and feel less bloated... thus lessening my belly area. I drink about 10 oz a day in place of coffee or a soda and then water the remainder of the day. My stomach always feels smaller and like i said, no bloat going on when i drink this stuff. And im normally a very bloated person lol. So, Granted it has a bit higher calories.. i do like it, and recommend it for the overall feeling i get. Plus if you are going to have a caloric drink.. why not drink one that is healthy for you... and has a few good side effects.

review/summary: Green stuff floating in every bottle!!!  Yuck!
review/text: I absolutely ADORE the Original Flavor of Zola Acai Drinks and I've had a standing subscription order for a couple of years - for both the smaller, 12 oz bottles and the larger 32 oz size.  But the last three months of the 32 oz size have been UNDRINKABLE!  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this problem, but I am so disappointed because it's always been top-quality before these last 3 shipments.<br /><br />Each of the 8 32-oz size bottles have had thick green stuff floating around in it...it's almost a neon green color, and it is a consistency kind of like algae. Weirdly enough, the 12-oz bottles in my order have been fine. The first time my order was like that, I shrugged it off and thought that maybe I had let 1-2 bottles sit outside in my car in the Florida summer heat, but every single bottle had green junk floating all through it, and I know that I did not even take 6-7 bottles in my car or any other place where it could have gotten contaminated.<br /><br />The second month/order it happened, I saved the receipt, took photos of the green stuff, and tried to contact the seller and Amazon. Unfortunately they do not accept returns! At the time I was so busy I forgot to cancel my standing order of the 32 oz bottles and so they shipped a third month of the 32-oz bottles and they too had the same problem. Each month I have also received my standing order of 2 boxes of 12-oz drinks and they have been FINE - no green gunk. But I've been stuck having to pour out each of the 32-oz bottles, and at a cost of close to $50 each time, that has been a HUGE waste of $$ for me.<br /><br />I don't know whether the problem has been only with bottles shipped from my seller (?) or if it is affecting everyone's orders. I have noticed that some other distributors online do accept returns, but I am not willing to risk going through this again with someone different. Maybe some purchasers actually drink the tall bottles with the green gunk, and maybe it wouldn't harm me or my kids, but it makes me queasy to see that in a glass when I pour a drink...and it tastes a little funky - so down the drain they go. In the 2-3 years I've been buying Zola drinks, I've never had this problem, so maybe it's temporary or maybe there's a logical explanation that I'm just not aware of. Good luck if you try the tall bottles.

review/text: When you wrap in the free shipping, this is the least expensive acai juice I have found on the Web. Not to say cheaper is always better, but in this case, it is. The juice is rich and flavourful, and has all the salutary effects of the more expensive offerings. I tried Wal-Mart's acai but it was watery and did not seem to give the benefits this juice does. Highly recommend.

review/summary: love the benefits, taste is just ok
review/text: Zola sells several varieties of exotic fruits, and a few are delicious, as well as healthy.  This is the first acai juice I've ever tried, so I don't have anything to compare it with.  This juice is  slightly thick and an interesting purple color. It does contain a bit of added sugar, but is not overly sweet.  The problem I had with this juice was an aftertaste that I can only describe as a bit like plastic, it was a bit gritty, and it just didn't have a lot of pure fruit flavor, in my opinion.  But the benefits are there, omega fatty acids 3,6 and 9, and antioxidants.  It is sustainably harvested and shelf stable until opened.  Even though I'm not in love with this juice, it's great for supplementing your diet when you don't have time to eat well, and I also found I like the taste better when mixed with a small amount of orange juice.

review/summary: Good Acai Juice
review/text: In Hawaii, Acai has been popular for some time now.  I am accustomed to getting an acai bowl for a quick breakfast or lunch.  The berry tends to have a bit of a grainy quality to it when pulverized into a pulp or juice.  The Zola brand juice is very smooth.  I was surprised when there was not a grainy mouth feel at the end.  Well Done Zola!  I like that they did not over sweeten the juice.  I also like the fact that there are fatty acids along with some protein naturally occurring in the acai fruit.  The only thing that threw me off was the fact that they added guarana into this juice blend.  I am a nursing mom and the last thing I was to pass to my already rambunctious 12 month old is a mild stimulant!  As a consumer I should have read the package before downing half of it, I know better than that.

review/text: The Juice doesn't taste good to me. I think my expectations were way too high. I recently purchased a premium acai juice that cost 100$ for four bottles that tasted amazing. I'm not sure if antioxidants are the same as getting actual vitamins? It is only 93% juice and It tastes more like cane sugar. I got a cold shortly after drinking this product. Not sure if it was related to drinking the juice.

review/text: I ordered a case of 6, first try of this brand.  Starbuck's carmel sauce is $4.95 in their store, so I am looking for cheaper option that is at least as good as their product.  While I don't have regrets, the sauce is good and I will use it all, I will be looking for a better product for my next purchase.<br /><br />Side by side comparison with the Starbucks sauce, the torani is not as thick, not as rich or buttery.  Looking at the labels, the ingredients are almost identical between the two products, but the starbucks mix had butter as a much greater portion of the mix, and torani included high fructose corn syrup as a prevalent component.<br /><br />Note: not sure why its labeled with Mocha, there isn't any cocoa as part of the product.

review/text: As said in a previous review, the Torani Caramel sauce is very rich and thick. Though it adds quite a lot of flavor to any coffee drink.<br /><br />I like to add it to my milk for lattes before I whip it up with an Aerolatte milk frother. It makes for some delicious caramel flavored frothed milk that goes great with any cappuccino or latte.<br /><br />The only drawback is that one bottle doesn't last very long due to the thick and rich quality of the sauce; though there is no compromise to this without reducing the quality of what caramel sauce is supposed to taste like.

After adding some thyme to a huge pot of chili without first checking it, I ended up with numerous dangerous sticks(branches)  that did not soften during cooking and, in my opinion, offer a choking hazard for children.  My entire bottle of thyme is now in the rubbish bin, and this vendor is off my list of people I buy from.  This is a very inferior product using a low price and the description of 'fancy' to entice buyers.  resist the temptation. Or buy it and check every single teaspoon of thyme you use.

review/text: I ordered these for my mom as a birthday present as she loves macarons. I was a bit late ordering so I was afraid they wouldn't get to her in time but they actually ended up arriving a couple days early. She really enjoyed all the different flavors and didn't even notice that they were gluten free! I'm glad I made the right choice!

We do not recommend it for high gluten allergen person". Since most products are made in a kitchen, I think they are trying to say that  no containing gluten ingredients are used but I am not sure.

review/summary: THE best mint creme cookie out there!
review/text: I've been eating these for years (40...?!) since they were Salerno Mint Cremes. I've tried many others, but nothing quite comes close to these -- especially when kept in the refrigerator. Apparently Rippin Good bought these from Salerno, as they are exactly the same as the Salerno version, even the box is almost identical. If you remember and loved Salerno Mint Cremes, these are what you want. Except for a few places in Wisconsin, they seem to only be available at Amazon. Thanks to Rippin Good (and other companies) for offering them here!<br /><br />This particular item is six 10-ounce boxes, and each box has 22 cookies.<br /><br />Note, when sold by Amazon, this item typically sells for less than $24.00, and is sometimes on sale for around $15.

review/summary: Lover of mint cookies and these are very good
review/text: While I have had many a mint cookie, these are way up on my list.  Not quite the top, but in the top 5 for sure.  I grew up in Wisconson and my Dad loves these (his favs. for sure), so we had them often.  You could buy them right off the grocery store shelves then, but I live in Nebraska now and couldn't find them anywhere but here.  If you have had them before, these are the real deal, just like what you bought from the stores or the Rippon outlet.  If you haven't had them, you should try them, they are a pattie cookie, so they are a bit different than your run of the mill girl scout cookie (not that GS mints are bad, but there are many better) or the like.  I highly recommend freezing them and eating them cold, it is really the only way a mint cookie should be served, IMHO.

I also liked that it's unsmoked - I was reading that some of the rumors/small studies that show mate might be mildly carcinogenic were done on smoked mate, which caused me to look for unsmoked and find this.  It doesn't taste the same as smoked, understandably, but it tastes good.

review/text: I like ginger snaps a lot, especially with tea.  Recently someone gave me some of these as a gift and I loved them.  So, happy to see them here on Amazon and especially a money-saving "Subscribe & Save" product.  As the other reviewers here indicate, they are thin, crispy and delicious.  These are not as hard as the more common "American" style ginger snaps and a bit more refined as far as flavor.  I like both, but these make a nice change of pace.
