review/summary: BEWARE: terrible flavor of usually good product line
review/text: It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.  Had to flush it.

review/summary: Check the ingredients
review/text: My dog is finally on to me. She's long given up PB on her pills, and has learned to spit out her pills that are wrapped in nitrite free deli meat, causing me to waste quite a bit before she gets it down.<br /><br />Looking for a cheaper alternative, these seem great, but the ingredients are not conducive for optimal health, especially a dog in our situation that has cancer.<br /><br />wheat flour, corn syrup, wheat gluten, vegetable oil should not be on the consumption list for a sick dog, let alone one for cancer. Sadly, my search goes on.<br /><br />Chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, natural flavors, dried corn syrup, corn flour, wheat gluten, chicken liver meal, vegetable oil, lecithin, brewer's dried yeast, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), methylcellulose, ascorbic acid (source of vitamin C), mixed tocopherols, vitamin E supplement.

review/summary: OK product but unnecessary...
review/text: Giving pills on a daily basis at an animal shelter, I have found that these provide no advantage over either breaking up the pill and mixing it in with canned food, or pushing the pill into a chunk of meat (in chunky canned food).  Some crafty dogs eat the pill pocket away from the pill and leave the pill untouched.  I suggest mixing pills in with something with a strong odor and flavor.  One trick is to push the pill into a bit of hotdog--no dog can resist that.

I wrap dog food around the Greenies and he eats everything.  If he's not eating and I try to put the Greenie into his mouth he spits it out as soon as he tastes the medicine.  If he's not eating very much he pushes the Greenie to the side.

review/summary: Complete failure with my dog
review/text: My dachshund recently needed to start taking pills three times a day. He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog.

review/summary: A lifesaver for a pet owner whose pet spits out its pills!
review/text: My 1-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy, was recently diagnosed with a skin infection and allergies, so the vet prescribed an antibiotic and an allergy med twice a day.  At first, I thought it was going okay with my hiding the pills in a piece of banana or cheese...but then, I started finding pills all over the place...she'd been appearing to eat the food while in front of me and then going elsewhere to spit out the pills!<br /><br />I was seeing my money go down the drain as these antibiotics and allergy meds went anywhere (including staining my carpet!) but IN HER TUMMY!  Finally, a friend who has a cat suggested pill pockets, so I ordered a small packet of these beef flavored ones to see if they would work.<br /><br />WELL!  She not only takes her meds now, but she BEGS for them as soon as she sees me open the package of pill pockets!  I am FINALLY seeing her skin clear up because the pills are FINALLY getting into her system...today I gave her a bath and her skin is clear!<br /><br />My only issue with the pill pockets (the ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars vs. 5) is that they are very soft and mooshy...I guess this is necessary so that you can mold the pill pocket around the pill, regardless of its shape or size...but I find it a little yucky.  A few months ago, I may also have complained about the VERY strong smoky smell (like beef jerky), but I've gotten used to that via some treats Missy that loves.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering these again...in a larger quantity!

review/summary: Perfect (but PRICEY) Pill Pockets
review/text: For those picky dogs that don't want to take pills, this is the solution. I tried to hide my dog's pills in peanut butter, cheese, and cold cuts, none of which worked. I purchased both the roasted duck, which is for allergies, and chicken flavored pockets and tried out both of the sizes (pockets for tablets and capsules) as well. My dog much preferred the chicken flavor. I preferred the pill pockets in the capsule size. This is because these pockets are larger. Even though the tablet sized pockets are large enough for any tablet, the capsule size allow me to get twice as many pill pockets for my money. I split them in two and can still fit a tablet inside each half*... just a TIP for those wanting to save a bit of $

review/summary: It does the job
review/text: Since my dog is a chewer rather than a chomper, it has always been difficult to give her pills.  I had tried hiding the pills (crushed or whole) in various foods or dog treats, but she'd always sniff it out and/or bite into it and then refuse to eat it.  Pill Pockets has an oily texture that she can just gulp right down.  I find one capsule-size Pill Pocket to be way too big for 1 capsule, so I just mash it down and mold it separately over the 3 pills that she has to take.

By the fourth day they won't eat anything with the pills in them....until Greenies came into our house! Never again will we have to worry about fighting with our dogs over taking their meds!!

review/text: It's really tough to give my dog his pills. He seems to know when there is a pill inside a lump of dog food. He'll enevitably eat the treat but leave or spit up the pill. Well, now this doesn't happen. These treats... Pill pouches have a compartment inside you can stick the pill in, and squeeze the pouch shut and voila! The dog has a little sealed pouch of treat to eat. The large size can be cut in half for smaller dogs like our paps.<br /><br />If you have to give pills to your dogs and they are no longer fooled by the lump of peanut butter or the hotdog... Try these... They work great especially if you have to give dogs pills frequently.

review/text: I have always loved these for giving pills to my dogs.  My Border Collie mix takes 4 pills a day, and this has been the only thing he will swallow with pills in it.  He's smart enough to chomp on whatever else I try and then spit the pill back out.  These, however, work great.  I wish I had read the product description closer, my fault.  This is only the 25 count.  I can get 30 for only a couple dollars more locally, so will probably just do that in the future.  Shipping was fast and my dog loves them, so its still a win.  Highly recommend them, as my dog sometimes has a sensitive stomach to treats and certain people foods.  He can take the beef or chicken ones, as well.

review/summary: This *may* give your dog diarrhea, but they do their job.
review/text: My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.  Making the poopy that loose makes me think it can't be too healthy?

review/summary: Great for Dogs on Hypoallergenic Diets
review/text: I have been extremely satisfied with the Greenies Pill Pockets Roasted Duck and Pea Formula. To clarify, this is the same as "Allergy Formula" (it's written on front of the package), although on amazon it is listed as a separate product.<br /><br />My dog is on a novel protein source diet and cannot eat the beef or chicken Pill Pockets, although he must take daily medications.  Getting him to take his daily medications was a huge hassle until I found out about these.<br /><br />I do agree with a previous reviewer about the smell and color of these duck/pea Pill Pockets.  The smell is unfortunate, to say the least, and the color is interesting-looking.  If my dog did not have allergic issues, I would definitely give him the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets instead.<br /><br />However, comparing the two products, I believe one reason the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets have a certain odd color is due to lack of added color. In other words, they have a more natural color. In the beef Pill Pockets, "caramel color" is one of the ingredients, but it is not in the Allergy Formula.  In case, anyone is interested, these are the ingredients in the Roasted Duck and Pea Allergy Formula: duck, glycerin, dried peas, natural flavors, vegetable oil, water, salt, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), xanthan gum, citric acid, preserved with mixed tocopherals (a source of Vitamin E).<br /><br />My dog likes the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets just as well as the regular Pill Pockets, so the offensive smell does not seem to affect him at all.<br /><br />Finally, I saw in an earlier review where someone said these were smaller than the normal "capsule" size.  I have NOT found this to be true. I have ordered several times and every time, the capsule size is the same as for the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets.  This means that usually you can break one in two, so they go twice as far.  The texture of these Pill Pockets is just as malleable as the normal ones and it's quite easy to hide a pill in them.  All in all, I highly recommend if your dog has allergy issues and can't take the normal ones.

review/text: I got these because my local store was out of the capsule size in beef flavor.  I discovered that they work just as well for big capsules, if you use your fingers to press the treat around them.  My dog is very picky and yet he gets the capsule wrapped in this pocket without a problem.  This suits me fine, since the tablet pockets are cheaper.<br /><br />I took one star off because the ingredients are questionable, lots of chemicals, color, corn syrup and other crap.  If my dog were not that old that his comfort is more important to me than his health, I honestly wouldn't go near them.<br /><br />Also, he will not touch the duck flavor, though, but I reviewed this flavor separately.

review/summary: Be careful, made 1 of my dogs very ill
review/text: I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google "pill pockets diarrhea", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.

My boy has to take pills twice a day probably forever; so far so good on pill pockets - it's been over a year and he hasn't figured it out.  He considers it a treat and LOVES them.  They are soft so I can form the pocket around the pill.  To make them last a bit longer, I split it in half since his pills aren't very big.

review/summary: Much easier - for all of us
review/text: The dogs are getting a bit older, and on fairly regular meds.  Was using peanut butter on bread to hide them, as even the chewables they weren't interested in chewing, and wrestling them to get the pills down just makes it an unpleasant experience.  With Pill Pockets they actually COME for their meds when they hear me open the bag!

review/summary: Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs
review/text: Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds.

review/text: We have tried all the various flavors of Pill Pockets for our dogs. One has a twice a day pill she takes and the other once a day. Chicken and Beef work ok most times but the dogs have never not wanted to take their pill when we use this Duck flavor.<br /><br />The consistency is excellent for being able to wrap around a small pill or to break apart and use only half at a time if needed. The smell is just enough to help hide the scent of the pills. The dogs just love it when I open up the pouch and come running to take their pills.

review/text: Our cat doesn't like the feline Pill Pockets so much, but he loves these canine beef ones. (Our vet said it was fine to give him doggie PPs.) And, the pieces are big, so I can use only half a Pill Pocket each day for his pills--saves me money. (I take the half Pill Pocket and split it in half, as he takes two pills a day.) Anyone who has ever had to "pill" a cat knows what a relief it is to just give a treat and the pilling is done. Great product.

review/summary: These are large, the cat size is smaller and has more
review/text: I love these, we have a cat that is impossible to administer pills to, but she goes stark freaking INSANE for these pill pockets. We used the feline size, which has more pockets in it than the dog size. However at one point she had to take a couple of pills at the same time and I could not fit all the pills into the cat-size pocket, so I bought the dog size. All kitty knew was hey, I'm getting a BIGGER treat than normal!<br /><br />If you have a dog that takes micro doses of tablets or just one small tablet, get the cat size and they'll go much farther.<br /><br />I purchased the chicken dog pockets for my cat and she loved them. That seems to be the flavor most of my cats like.

review/summary: Used for heartworm pill ~
review/text: My Maltese pup was given a chewable heartworm combo pill to use and the first time I offered it to him, he all but ran away.  Lucky me, I was prepared because I had already purchased these pill pockets.  I carefully slipped the heartworm pill into one and pinched it closed, then gave him the good boy talk.  He took the pill pocket and thoroughly enjoyed eating it, including the insert.  Problem solved.<br /><br />Whoever came up with this idea has my thanks.  These would have saved me a lot of trouble in the past with other dogs.  I just hope Puka doesn't catch on as he gets older.  I'm thinking about giving him a pinch of one every now and then to reinforce it being a treat instead of medicine.  They are very soft and sticky and apparently very tasty.

Of course the dogs could care less but they broke apart easliy as if all the mushy flexibility had leaked out and made them wet. So in trying to close the end over this giant capsule..., even in the large size, made pieces break off and made this mom a mess. were not expired or anything o/w good shipping and communication.

review/summary: Warning: using this product may have unintended side effects
review/text: This is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing part is these pill pockets are pretty much perfect.  They take a pill very nicely, cover it, and make it wonderfully desirable for the dog to eat the pills.  "Serve with food because it's so bitter your dog will hate you forever" is not a match for these little suckers.  Little dog loves these, and would happily snarf down the entire packet if she could.  As for the curse... well, you can no longer safely move pill containers anywhere.  With a keen ear and a taste for beef pill pockets, your dog will hear you shift your containers even one nanometer and come running, expecting you to give it a treat.  My Dad has to take pills twice daily... you can see why this is an issue.<br /><br />Sealed air tight for freshness.  Approximately 30 to a bag.  Suitable for small pills.  Tasty, yet functional.  A fantastic delivery system for an otherwise annoying problem.  5 stars.

review/summary: Worked perfectly
review/text: I have great animals that are usually willing to do whatever I ask of them.  Unfortunately my male dog gets anal gland infections once or twice a year.  I have tried many ways of administering his antibiotics from coating with peanut butter/cream cheese or wrapping in slices of cheese.  All of these methods work for the first few days but over time he decides the treat isn't worth while so I end up forcing the pill down his throat and giving a treat afterwards as a reward for being tolerant.  Eventually he starts refusing his treat and looks at me like I'm abusing him, lol.  So this time I decided to try Greenies pill pockets.  I chose the capsule size since they are supposed to be larger and he needed to take three pills at a time.  I also chose the duck and pea formula to provide a unique flavor.  Each night he watched me place the antibiotics in the pocket and form a nice ball then eagerly took his treat.  They apparently smell very appealing as my female dog also begged for them and we have to store them in a cabinet because the cat tried to help himself by chewing on the bag.  By the end of the first week, all three animals would line up in the kitchen at the end of the night waiting for their treat!  They did leave a strong smelling oily residue on my fingers but washed off quickly and easily with just a little water and friction.  Purchased through Amazon with Prime shipping.  Arrive quickly in perfect condition.

review/text: I bought these at the vet's office when I needed to give my dogs pills.  They said dogs really love the beef flavor and they were right!  The pills and pill pocket were gone before I knew it!  I still buy the pill pockets as treats even though they don't need medicine because they really love them.  Since they're used to getting them, they won't realize there's a pill in there if/when the time comes that they have to take some medicine.  Highly recommended in beef flavor or peanut butter.

review/summary: Helpful to get pickey eaters to take their medication.
review/text: My one doxie won't eat either the chicken or beef flavored pill pockets, but he will eat the "Duck and Pea" flavor; this is also the formula to buy if your dog has allergies.  The product smells quite strong when you first open the pouch; I suspect the peas give it that distinct odor. I don't need to use the entire pocket per pill, so I break a section off of the capsule just large enough to encapsulate the size pill I need to administer, forming the soft, pliable substance around it.  It is most economical to buy the capsule size, so I do so, but they also come in a smaller, pill size shape.<br /><br />I haven't purchased the pill pockets for my cats yet and don't know how they would be received, but this product has helped me give my dogs medication.  Even when the pill is supposedly chewable, and "liver-flavored," my dogs will generally not take their medication willingly unless I disguise it first.  These can make your life with your pet easier. Shop around for the best price as these can be a bit expensive if you have to use them frequently.

review/summary: Wonderful as always; my dog adores these!
review/text: Although these don't have the most pleasant scent, their effectiveness render's my nose's experience immaterial. These Greenies never fail to fulfill their purpose; once thoroughly surrounded by the pill pocket, any pill, capsule, or necessity I'd otherwise have to battle to shove down my dog's throat gets gobbled up. Actually, swallowed without chewing is more accurate. My dog has become increasingly sensitive with age, and she has shown signs of mild to severe allergies, digestive, dermatological and other manifestations. Not once has she experienced any hint of an adverse reaction to these. Without hesitation, I strongly recommend this product and flavor. These are a staple in our house, and I will continue to purchase these pill pockets in the pea and duck formula monthly.

review/summary: Probably A Good Product, Just Not For Sweet Girl!
review/text: When I got these in the mail last Saturday and opened them up, put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of, offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death!  We have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese, so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and I were both excited.  Then that afternoon for her last dose for the day, same performance.  We thought we had found the answer to our prayers as she has a disease that can't be cured if she doesn't take this medication until it's all gone.  So this was a Godsend!<br /><br />But, the very next morning, before she had anything else to eat, my wife tried to give her a pill using a Pocket and she turned her nose up at it and walked away!!  She tried several times with varying amounts of the pocket cut off to make it smaller for her and easier to gulp down.  Still no go.  So we waited a couple of hours, without feeding her anything at all, tried again, same thing.<br /><br />So I saw a bag of Pockets in Walmart and the only thing they had besides Beef was Duck so I tried that.  Same thing.  Wouldn't even eat one so we're back to looking for something else that might work.  If your dog will eat them they are GREAT!!

review/summary: These are indeed Life Savers
review/text: If you've ever tried to get your dog to swallow pills, you know how wonderful these are.  We have four dogs (three Corgis and a mixed breed), and all like them, and these have been successful with them all.<br /><br />Our mixed breed dog was about 13, and her disease was terminal, and we weren't ready to lose her (not that anyone ever is).  We had medicines that would make her comfortable in her final stages, but the problem was getting her to take them...we tried all sorts of things: peanut butter, apple sauce, fruit, meat--all had a certain ability to disguise the taste, but she got wise to them pretty quickly.<br /><br />But the Greenies Pill Pockets ALWAYS worked.  We were able to extend her life, with comfort, for a couple of months longer, and for that I'll always be grateful.<br /><br />A NOTE: The Greenies come in several flavors (chicken, beef, duck & peas), sizes, and also flavors for cats.  If you need to be more economical, you can also "shave" them down by squeezing off a little of them (depending on the strength of the pill they're taking).

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: We have had a number of cats with medical problems and tried any number of ways to get pills into them.  Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as "treats" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of "doses", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven't seen a cat yet that would't take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter.

review/text: First off, I have found that buying these treats on Amazon is cheaper than purchasing them at PetSmart. I buy the capsule version of the Pill Pockets versus the tablet version because the bags are larger (it holds more ounces) and the cost difference is almost nothing. I then break that one capsule up into many pieces because they are soft & malleable. I am able to get that one bag to last me for many servings. I only use it to wrap up my dog's Prozac pill.  He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill. For those types of pills, I just crush them up and stir them in some wet food for him.

review/summary: it works!
review/text: we tried alot of things to hide pills in.  our dog would maybe fall for it once or twice, but then would spit out the pills and eat the cheese, peanut butter, hot dog, etc. that it was wrapped in.  But then we found pill pockets and he likes them enough to eat them and the pill inside.  the best thing is how easy it is to form them around different pills, and how you can only use pieces of one pill pocket on smaller pills to make them stretch farther.

review/text: These pill pockets are the easiest way to get a dog to take its meds.  My dog scarfs them down no problem.  They can be kind of pricey, especially if you have a dog that requires daily medication, as they only come 30 in a pack and retail for $7.99 (cheaper on amazon of course!).  I would definitely recommend them if you have a dog that has trouble taking his pills.

review/summary: The dogs LOVE these!
review/text: Like most dogs I have met, our dogs HATE getting their meds. These things take the headache out of giving medication to dogs.  The dogs get so excited for these pill pockets, and they are easy to use.  The pockets are very soft, so if you live in a hot and humid place, they will turn into a pile of mush.  However, you can easily just take a piece of mush and wrap it around the pill.  The dogs don't care if it is shaped properly or not.  Our dogs just swallow it hole and sit there waiting for another one.

However, I have a dog with a major stomach problem that the vet is narrowing down to a food allergy - to stop her pain I can definately withstand the brief smell. All three of my dogs think they are treats and actually beg for them, so does one of my cats lol.<br />Anyhow the price of these keep skyrocketing in the sotres and at my vet,I am glad to find them on here at a better price considering how often we go through them!!!!!

review/summary: For the price and taste, one of the better t-disc choices out there
review/text: I normally buy my t-discs at Bed, Bath & Beyond using their $5 off coupon, but since the price of this on Amazon (using Subscribe and Save) worked out to about the same (approx. $5.35 a box), I gave it a go.  I really enjoy flavored coffees and I think this one is good.  It's a full cup of coffee, and although it's not as dark and rich as I prefer, it's not too watered down like some of the other mild and medium-bodied t-discs out there. Also, there doesn't seem to be any chemically aftertaste I found with some of the other flavored coffees.  All in all, I'd purchase again, but only for the same discounted price.

The company sent me the frito lay count variety pack, which i didnt ask for and which it only cost $14.57, now even though that is only a $1.03 difference, the reason for me ordering this particular package was because it has 7 different kinds of chips in it. Now the one the company sent me only has 5 different kinds. I was very upset about this. I was so upset that i didnt even try to return the chips back because i knew that would be an even longer process. I dont think ill be buying these chips again.

review/summary: Yummy and Low Cal!
review/text: Have been looking for a long time for a low cal yet delicious ice cream and discovered Artic Zero.  I love it.  If I feel compelled to eat a whole pint it's only 150 calories. My favorite flavors are vanilla maple, chocolate peanut butter, and pumpkin.  The only flavor that I wouldn't order again is strawberry  banana. It tastes so artificial and has a unappetizing aftertaste. I also bought the 40 pints and this reduces the price to almost half.  My family also likes this Ice cream.  It is also loaded with protein and a special sweet flavoring developed by this company who produces the ice cream.  I am diabetic and never had a significant increase in my blood sugar from this sweet flavoring, but each diabetic is different so check blood sugar to see how the Arctic Zero effects you. I highly recommend giving this a try.  Remember also that ice cream is frozen solid and tastes much better defrosted to a pliable consistency about 20 to 35 minutes.  Arctic Zero can go from a firm texture or soft serve depending on time defrosted. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Just keep in mind that you are not eating the premium ice creams made for supermarkets and franchise ice cream shops.  This ice cream makes a delicious substitute for little calories.

review/summary: Send That Skinny Cow To The Slaughter House!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:21 Mins<br /><br /></span>After seeing this product online and checking out so many positive reviews about it, I was eager to try it myself. But more than hesitant to spend $37 to $60+ bucks in order to do so. Luckily, Arctic Zero is carried in stores not too far from me. I had to drive about 30miles to the neighboring town in order to get it, but it was well worth the trip!<br /><br />I bought a pint each of chocolate, chocolate peanut butter, mint chocolate cookie, coffee, and vanilla maple. Packed them in the iced cooler I brought with me and headed back home. Once back I sampled each of the flavors. The first one I tried was the peanut butter chocolate. Tasted pretty good, but I didn't detect a whole lot of peanut flavor going on. It also had a fairly icy consistency. After tha, I tried the chocolate and was thoroughly impressed! Maybe it was because the chocolate pint wasn't as steeped in the ice as the other had been in my cooler, but this time the texture was creamy like any other ice cream. And it had a great chocolate flavor. I honestly could have eaten the whole thing right then, but wanted to see what the others were like, so went on to mint chocolate. This too had a fairly subtle flavor as far as the mint went, which I guess some might appreciate. But the texture was just as creamy as the chocolate had been. The coffee was icy and my least favorite flavor. But I'm historically not a coffee person so it may just be a personal preference. Maple vanilla wasn't bad either, but again, I could take it or leave it. So after tasting them all, I wanted to find out if the icy consistency of some of them was a product trait or was just letting it soften a bit the key to creaminess heaven. So I let the coffee sit out for a couple of minutes, and sure enough it was as creamy as the chocolate had been.<br />I'd say depending on your taste preferences any of them would be completely satisfying as replacements for their fattening counter parts....I would serve this to anyone and dare them to know the difference from reg. ice cream. And the fact that the whole pint has the same 150 cal. as those teeny tiny skinny cow cups, not to mention less sugar(it actually has less in the whole pint than skinny cow does in it's little cup) and zero fat, I'm definitely a convert.<br />I also really like the fact that it has some health benefits too, with the added protein and fiber. And that while I will probably try to eat this sparingly as it's pretty expensive, if I ever want to pig out, I can eat the whole thing guilt free! Which is a new concept when it comes to ice cream. I actually had to keep reminding myself while I was sampling them; "It's okay!" LOL!<br /><br />Edit; If your Arctic Zero hardens up in the freezer, I found you can get it back to a creaminess state by just popping it in the microwave for about 10-15sec depending on how hard it is to start with. That amount of time didn't cause it to melt on me just go from hard and icy back to smooth and spoon-able while remaining cold.

It is a good ice cream substitute for those who want a good dessert with only 150 calories.<br /><br />When we received this 40 pack, my kids tried it and wouldn't finish the container. That meant that the rest was for me!<br /><br />It isn't H&auml;agen-Dazs. I've since learned if you set it out to thaw first, it they taste much better and are easier to eat.

review/summary: ARCTIC ZERO IS THE BEST
review/text: I've been using this product for several months.  I had stomach surgery and was told to take a lot of protein shakes, instead, I opted for Arctic Zero!  Delicious, creamy, and completely non-diet tasting, every single flavor that I have tried has been INCREDIBLE!!!  The vanilla is warm tasting, and just  THE BEST!!! The chocolate decadent and creamy.  I never that cookies and cream with only 150 calories per pint could taste good, but is was SUPERB!!! You would never know that the chocolate peanutbutter was fat free, and, surprisingly, I found myself wanting the Strawberry Banana (which was soooo DELICIOUS -  usually HATE anything Banana-flavored!)  I LOVED the coffee as it was the perfect intensity - not too strong, not weak at at!)To make things even better, the owners of Arctic Zero have PHENOMENAL customer support.  They email, like immediately almost, and are always ready to try to help solve any problems (I don't have problems with the products, just like questions as to when the product will be avaliable.  I was worried that ordering frozen stuff online would be risky, but so far Arctic Zero has done a PERFECT job.  If you buy this product, you won't regret it!  It is really the best dessert in the WORLD!  I am gluten sensitive and this does not bother me at all.  It also has none of the strange synthetic sweeters like aspertame that will eventually end up harming you!<br />  In every way, Arctic Zero is just AWESOME!!!

review/summary: Not Quite What I Expected
review/text: These raisins were not really what I expected or wanted in taste. They tasted a bit off and too sweet for my liking. I guess I will be only buying organic foods from Klein's Naturals as I find the organic foods taste better and are less likely to have things like preservatives in them. I normally do buy organic but I decided to make this one exception and try these raisins out. I won't be buying these again. I will stick to their organic raw cashews and craisins.

review/summary: Pork gelatin!!!!!
review/text: I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. DHA from fish oil is fine, but the lady that answered my phone told me that all DHA Gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. Do infants need gelatin at this age?

review/summary: Why do their organic foods contain gelatin???
review/text: I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.

review/summary: Nope
review/text: My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. So, when I couldn't find the jars at the store I was at, I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. They are not. She doesn't like these. Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. Looking for more mac n cheese jars.
