review/summary: Put down those Planters and grab a bag of this!
review/text: I was introduced to this line of snacks when I bought a bag of Valdosta Pecans a couple years back.  For some time, I didn't realize they offered other nuts.  Valdosta is still my favorite today but they are all delicious! Darn you Amazon for making it easier to fuel my addiction!<br /><br />The ingredients are all high quality...nothing unnatural, and nothing listed that the lay public wouldn't understand.  Don't be deterred by the strange sounding combinations. They create a gourmet tasting symphony in your mouth, but do not detract from the natural flavor of the nuts.<br /><br />The only downside is that as always the case with nuts, if you're dieting, portion control is necessary since they are naturally high in calories.  But at least its healthy calories, right?

review/summary: Good, But None Measure Up to the Valdosta!
review/text: I fell in love with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTR99I">Sahale Snacks Valdosta Blend, 5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (or any of the various other package size and number options, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMX12I">Sahale Snacks, Valdosta Blend, 2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMX13C">Sahale Snacks, Nut Blend, Valdosta Pecans, 4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>, or even the "economy sized": <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029Y2SKK">Sahale Snacks, Valdosta Blend, 15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a>!), and so thought the other Sahale nut snack flavors were worth a try. They are all pretty darn good, really. Yet, while all do have varying degrees of the the chewy, crunchy, sweet, spicy blend of textures and flavors I appreciate so much in the Valdosta mix, none qute measures up, for my money.<br /><br />The Sing Buri Cashews seem to be the most spicy in their eastern kind of way. The Soledad Almonds are pretty good, but slightly brittle or dry (while being stickier than others, which is fine taste-wise, but which can be messy), or *something* that I'm not quite totally crazy about. The Cashews with Pomegranate and Vanilla are a bit sweeter of a treat than the others which have more savory and/or spicy notes. (Sorry, I'm far closer to gourmand than gourmet, so I don't have the most sophisticated taste nor the specific foodie terminology to go with it!)<br /><br />As they say, "There's no accounting for taste," and so I don't know if anyone else would agree with my pooely proffered preferences here. I just know that I don't see any reason to buy any of the other varieties when I always seem to be comparing them to the Valdosta and finding them wanting.

They used to buy it years ago in California but moving to MO. they lost track of saag`s.

review/summary: Really great tea!!!
review/text: I first discovered Bentley's tea by purchasing an assortment of tea like this in order to have a nice container.  What I was surprised by was how great the teas are.  The teas (except for the green tea) are black-tea based and all but the English Breakfast are flavored (none are herbal like a previous review implied). The black tea base is the smoothest black tea I've ever encountered.  It really has an outstanding flavor.  The flavored versions seem to use this tea base and add a flavor above it.  The flavor isn't as strong as in many teas.  However, given how good the black tea that Bentley's uses tastes, it shouldn't be.<br /><br />By ordering this off Amazon, I'm not paying any more than tea costs in the supermarket on sale, and getting far better tea.  Hope you enjoy this tea as much as I do!

review/text: I've had Bentley's teas before and enjoyed them very much.  I thought these tasted a bit stale.  I will use them for Sun tea and put double the amount I usually use to bring out the flavor.  The flavor is very light and as the tea bags are paper wrapped and not foil, the flavor inter-mingles with others in the tin.  I would not order these again.  Louise

review/summary: Flavors are good, if you like it all tasting the same...
review/text: The flavored teas are the reason I purchased this item. While the flavors in the peach and raspberry are some of the best I've had in black tea, the Earl Grey is only ok.<br />The problem is that the teabags are loose packed in the tin and the flavors all blend so that the English breakfast and even the Earl Grey do not taste like they are supposed to.  In my opinion it becomes rather yucky tasting.  Also, the teabags have rather a small fill, so they really are only suitable for a 6 oz teacup to be strong enough (for this reviewer) with a 3 minute steep.  That may sound nitpicky, but by comparison some teabags are sufficient for much larger cup sizes.

review/text: I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.  The peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the English Breakfast Tea made me a fan of that flavor where I never had been before.  I'll be watching for other tea collections from Bentley's.

review/text: I don't know why I haven't written a review before this. I have been drinking this tea about five years.  I first tasted it when my daughter gave me a tin for Christmas.  After I flew through that tin, I wanted more.  She told me that she got it from 5 Continents so that's where I purchased more.  After a few years, that chain closed in my area.  I tried supermarket teas but the taste was weak and had a paper taste.  These are full bodied.  I was thrilled to find my favorite tea on Amazon and at such a good price.  I love getting two tins at a time.  The tins are pretty.  I use them for a number of things.  One I use as a sewing box, another as a tool box, one for cosmetics,ect. My favorite flavor is the green tea followed by the raspberry. They also make excellent iced tea.  As much as I drink, I should subscribe and save.

review/summary: Great Tea - Great Price
review/text: My wife gave me a Bentley's Tea Collection for Xmas. It is the best tea I have ever used and the only flavored tea that I have ever liked to drink. This Bentley Classic Collection is a great buy. I have used one as a refill source as I empty my Tea Box. The other tin could also be a great gift for a tea drinker. I hardly ever put the coffee pot on anymore.<br /><br />Highly recommend the product and the price on Amazon is very, very good.

review/summary: VERY Gift-able, My Mom Loves It!
review/text: Bought this for my mom for her birthday, along with a book (Chicken Soup For The Tea Lover's Soul) and a tea cup and saucer. My mom loves a cup of tea either in the afternoon or after dinner, and she likes to have a selection. This set comes as two complete tins. My mom also hosts dinners frequently at her house, and this will look lovely as she offers a selection to her guests.<br />I actually ordered a membership for myself. I've received the first shipment--Amazon provides amazing fast shipping--with the next shipment following in six months. If you've prices tea bag tea at the grocery store, you know the prices have climbed for good quality teas. Yes, you can (and I have) get boxes of tea from the dollar store. Sometimes you get what you pay for.<br />Serious tea lovers will find this very impressive and giftable. The tins are also reusable.

It is nice to know which teas I prefer before ordering them (I really like the orange spice and peach so far!)<br /><br />These are very, very nice teas.  Highly recommended!  I think it's a great deal on tea, and you can currently order it to arrive every month, or every couple of months (or every 6 months!) and get 15% off.  Definitely a value!

review/summary: No keepsake, but great afternoon tea.
review/text: Don't plan to use the tin as a keepsake unless crimps and small scratches are not an issue for you!  But, for a pleasing presentation of select tea bags, it's perfect for the deck, patio, or other outdoor event.  Each of the teas has a distinctive, pleasant flavor, none of which are strong or bitter.  They make a great afternoon sipping tea, served either hot or iced, with light snacks, but won't pair well with heavier foods or a meal because of their mild flavor.

review/summary: Don't get these if you have a sweet tooth.
review/text: I tried the carob-cocoa flavor. These are not at all sweet, even with malted grains, honey and raisins in the ingredient list. They have the texture and appearance of very dense, nutty brownies, but not a lot of chocolate flavor, rather a kind of carob/raisin/grain taste. These are for active people who want a quick, calorie-dense (440 calories per bar) meal from a bar made with natural ingredients. They are NOT weight-loss bars.<br /><br />I like my coffee black and my iced tea with no sweeteners of any kind, so maybe that is why I like these bars. My wife won't drink those beverages without lots of sugar, and she HATES these bars. So, I'm guessing if you like sugar in your coffee, you should stay away from this product.

review/text: Got the idea to purchase these for a backpacking trip as a result of previous trips to Philmont. The bars were moist, but the carob is by no means chocolatey. The weight to nutrient ratio is ideal for backpacking, and in some cases can be used to replace a breakfast of lunch.

review/text: These bars gave me a stomache and indigestion. I am lactose intolerant. Nonfat milk is listed prominently as an ingredient on the package, but not on the website.  This is unfortunate, because, otherwise, I think that they have a good high-caloric-density backpacking product. As for taste, on the trail, everything tastes good.

review/summary: Healthy AND delish!!!
review/text: I think this Carob Cocoa flavor has edged out the Fruit and Nut version...it has a nice chocolatey taste but none of the sugary (or saccharine-ish) like taste of other "chocolate" granola and energy bars.  And like the rest of the Bear Valley bars, it is a complete protein and has an unbeatable dollars-per-calorie value.  I'm a very physically-active male with a high metabolism, yet I really CAN eat this bar as a meal replacement, it keeps me feeling full but never bloated or gassy (unlike many others) for a good 3-5 hours...that would normally require at least two ClifBars or at least 3 of a cheap grocery store granola bar.  Anyway, if you just need a little snack to tie you over for an hour or so, have just half of a bar at a time.<br /><br />I've also eaten 1/4 to 1/3 of these bars at a time just before a long run or during (about every 45 minutes) a long run, and with no ill effects stomach-wise.  That, in my opinion, is a good testament to its digestibility and quality, organic ingredients.<br /><br />The only TINY gripe I have about these bars is that it's damn near impossible to tear open the wrapper with your bare hands unless you take something sharp and slash a hole first...so I just use a pair of scissors, quick and easy.  But then again maybe that's a good thing, means you are assured of these things staying fresh for a long time without needing a bunch of artificial preservatives.

review/summary: Fantastic to use as a filling, delicious, breakfast (or other quick meal). Have water on hand
review/text: I bought these to be used essentially as breakfast. First off I find these delicious. They have almonds, raisins, sunflower seeds, and just enough of a cocoa taste. They are very dense and you will want to have a lot of water or other liquid available. They are also amazingly filling. Yes 440 calories (2 servings/ one par) so more of a meal replacement than a snack. But for breakfast a whole par gives you 16 grams of protein. Protein really helps get the mind/body going in the morning so they are excellent for that.<br /><br />But you are also getting 24 grams of sugar. A little high. But at least it isn't from corn syrup or even sugar as a separate ingredient. I do highly recommend these for meal replacement, especially breakfast. I have them 3 times a week for breakfast and feel really good and satisfied until lunch. This is usually 4.5 hours away for me. I think they would be excellent for backpacking and camping as well. Or other meals in the day. Tasty and satisfying, with good ingredients.

review/text: These are fantastic. It's true, they're not as sweet (or as low calorie) as many other meal/snack bars out there. But in my slow transition to a nutritional lifestyle that keeps unpronounceable ingredients to a minimum, I'm so glad to have these on hand. And they are FILLING! I keep them in my car with a small piece of tupperware so I can enjoy just half if I don't want to fill up, or just need a little something.

My wife said it made her tummy unhappy later, but her system generally has the same response to all onions.  So if you're OK with onions, you'll love the sweet onion confit.

review/text: I am so happy about my boxes of nerds ropes. They got here real quick, and in perfect condition. I was a little nervous that they would be stale, since sometimes at the stores they are very stale, and no so good. These are so fresh the best I've ever had, I'm so pleased with the quality of the product, and the price. I would and will recommend this seller to anyone. THANKS SO MUCH.

review/text: Besides the fact that it's good for you nutritionally, I like the fact that it tastes almost like 'white' pasta in texture. I never boil for as long as directed, they seem to be quite fragile.<br /><br />Smaller in size than I expected, but just right for in soups or chili!

review/text: I have this on my "subscribe and save" list because it is, hands-down, my favorite pasta ever!  I try to eat healthy but it just doesn't work unless it tastes good.  and this stuff tastes fabulous.  I'm old enough to remember trying the "new" whole wheat pasta and lordy, was it bad!  All brands have certainly gotten better at it, but this is tasty, healthy, even has flax seed in it!  The spirals hold up well to boiling and holds a sauce well.  I'd give it 17 stars if they were available.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've been buying Hogdson Mills products for many years, and I have yet to be disappointed.  The quality is excellent, as is the flavor.  If you're on a vegan diet, you should be eating whole grains, and of course organic helps.  This product combines both for a reasonable price.  There are less expensive whole-wheat organic products, but all that I've tried sacrifice quality.  I recommend Hodgson Mills products to those looking for whole-grain and/or organic products.

review/text: This pasta is truly one of the best organic whole wheat pastas out there. It does not taste as heavy or fibery as the other brands... it comes as close to "white" pasta as you can get. I second the other reviewer who warns not to overcook it, as it easily falls apart.

review/summary: Pasta Heaven!
review/text: Oh pasta, how I love thee in all your wonderful forms! But the toothy wonderful texture of bucatini and perciatelli is the most sublime of them all! This pasta is the opposite of Angel Hair pasta - it's a chewier, thicker version of Spaghetti and is wonderful with all kinds of strong sauces. We love Perciatelli with a garlic, chili, olive oil sauce with spicy Italian sausage or even sauteed boconcini. De Cecco brand pasta is wonderful quality too and very reasonably priced.

review/text: Delicious!  I can't say enough good things about this pasta.  I just love the texture.  It brings out a whole other side to sauces.  Great quality and taste.  I've made it a few times and every time it comes out perfectly al dente.  It's small tubes, so that gives it a great chewy mouth feel.  I can't find this at my grocery store here, so I'm grateful Amazon stocks it.

review/summary: Hard to find
review/text: It can be hard to find Perciatelli or Bucatini in any brand, let alone a good brand like DeCecco.  This DeCecco far exceeds most of what you will find on the shelf at the supermarket and is even better than many more expensive brands.  A must for an Amatriciana sauce.  The box says to cook it 12 minutes, but if you like it al dente, and especially if you are going to finish it in a pan with the sauce, start checking it at about 9 minutes to make sure you don't overcook it.

review/summary: Not for everyone
review/text: If you know what bucatini is, then this is good bucatini pasta.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with bucatini, this is FAT spaghetti with a really thin needle sized hole through the strand of "spaghetti".  This isn't a good replacement for folks who just want to chow down on spaghetti. It can't be twirled with a fork.  It must be cut first -- you need some manners -- before it gets on the fork.  The pasta is just too sturdy and thick to "swirl".<br /><br />However, your diners will like this BETTER than spaghetti if they have the patience to cut the past before putting it on the fork.  It holds sauce well, feels substantial, and is just plain more interesting than spaghetti.<br /><br />I recommend for a change of pace from regular ol' spaghetti, but know your diners -- they might be confused that it can't be twirled(!

review/summary: How do they do it?
review/text: I just want to know - How do they make these cute little tubes?  This will be an essential pasta for my pantry now.  First dish out of the box, I made Rachel Ray's Big Fat Spicy Sate Noodles over which I served Orange Scallion Sesame chicken. I was so pleased with the result. Her recipe called for this particular Italian perciatelli pasta which seemed strange since I was making an Asian spiced dish. But whatever. It was absolutely delicious. The bite of the noodle was chubby and somewhat chewy, not like al dente. but just perfectly chewy and dense. I highly recommend this product. I imagine this pasta noodle will be a good canvas for chunky Italian tomato sauces also.
