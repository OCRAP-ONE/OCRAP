review/summary: BOLD
review/text: I found that this coffee was much more BOLDER than the JET FUEL that I had before. If I would have known it was that much stronger I would not have bought it. It is good, I just make the smaller cup and blend it with another flavor ,such as cinnamon. Other than that I like it. I will not buy it again though, it is to bold for my taste buds.

review/text: Ok here is the short version, I love a strong cup of coffee but I dont like french roast. So this coffee is strong and has almost no bitter after tase but it does have a french roast taste to it, so if that is what you like try this. Personally I am sticking to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHIZXE">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/summary: GM Double Black Diamond - Pretty good.
review/text: One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.

The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc...

What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my "investment" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one.

review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups, and over the last several months I've sampled pretty much all the "extra bold" ones I can find. This one is very dark and strong without being too bitter (although I don't mind a little bit of bitterness in mine). They are similar to the Green Mountain "Dark Magic" variety, but I find that they are stronger, and perhaps a little more bitter. For reference, my favorite K-Cup is the Starbucks French Roast variety, but I also really like this kind, Green Mountain Dark Magic, and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.

We have not been disappointed.<br /><br />This has a french roast taste, which is a favorite of his but not usually a favorite of mine. The coffee is not bitter nor does the coffee taste burnt.  Pretty decent on days where I want something with more of a punch.<br /><br />I am glad this is the brand/blend that I chose.  I probably won't be experimenting with the K-cup bold blends. This one works for us.

Double Black Diamond is getting there, but it's still a touch weaker than I prefer.  Green Mountain's Dark Magic, or Sumatra Reserve, go a little darker and deeper and are, in my estimation, the five-star K-cups.  This one's close, but still not on the target.

review/text: I've tried lots of different coffees in my Kuerig brewer located in my office.  I like strong coffee, but it also has to be smooth.  Some of the stronger coffees tend to be bitter, but at least for me the double black diamond is smooth and tasteful.  While I drink some other flavors just for variety, this is by far my favorite for that first cup in the morning.

review/text: My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get.

review/text: Primo hit the Bull's eye with this flavor.  Aroma is dead on and has the right citrus/berry blend from its Austrian cousin.  Key with this one is to lightly carbonate the water to get a taste profile and effervescence close to the real thing.  Have tried versus SodaStream and this one wins hands down.  At $4.99 for 24 - 12oz servings, you can't beat it.  Just a tip, add a little extra syrup for a bigger boost.

review/summary: Angrily disappointed
review/text: These are a HUGE disappointment compared to the pictures.  First of all, there were no pink monsters to speak of.  Second, while I did get 2 each of the blue, orange, and green, they are not specific to each design of monster; the lizard looking ones were orange and blue, etc...  But that doesn't lead to the greatest disappointment - they are monochromatic.  No subtle color shading, no white teeth...  just solid fluorescent color with some black for the eyes and mouth.  NOT cute, NO attention to detail, and a COMPLETE waste of money.  I have never written a review for an item on amazon.com before but I have never been this severely disappointed.  Please do not buy.

review/summary: Cute little guys
review/text: Got these for lunches during October for my kid.  Thought little monsters popping up now and then in her lunch would be fun.  I have to say these arrived beautifully packaged, and the coloring on these little guys is even more awesome than it appears online.  These are just amazing pieces.  They are really cute.  I'm only giving 4 starts because of comments from my child, those being What the heck was it?  And she called them dinosaurs.  So, only because of her inability to see them as little monsters, am I giving 4 stars.  However, in terms of quality, coloring, and taste, these are all 5 star.  These are made in the US, and from everything I have seen, this company actually CARES.  They turn out high quality product, that is fresh, tasty, and even better than what you can see online.  Don't hesitate, get Lucks Dec-Ons.  They are the BEST.

review/summary: Great steak seasoning
review/text: When we picked out our new Weber Grill at a local bbq store, I asked the salesman what his best steak rub was.  He answered quickly that it was "John Henry's Pecan Rub".  I bought a container of it and it set on the shelf for several months.  Having been a long time bbq smoker and griller, I have several favorite steak seasoning, but I am always looking for new tastes.  My Weber grill has a "seer" feature that allows for 700 degree heat.  The first time I tried the "John Henry's Pecan Rub", it was on a porterhouse steak.  I brushed a little olive oil on it and covered the steak liberaly with the rub.  The grill was at 675 degrees and I "seered" both sides for about 3 minutes.  Took it off and let it set for 5 minutes.  It had a mild chared look on the outside and was a perfect midium rare on the inside.  After my wife tried it she said "this is the best steak I have ever eaten".  Each time I use it I get the same remarks.  It is a great seasoning and I have ordered more.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Cardboard after taste, lots of ingredients
review/text: I do not eat a lot of crackers because of all the partially hydrogenated crap in them, but I purchased these for a party thinking they might be slightly healthier than normal crackers-I was wrong. Although there are "real" vegetables in the ingredients list, they are very far down on the list. Additionally the vegetables in the crackers are part of a "dehydrated vegetable blend" and the vitamins you would expect to be in many of the vegetables (eg vitamin A in the carrots listed in the vegetable) are not much higher than in normal crackers.<br /><br />Questionable marketing and name aside, the crackers don't taste very good. I could barely taste a hint of onion and pepper, and none of the other vegetables listed on the crackers-I am guessing I tasted the onion only because onion powder is also listed as an ingredient. They have a strong wheat taste, which I thought was surprising since it lists enriched flour as the main ingredient. Additionally they had a very distinct cardboard taste once you have chewed them a few times.<br /><br />I will not be buying these again and I would not recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />Ingredients I got off the box: Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine, mononitrate {vitamin b1}, riobflavin {vitamin b2}, folic acid), soybean and/or palm and/or palm kernel and/or canola and.or partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, dehydrated vegetable bled (contains carrots, onions celery, cabbage, red bell pepper, tomato, parsley), sugar, baking soda, high fructose corn syrup, onion powder, (flavor enhancer), natural flavor, artificial color, disodium guanylate (flavor enhancer).

review/summary: Need to boil up a horrendous mess? Look no further.  Need to eat?  Keep looking.
review/text: I have been a loyal purchaser of Deboles corn-based gluten-free pastas for many years.  I absolutely love them.  When I saw this multi-grain variety of penne I was eager to try it. Now I'm eager to get the gluey, sodden mess it created out of my house.<br /><br />The texture is a total disaster: it breaks apart before the pasta is even to al dente stage. The result is a melange of crumbling broken bits of half-cooked product that has the texture and (presumed) flavor of wet fiber-board.  My dogs (who will eat most anything), wouldn't even touch it.<br /><br />If you are from the school of thought that those who must eat gluten-free deserve only the worst of textures and flavors -- then this is for you.  If you're from the other school -- one that says we're entitled to flavor and texture to rival that of other grain products -- just pass this up and order one of the corn-based pastas.

review/summary: Simple, quick, and easy for on-the-go!
review/text: I was looking for a bunch of different options for on-the-go lunches that would not require a refrigerator. I ended up getting a pack of these Easy-Mac to-go cups since I loved easy-mac as a kid. They worked out pretty well!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy - very simple instructions, no additional stuff needed (except about a cup of water). Following the instructions on the pack yields the exact advertised product<br />2) Quick - 3.5 minutes in the microwave!<br />3) Similar to stove-top Easy Mac - taste is very similar to the stove-top version. Though consistency is not (see below).<br />4) ample cheese sauce - my gripe with Easy Mac is that sometimes it lacks in the cheesiness (compared to other quick-type macaroni and cheeses such as velveta). This comes with a pretty good size pack of cheese mix, and definitely carries through in execution.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) noodles are a bit mushy - This is obviously not fresh, homemade pasta,  and the noodles are a little mushy after cooking in a microwave on high power. Doesn't particularly bother me though, but if you're a pasta snob (cough, Scott Conant, cough), you may wanna steer clear.<br />2) Takes a while for sauce to thicken - The instructions require that you add the cheese sauce mix after you microwave the pasta alone. Then you stir for a while until the cheese sauce thickens to your liking. It will take a while. In my experience, expect to face an additional 5-7 minutes of stirring the hot pasta with sauce before it thickens to the traditional consistency of Easy Mac (ie. macaroni and cheese).<br />3) Small portion - I'll admit, this is probably an item that is targeted for children, but in any case, it's a fairly small portion. More of a snack than a meal. Then again, I don't think I'd really like an entire meal of Easy Mac...<br /><br />Overall, it's a small pack that's easy to throw in my bag on days I don't have access to a fridge to keep my lunch cold. It's quick, easy, and requires no additional items to make (again, aside from water). If ever I need this kind of item again, I will definitely purchase!

review/summary: NOT FRESH when bought from amazon
review/text: These coffee beans, when purchased directly from the roaster, typically arrive 48-72 hours from the time they were roasted, and always SHIP within 24 hours of being roasted.  They are inexpensive, single sourced, precisely roasted beans, that when brewed correctly produce an unbeatable cup of coffee.<br /><br />When purchased from amazon, unfortunately these beans arrived 40 days after their roasted date.  The day they were roasted is printed on the bag in the format of DAYOFTHEYEAR|YEAR.  So my bag from amazon came printed with 17111, meaning the 171st day of 2011, or June 20.  Today is August 1, it was shipped 2 days ago.<br /><br />Coffee is at it's peak the moment it comes out of the roaster and declines every minute after via dissipation of volatile aromatics and oxidation, or staling.  Buy it directly from the roaster if you want it fresh, buy it from amazon if you want cheap mediocre half-stale coffee in bulk.

review/text: I am about half way through my first bag and looking to try a different bean. It still has the yummy oil on the beans that you only see when it is fresh or you roast your own. I like my coffee strong so I give my grinder several more grinds almost to espresso, but if you pre-wet a paper filter it works out great in a drip pot. It also causes a build up in the grinder which a tablespoon of rice fixes that. My difficulty is my own making. It has nothing to do with a superior product. I plan on staying with this company as long as Amazon handles it and am looking forward to trying all their beans to find my favorite. This is a very dark bean without almost no bitterness. You can serve this to the most discriminating guest with pride.

review/summary: Great coffee @ Excellent price
review/text: I don't know and use all the termanology like 'nutty', 'fruity', 'low acidity' but in my words these beans make an outstanding cup of coffee. I grind only as needed and goes straight into 'Brewmaster". Good aroma while grinding and brewing. I vary 'beans per cup' for different taste at different times of day. I switch between 3 or 4 coffees day to day and this has definitely earned a spot in the rotation.

review/text: I always adventure into different brands of coffee when they're at a price point comparable to 8 'oclock. This coffee was right up there in quality with the others and the expiration date was nearly a year out when it was received. Smooth flavor with no bitterness and a very enticing aromoa, a nice addition to anyones coffee stock.

review/summary: Great Coffee - Excellent Value
review/text: I don't have much to choose from in the stores here and came to the decision that the only way to get good coffee is to order it online. I was surprised to see that there weren't many outstanding choices in that space either but this company fits the bill. I could order this directly from the merchant but decided to get it from Amazon because I get free shipping with my Prime membership. The coffee arrived on time and I have been enjoying it ever since. I am buying for just one person so I broke the five-pound-bag into eight smaller bags and put them in the freezer. This works out great. I ordered the Columbian Supremeo. It's an excellent value and I am looking forward to trying out another variety.

review/summary: Good Quality Bean, Stands Alone, Also Nice for Blending
review/text: BLEND this for a Great Smooth cup of Coffee! Easy to do.<br /><br />These coffee beans arrived quickly, however there were not in a vacuum packed pouch. Store in freezer (stay cool) to minimize the oils in the beans from becoming rancid & ruining the taste.<br /><br />These beans were nicely and uniformly roasted to a nice brown. No dark, burnt, over-roasted beans here! (If you want a darker roast go for French Roast or Espresso roast(-for morning java consumption, many prefer this lighter roast. )<br /><br />Columbia Supremo beans are a bit larger. These are plump and uniform (no old dried out beans). These Supremo beans will stand alone for a nice, non-acidic, robust cup of coffee. Note: To minimize/neutralize acidity a very small amount of sugar (tsp or less) is nice.<br /><br />Blended it with 60% Columbian Supremo (more robust, stalwart bean) and 40% Tarrazu, then just loaded up the coffee hopper on the maker. Those beans in there do fine at room temp for every day use.<br /><br />Predictably great coffee-nice way to start the day.

review/summary: really helped my lawn
review/text: this really works. I have a 100+lbs dog & his urine kills the grass. Now after using this product there are less patches in my grass. Just rake up the dead grass & re-seed or there will be a patch of weeds. I also started him slowly on the treats because I did not want to upset his stomach & I wanted his body to get used to them. So I did one a day for a week, then two a day and so on. Also, keep using this product through the winter or the urine will go through to snow & defeat the purpose. I cut down his dosage in the winter because of the snow & rain. His urine will be diluted a bit.<br />Also these smell really bad but my dog loves them.

review/summary: Perfect snack.
review/text: I absolutely love anything that has to do with cheese. I've always loved plain Quaker rice cakes, so when these tiny cheesy treats came out I knew I had to try them. I actually devoured a whole bag by myself a week ago- they are that delicious. They're crunchy and light and SO yummy. The cheese flavoring is actually a mix of both cheddar and blue cheeses, so I think that is what gives them a nice unique flavor. I can seriously sit and eat a whole bag within minutes. I try to savor each one but they're so yummy I just can't. They are really the most perfect snack out there- a far better choice than something like Smartfood or Cheddar $ Sour Cream Lays (both snacks I was partial to buying before I discovered these). They are worth a try- you will definitely love them. I would give them 100 stars if I could. :D

This kibble has NO nasty 'meal' (read: beaks, claws, lips...yech )AND...it has NO gluten ....and therefore no hidden melamine mixed in to artificially raise protein content.  The kibble is a small size and my bichons have always taken straight to it...including one who had only eaten ground meat and whose previous owner said:"He'll NEVER eat kibble." He was eating it within 24 hrs here.<br />I recommend reading labels.....Buy this wholesome kibble with confidence!

review/summary: For some reason, way better than other matzos
review/text: I dont know how they do it, but the texture of these is just great.  From the picture you can see parts that are toasty and parts that are less. Somehow that translates into a lot more flavor. Is that what "jerusalem baked" means?  Or does that mean they are made in Jerusalem?  Either way, when you look at other matzos they look uniform.  The toasting is really huge since since they dont use salt or oil.<br /><br />I love the ingredients list, you cant get better in a cracker: whole wheat, water.  Thats it.  The stats are great too, you get a good fiber/carb and protein/carb ratio.

review/text: These are the best ever whole wheat matzos, far better than any other brand.  Thin, crisp and with great flavor, they make domestic brands taste like cardboard.  It's great to have a year-round source; in the grocery store if you find them, it's only in March-April.  I recommend them highly .  I hope Amazon continues to carry these.  I'll definitely buy more.  BTW, package arrived in perfect condition; Amazon packed them very well.

review/summary: Excellent product!!
review/text: I was looking for a whole wheat Matzo (we use them to make mini-pizzas in the toaster oven) and there wasn't one available at any of the local stores.  I have been trying to switch my family over to as many whole grain products as possible.  These taste excellent, have much more fiber than the regular matzos, etc.  Couldn't be better.  The calorie content was only about 10-15 more than the non-whole-grain ones we'd been eating too - but the matzo squares are significantly larger so that's part of it.  Excellent product; a couple did arrive cracked or broken but not really an issue.

review/summary: You don't have to be Jewish
review/text: Many people think of Matzo as Jewish and it probably is - but you don't have to be Jewish to appreciate the quality and versatility of Matzo thins.  Whole wheat is healthier than white - versatility means it can be used in so many ways from simple cheese on Matzo broiled in little oven - spread the Matzo first with your choices be they mustard of varied flavors; ketchup; BBQ sauce; combinations of the preceding or just let your imagination lead you.  Cheeses may be any including Swiss, Provolone, Cheddar and so many more - I usually use two cheese with perhaps a little Turkey or sometimes Pepperoni - again, let your imagination lead you. Once I needed bread crumbs for a dish we were making - didn't have any - made some using these Matzo thins.  Excellent!

review/summary: Been using this for years...
review/text: My husband has suffered for years and feeding him on his gluten free diet has been difficult. I found this flour through a gluten free oats producer and have been so happy with the product. With this I have a bread recipe that I can make in the bread machine that is really good. I make him cakes and cookies and breads using regular recipes and they come out great. Because of the lack of gluten I often have a problem making things like pie crust but I manage. Because of the lightness of the flour I do have to make sure it is all incorporated in the bread machine and scrape down the sides in the beginning but the it makes it so easy to make him bread in only 2 hours. Since you only have to let it rise 1 time you can make it quicker than some other styles of bread. Being able to purchase from Amazon will make it more convenient and I am grateful more people will become familiar with this great product. For those that suffer with Gluten Free intolerance this is a really good product that works with most recipes that you already have in your kitchens.

review/summary: Perfect all-purpose gluten-free flour blend
review/text: Domata Living Flour put the joy back in my gluten-free cooking.  I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen.
