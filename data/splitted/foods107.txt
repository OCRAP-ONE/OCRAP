review/summary: Not crazy about this flavor
review/text: I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.<br /><br />The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I won't be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of flavored tea, but the Raspberry Black Tea K-cups are great! My Keurig machine has an iced-tea option, so maybe that is why I am satisfied with my brew each time. I can also use 1 K-cup twice. The second one is weaker, of course, but it's still has a great flavor.

review/text: Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.

review/summary: Darned good for a packaged cookie
review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers here, our packages of cookies arrived intact, sometimes even overly packaged in that unique-to-Amazon way.  Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies.

review/summary: One of the best tasting packaged cookies out there
review/text: I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.

review/text: Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great!
review/text: I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great.

review/summary: Superior to Chips Ahoy!
review/text: I used to buy Chips Ahoy! brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler brand cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker, fresher, more crumbly (although very few if any were broken in the package), and overall much more melt-in-your-mouth delicious than Chips Ahoy! originals which were thinner, a little harder, and almost a bit stale-tasting. If I remember correctly, the Chips Deluxe cookies package has 2 ounces more in it. I've never been a fan of the soft batch.

review/text: The "Soft 'n Chewy" Chips Deluxe cookies are highly underrated. Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, "Soft 'n Chewy" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy. I would say these are just as delicious as Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but they are also thicker and usually cheaper. Pick one up today and the people in the house with sweet tooths will gobble them up quickly.

review/summary: 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!
review/text: As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."

The brown rice comes through with it's nutty flavour but doesn't overpower the green tea. My only concern is that it will oversteep and get bitter pretty easily and anything over about 2 minutes is too much as opposed to other brands I've tried and it only deepens the tea strength. Otherwise it's a great start to my mornings!

review/summary: Good - But Not Great. Yet Another Saffron Review
review/text: If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.<br /><br />There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland brand name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra-right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).<br /><br />First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.<br /><br />As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to bring it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier brand of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to "air out" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.<br /><br />The actual touch/texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior brands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.<br /><br />Fragrance - very nice and aromatic.<br /><br />Overall - for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon and/or the Roland brand ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only.

review/text: Vegan. Natural. Spicy snack mix also with sweet flavor notes. Americans might find it spicy, but for Indians it is quite mild and more towards the sweet side. If you like Indian flavors and spicy snacks along with some sweetness, you might really enjoy this one! Haldiram is a top snack brand in India. Khatta Meeta is my top favorite Indian snack mix. Made with gram flour, peanut oil, corn oil, peanuts, rice flakes, sago [palm stem starch], sugar, green peas, gram pulse, lentil, salt, mango powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, ginger powder, black pepper powder, & citric acid powder. Was very happy to be able to order from Amazon rather than to wait until I find myself back in India or in a large metro with an Asian market. Walking on the streets in India, you can find the small and big packets of Haldiram snacks nearly everywhere.

review/text: I was introduced to Hadiram's Khatta Meetha by my sister who lives in India. I really like it as a snack. It's sweet but with a little kick to it.  I've been buying the 7.06 oz five packs and freezing them until I use them.  Today I saw that it's available for a regularly scheduled subscription (at a discounted rate and with no shipping charges) and I am ecstatic.  This is just a great snack if you want something sweet with just a little bit of heat.

review/summary: Not My Taste Preference
review/text: I ordered these without having tried them before- I tried a similar product made by a different brand (possibly a slightly different flavor?) and loved them, so when I saw these I thought "yes!" and ordered the bulk pack.<br />When I tasted them, however, my stomach said, "no!"  These are disgusting.  I repeat: disgusting.  They taste like ketchup, mustard, LOTS of sugar and EGG.  Which mixed together tastes like vomit.  Say, what you might expect after eating cotton candy and a corn dog and an omelet and then riding the tilt-a-whirl.  I have tried them several times to see if it is "an acquired taste" but, for me, it is not.  These make me nauseous every time.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like them.  Anyone want 4 and a half bags of this?

review/summary: Very disappointed.  This is  a very sweet jelly with an odd texture
review/text: I love lemon marmalade.  They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.<br /><br />I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br />Sugar 62g per 100g<br />Glucose-fructose syrup<br />Lemons<br />Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid<br />Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate<br />Flavoring: Lemon Oil<br />Color:Caramel E150C<br /><br /> Price with shipping slightly over $11.<br /><br />I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!<br /><br />8/22/11 Update<br />Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.<br />Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try.

review/summary: EXCELLENT SOUP MIX
review/text: I absolutely love this soup mix for my roast chicken.  It's the only way I'll roast a chicken.  I actually got the recipe out of my Lipton soup mix cookbook and it's as follows:<br /><br />Country Herb Roasted Chicken<br /><br />1 chicken (2 1/2 to 3 lb.), cut into serving pieces (with or without skin) or 1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast halves<br /><br />1 envelope Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic or Golden Herb with Lemon Soup Mix<br /><br />2 TBS water<br /><br />1 TBS olive or vegetable oil<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br /><br />In a 13x9 baking or roasting pan, arrange chicken.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on chicken.<br /><br />For chicken pieces, bake uncovered 45 minutes or until chicken is done.  For chicken breast halves, bake uncovered 20 minutes or until chicken is done.<br /><br />Makes about 4 servings.<br /><br />I do hope you'll try it.  I had to purchase it from Amazon after all of my local grocery stores discontinued carrying it.

review/text: I've tried most of the McDougall LIGHT SODIUM instant soups and have them several times each week for lunch.  White Bean and Pasta is my second favorite LIGHT SODIUM soup behind the Split Pea (really like that one).<br /><br />It does, however, require more time than the other soups to "steep" and develop its flavors.  It also requires more time to take the crunch out of the pasta and vegetables.  Let it sit longer than directed and you may want to put it back in the microwave to heat up.<br /><br />Small price to pay for an inexpensive and relatively healthy lunch.  Try it.

review/summary: Good, but stir thoroughly, and even then ymmv
review/text: This line of products from Dr. McDougall's, is a reasonable solution to those looking for a semi-quick and easy snack or small vegetarian meal. The ingredient list was something that I was fine with, as well as the (relatively) lower amount of sodium. While the other products in this line are good to go after about 5 minutes, the white bean and pasta soup requires 8 minutes, according to the directions. Even then, I notice "crunching" of somewhat dry pasta when eating it. Thoroughly stirring the product helps to a cetain extent, but even so it still happens.<br /><br />Also, the lids are glued on TIGHT. Very difficult to remove the paper lid without ripping it. This also wouldn't be an issue, except the directions say to cover the lid with the spoon while the soup is sitting. So have a suitable substitute cover for it.<br /><br />Otherwise the taste is fine, and it does make my lunch meals easier.

review/summary: Good vegan food option for weekend outings
review/text: I enjoy weekend backpacking adventures, and I like to enjoy a hot cup of soup or vegetarian chili around the nighttime campfire. I saw that the white bean & pasta was a vegan product, so I decided to give it a try. For this past weekend's outing, I brought along a few containers, and prepared it with boiling water. Other than my taste preference desiring a bit more spice (a couple dashes of hot sauce would do the trick), I thought this soup was good. I did not have any issue with the pasta not 'cooking' like some of the other reviewers, but perhaps that is because I used boiling water and not the microwave to prepare it. (I actually never use a microwave) I'll definitely purchase again, and would recommend to other vegetarians and vegans. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TRSM6G">Easy Vegan Cooking: 100 Easy & Delicious Vegan Recipes (Natural Foods - Vegetables and Vegetarian - Special Diet)</a>

review/text: I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.<br /><br />The taste of the White Bean & Pasta soup is good, especially for a low-sodium soup, and it's about as filling as a cup this size will get.  It can be eaten as is or poured over pasta, rice, a baked potato, etc.<br /><br />My one complaints is that the beans don't always get completely hydrated (watered), and they can end up a bit "crisp".  Letting the product soak longer doesn't seem to help.

review/summary: Daneille (non celiac that cooks for 3 celiacs)
review/text: I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.

review/summary: A guilty pleasure that manages to avoid my multi allergies!
review/text: I have three main allergen groups of foods:  wheat, dairy, eggs. This product manages to avoid them all and still provide great taste and nutrition, decent fiber content, at a nice price.<br /><br />Believe me when I tell you that on such a restricted diet (I have to watch sodium content also) amazon offers many products in good quantities at great discounts (+ free shipping) such as the Ener-G line that help me navigate the waters of avoiding ingredients from the allergy groups above. I have also purchase several other items in the Ener-G line of foods and have found them all to be in the 4 or 5-star categories.<br /><br />Only thing to watch out for:  a few of their products have less than desirable fiber content, but if that is not a big concern for you because you get plenty of fiber from other foods, try them also and I'll bet you will like them.

review/text: The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea, I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip, and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me, I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box, but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes, go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea.

review/summary: Very Good Drink with a Minimum of Calories.
review/text: I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water, I choose an ice-cold slightly carbonated spring  water. Just mix and, viola, a nice tasting glass of fruit drink with a minimum of calories. Delicious! Very, very good. And the original bottle says it has 22 servings, although I may make up a little larger serving than they suggest. Well, what can I say? It tastes like a very good soda pop and has an absolute minimum of calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have a weakness for good fried fish and as I age, I've cut down on my fried foods.  No, this is not as good as deep fried fish but it is a darn good substitute.  I cut the fish in small pieces dip them in egg and bread them with Oven Fry.  I cover my cookie sheet with foil, so there are no dishes to wash.  I also put oven fried potatoes in at about the same time.  Then I make a salad to compromise toward a more healthy meal.  It's quick, easy and fairly healthy.  No it's not diet food but it doesn't taste like diet food either.  I just bought a case of Oven Fry from Amazon and am a repeat customer. It has become more and more difficult to find their fish product in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon when these supermarkets quit carrying the products I enjoy.

review/summary: Fun to try all five flavors
review/text: The Crunchmaster brand is definitely my favorite brand of gluten free crackers. Previously, I had only tried the white cheddar and regular multi-grain so I was excited about a variety pack. My favorites were the white cheddar and garden vegetable (these two are square in shape and less grainy). The other flavors (rosemary & olive oil, roasted garlic and toasted onion) were octagonal shape and have a nuttier consistency. I liked all of them though the octagonal shaped flavors were best with toppings, while the squares were better on their own.

There is no stomach upset, no bloating with this tea. I drink 2 large cups after breakfast, and I find that I have no stomach distress at all.<br /><br />It's wonderful hot, and it's excellent as an iced tea, with a shot of Stevia and lemon. It contains caffeine, though there are no "coffee" jitters to speak of. This tea is also known to reduce cholesterol. I am looking forward to my blood test results this November when I see my Dr.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.
