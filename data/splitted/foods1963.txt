review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: The Switch Watermelon/Strawberry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 35 grams of sugar and 36 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 140 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.<br /><br />Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion.

review/summary: Just Flavored Water
review/text: This really tastes like strawberry and watermelon for a while.  Then the aftertaste kicks in and I cannot describe the exact taste but it is neither of the above two.  If you are in need for a quick energy push you may find this to your satisfaction.  It did nothing for me except leave a lingering useless taste.  It has been over 5 hours since drinking a can and I am still burping the stuff.  I'd call it something other than stuff if I could describe it.  If I had been in the yard pushing a mower for an hour or so this might taste pretty good but it is only 8.3 ounces and that is not enough to satisfy many who have done much work.<br /><br />I still have a major problem with water-flavored drinks costing so very much.  I calculated that this drink is about $15 per gallon.  That, my friends, is way too much for water.  Gasoline is about $2 per gallon and it takes me farther than this drink.  If this were $0.25 per can then it would be in the ballpark for reasonable cost but then again we all have to make a living.  If I were going to go for a satisfying drink it would be an old standard or perhaps something a little harder.

review/summary: Zesty and Sweet
review/text: I wasn't sure about this product from the other reviews. However, I have to say it's pretty good.<br /><br />Initially you get hit with really zesty bite (in a good way). This quickly turns into a sweet fruity aftertaste.<br /><br />Its a little on the sweet side to be good for mass consumption but just 1 can at a time is good.<br /><br />The only negative things I can say about this product is the price tag. Which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. If someone handed me a can of this I would gladly drink it in the future.

review/summary: Kids like it - moms don't...
review/text: Well, I decided to share this with my daughters - 11 & 6 - apparently for my oldest daughter they sell this drink in her school. She loves it. Needless to say she was thrilled that I would get an opportunity to review it. I had never heard of it. So for a kids they loved it. Would I buy it, probably not. For such a small thin can, it has 140 calories. That's just too much! I would prefer they drink WATER! Good for the body and 0 calories. How about that?!  As an adult, I saw that although it is marketed as 100% natural, it did have 35 grams of sugar. Sugar is sugar - natural or artificial. I'll pass.  The kids give it five stars...and I give it two stars. So because mom is the actual reviewer, two stars wins.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: The Switch Watermelon/Strawberry can is 8.3 oz and contains 140 calories. That's the bad news. The good news is that it contains no sugar, no corn syrup (that sneaky ingredient that is making its way into everything these days), no preservatives, no artificial colours and is gluten-free.<br /><br />So what does it contain? Juice, juice concentrates, filtered sparkling water, natural flavours and vitamin C.<br /><br />Taste-wise, SWITCH is a bit on the sweet side for me. There's a very light strawberry flavour but I couldn't pick up a hint of watermelon. Would I buy this? No because the calorie content is too high and I tend to go for fresh juices when I want juice. If I was stuck in a restaurant would I pick this to drink over nasty sugary soda? Only if they were out of water.

review/text: I couldn't really taste the watermelon but there was a very sweet overall flavor to the drink. The sweetness was of course augmented by the strawberry. It's not my favorite Switch flavor but it is hardly the worst. The low carbonation may be favored by some and is about on-par with some light beers.

review/summary: Watermelon is the best switch flavor to date! Highly recommended!
review/text: I love these Switch "sodas" they are very tasty and do not contain any bad ingredients. I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1/2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.<br /><br />The Watermelon flavor is awesome! In my opinion the best of the three I sampled. I highly recommend this to everyone looking for an alternative to other sodas. All Natural, no extra junk your body doesn't need.<br /><br />Calories: 120;<br />Fat: 0;<br />Sodium 15mg;<br />Total Carbohydrates 31g;<br />Sugar 24g;<br />Protein 0g;<br />Vitamin C 100%<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review!

review/summary: Tastes Good - BIG Calories
review/text: These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes good. I liked the drink but I'm not wild about the strawberry part of the mix.  It kind of tasted a little stale to me, not in an obvious or overt way but in the after-taste (a little). The carbonation is just right, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories.

review/summary: Great Product, but the other flavor is better
review/text: Once again, this "The Switch" is much better than any soda or seltzer product out there.  Last time, I tried the cherry one and that would be my drink of choice if I could choose any drink at any time.  This drink has the same great low level carbonation and is also great when thirsty (what else is a drink for?), but the flavor isn't as good as the cherry one.  I realize that people's tastes vary, but I definitely preferred the other.

review/summary: Needs more work
review/text: This product label says that it is "the perfect balance between juice and carbonation", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this one, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called "Watermelon Strawberry", and both of these fruits actually are listed on the ingredients label, unlike some of their other drinks. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars and carbs. This little 8.3 ounce can has 140 pretty empty calories in it. I think children will like these really sweet flavors, so it could be a good alternative to soda for parents to offer their little ones.

review/text: I loved the lightly carbonated non-sweet flavor of this watermelon strawberry 100% fruit juice.  Both flavors can be faintly tasted in this beverage. It is certainly a refreshing drink served over ice.  However, at 140 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly.

review/summary: The healthiest soda I've ever had tastes the best.
review/text: Finally!!! A soda I can enjoy without spikes in my blood sugar, the fatigue afterward, and of course all the other negative health effects from eating sugar. No artificial junk in there-no artificial sweeteners which can be even worse for your health than sugar. No artificial colors, flavors, etc. It's juice but tastes very light and naturally sweet with white grape juice, yet it's refreshingly tart, too. I loved it. Preserved naturally with ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br /><br />The cans are smaller than your traditional soda can, which may be a good thing because the drink is carbonated and probably not suitable for people with fibromyalgia or a vitamin D deficiency. But if you're healthy enough to drink soda, this is a spectacular treat. I will be buying this. It's fantastic. I hope they make an organic version. But then there would be nothing left to wish for.

review/summary: Nice, carbonated, and not overly sweet
review/text: Of the three "Switch" juices I have tried (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>), this is my favorite. It is not as sweet as the other two, and it has more of a rather unique flavor of its own. It's not like eating strawberries or watermelon, and the blend of the two, with the carbonation, give it a slightly different, less predictable taste, which is a plus if you are tired of "more of the same" flavors..<br /><br />The 8.3oz can (one serving) has 140 calories, but at least it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, which is certainly a big plus over the traditional Colas, sodas and sugar-loaded iced teas.

review/summary: ALMOST the switch you're looking for...
review/text: It's a fantastic idea.  100% juice meets carbonated beverages with none of the undesirable additives.  Add to that a wonderfully rich flavor (think jolly ranchers, but more vibrant!) and an incredibly reasonable price tag (less than $1 per 8.3 fluid ounce can), and The Switch sure looks pretty perfect.<br /><br />Except, of course, for one little devil in the details.<br /><br />The Switch uses juice concentrate for its beverages.  This, in itself, is not a terrible thing, but the water that's later added at the bottling facility is "filtered sparkling water" which is a flowery way of describing filtered tap water.  They take the good water out of the juice and add garbage.  Considering the whole concept of moving away from all that's unhealthy about carbonated beverages, one would think they could have made the drink a little more expensive and used spring water.  Funny how "sparkling" strongly implies spring water even when it actually promises nothing.  I find this downright deceitful.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, do keep in mind that any carbonated beverage is going to contain sodium and, therefore, will do little to actually refresh you.  Drink this because you like the flavor, not as a source of healthy hydration.  There's nothing wrong with the fact that The Switch is carbonated.  In fact, it's part of its charm, but that necessarily makes it less than 100% good for you.<br /><br />So The Switch has a lot going for it, and I wouldn't be averse to picking one up every now and then, but contrary to what the can promises, this is not "100% of what you want" with "0% of what you don't."  "Sparkling water" is what you get when you run your tap through a Brita filter and nothing more.  Does the "100% of what you want" take into account the fluoride, pipe rust, and Grandma's discarded anti-depressants, all floating around in the tap water they're adding to each can of The Switch?  If so, the company's wants differ greatly from my own.

review/text: The benefit of this drink is that it is "no sugar added, 100% juice," which tastes basically like fruit soda.  I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the watermelon and strawberry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board.

review/summary: Not bad at all
review/text: As background, let me say that I spent the last 5 years in a predominantly African American ghetto, and one of the favorite non-alcoholic canned beverages in da hood is Arizona Watermelon Strawberry juice in a 20 oz tallboy.  THAT stuff is nasty . . . so teeth-shatteringly SWEEEEEEET it will put a diabetic into hypoglycemic shock after a single swig.  So let me say it was with some trepidation that I did first sip at my sample can of Switch Watermelon Strawberry.<br /><br />Not bad at all.  Certainly not the sickeningly sweet sugar overload from Arizona.  It was a little sweet, a little tangy, and it wuz bubbly too.  Flavours were well defined and pleasant.  Fairly good, actually.  8.3 oz can was a bit too small for a carbonated beverage, though.  I'd prefer this product in a 12 oz can.

review/text: If you like sweet, fizzy drinks - this product is for you.  It is refreshing and sweet.  I liked the watermelon flavor and thought it was different from other products on the market.  I don't normally drink soda or sugary drinks on a regular basis - but I like to pick up differnt kind of beverages for parties and get-togethers at my house and this is a good drink to serve guests.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I am not a soda person, so I wasn't sure if I would like Switch. I loved it! It's 100% juice with carbonation, so no need to worry about strange chemicals or artificial sugars. I could taste both the strawberry and watermelon juices (it also has grape and apple juice) and the combination was perfect. There is no added sugar of any kind, AND this juice contains 100% of your RDA of vitamin C. I also really like the smaller size can -- it's 8.3 ozs, perfect for kids and for adults who don't like to drink a large can of soda all at once. Overall the taste of Switch is crisp and refreshing, and not too sweet. I would definitely purchase this product again, especially during the summer months. Delicious!

review/text: I really enjoyed this carbonated Watermelon Strawberry fruit juice. The carbonation gave the drink a more complex taste than just plain juice and the watermelon flavor will appeal to both kids and adults alike. It is also a healthful alternative to sodas with no nutritional value.

review/summary: Should have been called Apple Strawberry
review/text: I was really excited to try this drink because I love watermelon and strawberry drinks.  It comes in a slender 8 ounce can with pictures of a watermelon slice and a couple strawberries.  It touts "no sugar added" and "100% juice" on the front, along with the slogan "100% of what you want, 0% of hat you don't."  Well, what I wanted was to taste a watermelon and strawberry symphony in my mouth!  What I got was a mildly carbonated apple strawberry flavor.  I honestly cannot taste the watermelon.  The first ingredients in the juices listed is grape, then apple.  I guess this is another grape juice trying to be something more.<br /><br />The "no sugar added" does not mean this is a low sugar drink.  It has 36 grams of sugar in the 8 ounce can.  That plus 140 calories would turn me off from this as a regular purchase.  I do like that it has no preservatives, artificial flavors, and no corn syrup.  So those are pluses.<br /><br />All in all I think I have tasted better, but it is not a bad drink.

review/summary: Light, refreshing, nothing to feel guilty about.
review/text: This was a really nice, refreshing drink. The strawberry-watermelon blend was sweet but not too much so, and it has just a little carbonation that makes it a little edgier than plain juice. The best part of it is that it didn't have the overwhelming grape or pear  taste that natural juice products usually have. A lot of the others use grape or pear syrup to get the sweetness and it overwhelms the flavor you actually paid for. This one tasted exactly like strawberries and watermelon. I'll definitely be buying these in the future, and I hope they make them available in a large size, too.

review/summary: A Refreshing New Option
review/text: This is a nice option for people who enjoy the fizz of sodas but prefer to keep things healthy. The carbonation in this beverage is very light and reminds me more of a spritzer than anything else, and because it's not overly sweet, it's very, very refreshing! We almost never have soda in our house and only sometimes have juice (we're a water-drinking family), but Switch is an all-juice product with no added sugars or high-fructose corn syrup and perfectly welcome in my refrigerator. My son was delighted to have something so "soda-like" while doing his homework and gives it two big thumbs up!

review/summary: Yummy Drink
review/text: When trying this drink we decided to use the taste test method. The four of us sat around the table with little drink cups filled, waiting to start our test. Around the table each one took our sampling. Our four year old son decided this was good and he wanted more. Seven year old Daughter had lots to say but all her adjectives revolved around and excited yummy. Dad's turn to try and he like it but he thought it was a bit sweet. My turn. The can is slim and tall and reminded me of the apple juice cans only taller. Tasting the Watermelon Strawberry drink made me think of the version of the JD alcoholic beverage minus the spirits. A little on the sweet side, with a little bit of a twang and if you drink too much you may regret it! These little carbonated juice drinks were good and I can see that they could become an addition. As a parent I would definately put this in the lunch box over say one of the fruit punch pouches we so readily disperse! All-in-all this is a pretty "yummy" drink.

review/text: This is a extremely tasty drink, but I am partial to watermelon flavors. The flavor is subtle, but you absolutely pick up the watermelon flavor. Its not drowned out by the strawberry, which is usually the case in strawberry-watermelon flavored food items. This drink is lightly carbonated, much less than a standard cola drink, but the carbonation transforms the drink from a juice-like, powdered drink type to a much more refreshing, original beverage. The drink is not overly sweet, but just enough to enhance the watermelon-strawberry flavor, and not too caloric. I am anxious to try the other flavors. (its a small can, but the price is not too bad.)

review/summary: Think Welch's Grape SODA but healthier
review/text: Disclaimer: I am a VINE REVIEWER and therefore I received one item of this product for free to review.<br /><br />I have a marketing background and the marketing here is great, "The Switch" is an ideal name and with consumers looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, this is a good "switch" ;-)<br /><br />This is a tasty beverage made from juice concentrates with no added sugars. To quench that thirst and you want the feel of carbonation (you know what I mean!) man, this is a good choice.<br /><br />My only gripe might be that it is tiny, just a cup or ~8oz. It goes by quick. I have no idea on pricing, again since I'm a VINE reviewer, but it's going to need to be comparable to the price of regular sodas or cheaper, else why make the 'switch' ? I do wish it came in 12, 16 or 20 oz variants.<br /><br />The Watermelon Strawberry flavor is great.  Think of a Welch's Grape Soda, but in a healthier form with no processed sugar.  (Natural sugars from fruit is okay, processed sugars are bad) Essentially this is a good tasting soda that is not a soda and it still has carbonation, but it still natural juice. :-)

review/summary: Tastes like carbonated apple juice!
review/text: I like apple juice, but when I drink a beverage that is supposed to taste like watermelons and strawberries, I want to taste watermelon and strawberries!  The overriding flavor in this drink is apple juice.  If I concentrated hard enough, I could (almost) detect a faint taste of watermelon, but not enough to convince me to purchase this soft drink again.<br /><br />If you like apple juice more than watermelons or strawberries, this soft drink would be perfect for you.  It's got plenty of carbonation, and it's healthy, with no added sugar or artificial sweeteners (which is why I gave it two stars).  Even without the sugar, it's plenty sweet (but not too much).  If you want a flavor other than apple, try the tangerine.  Of the three flavors I've tried, tangerine is the only one to actually taste like it's should.

This one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Of the three flavors I would have to say the Black Cherry is by far my favorite flavor. It had a much more mild taste and was carbonated perfectly.<br /><br />This flavor I was a little surprised with. I thought it may have an overwhelming flavor of watermelon, but that wasn't the case. It's a decent mix between the two flavors. It does lean a little more towards the taste of strawberry.<br /><br />While the juice may be decent, the price seems high to me for a can of 8.3 oz juice. While I like juice, I am not sure I like it that much to pay that high of price.

I'm not sure if it is just the orange vs watermelon & strawberry, but it was much better all the way around. I didn't find the carbonation to be excessive and the flavor was surprisingly good.  However, it still has too much sugar and too many calories to be considered healthy in my opinion.  I also felt like this flavor had a more natural taste, not an artificial one.  If you want to give Switch a try, start out with this flavor first!

If you are looking for an alternative to soda this flavor may be a good choice- especially for younger children who may object to the stronger flavor of the Black Cherry.  As for the cost and nutritional info- that would have to be a personal choice but for me this would be a viable choice to have around for my granddaughter, she loves carbonated beverages in a can and could be fooled in to thinking she was getting a "soda" with this drink.

review/text: Despite the claim that Switch is 100% juice, it tastes more like an artifical soft drink. The reviewer who stated that it tastes like a Jolly Rancher is spot on.<br /><br />There is a hint of watermelon flavor, but it is drowned out by excessive sweetness. I kept wondering where the strawberry flavor was. It never materialized. The overall flavor is one-dimensional. Reading the ingredient list clues you into the fact that it has more apple/pear/grape juice than watermelon or strawberry. That probably explains why it's rather boring tasting. At least it's a little bit bubbly.

As it stands now I would rather go for regular juice or cheaper soda but if the price was comparable to a normal 6/12/24 pack of soda and off the shelf then I would recommend the black cherry and watermelon versions of Switch.

My husband has to avoid gluten foods, so  this worked well for him.  It is carbonated, but you could hardly tell and I found it to be refreshing.  SWITCH contains 100% juice and one can has 8.3 fluid ounces.  The 140 calories can add up, so this drink is not something that I would have more than once during the day. The taste of watermelon and strawberry together, was really good and I would recommend this for others to try. I think this might help people to get away from those regular, nothing but sugar, sodas!

Why does vitamin C need to be added if there is really real juice in this can and aren't their other nutrients worth listing if there is "real" juice in it?<br /><br />In any case, it is sweet, the taste is ok, it would be a better mixer that drinking plain.  As with most things like this, why not just drink water than spend $1.00 for a can of what is essentially sugar water?

review/summary: Made a nice sangria.....
review/text: The positives: 100% RDA of vitamin C...no artificial additives...pure fruit juice.<br /><br />The negatives: 140 calories per can...almost $1 per 8 oz...flavor is a fairly sweet strawberry flavor, little hint of the tartness of watermelon that I was hoping for.<br /><br />It might be a good way for some children to get extra vitamin C and calories (some -do- need both). Certainly, I'd prefer it, nutritionally, to soda.<br /><br />Most adults would probably find it too sweet, too high in calories, and too expensive--at least I did. But, added to some on-hand merlot and some oranges and lemons, it -did- make a refreshing sangria....

review/summary: The Yummy Bubbly Juice
review/text: The logo on The Switch says 100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't. The ingredients reads 100% juice (filtered) sparking water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) I'm on a health kick and I don't like to eat HFCS or corn syrup. I sometimes look at "natural" pop and am surprised to see corn syrup.  The taste of The Switch is outstanding, but I think it tastes more like grape/apple/strawberry than watermelon.  It has 140 calories in a dainty 8.3 fluid ounce can. If one is watching calories or carbs, I'm sure this would still taste good mixed with more soda water as it is a little sweet straight up.  I'll buy The Switch again.

review/summary: Like Liquid Candy! Yum? Not so much.
review/text: My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Watermelon Strawberry is somewhat more desirable than Kiwi Berry.  For a beverage that claims to have no added sugar, Watermelon Strawberry Switch very sweet -- almost too sweet for me.  It reminded us of strawberry sparkling cider, though Switch's "fizz" content is somewhat less.  I thought the strawberry taste overwhelmed the watermelon taste, but my brother had an opposite reaction -- he said it tasted like a watermelon Jolly Rancher candy. "Too much like liquid candy" was his sum-up, and the rest of us agreed.  Good for a sweet treat, but not for an everyday beverage -- unless you've got a major sweet tooth.  There are tastier ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix.

review/summary: Good Alternative to Soft Drinks
review/text: Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well, look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First, the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Watermelon and Strawberry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch, brief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people. Remember the original single serving size bottles of Coca-Cola?  They were 6.5 fluid ounces.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 140 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives).

review/text: This drink tasted okay.  I liked the option of trying a strawberry-watermelon flavor, since they are both favorites of mine in the fruit family.  But, it is so SWEET.  As other reviewers have noted, there is a LOT of sugar in the drink, even though they push the fact there is no corn syrup.  If I were going to drink my calories (which I tend to try not to do), I'd try to find a fruit drink with less calories.

review/summary: Refreshing, Natural, & Not too Carbonated. But where's the Watermelon!
review/text: This is my idea of an ideal healthy beverage. It's lightly carbonated and free of high fructose corn syrup, and no sugar added. And of that and it still tastes great. My only gripe (which is why I took off one star), is that it doesn't taste watermelony enough. I mean, I can taste the strawberry clearly. I get a hint of a watermelon taste coming through but all of the other filler juices cloud it out into a sort of dullness. I ended up with sort of a mango flavor in the back of my throat but without the hairiness. I mean, it's still very great tasting and all, but they're probably better off calling this "Strawberry Watermelon" instead of "Watermelon Strawberry". I don't know if it's my taste buds or what, but for me the watermelon wasn't quite there enough.

review/summary: Shouldn't Watermelon or Strawberry be the first ingredients?
review/text: This flavor (Watermelon-Strawberry) of the Switch carbonated juice is pleasant, but has an "interesting" after taste.  It leaves a flat feeling in the mouth. I didn't feel refreshed, it was just sort of there. I didn't think, "Oh wow this is great", it's not.  Slightly tart but not to the point of pucker. It doesn't really taste like watermelon or strawberry. Given grape and apple juice come before the listed flavors that's not surprising. The color is a pale orangey-pink sort of like watermelon but not really.  Fair at best.

review/summary: a tasty and not too sweet beverage
review/text: The Switch Watermelon Strawberry beverage is a combination of juice from natural concentrate and carbonated water. The makers of this drink emphasize that their beverage has no added sugar and no artificial colors. This is shown also by the list of ingredients which consists of various types of fruit concentrate, sparkling water and some vitamin C. I really enjoyed this drink, it is flavorful but not too sweet. For your information, there are 140 calories in a serving (one container) and there are 36g carbohydrates per serving. If you are looking for a fruit drink that is not too high in calories and carbohydrates you might want to give Switch a try it is pretty good.

review/summary: Good soda but miss labeled
review/text: Switch is the "all natural" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C. The flavor in question is watermelon strawberry.  This soda had a very clean and crisp taste, yet it didn't taste like watermelon or strawberry.  I had a hard time trying to pinpoint what this carbonated beverage tasted like.  After I finished I came to the conclusion that it tasted a lot like blueberry or raspberry, not watermelon-strawberry (watermelon or strawberry).  The end result is this soda is very good but doesn't taste like its name.

The watermelon strawberry was ok, but it didn't have the burst of flavor I expected.  Still, this is far better than drinking soda pop and the cans are about the size of a Red Bull can.<br /><br />If you like watermelon and strawberry, you might enjoy this.  I found it was good, but not as good as some of the other Switch drinks I've tried.

review/summary: Moderately Tasty; Could Be Improved
review/text: The drink definitely wasn't what I expected, but I did enjoy it.  The watermelon and strawberry tastes blend nicely, creating an interesting and very unique taste.  It's slightly carbonated, though I think it could have benefited from slightly more.  As is, it tastes vaguely of soda that is on its way toward being flat.  Had it been slightly more carbonated, it would provide just the right tickle without being as bubbly as soda or energy drinks.<br /><br />It was a lot thicker and more syrupy than I expected.  Pair that with the lack of sufficient carbonation, and you might discover that the drink could be better if mixed with club soda, served very cold.  I was pleased to read that there was no sugar or preservatives added too, but I did expect a slightly less sweet drink.<br /><br />Overall, it's moderately tasty, but there are some areas that could be improved to make this a real treat.  It's not something I could drink on a regular basis, but I might indulge again.<br /><br />6/10

review/summary: Soda Juice II
review/text: In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products.

review/text: For those who are looking for more than a twelve ounce can of sugar water, artificial flavors, and dye; this is one way to go.  I'm not sure when I started liking these types of sodas, and I must admit that I still have regular relations with Sprite.<br /><br />Nonetheless, when I want to savor a soda as a special, end of the day thing, I would have no problem having these stockpiled alongside some of my other 'weird' softdrinks.  At least it's easier than finding a case of, say, Lichi soda.  It might be the price that makes the savoring a must, along with the smaller size, but everybody has to have their vices and having never done the alchohol, smoking, or drug scene.<br /><br />For those who like these sorts of sodas, a warning - the strawberry does overpower the watermelon a bit, despite the name implying that watermelon is the headliner here.  Other than that, I'm going to go check out some of Switch's other flavors now.

review/text: I received a sample 8.3 fl. oz. of Switch Watermelon/Strawberry.  I poured a sample for my wife, my 21-year-old daughter, my 16-year-old son (who had just awoke from a nap), and myself.  My wife's impression was that she really liked it.  She enjoyed the strawberry flavor.  My daughter said she liked it as well.  She commented that it was "different" and in a nice way.  I liked the flavor and the light carbonation (as opposed to something that foams up into something flat).  The taste was agreeable (I had intentially picked this flavor combination to sample).  My son, however, didn't particularly care for it.  He said that he thought the flavor was too strong (he prefers sports drinks).<br /><br />I don't know if it will be available in our remote location but I would buy it as an alternative to other soft drinks.  The information on the can suggests that it is a product that should appeal to the natural food crowd.

review/text: I really love the idea of a drink that is 100% juice and not a whole lot else. Switch is also pretty tasty!<br /><br />The can is smaller than you expect. It's sort of like a tall version of the tiny orange juice cans (the ones with the peel off top). You figure real juice is more expensive to make than artificial sodas, so that's not unsurprising, but the picture of the product makes it look bigger than it is.<br /><br />The other thing to note is the carbonation of this beverage packs quite a kick! In fact, it was a tad much for me, but I still found it pretty tasty.<br /><br />This drink is definitely worth a try!

review/summary: The Best of the Bunch
review/text: The Switch has come out with a wide variety of flavors for their refreshing all natural fruit drink, but the Watermelon Strawberry has to be by far the best. While the Switch juice drinks are good, some of the flavors can be a bit too sweet, despite the complete lack of artificial sweeteners in their product. The combination of Watermelon and Strawberry, however, manages to cut the sweetness with the fresh watermelon flavor. I would recommend most of the Switch juice flavors, but the Watermelon Strawberry would be my first choice every time.

review/summary: Watermelon Strawberry Flavored carbonated water - tastes great!
review/text: Switch Watermelon Strawberry tastes exactly like it should. It is a nice refreshing carbonated juice drink. The can proclaims that it is all natural so I must assume that it is. However, the juice portion is what is always annoying to me.<br /><br />I know the beverage industry intimately. It is necessary to create such drinks with one of three bases: water (only when not 100% juice is claimed), grape juice, or apple juice.<br /><br />However, the problem is that grape and apple juice are exceedingly high in sugars. Yes, they are natural sugars, but it's a higher level of sugars than you would get if you were to eat an apple or a bunch of grapes. It's concentrated. Further, these juices are both rather inexpensive.<br /><br />At 8.3 ounces, I'd be very reluctant to purchase such a juice soda for the price that would be required. While it's refreshing, so is a glass of water and an apple or a bunch of grapes (or a slice of watermelon and some strawberries).<br /><br />Yes, it's good. Just keep in mind that you're getting a lot of sugar content that is NOT necessarily good, even though it may be "all natural".

review/summary: The Best Switch Flavor in A Can
review/text: This is one of my favorites! It is sweet but crisp and full of juicy flavor. It definitely satisfies both my sweet tooth and desire for a healthier alternative to soda that won't upset my stomach. In fact, thanks to Switch, Reed's Ginger Brews, Virgil's Root Beer and R.W. Knudsen Spritzers, I have completely abandoned traditional soda! Who wants all that nasty corn syrup and who knows what other mad scientist chemicals they cram in there? Now that these healthy soda alternatives are here, it's time to drink smarter without having to give up taste. In fact, all of the drinks I mentioned above taste a million times better than anything I've ever tasted from Coke or Pepsi (etc.). The only problem is they are a lot more expensive than regular soda but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />If you are going to try Switch, I recommend either Watermelon Strawberry (8 oz. can only) or Apricot Peach (12 oz. bottle only), which are their best. I also enjoy Switch Orange, Fruit Punch, and, when I'm in the right mood, Black Cherry. Grape, Very Berry and Kiwi Strawberry are just okay but a word of warning about Kiwi Strawberry: if you eat the wrong food with it (like a lemon bar), it can absolutely ruin the taste of the soda and turn it into a whole new level of yuck. I haven't noticed any of the other flavors compromised by my choice of food in this way.

review/text: I like this very refreshing drink and the fact that it is juice.  I'm not a soft drink drinker and I would buy this drink again if it were available locally.  Not too sweet, light carbonation, and has a light fruit flavor. Recommend you try it if you like fruit flavors.  I also like the smaller size can.<br />I thought I'd already reviewed this for Vine but apparently not.

review/summary: A better soda with a juicy aftertaste.
review/text: I'm not that big a soda drinker and I absolutely hate those flavored water carbonated drinks, but this 100% carbonated juice comes fits between the two rather nicely.  At first, this flavor tastes a lot like straight strawberry soda, but as you continue to sip, a juicy flavor and aftertaste kicks in.  It's soda without the chemical belly ache of all that acid.  Surprisingly, it's a blend of 100% juice (apple, acerola, strawberry, and watermelon) and you would never guess if you drank from an unmarked cup.<br /><br />No preservatives and no added sugar make this a great alternative to straight juice, soda, and the sparkling clear flavored beverages.

review/text: I was skeptical that something without corn syrup or artificial ingredients could taste as strong as The Switch Watermelon Strawberry drink did.  However, this product is very sweet.  My first gulp reminded me of those purple grape sodas I used to drink as a kid.  Since I like fruity candy, I liked this drink.  But, I'm not so sure it's worth the calories.  It's basically fruit juice and carbonated water, but calorie-wise, it's like drinking a Coke.

review/summary: Sweet & carbonated - NOT for the 'faint of heart' like me!
review/text: Wow, I was quite unprepared for the amount of sweetness packed in this sugary drink!  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated', so I was expecting somewhat sweet tasting, but not like this ~ it was overwhelmingly sweet, and packed 140 calories, 35g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE natural, and this one (for all it's claims to the contrary) did NOT taste very natural to me.<br /><br />It was certainly pleasant tasting, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda completely last May (I don't miss it at all!), this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, iced tea, milk, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The watermelon & strawberry flavors were nice, but TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like super-sweet carbonated beverages, and aren't worried about calories, etc.

review/summary: A Nice Tasting Carbonated Juice
review/text: These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Each can has 140 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 35g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C. This sparkling juice tasted good as you drank it and I could taste the Strawberry and Watermelon blend. After trying three flavors I would have to say I would drink this again, though I prefer  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> flavor.

review/summary: Would be better if it was clean :(
review/text: Watermelon and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink "hits the spot".  It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it has a whopping 35g of sugar.  The main fruit juices, are grape and apple.  As a "snack" or "treat," it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an "energy" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine.<br /><br />I also made a review of the kiwi and strawberry which tastes slightly better and has 2g less of sugar.  The real reason I gave this product one star less than the other is that Amazon needs to work on their packaging/handling.  See my customer photo.  This item was just plain filthy with some kind of dirty/greasy industrial soot on it.  I had to REALLY scrub it with dishwashing detergent.  After that, it was good! (But, I shouldn't have had to scrub it.)

review/summary: Not what I expected (and not in a good way)
review/text: I really thought I'd like this product.  I love watermelon and strawberry flavors in just about anything so I figured this would be a no-brainer.  My disappointment was almost palpable and I actually had trouble finishing this drink.<br /><br />I'd have to say my primary impression was that I didn't really taste much watermelon or strawberry.  It's possible these two flavors just aren't meant to go together and cancel each other out.<br /><br />It's a little too sweet for me, although there is no added sugar.  I would have liked something with a bit more 'bite' to it.<br /><br />The primary juice ingredient is grape, followed by apple and acerola, then finally strawberry and watermelon (all from concentrate).  I think maybe a little less of one of the first three might have allowed more of the watermelon and/or strawberry come through.

review/summary: Tastes like cold Robitussin!
review/text: I tried this The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, along with the Black Cherry flavor.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />The beverage was sweet, and while not overly sweet, I couldn't help thinking how it reminded me of what cold Robitussin might taste like.  It has a fruit flavor, but I really didn't care for it at all.  Our family drinks a lot of fruit juices and some fruit drinks, so I am OK with strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, but this one was not that good.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are grape, apple, acerola strawberry, and watermelon.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Watermelon Strawberry contains:<br />* 140 calories<br />* 15 mg sodium<br />*36 g carbs (35 g sugar)<br /><br />So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  In fact, It has over 40% more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.<br /><br />It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.<br /><br />PRICE:<br />The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  However, due to the taste, I'd almost rather drink the soda.  Price wise though, this product is comparable to other carbonated juice drinks.<br /><br />Overall, this is drinkable, but it didn't seem that good to me.  It wasn't bad enough to pour down the drain, but after every sip I couldn't help think "cold Robitussin"

review/text: I wish I could recommend this product, but I just don't have the palate for sickeningly sweet drinks anymore. The flavor was fair, not that I could tell you what the flavor was supposed to be without looking at the can, but even my teenagers said it was too sweet. We're all pretty used to sugar-free drinks. Another reviewer gave it props for not having any refined sugars, but who cares what kind of sugars it is when it's still nothing but sugars! Even if it's fruit sugar it still has the same high calorie count and candy-like taste. And it's a tiny can for nearly a dollar! Sorry, it's not worth it. If it were good, my kids would probably drink 3 at a sitting. Imagine the expense and packaging waste!

Don't be fooled by the "natural" ingredients into thinking this is a healthy alternative to soda, or that what you're drinking is watermelon juice.  Basically, it tastes like melted Skittles, and will appeal mainly to kids and junkies.<br /><br />On the other hand, you could treat it as a concentrate, and dilute it with a lot of seltzer and/or vodka to make a reasonable beverage for adults.

review/text: This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a "diet" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option.

Many people remark regarding the calories, but they are no different from any other 100% fruit juice & better for you than soda! Yes it is a bit pricey but it seems to be about average in comparison to similar beverages sold in individual portions..............you are paying for CONVENIENCE!  IF you want to save money just but a fruit concentrate & seltzer/soda water & mix up your own blend (like we do!) I did not have any on hand but a splash of fresh lemon or lime wedge would be Delish with this drink! We sampled it ice cold, don't know if that makes a difference, but if I was offered this again I would definitely grab it up! YUM

review/summary: A very good drink, but a too-small package.
review/text: When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I usually choose flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 140 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 36 grams - plus 35 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />This flavor of Switch does have a higher calorie count than<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry</a> - though I'm not sure why.<br /><br />Taste: This drink has the unique taste of strawberries, grapes and watermelon at the same time. My spouse said it tasted like "watermelon bubble gum". Anyone looking to get off the soda kick can find a nice change of pace with this juice. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to "make the switch" for two main reasons:<br /><br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.

review/text: I tasted both "The Switch" Orange Tangerine and this drink, the Watermelon Strawberry. Between the two, Watermelon Strawberry is the winner. The taste of both the watermelon and the strawberry came through and tasted nice. The aroma is also good and smells somewhat like the fresh fruit. The overall effect is like a Hansens or other fruit soda, but with half the carbonization (bubbles).<br /><br />On the other hand, I would have liked a larger serving size (12oz vs 8.3oz) and although the flavors were good, I think it would have been nicer if they were just a bit more lush.<br /><br />This is something I might opt for in the future.

review/summary: If You Like Watermelon, Then You'll Like This Drink
review/text: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it wasn't bad, but I am not really a big watermelon fan and therefore it didn't appeal to me as much as some of the other Switch drinks have. Like the other Switch drinks I have tasted, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, if you like the taste of watermelon then this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one that you should consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, in my opinion, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and that combined with the fact that I am not a big fan of watermelon, would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

Yes, but only if it was purchased by someone else or if the cost was lower.<br /><br />Recommendation: Larger can (only 8.3 oz)

review/summary: The best flavor The Switch has to offer
review/text: This Watermelon Strawberry flavored drink from The Switch is a refreshing and tasty beverage that beats soda any day of the week.  Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Watermelon Strawberry flavor is by far the best flavor that The Switch has to offer.  Refreshing, worthwhile, and much healthier than any diet soda or nearly any other carbonated beverage, The Switch is definitely worth trying out if you're looking for something refreshing, healthy, and tasty.
