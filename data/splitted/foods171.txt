review/summary: Not bad but not Jasper proof
review/text: This toy is great for preventing my dog from inhaling all his food.  Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like.  So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy).<br /><br />Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it.  Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.)<br /><br />Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is "unraveling" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food.  So it's definitely time for a new toy to dispense Jasper's food, which could very likely be this one simply for the ease of loading the food.

review/summary: My dog likes it
review/text: My Beagle, who is an avid chewer, really enjoys the tug-a-jug.  It took her about a day to figure out the fastest way to get to the treats, but even so it still takes her some time to work everything out of it.  It's better than other treat-dispensing toys I have which make the treats either too easy or too difficult to get out.  The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is that my dog was able to chew right through the attached rope within the first hour of playing with it, so that part of it was not too durable.  Still, even without the rope it's a good product.

review/summary: Dog Danger
review/text: I purchased two of these for our labs at Christmas.  I filled them with their usual training treats, and the dogs loved them...they played with them for about 30 minutes trying to get to the treats.  Then...the two dogs figured if they bit off the ball on the end of the rope, they could get the treats to fall out sooner.  Yup...within 30 minutes the plastic ropes were destroyed.  It could really be a danger to dogs if swallowed.  (This is why I watch the dogs when they get new toys...and thank goodness I did.)<br /><br />Anyhow, totally disappointed with the product, it's safety and the price.  THESE TOYS ARE NOT LAB-TOUGH!

review/summary: Fun Little Toy
review/text: My Boston Terrier really loved this toy. With treats inside, it honestly kept him busy for about an hour as he tried to figure out how to get them. Unfortunately, the rope, which was his favorite part of the Tug-a-Jug, was pretty much shredded after only a few days of play, and without it he's mostly lost interest in the toy. But, if your dog isn't an intense chewer, this toy should be able to last quite a while, and keep them intrigued.

review/summary: Boomer's New Toy
review/text: I have a 13 week old Goldendoodle who is fiesty and playful. We have several interactive toys and this is one of Boomer's favorite! We use it all the time but lately my husband who takes care of him in the early morning has been away so I've been on duty 24/7, after his 5 a.m. potty I fill it up with his kibble and put him back in his crate and it keeps him busy for a while and then he falls back to sleep. It's worth it's weight in gold for us.<br /><br />The bottom unscrews so you can put the treats in from there and the ventilation holes allows for the dogs to get a good whiff of the treats. It's more challenging than the amaze a ball and keeps our puppy busy.

Even without treats inside of it, he plays with it endlessly. And so far, it's standing up well to his surprisingly powerful chewing as well.

review/text: I bought this for my one year old sheltie for Christmas and he LOVES it.  I put the Premier buddy berrys inside and they work quite well, as he can smell them through the holes in the toy. He's learned to stand it up and knock it over to get the treats to come out.  It's his new favorite toy and he drags it around everywhere.  It keeps him occupied for quite a while.

review/summary: Great for Smart Dogs
review/text: I live with 3 dogs: 75 lb shepherd/collie mix, 37 lb. spaniel/? mix, and a 17 lb. chihuahua/dachshund mix.  Only the Chiweenie can get the food out of this toy---which is a good thing really because he is the only one with a weight problem.  He is also the youngest and the one most likely to get into trouble when left at home alone.  He drags this toy around by the hard rubber ball part, then lays it flat on the floor, pushing and pulling the rubber rope until he empties it.  The other dogs just watch, but never attempt it themselves.  It is easy to refill except I struggle sometimes with lining up the grooves on the screw-on lid.  It washes well in the dishwasher.  I recommend this toy for every dog, but many dogs will need a little occupational therapy to learn how to use it.

review/summary: I'm Undecided
review/text: First of all: I bought the med/lg size for my 70 lb, 18 month old lab puppy, and I think it is a little too big. This may help you in deciding what size to buy your dog. The rop and opening ball are the right size, but the bottle is so big he can hardle pick it up (no fun).<br /><br />Positive: this toy has single-handedly kept my dog occupied more than any other toy (other than Nylabones). He is infatuated with it! He LOVES it! He is pretty angry and still hasn't figured out how to get the treats out (which suprises me because he is very intelligent).<br /><br />Negative: After very little effort the rope ended up in 3 strands. It is not durable or tightly woven at all. Also, I didn't buy the treats suggested to go with it, but rather broke our treats into tiny pieces......but it is actually hard to get the treats out! (Is a dog toy smarter than me?!)<br /><br />Overall, I love the product because it keeps my lab busy and content, but if you have a chewer, you may want to consider something else until they grow out of it, because this rope is done-for.

review/summary: Challenging, occuping toy--well worth the spend
review/text: I bought the small Tug-a-Jug for my 7-month-old Shih Poo puppy, Max, an aggressive chewer who is easily bored and demands play attention constantly.  This toy keeps Max well-occupied for long periods on end.  I started out by really filling the bottle and using smaller treats that would more easily dispense, and once he got the hang of it, used larger treats for increased challenge.  While the tassel on the end of tug rope has been worse for the wear, the rope has withstood Max's chewing well.  Max has been able to figure out various ways of getting to the treats--rolling the bottle around, up-ending it, then knocking it over and tugging on the rope to dispense the treats...As the label says, Max is able to smell, see and hear the treats, and this keeps him interested for hours of play.  I've learned however, that I really have to screw the bottom on extra tightly, as on one occasion he somehow managed to loosen it by repeatedly rolling the bottle, and was able to get to all the treats at once! Suffice to say, he did not have much of an appetite for his evening meal after that!! At the same time I purchased this, I also purchased two Kongs; however, Max prefers the Tug-a-Jug hands down, and generally ignores his other toys--even his previously favourite tug rope--in favour of playing with the Tug-a-Jug All in all, Max rates this toy with 5-stars and thinks his mommy made a wise buy!

review/summary: Great challenging "interactive" toy but rope is too thick!
review/text: My dog LOVES this toy but the rope seems too big for the opening, making it virtually impossible to get out any treats.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue and was sent a new rope, just to make sure the bottle I had wasn't mismatched with the rope size.  The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the "game" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the "mouth" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game "reasonably" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope.

review/summary: Best meal time slower-downer and doggy activity out there
review/text: We bought this for our 5 month old lab to keep her from inhaling her dinner in 5 seconds flat. We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- "Rope" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity.

review/summary: Lasted 7 months with 55 lb. 3 year-old LabraDingo!
review/text: Jack, our 3 year old LabraDoodle (I refer to him as a "LabraDingo" sometimes because he's so nutsy) really enjoyed this Jug -- our second one lasted 7 months of heavy use before the rubberized rope broke.  (Another reviewer suggested inserting a tennis ball into the now-ropeless jug in order to salvage it; I'll try that, but am not enamored with the idea of mixing a tennis ball with edible things).  It seems to be his favorite toy -- a good balance of enticement, challenge and reward.<br /><br />PRO:<br />Keeps our dog engaged.<br />Good price ($10 currently)<br /><br />CON:<br />It can be loud rolling around and crashing into things.<br />Hard plastic should be washed before use; unknown chemical safety.<br />Limited durability, but fine for the price.<br /><br />Net: I'm ordering our third!

review/text: I bought this toy and the buster cube to be able to leave with my dog on the couple of days he is home alone so that he at least gets a little excitement.  He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone.  I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem.  It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little.  I think it was definitely worth the money and recommended it to our local vet who is now carrying it in stock.

review/summary: No more inhaling dinner!
review/text: I give this to my Lab-border collie mix. He inhales his food it's better for his digestion to slow down. It took him less than two days to become proficient with it. After about two weeks we stuck this nubby football toy sold at Complete Petmart in the bottle to slow him and keep him busy longer. It's just the right size to fill the bottle yet allow food to flow down. We do shake it a bit to get the flow started. Using this method it takes him about and hour and half to get all of the food out. He still gets to inhale his food and pester us sometimes it depends on what we're doing. I'd reccomend it and the nubby football to go inside if you have extra smart dog. If you google football dog toy in google images you will come across an example of the type of toy we used.

If they do it's a great occupier of time. I have been filling it with their regular super premium dog food and a little bit of Beneful dog food kibbles & bits for variety. So no expensive treats.

review/summary: 2-Dachshunds CHEW PROOF
review/text: I bought the small size for my 2 dachshunds (who are notorious for chewing through monster truck tires and tearing the heads off barbie dolls).  This toy has kept them busy for 2 1/2 days and still going strong.<br /><br />The bottom screws off to EASILY put food in (I put in their dinner portion of kibble plus a couple bone treats).  The bottom has pin size air holes so the dogs can smell the food, the bottle is tinted purple but you can still easily see the food and hear it rattle inside.  The plastic rope part has a 'plug' at the end so if the dogs try to pull the rope, it closes the top exit and food wont come out.  The only downfall are the tiny plastic nubs around the neck of the bottle.  A big rubber covering around the neck of the bottle has tiny numbs which my dogs were able to chew off- but sooo tiny i'm not worried about them at all (and the main plastic covering is still in fantastic condition)<br /><br />I'M ALREADY ON THIS SITE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER DACHSHUND.... AND A COUPLE MORE AS GIFTS FOR FRIENDS WHO HAVE BUSY DOGS TOO!<br /><br />If you want a toy that will keep the dogs entertained, challenged, interested, and wont tear apart- this is WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!

Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast.

review/text: This toy has been great for our very active Shiba Inu!  We got it for him when he was 6 months old, and at 1 year, it is still one of his favorite toys!  I was afraid it may be too big for him to work since we got the medium-large sized jug and he only weighs 18 lbs., but it seems perfect for him now.  It took him a couple of days to figure out how to stand it up, and tip it over to get the treats into the neck of the bottle, and then pull on the rope until a treat comes out.  It works great with his small sized Newman's Own Organics Peanut Butter Dog Treats, and is easy enough to fill.  We only fill it about 1/2 full once every 1-2 weeks, and it keeps him self-entertained intermittently for hours.

review/summary: definately entertaining!
review/text: I bought 2 of this item for our (2) 14wk old labs and was shocked at how big they were!! They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30-45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased.

review/summary: Entertaining
review/text: I bought both this toy as well as the Buster Food Cube and while both are great toys, this one is nice because it is much quieter and a lot easier to get the food in and out.  If your dog isn't as good at manipulating things with her paws then this toy may be a better choice for you because it is easier to use with just their mouths grabbing the toy to get the food out.  My dog pushes on the top of the jug with her paw and usually gets the food out that way.

review/text: The product itself is good I suppose.  Maybe it's just my dog.  I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day.

So I was hoping this would entertain him, but even this wouldn't do the trick.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I broke it back out after I adopted a new dog for Christmas.  She eats her food much too fast, and in return has horrible gas.  So, I started filling this with her kibble, and it slows her down, and keeps her busy for a good ten minutes.  My older dog still won't play with it, but he will indeed follow her around and pick up any kibble left behind! lol

review/summary: bottle may be bullet proof, but plastic rope is easily broken
review/text: My dog LOVES to chew her toys, and I thought that with the advertising that the bottle was "bullet-proof" that meant they had made the rest of it as indestructible as they could.  I would have been happy to get a week's play out of this.  No go.<br /><br />My dog loved the treat aspect of this toy.  She spent a long time working the treats out one by one, and I was really happy with how busy it kept her.<br /><br />Until I went to pick it up to bring it inside with us at night.  I found several little pieces of the rope part that she had torn off.  I realize it's difficult to make a toy unchewable, but this wasn't even close to as durable as it could be.<br /><br />For a dog that doesn't try to destroy toys, this would be a wonderful toy!

review/text: I bought this toy for my dog to keep him busy while I run out the door to work.  He used to get upset when I left, but now he knows he will get this to play with.  He figured out really quickly how to use it and it keeps him entertained for at least 10-15 minutes while I escape.  It is very easy to clean.  One thing I wanted to point out is that the small is rather large.  My collie is huge and he uses the small.  I think the large would be too big for him.  I just put about a quarter of a cup in it although the small holds about 2 cups.  I guess if you wanted to feed a very large dog an huge meal you might need a large, but then it might be too heavey for the dog to play with.

review/summary: This thing is amazing!
review/text: For the first couple of days, our dog Moby was only slightly interested in the tug-a-jug.  We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!

review/summary: TOUGH ENOUGH FOR MY DOGS
review/text: I have a 14-month-old chocolate lab who can chew through a large rawhide in 20 minutes, and a pit bull mix who is right behind his big sister. I love the Tug-a-Jug because not only is it virtually indestructable, but it also keeps both of them challenged during their days home alone.<br /><br />I would agree with recommendations to fill the bottle high with small kibble to start with, until they get the hang of how to work it. Once they do, it is really fascinating to see how they learn and get better. The good thing is, even when they are getting treats, they are getting them sparingly so they continue to try for that one more.<br /><br />I have two Tug-a-Jugs and brought them outside a couple of times. They survived the frost and yard dragging very well. Inside the dogs do thump it against the floor pretty hard, so I would not use this on a nice wood floor, for example.

He's very active (he's a beagle!) and we needed something to keep his attention for more than a few seconds. This is it! What a winner! Wilson loves the tug a jug! At first he was puzzled by it. Of course, since he's a hound, he was following his nose, and his nose was telling him there was food in that jug but how in the heck was he supposed to get to it? He tried a few ways and then walked away frustrated. I showed him how the kibble would actually come out the hole and he was hooked. He spent half a day figuring it out. Sometimes I give him his entire meal in the tug-a -jug and let him work it out of there. He's a very high energy dog. He loves a challenge. I'm so grateful for this toy slash dogsitter!

Tug-a-jug does not keep Weezer occupied for long stretches of time, but it entertains him for 15-30 minutes here or there.

review/text: I purchased this for my Westie because I work and she's home alone in her crate most of the day. I wanted to give her something to stimulate her mind, so she didn't get too bored while I was away. I received many recommendations on this toy, and read many great reviews. Here are my issues with it.<br /><br />1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.<br /><br />2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.<br /><br />I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats. For extreme chewers, and smart dogs, it's not durable or stimulating enough for them.

If your dog is a strong chewer, I would get something else to entertain them.

review/summary: Lasted 5 minutes, item not as pictured
review/text: My dog chewed up the "rope" that stops up the bottle into dangerously large pieces in a manner of minutes.  Note that in the "Medium/Large" photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope, but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber "rope" that appears in the "Small" photos.  This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers.  I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate.

review/text: My dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. I have never has one break before. This bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day I gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. It was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.

review/summary: Terrible Dog Toy
review/text: I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.  Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth.  I definitely do not recommend this item.

review/summary: Don't Waste Your Money
review/text: I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing "straw grabber" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)

review/summary: Broke in less than an hour.
review/text: I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix.  She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber "pull" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!

review/text: My 35 pound pit bull mix chewed the rope in half in less than 20 minutes (I knew it didn't stand a chance), but she still has a blast with it. I put two ping pong balls inside so it's not too easy to get the treats out. Often she would rather chew on the rubber around the bottle neck than try to get the contents, and it's stood up pretty well. It does have a couple bits and nubs missing.<br /><br />Also, it your dog is playing with it on a hard surface, it is LOUD! For me, this is a small price to pay for knowing my girl is having fun with something other than my sneakers.

review/text: I think my dog was just too smart for this toy.  I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope.  After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole.  It was a waste of money for my dog to try out.  With the fabric-type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her.

One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the "ultimate solution" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for "heavy chewers" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund.

review/text: I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost "by accident" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy.

review/summary: The rope is a weak point.
review/text: This toy has a failing if you have a dog who's too clever for it's own good. The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.<br /><br />We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.<br /><br />The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.<br /><br />1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.<br /><br />2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray.

Unfortunately, the toy is made of hard plastic and while we didn't care about the noise, the plastic itself eventually cracked from the beating on the hard floors.  We continued to use the toy cracked, until the lid finally cracked and was no longer able to be screwed on.  All said, the toy lasted about two months.  You decide if the price is worth it.  For us, we'll be looking for an interactive feeding toy that is made of hardier material.

review/summary: Morkie cannot get any treats out when used as intended.
review/text: I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose. That said, this is the only way for him to use the jug, so still not fulfilling its intended purpose or use. Cleaning if course is a pain.

review/summary: Rope does not last long
review/text: I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food/treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted &lt; 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food/treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.

review/summary: Cool toy, but dog not really interested
review/text: I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.<br /><br />He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end. If your dog is any good at playing tug at all, you will lose every time.<br /><br />He did not seem to enjoy chewing the purple spiky part either.<br /><br />There was some interest in getting the treats out, but it never lasted very long. The treats have to be fairly small to come out. I spent nearly an hour cutting up treats to make them easy to get out, and that helped perk his interest a little, but he always went back to other toys.<br /><br />Maybe its too complex for him. He does LOVE another puzzle toy we have. Its like a buster cube, but its a tough rubber ball (melon sized) with a maze like center. You put treats in one side by pushing them through a crossed slit, and after some rolling they fall out a hole on the other side. He loves that toy. I think its cool, too, but I fear what might be growing inside it, and the only way I've figured out to clean it is to soak it in vinegar and then put it in the dishwasher and hope.<br /><br />This toy is at least easy to clean.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to a neighbor to see if her dog might like it better.

review/summary: Great concept for CERTAIN dogs
review/text: I bought two of these in med/lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!

I have a yorkie, Tinker, that just stares at it. She just waits for someone to move it to dispense the food I've put inside. Is she that lazy? I know she is smart enough to figure it out. We were trying to show her how it works and now she just waits for us to show her again so the food will come out (perhaps that's the smarty pants coming out). We have two small dogs and Tinker has become quite posessive over this and will not let the other dog come near this toy. She sat by it for several hours and then got tired and fell asleep next to it. Does anyone have any suggestions?

review/text: I cannot get my dog to use this no matter how hard I try.  My dog is the most food motivated dog I've ever known.  She will do ANYTHING for carrots, lettuce, ice cubes... even her own kibble.  But regardless of what I put in this thing, I cannot get her interested in this toy to save either of our lives.  I even tried clicker training her on it!  She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do.

review/summary: Lab loved this but broke it very quickly
review/text: My 60-lb 13-month-old Labrador LOVED this toy but she cracked the top, effectively ruining it, within a few days. I'm not sure what size we had but I'm thinking it must have been the middle size (small?) - it was a good size for her insofar as she was able to fit the whole thing in her and tilt it on its side to let treats out but that's also how she cracked it. I'm going to get the biggest size, which I think will be able to withstand her, but I'm also predicting that she won't like it as much if she can't fit it in her mouth. Too bad they don't make this same toy with a rubber coating.

review/summary: Keeps My Furbaby's Interest
review/text: I have a 7lb Maltese boy who loves this toy! I was a little hesitant when I first received it because it is about half as big as he is. It took him a little while to figure out how to get the treats out but he definitely has his methods now. From dragging it around the living room to standing it up by the couch and knocking it back over. Also keeps his interest for a very long time whether it has treats in it or not!!!! I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope, lol. Does he play with it every day...no. But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try.

review/summary: Hardly indestructible...
review/text: I bought this for my 8-mo-old blue heeler/husky puppy, and she managed to pull the rope enough to break it within 2 days. She's a rough-and-tumbler to be sure, but they claimed it was indestructible. Hardly.<br /><br />Pity too, she'd almost learned how to use it.

review/summary: If your dog chews out the rope...
review/text: Try putting a tennis ball inside the bottle. My Border collie chewed the rope out too- to make it more challenging then just knocking it over and treats spilling out really easy, I put a smaller sized tennis ball inside so she still has to work the bottle back and forth in order to get the treats to go from the back of the bottle to the neck. Hope this helps! -Ali & *Kylie *the border collie/flat coat retriever mix

review/summary: GREAT entertainment for my pooch!
review/text: My dog gives this one TWO paws up!  I was worried it might be too big for my little Maltese, but he LOVES this toy!  I especially use it when I'm going to be gone for a couple hours because I know it will keep him entertained and happy.  If we're going out for dinner, I put the dog's dinner portion of dry food (very small morsels) into the jug so he can play and eat while we're away.  I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).  I don't have to worry about that with this VERY durable bottle.  It seems by looking at it that it would be impossible for the dog to get treats out of it, but my guy figured out within a day how to get out every last one.  A truly super item!

review/summary: Just a Jug, No Tug
review/text: In my search for a toy that would occupy & challenge my 2-year-old Golden Retriever, I located the Tug-a-Jug.  Like one of the other reviewers, at first my dog was not entirely convinced that the toy was his to play with, as he had never been given access to a bottle before.  After the scent of the treats lured him in, he began to play.  It took little time for him to realize that the rope was what was getting in the way of the treating plopping out, so he just set about chewing on the rope until he succeeded in chewing it in half.  After this happened, the shorter knotted end fell into the jug, and the treats came out easily.  Now I am left with an -a-Jug, as the "tug" is missing.  We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.  I'm hoping to find a replacement rope to string through the jug, however they are often knotted so tightly, I've not yet had any success there.  Overall, a great toy that continues to entertain my dog, despite the fact that he re-engineered the main mechanism in the first 30 minutes.

review/summary: My dogs arent quite smart enough........
review/text: I got the Premier line of toys thinking I could varriate what they got each time I leave for work, on Monday it would be the twinst n treat, Tuesday the Tug a Jug, etc. But when I put this one down on the floor my two mutts just sat there and looked at me. I tried to show them that pulling the rope would cause the treats to come out but alas they just werent understanding. It has been almost twoo weeks now and still not much results. They love the other Premier toys, just arent quite smart enough for this one.

review/summary: keeps the pup busy!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:06 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was skeptical when I bought this toy because of all the reviews I read of people reporting that their dogs couldn't figure out how to use it. My pup figured out a strategy within about 5 minutes. It continues to be a useful toy for times when I want to keep her busy, and also for everyday feeding. If you've got a dog who likes puzzles, this is a great toy. This video shows two very different ways of approaching the tug-a-jug puzzle.

review/summary: Entertaining!
review/text: Just a word of advice:  If your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up.  If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.<br /><br />At first, my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy.  It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was "his".  Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)<br /><br />On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.  So, some dogs will take to it, and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak!

review/summary: Great toy but frustrates my dog
review/text: This toy keeps our Boston Terrier entertained for a long time.  We don't give it to her all the time to keep it new and interesting.  It is not easy to get the food out of the toy, which really frustrates her.  She'll start barking at it and going at it harder.  Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to "beat" the system, but I don't see that happening with our dog.  It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out, so what worked for the dog one time, might not the next.  You can make it harder or easier depending on the size and shape of food you use.

review/text: I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob-a-lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob-a-lot.

review/summary: Not Durable
review/text: The item was delivered here in great condition. My 5 month old American Eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. But after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. My puppy didn't even play roughly with it. It could have been dangerous if he ate it. Luckily I was there.

review/summary: My puppy loves it more without the rope attached.
review/text: My large puppy (8 mo., 70 lbs, Doberman/Am. Bulldog mix) needed a lot of help getting the food out while the rope was intact, but after he shredded the rope after about two days of gnawing, everything changed.  I cut the inside knot off and left it inside the bottle so that it would slow down the exit of the kibbles.  So now the kibbles come out much easier, but not too easily.<br /><br />Bottom line, with this slight modification, my puppy LOVES his purple bottle, and the 10 minutes that he spends throwing the bottle around to get his food out is 10 minutes less that he's chewing on things that he shouldn't be or otherwise being naughty.

review/summary: Frustrating for my dog!
review/text: We got the Tug-a-Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's breakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the "tug" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the "tug" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think.

review/summary: Not Strong Enough
review/text: I purchased this toy based on the recommendation from Dr. Ian Dunbar in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577314557">Before and After Getting Your Puppy: The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dog</a> and it was fantastic for about two weeks.<br /><br />The toy was banged up against the wall and table a few times in the normal course of play and the plastic screw-top shattered.<br /><br />My border collie puppy still will play with it now even though it's missing pieces and doesn't hold food anymore. This is great, but it's pretty much become an expensive rope toy.<br /><br />I wish I had known before purchasing that it was so delicate. A much sturdier food dispensing toy has been the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLTOKK">Kibble Nibble Original, 7" tall x 6" dia</a> which has rubber bumpers that prevent the same shattering that happened to the tug-a-jug.

review/summary: Probably a Little too Big for the 'Tween Dachshund
review/text: The dog weighs about 12#, and this is just a little too big and awkward for her to wrangle.  I can draw her into a fierce game of tug of war with it though.  A slightly larger dog might have a better time with it.  The toy itself seems very sturdy, and the screw cap (on the bottom) makes filling very easy.

review/text: I have two boxers, male and female. After about 30 minutes of the expected use, the male grabbed the end of the rope, shook and shattered the plastic threaded bottom right off the bottle against the corner of a door frame.<br /><br />Concept is intriguing for the dogs but the plastic is too brittle. They didn't have the toy long enough to get to chewing on the rubber ball at the end.

review/summary: Fragile bottom splits easily
review/text: My dog loves the tug-a-jug. I've bought three of them and on all of them the bottom has split. The bottom edges and threads split and break off. My dog isn't particularly hard on the toy either, it's only used on the carpet and she doesn't swing it around into walls or furniture. She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws. I really want to recommend this product, but I can't afford to replace it every three to five uses.

So, in theory it is a great toy, in practice, in my house, it's a bust!

review/summary: Tug a jug
review/text: This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.
