review/summary: Honey bunches addict likes this best
review/text: I love Honey Bunches of Oats and have been a fan for years. Of all the varieties out there, I prefer this pecan version the best. It seems to be slightly less sugary tasting than the original, and more flavorful than the almond version. The pecans are delicious. Overall, this is a fantastic everyday cereal. Its light and flakey, yet satisfying so you don't feel hungry again in an hour. Easily my favorite cereal.

review/summary: A Consistently Good Classic
review/text: I have enjoyed this company's chips since they first came out.  Over time, I have found all of their chips to be consistently great.  I haven't had these "Blue Chips" in quite a while - several years - so I wasn't sure what to expect upon ordering them again.  (So many companies will eventually lower product quality over time to cut costs and increase profits.)  No worries there; these are still just exactly as always - great, fresh, crisp, satisfying and healthy chips.<br /><br />I've had these chips in both the salted and unsalted varieties, and both are good.  They also make some with different flavors; one of my favorites has sesame seeds added.  They make other types of corn chips too, such as yellow corn chips (I particularly like the small round shaped ones).<br /><br />I purchased these via Amazon.com from the company VitaCost.  They did an A+ job of rapidly shipping and extremely careful packaging - the best packaging I've seen in any product I've ordered off Amazon, actually.  The chips arrived in perfect condition (well, all bags of chips will have a few broken pieces at the bottom, but these weren't any more broken than ones you get at the local grocery store).  I got a great deal at VitaCost too, they were cheaper than they would be locally, AND I got free shipping for meeting a reasonable low minimum order price (especially considering their careful packaging).

They hold up under the weight of a bean dip I make with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXRU4">Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Black Beans</a>. They are also delicious just by themselves as they are made with sea salt. The ingredients include: organic blue corn, expeller pressed canola oil and/or safflower oil and/or sunflower oil and sea salt. There are no genetically modified ingredients, no artificial colors and they are gluten free.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Nice change from potato chips and popcorn
review/text: Japanese rice crackers come in as many shapes and flavors as potato chips. We enjoy this product because the nori (seaweed) wrap has a hint of soy sauce that pairs nicely with the cracker's mild sweetness.<br /><br />The nori maki crackers are a nice change of pace from potato chips and popcorn. These snacks go especially well with a lager beer and are often served as an appetizer along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A5WSMC">Edamame</a> at Japanese pubs, known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4770030657">Izakaya</a>.

review/summary: Not as Tasty as Japanese Seaweed
review/text: I bought these crackers hoping that they would be similar to some a friend brought back from Japan a few years ago. The cracker is, indeed, similar, but the seaweed wrapper is not. The crackers are dense, fresh, crispy and have a pleasing taste with the merest hint of sweetness. However, the seaweed that is wrapped around them is not very good. It is not salty (a pleasant surprise) and has a slightly fishy taste (which I expected), but the first cracker I ate tasted like fish-scented soap and had a very "chemical" aftertaste. After eating several of these crackers, I have become somewhat used to their taste. I still taste the soap flavor, and the chemical aftertaste is still there, too, but it is not as strong as it was with the first cracker.<br /><br />I am not sure what the manufacturing process is, with what the seaweed may be treated, or what I am going to do with the 11 bags of these I have not yet opened. I AM sure that I do not care for the seaweed wrapping on these crackers and will not buy them again.<br /><br />For anyone interested in where these were made, they were made in China.

review/summary: Love these things
review/text: I am an Army brat.  My father spent 31 years in the Army and until I was 18 years old, my whole life was Army.  Because of that, I was able to live all over the world and try many different things.  One of which was this type of rice cracker.  Now, I am 39 years old and realizing that the downside of living all over the world and trying a lot of things is that many of those things are not available easily in the U.S.  Very much like this cracker.  Oh, I have found them but either the price was too high, or the store stopped carrying them when they ran out.  So, when I found them on Amazon.com, I immediately ordered them.  Now my only problem is that my children love them too which means I have to share.  Guess I should order more.

Even though I only use the vanilla, there are 3 different vanilla flavors.<br />I could buy this same syrup locally for about $5+/ bottle, then add tax and the gas to get to the store that carries it(not all grocery stores have this). But this subscription cuts the cost down to about $3/bottle And it comes to me! Very cool. Thanks, Amazon.

review/text: This tastes fantastic as always.  In fact, in the last couple days I have used it in French Toast batter in lieu of pancake syrup after the fact, and also made terrific vanilla lemonade better than any bottled version I have ever found.  My only gripe is that I do not like the plastic bottles.  I don't know if this is the direction Torani is going as I have in the past purchased my bottles from a food broker, and they have always been glass.  The plastic is not as pleasing aesthetically as I have many flavors on display for a "soda bar".  I have not noticed a difference in taste, but it makes me wonder if that changes over time.

This product, mixed with your favorite vanilla protein powder, a dash of salt, a heaping teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa and whole milk makes a divine protein shake. No corn sugar either!!

Me and the wife enjoy a pot of coffee and sometimes make that on the weekend, but we have different schedules and just want a quick cup (or two) in the morning or afternoon.  MY wife likes instant but I cannot stand the taste of it myself.  These bags are a great alternative!<br /><br />- Tastes like brewed coffee<br />- $0.20 a cup with subscribe and save<br />- Fast and convenient. Stick mug with bag and water in microwave for 90 seconds<br />  and dunk a few times when done.  Some people stick them in a small coffee pot,<br />  but I don't need a coffee maker to clean and on the counter, and nuking is faster.<br />- Like flavor and strength more than the Maxwell House<br />- I take them camping or traveling<br />- They stay fresh for a long time with the individual sealed pouches.  Standard<br />  coffee starts to lose freshness once you cut open the big bag.<br /><br />To save room on the wasted space in the box during storage, you can dump them in a gallon ziplock bag and throw the box away.

review/summary: Break the cycle of overpriced single serve cups of coffee once and for all!!
review/text: Just because these come in a tea bag type of pouch does not mean they can not be brewed in a single cup ($20) coffee pot. I tried this method of brewing single cups of coffee out of disgust with the price of the all-mighty K cups pods. With K cups, I found myself spiraling toward financial ruin simply to enjoy coffee in a single serving cup.<br /><br />So, for A FRACTION of the cost here is what I recommend. Purchase a $20 single serve coffee maker, doesn't matter the brand but this is the exact one I use with the metal permanent filter removed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041GNZSS">Single Serve Coffee Maker</a> ...get the cheapest one you can find. All it is doing is heating water - keep that in mind. Put one of these tea bag style pouches in the filter compartment. Push it down really good in the filter holder and make sure the water won't flow around it as it hits the bag. Sit back and wait, soon you will have a perfect cup of Folgers coffee.<br /><br />I have not brewed a pot of coffee any other way since going to these. I have purchased hundreds of packets and have never been disappointed. I just hope Folgers doesn't realize what they have here and jack up the price.<br /><br />So...cut yourself loose from the K cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out-of-service space shuttles, or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to Harvard.

review/text: This is just like a tea bag - string and all.  I was surprised to see this "coffee bag" because I was expecting actual pods.  I wanted to use them in my Keurig.  As it turns out, these are even better.  I just get the water hot with the Keurig and thenrun it into a cup with the bag. I often make Folgers in my other coffee maker, so this works out fine.  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison of the coffee maker Folgers and the Keurig with Folgers in a bag, but it seems fine to me.<br /><br />At less than half the cost of k-cups, I find this a good choice for me.  I have ordered some Senseo pods to see how they work out.  With Amazon Prime, I'll have them in a couple of days.<br /><br />Of course, everyone's taste is different, and the idea of "coffee bags" might seem sacrilegious to some.

review/summary: Best Cup of Coffee!
review/text: My husband and I LOVE the coffee bags. They brew the perfect cup of coffee every time. My husband, who drinks his black, insists it has a dark chocolate kind of flavor. I just love the fact that it doesn't taste like "brewed" coffee (I'm so spoiled on these bags, I don't drink any type of brewed coffee now). In fairness, I cannot compare this to the taste of the Keurig coffee pod because I haven't tried that yet, but I am able to compare the price. It seems that the best price I've seen runs around $1 per cup of coffee for the Keurig, this is approximately $0.42 per bag. I drink a cup in the morning and one in the afternoon. I'm shocked these haven't had more marketing.

review/summary: OK coffee, convenient -- but Amazon's price is high
review/text: I love coffee. My preference is to fresh grind premium beans myself just before brewing and make the coffee in my French press. Yum! But this process is a lot of trouble and I'm lazy (or as I prefer to put it, "busy"). I've been tempted to get one of the Keurig systems. They make pretty decent coffee and they're easy. But I haven't yet gotten the nerve to spend the $100 for a basic machine. My wife uses a Nespresso machine which I don't like very much. For a long time my compromise was to use pre-ground premium coffee in a standard drip coffee machine. But even this is a little trouble -- have to wash the pot, throw away the used filters -- and the real problem is that I was drinking too much coffee.<br /><br />So I broke down and tried these Folgers single-serve packets. The coffee is okay, not great, but okay. A little better, I think, than coffee from Macdonald's. And it's REALLY EASY. Exactly like making a cup of tea with a tea bag -- same pros and cons. I'm on my third or fourth box now. And I'm usually drinking only two mugs a day, instead of the three or four I used to drink with the drip coffee maker.<br /><br />I have had one problem with the Folgers packets: In quite a few cases, the string gets caught at the top of the bag and when I ripped the bag open along the "tear here" line, I ended up ripping the bag itself and spoiling it. I've spoiled several bags this way. The solution I've discovered is to use a scissors to CUT the bag open, carefully. No problems when cutting. But I forget occasionally and I have continued to have this problem from time to time. Perhaps I'm just buying from a slightly defective lot that was delivered to my local grocery store.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point. I'd love to buy from Amazon -- but the price is too high. That is rarely the case but seems to be the case here. If I understand this correctly, Amazon is selling two 38-packet boxes (total of 76 coffee packets) for $32. Well, I've been buying the 38-packet boxes from my local Albertson's grocery store (Dallas, Texas) for $10 each. And they aren't marked at the store as being on sale.

review/text: I bought these for the office where (usually) I'm the only one drinking coffee. It's a less expensive and more economic alternative to brewing a full pot. The taste is great (much better than I thought it would be), and anyone else I've made a cup for hasn't even noticed a difference in flavor. I will definitely buy these again, and recommend that anyone who is a solo drinker or just looking for the occasional cup do the same.

Yum!<br /><br />They're thick chips and will stand up to any dip you want to pair them with, though dip is certainly not necessary.  They're also not as neon green as the picture indicates.  They look like what you'd want them to, kind of speckled with bits of spinach and artichoke goodness.<br /><br />These are by far my favorite of Jensen's Orchard's offerings, though they're all very good.

review/text: I can't even remember what store I originally discovered these in but I was happy to find them here on Amazon.  Beware the box they come in though as it's rather weak, my chips seemed OK when they arrived but the box was very beaten up and if your delivery guy isn't as good as mine you may end up with some tiny chips.  Even my fiance loves these and he's more of a carnivore, he wouldn't generally think to pick up something veggie like these.  Not that they're all that healthy as they are still potato chips for the most part, but they don't require dip to give them any flavor.

review/summary: Oatmeal alternative
review/text: I'd never heard of Kamut before it showed up in my Gold Box deals (since I had purchased some other Red Mill products), but decided to give it a try based on the positive reviews. I'm glad I did. As a hot breakfast cereal, it has a nutty flavor and a consistency similar to MaltoMeal, but is much better for you! The taste took a little getting used to (it's best with some milk and brown sugar) but I now like it quite a bit. I've added it to my breakfast mix, and alternate it with oatmeal. I've also started mixing in a tablespoon or two of flax seed from time to time. It also goes really well with fresh berries, or even frozen blueberries if you thaw them out first.<br /><br />While not quite supplanting oatmeal as my hot cereal of choice, Kamut has proven to be well worth the purchase; tasty, healthy, and organic. What more can you ask for from a product purchased on a whim?<br /><br />*****UPDATE 07/15/2010*****<br /><br />I tried making the "Pharaohs Muffins" recipe on the back of the package and loved it! I added chopped dates, raisins, and ginger, as well as a pinch of cinnamon. I also omitted the butter and sugar, and instead used apple sauce. The muffins turned out extremely well, and I'll be making them again. My wife also loved them, as did the coworkers I shared them with. They were pretty surprised to find out they clock in at 145 calories and have virtually no fat! So give them a try--they are worth it.

The great think about Kamut is that it goes with many things very well (apples, blueberries, cinnamon, etc).  It is very versatile.  The texture is also very unique and it is an overall very good, unique cereal.  Well worth the try if you've never had it.

review/summary: new way to enjoy a whole food
review/text: I have never eaten something like this, but I like it...alot.  I am pre-diabetic, and whole grains are really important in my daily diet.  It has an odd texture at first (as I never was one to enjoy cream of wheat, or anything 'mushy'), but after a few spoonfuls, you begin to notice that the taste is pleasant and mild.  I add soy milk and fruit (Dole fruit cups are perfect, as they add liquid if it gets too thick) and nuts, and am content all morning long.  There is a recipe on the bag for Pharoah's Muffins...excellent.  Even my husband, when asked about them..said they had a 'pebbly' texture, but that was what made them really good.  Reminicent of a good cornbread muffin perhaps?  I have given away two of the bags so others can be introduced to this, and it will be a staple from now on....try it!

review/summary: Please don't eat Cardboard
review/text: I have Celiac Sprue, and ate Ener-g foods bread during my childhood and teenage years, simply because I needed safe food and there wasn't anything better out there at the time. Now, there is. I commend Ener-g foods for providing truly safe food for those with gluten intolerance and other dietary  restrictions, but it has to be said- their breads are, for the most part, disgusting, and their cookies and other products aren't better. White rice loaf actually used to be my favorite (compared to the alternatives), but it is only edible when toasted, and it is a far cry from the other options now. Please, don't resign yourself to eating this. Try Whole Foods GF bakehouse breads or make your own from Bette Hagman's cookbooks. Once I started baking my own bread and realized how much better it could be, I resolved to never again eat Ener-g foods bread... and I haven't. Occasionally I think, surely it wasn't that bad, and try it One more time- and it just doesn't get better. THe only thing this bread is good for is for stuffing- toasted and slathered in seasonings and soaked in broth, your shoes would probably taste ok too. I'm sorry, Ener-g foods... I do appreciate you. If only your products could compete with the excellent alternatives out there now.

review/summary: Good bread for those on Gluten Free & Dairy Free Diet
review/text: My son is on a gluten free, casein free (GFCF) diet and eats quite a bit of this bread.  Like the another poster has said, if you are Gluten Free only, I suppose you have quite a few options these days. If you are GFCF, then it is difficult to find bread that also does not have the dairy (typically introduced as milk or butter).  We've bought some of the frozen breads that are GFCF from the grocery store, and they are ok. However, it is nice not to have to freeze the bread and just have it available for use without defrosting and fighting to get the slices of bread apart.  I've eaten this bread right along with my son and I think it tastes just fine, and way better than the frozen stuff. I mean, it isn't as soft and squishy as typical bread, but I think it tastes pretty good.  Toasted is always better, but it is fine on its own.  If you do not have a dietary restriction or aren't choosing the bread for its other ingredient differences, you'd probably enjoy other bread over this bread.<br /><br />Note that the bread is specially packaged such that you are not supposed to freeze it before opening. I believe it is supposed to last up to a year using its special packaging. Mileage will vary there, as I've bought loaves from the local grocery that started molding within a few weeks w/o opening them, but have others from Amazon that have lasted a couple months.

review/text: This one of the better GF breads I have tried. The part I like the best is that the packaging is such that it does not have to be frozen before you open it. The flavor is much better after toasting it.

review/summary: Good, convenient
review/text: A good all-around bread, good for toast and sandwiches.  It takes five minutes or so to absorb egg/milk for french toast (the Ener-G light tapioca loaf is much quicker).<br />I had no problems with mold, although I took delivery in the cool part of the year. I kept the loaves in the garage, where it's cooler right now than my pantry. It's been several months, and the bread still seems as fresh as when first delivered.<br />The bread is firm and doesn't crumble at all, unlike another brand I get at the local health food store (which has slightly nicer (softer) texture, but falls apart too easily). Since the local store charges $5 a loaf, these loaves are a bargain in comparison.

review/summary: Great price, good for gluten free
review/text: The price can't be beat for gluten free. Like most GF bread - toast it before you eat it. I like the fact that it has no preservatives but has a 1 year shelf life due to the double vacuum seal technique used. Be careful about subscribe and save though! Something went funky and I ended up getting shipped 60 loaves of bread! My BF also ended up getting duplicate orders of her subscribe and save items. So keep a close eye out!

I'm going to have to mix it with much stronger coffee or throw it out. I could not taste the kona at all. If you are looking for robust kona blend coffee, don't waste your money.<br /><br />On the other hand if you like weak coffee, you may like this. It is smooth, not bitter or acidic.

Blink and your nuts vanish.  Well amazon let me down this time.  I bought a pkg.(12oz)  and then, on amazon also, found 4 six ounce bags, for the same price. Let the buyer beware I guess.  Next, when I received them, they were all melted together. Two messy chunks.  Also, they were advertised as 12 ounce. I was sent 11 ounce packages. For what I paid, 1 ounce is a lot. Oh yeah, and I bought two bags. Double whammy.  Then I wanted them fast soon, so  I paid 4$ extra shipping. Hit the place order button.  $8 dollars shipping.  Whoops . That was $4 PER item.  Well , never again. Next pkg is coming from the local store.  DW

review/text: Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

You can add it to a can of beans and some rice and you don't have to add a single other thing.  Or add half a can of this to your batch of marinara sauce for a fra diablo style.  There are many recipes to use it in, but I value it primarily for its ability to make what you have in the house into a satisfying meal in mere minutes.

review/text: I buy this stuff for the flavor. It is not even remotely hot. The green chile is just above a bell pepper(zero more or less) on the scoville scale. In other words, a joke. Normally, if I want hot, I buy the extra hot, which has been rebranded as just hot now for those interested. That will burn you up. Straight into a bowl and use some Tostitos on it, can't be beat if you can handle it. I mark this down by a mere one star for its absolute lack of heat. This should be the milder version and some other chile should be in the regular version I believe. Perhaps the Chile de Arbol, not tremendously hot and yet does at least give a hint of heat to you when diluted(such as cheese dip).

review/text: I have used and loved Crystal Light Lemonade Drink Mix for years.  However, I have noticed that the taste is much weaker now.  I have to cut the water down to 3 quarts instead of 4 (2 packets)to get the same taste as before.  The drink was already expensive and now even more so. Did the manufacturers think we would not notice???  I gave 2 stars because the taste, with less water, is still very good. I am looking for a substitute because I feel cheated by the manufacturers.

review/summary: UPDATE:  NOT weaker than the version that came in the little tubs!
review/text: I've been drinking Crystal Light lemonade since it first came on the market and I love(d) it.  This stuff now comes in packets instead of those little tubs, which I hope saves them money or reduces the environmental impact or something, because they've pretty much ruined the taste. This is so much weaker than the old stuff that I only use 3/4 of the water called for, which of course raises the effective price.  Why do they always have to "improve" things?  Why couldn't they have just put the old formulation in the new packets?<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE 8/11/11:  OK, I admit it.  I'm an idiot.  Once I read the directions and prepared it properly, this is the same old Crystal Light I've known and loved.  I've just reactivated my Subscribe and Save subscription.  When in doubt, read the directions...

review/summary: Very Tart and Tasty if You Double the Recipe!
review/text: Well, perhaps many people won't need to double it, but I really love the super-tangy flavor I get by mixing nearly an entire one of these little packets into a 18 glass loaded with crushed ice. If the price were much better I'd easily give this a 5 for flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste, unlike the Crystal Light Pomegranate Lemonade flavor, and--also unlike the Pomegranate variety--the lemon flavor is remarkably lifelike.<br /><br />Also docking the stars due to the artificial sweetener. I wish they could make something similar using stevia or at least mostly stevia, if the flavor suffers too much. After drinking over a gallon of this stuff a day for months I did beging to get muscle pain and weakness, but I'm not positive that wasn't just a co-incidence rather than the Aspartame. I tend to gain weight easily, so I reluctantly accept artificial sweeteners into my diet, always hoping stevia will continue to become more mainstream and that Crystal Light can give me that strong, tangy lemonade flavor without the Aspartame, sucralose, etc. Then again, who knows, it may be the tasty artificial lemon that proves deadly!

review/text: I love this drink. I would rather drink crystal light beverages than just about anything else, and they're also much healthier than just about anything. I like to mix half crystal light lemon iced tea and the other half crystal light lemonade. It's like a sweet and tart half and half. As per the instructions one packet makes 2 quarts of beverage, however I find this to be a little too sweet for my taste. I use four packets (eight quarts) in in five gallons of water, I put it in a five gallon water jug and put it on one of those stand alone water coolers with the filter removed. Ice cold half and half on tap, mmm, mmm, good. Amazon has about the best price on crystal light that I have seen, and I can assure you as a crystal light connoisseur I have shopped around. Try it I'm certain you'll love it, although I hazard a guess you'd probably want it sweeter.

review/text: I love a good latte' - which was why I  purchased this Syrup (as well as, the Pumpkin Spice Syrup) - I have always used the Gourmet "Sauce," but decided to give this a try, big mistake! I found it to be bitter and the flavor was harsh, even when dispensing less than a 1/2 of tsp.  To say that I am disappointed would be putting it mildly. I haven't tried using either of these syrups in baked goods, so I am unable to comment on that particular aspect. However, if you are searching for a product to put in coffee to make your favorite hot or cold drink, I recommend purchasing the sauce not the syrup, it is well worth the difference in cost. The sauce is thicker, has a full bodied, authentic flavor and mixes well with hot or cold beverages.
