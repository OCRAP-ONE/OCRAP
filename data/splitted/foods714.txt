review/summary: Oberto beef jerky thin style - good value, a little salty
review/text: Great price for the quantity. The quality is as expected if you have had Oberto's other beef jerky products; however, it seems much saltier than the regular style.

review/text: I love beef jerky, and it's perhaps the one thing standing between me and full-on vegetarianism but this product was too salty, didn't have enough pepper, and the thin strips were not as tasty and chewing a thicker slice of jerky. So, all in all, it was adequate, but Jack Links' peppered beef jerky is a much better choice.

review/summary: Pretty tasty
review/text: These are good, but some points:<br /><br />* The eggs are smaller than what I expected (.6 oz/17g each egg) - probably because they are "snack size"<br />* The chocolate tastes a little weak/waxy<br />* Not as good as the Reese's Christmas Trees (which I give a 5 star rating to)<br />* Could easily get smashed or melt in transit<br />* Mine came with a "best buy" date of 11/2012<br />* Another reviewer says that the ones they got had chocolate that was white in color - that's not the case for me... no "white in color" chocolate here<br />* Contains TBHQ (a preservative)<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: PEANUTS; SUGAR; DEXTROSE; VEGETABLE OIL (COCOA BUTTER, PALM, SHEA, SUNFLOWER AND/OR SAFFLOWER OIL); CHOCOLATE; NONFAT MILK; LACTOSE (MILK); CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: MILK FAT; SALT; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER; TBHQ (PRESERVATIVE).<br /><br />They still taste very good (but not "excellent"). So 4 stars overall.

review/summary: Contains PGRP!
review/text: PGPR<br /><br />December 27, 2009<br /><br />tags: a new ingredient, chocolate, cocoa butter, health, hershey's, low end chocolate, messing with my chocolate, nestle, pgpr<br /><br />by crazybengal<br />.<br /><br />Aww.  What a cute little acronym!  So tiny and innocent.  What are you doing in my chocolate, little PGPR?  You wern't there a few years ago.  Let's find out what you are.<br /><br />PGPR is known in the candy industry as polyglycerol polyricinoleate.<br /><br />Wow.  Cool!  Wonder why they put you in my Hershey's chocolate bar.  Could it be because it makes the chocolate better?<br /><br />Of course not.  PGRP is used to replace the expensive cocoa butter that is normally found in chocolate.<br /><br />Well, is it better for you?<br /><br />Of course not.<br /><br />What you need to know:<br /><br />The 1996 study conducted by Andrew Waterhouse of UC Davis which discovered the phenols (potent antioxidants) in chocolate also revealed that these antioxidants come from cocoa butter and the stearic acid it produces. It demonstrated that the phenols prevented LDL cholesterol from building up in arteries. Another study had subjects follow diets in which the majority of fat calories came from either chocolate or butter; only those with the butterfat diet showed an increase in LDL cholesterol.<br /><br />This is why dark chocolate, which usually contains between about 30% and 50% cocoa butter, is touted for its antioxidant properties, and a bar of Hershey's milk chocolate is not. Unfortunately, Hershey's in particular - one of the biggest users of PGPR - has also moved to take advantage of the new healthier perception of dark chocolate. Not only have they begun buying small high-end chocolate producers like Scharffen-Berger and Joseph Schmidt Chocolates, but they have also expanded their dark chocolate line and begun marketing it heavily as a healthy treat. Besides the irony of their simultaneous replacement of antioxidant-filled cocoa butter with PGPR in their cheaper chocolates, they have put corn syrup in many items from the more expensive and supposedly healthy dark chocolate line.<br /><br />This is the kind of behavior that buying PGPR-enhanced chocolate supports. Dishonest; unscrupulous; pulling the wool over consumers' eyes. Read your ingredient listings carefully, and research the unfamiliar, and you can feed your mind as well as your body.

review/summary: Great taste but arrived somewhat melted
review/text: You probably already know what these taste like.  They're delicious.  If you don't, allow me a moment to describe it - it's peanut butter covered with a layer of chocolate.  The difference with these and standard Reese's cups is these have a higher peanut butter to chocolate ratio - something I think makes them just right.<br /><br />The only negative I have is that due to shipping they'll arrive a bit melted.  Not a huge ordeal, but something that kind of threw off the whole shipment since they're deformed now.  I've noticed they seem to melt in my hand faster too, but that could just be my imagination or a particular batch.  Putting them in the fridge helps though.<br /><br />As a note these are SNACK SIZE, so they are small, but you get a lot of them so it's ok.

UPS had them for a week and I did call Amazon to see if they could do anything since it is perishable you can't return them. All they did was issue me a $5 credit. That did not cover it so I lost a few dollars too in the process. Being late did not bother me as much since you could eat them later. The fact that there was no extra protection bothered me. After being frozen to see if I could bake or put in ice cream, they taste like plastic cardboard.

review/summary: Not real fresh, not stale. Pretty good. Can one be a PBC connoisseur?
review/text: I love holiday candies because they're predictably fresh (as opposed to the regular versions that have been sitting in a warehouse for 6 months - the holiday packaging ensures they're new stock).  Bought these from amazon for a great price despite mediocre reviews.  The reviews are true - this stuff wasn't handled with care - but the candies are still terrific.  They're visually a little waxy (visual eaters take note!) but the flavor is just a notch or two below ideal freshness and at least two notches above the non-holiday versions typically on my grocer's shelf.  Quite good.<br /><br />If you typically eat the Peanut Butter Cup (PBC) form, you may find the flavor of the holiday versions a little different.  The different shapes of the various holiday versions (bunnies, eggs, Christmas trees, etc.) alter the balance of peanut butter to chocolate in each bite.  There is a small finch-egg size PB egg (PBE) that is harder like the mini-cups.  It's actually interesting to geek out on the flavor differences between all the different shapes.  This oval egg is one of my absolute favorites - higher PB-per-bite balance, but still plenty enough chocolate.  The holiday shape versions are softer (no side ridging like the cups to add rigidity), with a different tooth-feel, and not as easy to transport without smushing.  This is a mini version of the soft PBE, and I found the flavor (PB to chocolate balance) virtually identical to the single-serving full-size PBE.<br /><br />If you happen to enjoy holiday PBEs, these mini-eggs are a sensible serving size without sacrificing the yummy texture and flavor of the larger PBEs.

review/summary: Great Bones
review/text: This is s great product for keeping a dog's teeth free from tartar problems.  They are a little smelly while the dog chews them, but not so bad as to be a disadvantage.  To keep them chewing them, I typically let them chew for a while and then take it away and put it in a sandwich bag so it stays somewhat moist and then they get excited to see it coming out of the bag as another chew session.

review/summary: WAY TOO SWEET
review/text: I used to buy this product all the time at walmart, it was always very fresh and not too over powering. Well this improved flavor or what ever you want to call it, is way too sweet. I wanted a meaty protein snack not a big bag of sugar! This product had high marks from me before when i got it from walmart, but i havent seen it at walmart for a long while now, it may have been discontinued so when i saw it here i thought i knew what i was getting into....boy, was i wrong....too much sugar, it has killed the flavor for me. will not be buying this again.

review/text: All of Amazon's food items should have a nutritional guide to view. If I had known the second ingredient on the label was brown sugar with 9 grams of sugar, I never would have purchased the nuggets! The texture of the nuggets is fresh and chewy but too much pepper for our taste and too sweet. My husband likes to take the single serving bag in his lunch for a snack so I thought he'd like to try something other than the strips. Sorry Jack Links but I won't be ordering these beef steak nuggets again!

review/summary: Best Turkish White Cheese!
review/text: Tahsildaroglu Traditional White Cheese is inarguably the best pre-packaged white cheese not only among imported Turkish cheese, but also in Turkey. The fat-salt consistency is perfect, the taste is wonderful, and it has the right texture. Go for the sheep's milk, since it is a better representation of the 'Traditional White Turkish Cheese' (not feta, big difference), better tasting than cow's or goat's. It does not smell like sheep, so don't be turned off by the title.

review/summary: Nice Product! Non-Problemmatic Order from Amazon!
review/text: Ordered this product from Amazon directly, and received the right quantity - all six packets - so I have no problem with my order unlike other reviewers who were short-changed. Overall, pleasing flavor and tastes great with tofu (firm) and cilantro sprigs thrown into the rich gravy.  Not that spicy-hot according to my Asian palate. And yes, I will purchase this again - amongst the closest that I can find that taste-wise, to the real deal in Asia.  Should shipping costs continue to spiral upwards, I would recommend the manufacturer just produce the gravy packets - that's the main attraction for me anyway - thereby reducing the product weight.  Customers can cook their own rice, readily available in the States - either the fragrant white Jasmine rice or the healthier brown rice.

review/summary: ONE box for the price of SIX? (but tasty, if you can get it)
review/text: I was initially very disappointed in this, without having tasted it, because I only received ONE 19.4 oz. box instead of the pack of SIX offered here (and which I was charged for!).  This happened with two other orders for Tiger Tiger products, as well --  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317H96M">Tiger Tiger Indonesian Satay with Cantonese Fried Brown Rice, 19.4 Ounce Box</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317F5LI">Tiger Tiger Pad Thai With Rice Noodles, 19.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />However, customer service made me a full refund (I'd have preferred to receive the other five boxes in my order, but apparently that wasn't possible at the time), so I was able to use my one box without feeling cheated, and it was quite good . . . WITH a bit of 'doctoring'.<br /><br />In addition to sauteeing vegetables (broccoli, sweet peppers, onion, and halved cherry tomatoes from the garden) and thinly sliced chicken breast with garlic and ginger before adding the sauce, I found I needed to add a bit of soy sauce and a pinch of brown sugar to the sauce, in order to mellow out the too-strong (for me) taste of fish sauce in the sauce, and finish with fistfuls of fresh Thai basil leaves from my herb garden.  After that, it was WONDERFUL.

The person issued me a refund and was told:  "I'm so sorry the information about Tiger Tiger Thai Red Curry With Jasmine Brown Rice, 19.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6) was misleading when you placed your order. We use many sources to build our website information, and we really appreciate knowing about any errors which find their way into our listings.

review/text: This was the third order of brownies we ordered, and they were great as usual. The only issue with this particular order was the brownie count, it came with the 17 items as mentioned, and it had 2 large brownies, 4 cookies, coffee, and then an assortment of regular sized brownies and some mini brownies. The mini brownies were good, but for the price would have liked to have seen just more regular sized in the box versus the mini sized. Still a great product.

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: De-Licious with perfect packaging
review/text: Leibniz cookies are truly my favorite, beyond what I make, I am a passionate cook. The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery. Bon appetit.

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Not bad, in the second tier of Chef Tom's Rubs
review/text: As Chef Tom says, 'Don't be afraid of curry!'.  There's a light but distinct curry scent to this mix that works beautifully on shrimp, scallops, and white fish (catfish, orange roughy, red snapper).<br /><br />For those of you who who don't like the 'burn' curries can impart, no worries - the bark is definitely stronger than the bite in this case. It fades to practically non-existence on more distinctly flavorful 'red' fish such as salmon and tuna.  It's too weak for pork, let alone beef. (To be fair though, it wasn't really designed for these types of meat).<br /><br />This spice isn't quite as good as the two knockouts in Chef Tom's collection: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>  - but it is yummy.  I suggest drizzling this into your potato or pasta salad instead of paprika to give things an exotic punch!

review/summary: Bitter!
review/text: I ordered these supposedly sweet peas from this seller and couldn't wait to try them.  They sprouted well, but were bitter.  I originally thought I had done something wrong in the sprouting process, but I decided to try an unsprouted dry seed.  I rinsed it and it was bitter before I even started the sprouting process.  I contacted the seller directly to let them know they may have a bad batch.  The seller told me that some people rave about the sweetness of her peas and some say they are bitter.  I've gardened for years and the only time peas are bitter are when they are overripe.  The seller should be tasting and testing the batch before buying it.  She did not apologize at all.  The garbanzo bean sprouts I bought tasted fine so I think it's this batch of peas.  I wanted to get a replacement, but was afraid it would be bitter as well.  The seller was nice enough to check the lot number for me and it was the same so I decided to go for a refund instead which I needed to do through Amazon.

We just keep eating them.<br /><br />If you haven't had a Lindor truffle before, it's a very-very creamy/clean/rich chocolate taste. The dark-chocolate (Blue) tastes like milk chocolate, the milk chocolate (red) tastes like white chocolate and the white chocolate (Yellow) tastes like sweet and condensed milk. It's really really delightful chocolate and I'd rather have these around for quick treats to pop in my mouth than a cake or cookies or something else with a ton of carbs in it.<br /><br />I'm usually a pretty classic-desert kind of guy (Twix, Snickers, etc.) but these are delicious. You can buy this 12-pack as gifts for others or just keep them around the house yourself -- either way it's a great buy.
