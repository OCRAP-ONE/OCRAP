review/summary: Addictive and amazing
review/text: I had first tried that Goya Mojo. It was good, made a killer marinade, but it wasn't my thing.  Then I tried this.  This is the most amazing thing I have ever put into my mouth.  It made every awesome dish I made godly.  If you aren't one for tangy, salty or citrusy, yeah, I'd avoid it, but I LOVE all three and this is a perfect blend!  The garlic they add isn't too overpowering either, so it makes this the perfect addition to any dish.

review/summary: Excellent, organic whole grain corn meal
review/text: Just like the description says, it's whole grain organic cornmeal. Well, the description on the producers website says that :)<br /><br />It's getting very difficult to find real organic, non-gmo corn, and this is one of the few producers still offering it and at an excellent price. I got a bag before prices start going up ($27.05 / 25lb)

review/summary: Great Corn meal, Great Price!
review/text: I have been looking for organic non-GMO corn to put up for storage. Trying to keep Monsanto out of my pantry is very hard. I read a review that said this product was non-GMO and I cannot find that on the packaging anywhere. I still am very happy with the purchase and the packaging of the this product. It didn't leak into the box like flours sometimes do. Will be eager to give it a try before I pack it away.<br /><br />Correction: I have been educated and found that this is in fact a non-GMO product and that just makes it all the better. I will be buying this product again, very soon.

review/summary: Perfect Chew Treat
review/text: As pup-parents to 3 corgies, we've been looking for the perfect chew treat...this is it!<br /><br />Our pups love to chew, but we've had a tough time finding a product we can all live with. Our senior girl has brittle teeth & can't take on anything too hard, our middle-aged boy doesn't digest rawhide well, and the baby of the bunch gets bored easily. As for us, we aren't fond of anything that stains, stinks or stabs at their intestines!<br /><br />Bonies are just right for each pup: hard enough to be chewed on for a while, soft enough to digest without sharp edges. There's no greasy feel or rancid smell. They actually smell pretty good to me and GREAT to the dogs - open the bag & their noses go into overdrive! When finished, there's no evidence left behind (no spots or stains) and the dogs have fresher breath & happy, silly grins. By contrast, Greenies are too soft for them (more like something to eat,than something to chew), plus we've always been leery of giving them a wheat-based product.<br /><br />Hooray for Bonies!

review/summary: Kids loved it!
review/text: A few weeks ago we had a picnic party where several couples had kids who did not like fresh fruit.  We purchased Mandarin Orange fruit cups (and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UQ2SH6">Del Monte Cherry Mixed Fruit Cups - 16/4 oz. cups</a>) as an option for desert hoping to please them.  I am happy to report they they liked the fruit cups!<br /><br />Mandarin Oranges was the favorite choice with both kids and adults, at the end of the day there were no Mandarin Orange cups left (there were a few Cherry fruit cups left).  The fruit cups are 80 calories and 18 grams of sugar which is pretty good (a fresh apple, for comparison, is on average is 80 calories and 15 grams of sugar)<br /><br />I recommend these fruit caps as an option to a healthy desert!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Works for Nepresso Capsules if kept in the Sleeve!!
review/text: I bought this to use with my Nespresso Essenza Machine and Capsules.  Nespresso capsules are quite a bit smaller and ended up falling out the sides. I was prepared for this scenario and took a chance.  My son came up with a great idea for the capsules...we keep them in the sleeves they come in, which fit perfectly!  I love that my Nespresso can sit on top of it and the capsules are right there.  The only bad thing is that my machine vibrates a bit but it is missing a rubber foot or two. After  I take care of that, I expect it to be perfect.  So...in the end, this isn't just for the Keurig! I put up a picture with my Nespresso machine and capsules, check it out to see if it will work for you :)

review/summary: Great product, but drawer could be improved
review/text: I have a mini Keurig brewer and this is the perfect size for it in my small kitchen.  It doesn't really eliminate me taking up cabinet space just because if I have, let's say, 3 varieties...there are not enough spots in the drawer.  This is to be expected though as it tells you it can only hold 24.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the convenience of not having to root around in my cabinet to find the k-cup I want, and that seems to be the main goal here.<br /><br />I will say though, the drawer could really be improved.  You kind of have to jiggle the drawer a bit to make it come out, and hold down the top plate so that it doesn't slide around the counter top.  They could have also thrown some rubbery grips on the bottom of the drawer so that I didn't get that 'nails on a chalkboard' sound when it slides on my granite counter top.<br /><br />That being said, I knew most of this when I went to purchase the product, and because of the convenience and the price...it was worth it to me.

I got to thinking, if they are so cheap and I like them so much, I should try to buy a case. My first thought was to come to Amazon where I do a lot of my online shopping, but I was amazed to see how ridiculously expensive they are here! $30-40 for a 24 pack, when they sell for 99 cents a piece?! Other big name bulk stores have these cases for less than $20. Not sure why exactly they are so expensive here, but definitely look elsewhere.

review/text: I have loved Black Jewel for several years now and have introduce many friends to it, who now love it too. Or used to. With the last case we bought online, that has now changed. I read a review at that time that said they had changed their bags and that it had affected how their corn is now popping. That customer was right. I now get a little over half per bag of what I used to get. The taste is the same but the amount that pops is woefully deficient. I've tried different microwave settings and still get the same results. What a shame!  I suppose we'll continue our lifelong search for a great popcorn brand. Nothing else came close to Black Jewel but the value is now gone.

review/summary: New Bags Pop Terrible (Was: Best Microwave Popcorn)
review/text: Updated Review: January 31, 2010<br />--------------------------------<br />The original review below was for black Jewel popcorn that I purchased about 6 months ago from Amazon.  After loving that one we bought a second case.<br /><br />In the second case, the popcorn kernels seems the same but the microwave bags are completely different.  The new bags are brown in color and say: "Being conscientious of our environment we have chosen to use unbleached natural paper microwave bags".  (The old bags were white and felt like all other microwave popcorn bags.)<br /><br />The problem is that the new bags are VERY inconsistent in how they pop the corn.  In the same microwave that we used with the previous bags, you now either get half unpopped kernels AND/OR burned popcorn.  This is with the same amount of cooking time and settings as before.  (We tried varying the time/wattage and it is even inconsistent between bags with the same settings.  i.e. It will burn at 2:10 on one bag and on the next bag won't be half-popped at 2:10.)<br /><br />I can't be 100% sure that it is the bags but:<br />1) We didn't have this issue before with the old case.<br />2) Of the kernels that pop without burning they taste the same as before.<br />3) Visually the bags appear to be the only change.<br /><br />We've almost ran thru all 18 microwave bags that come in the case...  (At least 15 of them.)  Getting half popped corn or having to throw the bag of burned corn the rest of the time.  This issue has happened for ALL of the bags we've tried to pop with the new brown bags.<br /><br />I guess we'll try just buying the loose kernels since they ruined the microwave version.<br /><br />NOTE:  Our microwave is not much more than 6 months old...  So I don't think it is that.<br /><br />Original Review (5 stars): January 10, 2010 (Before we opened the new case)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Simple Review:  This is the best microwave popcorn we've found.  My wife is a popcorn nut and she's tried everything you can get in the stores and many of the online brands...  (She even likes this better than the kind you pop on the stove.)<br /><br />Microwaving Tip:  If you have a 1200+ Watt microwave cut the power back to 80% or more.  You'll get better tasting and more consistent popcorn.  (An Inverter Microwave is better at this since it cleanly cuts to 80%.  It isn't on 80% then off 20% of the time like old microwaves.)<br /><br />We have a 1250 Watt Panasonic Inverter microwave.  At 100% power it will burn at around 2:10 or sometimes less.  (I won't put any other times in here.  You have to determine the best setting for your microwave.)<br /><br />So cut the power back and find the right time for your microwave...  It makes a significant difference in taste & consistency.

review/summary: The Best Microwave Popcorn Period!
review/text: I bought a box of this at a local grocery store. My husband who is a popcorn nut fell in love with this. Now we take a box with us where ever we travel. I buy on Amazon because it is much cheaper and we buy a few of these packs of 6. We also give it as a thank you present after we have stayed with someone. Everyone that has tried it says it is very yummy. Even this Natural one doesn't need the butter on it and I love butter on my popcorn...but don't have to have it on Black Jewell. I come from popcorn country in the mid-west and this is the best we have ever tried!

review/summary: Yup.  Best Microwave Popcorn, By Far
review/text: To me, there is NOTHING like popcorn popped on the stove top.  I have a Whir-li-pop or whatever it's called.  It's made in Wisconsin and has the cranked handle which allows you to stir the corn while cooking to avoid burning and insure even cooking.  I'm not a fan of air-popped corn.  It takes the character out of the corn.<br /><br />Microwave popcorn, in my experience, has always been a bit on the chewy side, sometimes too salty, and occasionally tasting processed.<br /><br />THEN I discovered the Black Jewell microwave popcorn.  While you have to be careful not to cook too long (it cooks pretty quickly), this popcorn comes out crunchy, not too oily, natural tasting and with just the right amount of salt.  It comes pretty darn close to stove top popped.  The hulls are very small here, so by the time they kernels are popped, what's left is mostly the white, but there is the tiny black center.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this popcorn a try.  I go out of my way to look for it now locally.  Much harder to find, but if you buy it here and like it, see if you find a local retailer to carry it.

It reminds me more of smell & taste of fresh yeast donuts with a little salt - SO, very satisfying.  We're fans now and way never go back to Orville!

review/text: This popcorn is delicious.  If you are sharing one bag with two other people, I highly recommend.  But if you customarily eat a whole bag by yourself, I would not recommend this.  It has too much sodium and fat for my taste.  Again, that's just my personal opinion. I really like natural popcorn (without a lot of extra things added); this wasn't natural enough for me.

review/text: We love this popcorn.  It tastes fantastic and we like that it is just salt and oil instead of butter.  We've ordered it 2x and have the microwaving down to a science.  it's also interesting that the kernels are so white and compared to the rest, it pops or at least half pops about 95% of the kernels in the bag.

review/summary: Blows the DOORS off Orville Redenbacher's
review/text: Have been struggling to find popcorn that I liked as well as Orville's 50% less fat natural; almost immediately the new owners of the company discontinued it. Too healthy and simple, I guess. So I took a chance on this popcorn and I must say it's great. Takes longer to pop than Orville's, for some reason (at least 2:30 in my microwave vs. 2:05 max for Orville's), but worth the wait. The taste is better, it pops more kernels, and it is much less oily than many of the Redenbacher varieties. I'm a fan!

review/summary: The Best - No need to add anything
review/text: 9/24/12: I just gotta add that not only can I not stop eating this stuff, I cannot stop sending to everyone I know. Boxes of this popcorn or being flown all over the country to friends and family. It is just fun to share this new discovery....<br />This popcorn truly is the best I have ever had including theater, stove-top, air-pop, jiffy-pop, etc. It is light, fresh, and very crunchy, with the right touch of salt - for me anyway. My husband does want more salt on his. We found this popcorn to be so flavorful that addition of butter or other seasonings just aren't wanted.<br /><br />In our microwave, 2mins and 20 secs gets nearly every kernel popped. The remaining partially popped kernels (old maids as we used to call them) are softer than other brands so accidentally eating one does not gum up the bridge work or break a tooth.<br /><br />Note for those with food allergies - we tried the butter flavor and it caused me, an asthma sufferer with food allergies, to seriously cough and choke. The ingredients look pretty innocent so I tried the butter flavor a few times just to make sure. - Results were unfortunately the same each time -- me grabbing for the rescue inhaler and giving the bowl to someone else to finish.<br /><br />Looking at the short, simple list of ingredients, it is not clear what about the butter flavor causes the allergic reaction, unless there is something actually in the "natural butter flavor" itself - perhaps it is an extract of some type. Don't know, but stick with the plain and, at least for this allergy sufferer, all is fine.

review/text: I normally like popcorn that has a lot of added flavor (butter, cheddar, caramel, etc...) but I also wanted to have something healthier on hand for when I have more health conscious friends over.  I didn't want plain popcorn though or anything that was so tasteless that I didn't want to eat it either though.  I am happy to say that this is perfect for that.  Because it is salted, I won't say that this is a healthy snack, but it is a much healthier option than most other types of popcorn and it still tastes great.

review/summary: Not up to par
review/text: Well, I guess I should've taken the cue from the first reviewer. Yep, this millet is inedible, completely. Not adequately dehulled. I guess I figured that they had fixed the problem based on the second review given. They certainly had plenty of time in the last year to beef up quality control. So, I took a chance. Hey, maybe it's a hit or miss thing. Or perhaps the second reviewer didn't boil theirs, but ground it into flour and so didn't notice the problem. (?) Anyway, I am very familiar with cooking millet and using it instead of rice and I would classify what I received as not fit for human consumption. Guess you get what you pay for! Of course there is no returning this item. Oh well, perhaps the birds will like it.

For the calories they aren't bad at staving off hunger(2.5, 3.5 hours tops). But they are so SO yummy . I can't get enough of them! They are a bit sweet, but I have a lower tolerance for sweet things. You can also tell the sweet taste is very natural. They go perfectly with milk, or just by themselves. The only problem I have is when I finish, I find myself wanting more. On the whole, a fantastic product.

review/text: I have eaten these bars every day over the last month and they are soft and moist, with chewable flakes of coconut and tasty bits of dark chocolate, not tipping the scales of tastiness in any one direction.  They fend off hunger and stay with you for nearly three hours (oats?).  I find that this was a very good buy, in that it added fiber and tasty chewiness to my diet. Since I cannot consume very much of anything which contains corn products, this was an excellent find.  Add to all this, it is fairly organic and almost gluten free.  I am enjoying my dietary obedience now. Thank you Pamela!

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

review/summary: Great Quality Tarragon!
review/text: This is a great quality tarragon for the price.  I would encourage anyone to try it.  It is so fresh and soft, and, I have tried a lot of dried Tarragon brands.  When it comes to this quality of dried tarragon, combined with the quantity, this is the best deal I've seen so far, even with the postage.

review/summary: Fragrant & Tasty!
review/text: I have been purchasing this Paprika for at least a year, and am very impressed with not only the price, the flavor, the strength, and the speed of shipping, but when compared with the prices in the store this is beyond a bargain, and to top it off the quality is superb. I love it so much I joined subscribe and save to get it sent every three months. When I first tried this paprika I thought there was no way I would be able to use five pounds. Was I ever wrong, the flavor is outstanding, and has become a go to spice for so many of our favorite dishes.

review/summary: Raspberry Tea and Hibiscus, Yum!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Disappointing to Say the Least
review/text: I lived in New England for 26 years and have eaten more than my fair share of lobster bisque. It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />The stuff that came out of the can is very dark orange-colored which is not typical for lobster bisque, devoid of any flavor, and just plain gross. It could not be eaten out of the can because of the dreadful flavor. There is no cream in this soup and any bisque is heavy with cream. There's milk, wheat flour, and teeny dots of lobster. I'm a good cook but I doubt that I can doctor this up to taste like anything worth eating.<br /><br />When I read the other negative reviews, I thought...oh well. Folks from other parts of the country don't know what real lobster bisque tastes like, but surely Bar Harbor is doing it right.  WRONG. As a New Englander, I know what good lobster bisque tastes like and it's not this.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy mystery food and dislike lobster, I'd advise against purchasing this.

review/text: The reviewer Jo Ana Starr is right, this canned "lobster bisque" is plain gross.  I am a lifelong New Englander and I've been enjoying lobster bisque for 30 years...this stuff is NOT lobster bisque. It's an odd-colored concoction of canola oil, milk, and "native tapioca starch." I paid $3.89 for a (tiny) 10-oz can, and I'm very disappointed. There is so much canola oil in it, you can feel it on your tongue.  No lobster flavor at all.  It's a travesty that they're using the name "Bar Harbor."

review/summary: Bad batch??
review/text: We just bought 3 cans for $3.00 each at JobLot.  Granted, JobLot is a discount place and these cans sell for $5.00 each. We love Lobster Bisque. We love all types, restaurant, canned, supermarket, whatever....  We opened up one can up today and four of us tried it. It tasted horrible!!  It was brown and tasted like bad fish.  No lie. All of us were repulsed.  I looked up the reviews on the internet, like here, thus wondering if Bar Harbor made a bad batch and sold them off to Job Lot. Anyways, we have two more cans to try. We will certainly not buy this brand again.

review/summary: This Stuff's Gross
review/text: Shame on the Bar Harbor Soup Company for falsely inflating their review, with a five-star one of their own. The color doesn't bother me, but the taste certainly does. It's just not lobster bisque. I don't expect much from a can in the first place, but this falls far below expectations. It is edible, but not by much.<br /><br />A few years ago in California lobster bisque was quite hard to come by, so I paid five dollars for a can of this stuff. Waited expectantly while it cooked and threw it all out after the first bite. This product is a bust. Sad though, because the city of Bar Harbor, Maine has some of the best lobster bisque in New England.

review/summary: Clarification from the manufacturer...
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2DQ8M">Bar Harbor All Natural Lobster Bisque, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Thanks to all who reviewed this product! We appreciate the conversation and realize there can be quite a variety of opinions on any food item based on the vast majority of palates and individuals' past experiences with foods.<br /><br />As a Downeast Maine company that has been producing Lobster Bisque from a local recipe since 1917, it is believed that the recipe, handed down from previous generations, was the most accurate rendition of this regional soup. This is not to say that it is the only recipe or the most popular in this genre of soup, as bisque originated in France and was handed down through immigrants who settled in the Canadian maritimes and then migrated to coastal Maine.<br /><br />The original recipe included the tomalley, or liver, of the lobster and provided a truly robust seafood flavor and a deep orange tone to the finished product. With concerns over mercury in seafood, the recipe has been modified in recent years and a larger quantity of minced lobster has replaced the tomalley. This along with a bit of paprika gives the soup its distinctively strong color. The recipe does not include any tomato products. As to the cream content, milk is an ingredient to create the true bisque texture, however, we intentionally leave the soup in a semi-condensed state to allow the customer to prepare the product to their liking. By adding a bit more milk or cream and a dash of sherry at the end of gently heating the bisque, true restaurant-quality lobster bisque can be achieved.<br /><br />This is one of our most popular soups and at over 20 annual international trade shows it receives rave reviews. Thought we realize we cannot please every palate, we believe the majority of our lobster bisque connoisseurs provide us the confirmation that we are making a high quality, great-tasting Lobster Bique.<br /><br />Bar Harbor Foods is now on Facebook, so please "Like" us if you enjoy our products and we appreciate hearing from all of our customers!<br /><br />~ Bar Harbor Foods

review/text: I found this Bar Harbor lobster bisque at my small "Shurfine" grocery store.  It was expensive at $4.69 a can but I bought it to try.  I added about 1/2 can of milk and some port wine and a little salt and I thought it to be very good.  Had plenty of lobster and smelled like lobster.  I didn't find it strong of tomato.  Bisque is made with tomato.  If you want chowder you buy clam chowder.  I guess you can't please everyone's taste buds.  I would definitely purchase again.

I usually don't purchase ready prepared or short-cut items because I am very particular about the food I serve; however, once I tried these, I've kept them on-hand for hurry up meals.  If the directions are followed and you stir in the cheese while the product is hot, they're wonderful.  I make them on top of the stove - and if the liquid gets too low I add a little more milk; then afterwards I sprinkle with a few bacon bits and place in the oven for a short while. I am dismayed that I can no longer find this product in the store.

Couple of tips, though; be sure to stir the product well before cooking or the potatoes will stick together, and add bacon crumblies!  This is up there with mac and cheese for a family fav here now.

review/text: I just saw and bought these recently because they looked just like the Girl Scout cookies I have always loved over the years ... SAMOA cookies.  If you are a fan of the classic Girl Scout Samoa, then you will undoubtedly love these.  Not sure how or why Keebler decided to bring this cookie to the regular store shelf, but it's a winner.  For a little history: Keebler-Wyl Bakery became the official baker of Girl Scout Cookies in 1936.  It's only natural that the recipes and cookies would make it to the consumer shelf.<br /><br />When you can't find a Girl Scout selling cookies and you need a fix ... these will do.  Love "Thin Mints"?  Try these:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYDGZW">Fudge Shoppe Grasshopper (Mint) Cookies, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />I feel like I hit the jackpot.  Not that I won't still support the Girl Scouts (cookie sales are integral to their fund raising efforts) but sometimes the cookie availability is not there.<br /><br />Yummy, yum yum!  Love Samoas?  You will love these too!

Keebler's 8.5 oz retails for under three dollars and can even be found on sale for much less.

review/summary: Good Product but Suspicious Behavior
review/text: Brown Rice Flour is a staple in my household due to the digestive needs of my household, so I needed to find a way to purchase it in bulk without buying out Whole Foods every month when I went so I checked on Amazon since I had Prime. It was really awkward at first and we considered not purchasing the item because instead of a bag of Brown Rice Flour or the like, there's a bottle of Calcium/Magnesium plus minerals liquid vitamin. And not even by the same company that the rice flour is claimed to be from. But we've always had a good experience buying from Amazon, LLC. So we risked it, knowing we could get our money back if something was wrong.<br /><br />Yet, once we got it and liked the product I went to bookmark it's location on Amazon and came across the fact that it was now TWICE as expensive as it had been, and we're not talking a $2 item going up to $4 but a $34 going up to $69. That's a helluva large chunk. I get Rice flour at retail for about $1.99 from Whole Food's. At $34, this was just slightly cheaper but now it's even more expensive to buy as a bulk than I'd have to pay at Whole Foods? I won't be purchasing again. Not only that, but now despite the fact that I bought it from Amazon, LLC in my orders list, the link sent me back to it now being sold by Nutricity. It may be more of an annoyance to buy from Whole Foods, but at least I know the price won't change on me the moment I purchase another bag.<br /><br />Five Points/Five Stars<br /><br />1. Item Quality - Good<br />2. Company Behavior - Bad<br />3. Timeliness - On Time (Amazon Prime)<br />4. Price - Was good, changed the moment I bought it = Bad<br />5. Experience - Bad<br /><br />To make a note, I know it's expensive to ship something which is the reason I suspect the price was changed when they realized that with Prime they had to cover a helluva shipping price but they should have figured that out before putting an item up for sale. I would have been buying a 25# bag every month or so at that price and now they've lost me as a customer completely because of their bad practices.

review/text: Excellent muffin mix. Add in blueberries or peaches and it makes quite a few more muffins than the box estimates. Only muffin mix I will buy.

review/summary: REALLY yummy
review/text: Very moist, freezes well.  My 9 YO loves the mix with added banana with chocolate chips.  I have tried raspberry and cranberry as well.  Have tried many mixes so far, and this one is a keeper.

review/summary: the best!
review/text: So far this is the best gluten free muffin mix. I've tried so many products available out there. I was actually shocked that this one was sooooo good. I didn't think that gluten free baking products can ever be that good compared to regular ones. I'd prefer this over a regular muffin. I add berries. There's no grainy texture and the flavor is good. My daughter is gluten free (I'm not) and it feels good to enjoy food together and not have to have separate food. I'm just so sad that the only specialty store that has this brand in our area is no longer selling it. I'll have to get it online now.

review/summary: Super light fluffy muffins
review/text: These muffins are dangerously tasty! It's hard to not eat them all immediately. They are light, springy and sweet without being too sweet. I've made them with fresh blueberries and dried cranberries--both were excellent. Made these for guests recently--none of whom are gluten free and they all raved about them and ate at least two per person. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Muffin
review/text: I loved these muffins! I added a cup of blueberries instead of the recommended 1.5 cups. It was plenty! I didn't taste the nutmeg like some of the other reviewers stated, and I thought they had a nice flavor-- I don't think they tasted gluten-free at all, and my gluten-loving husband agrees!! They have been out of the oven for an hour and half of them are already gone :)<br /><br />I look forward to buying this mix more often and trying out different mix-ins: chocolate chips, pumpkin+streusel, cranberry almond, etc. These are fabulous and so versatile!!<br /><br />The box says that it makes 12 muffins, but after adding the blueberries, I made a batch of 16... not too shabby for a gluten free mix!!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This is the best taste and best result I can get. I tried other brand but the taste was far worse than this one. Interestingly, I can't found this from Whole Food. I used olive oil to replace butter, it is good and healthy.

review/summary: Moist and WONDERFUL
review/text: Wow. I have tried a lot of GF stuff over the past 8 years and I have to say this is something I will buy over and over. It's been 8 years since i had a muffin and these were just like I remember muffins being! It could have been a regular wheat flour one! It calls for 1.5 cups of chips or whatever-add-in, but I put in less than 1 cup of little choc chips and they were SO good. Moist, great flavor, not grainy texture. AND they didn't dry out in a day like GF corn muffins or cookies seem to. If I have a complaint at all it's that they are WAY TOO expensive.

review/summary: Light and they freeze well!
review/text: These muffins made me so so happy. They didn't crumble in my hands, they didn't weigh 5 lbs, and they froze/reheated well which is important to me since I only bake GF for myself (although these were honestly so good, I ate WAY more than I should have before saving the rest for another day!). TRY THEM.

review/summary: Delicious, and surprisingly passable as a normal muffin!
review/text: Ok, I agree that there was a strong scent of nutmeg when you opened the bag, but I don't find it overpowers the flavor of the muffin. But, I like nutmeg and keep whole nutmegs to freshly grate into my baking, so I might not be the best to say it's not too overpowering.<br /><br />The first time I made these I didn't pay enough attention to the instructions. I figured hand mixing would probably be fine, and my batter was super thick. I made 'coffee cake' muffins with a layer of streusel inside, then a little on top. They completely caved in and while they actually tasted good they were a huge crumbly mess and had holes in the center.<br /><br />The second time I made them I did it exactly as instructed and they turned out great. I put in 1.5C of fresh blueberries and they did sink to the bottom. I found that to be too many as well, it was just a mouthful of blueberry in the lower half and no cake. Next time I'll just use fewer blueberries. But they rose well, stayed in one piece (so long as I was gentle with them, not for toddler hands), and tasted fantastic! I would say almost the same as gluteny muffins. They were light, airy, spongy, and delicious. I sprinkled the tops with a touch of plain white sugar just for fun.<br /><br />I'll make these again and again. I like not having to mix out a million flours and starches that are light as air and fly all over my kitchen when I make homemade recipes. So I'll take the convenience, I think King Arthur hit the mark on these!<br /><br />4/5 stars b/c if you follow the instructions, they are a total pain to make, to be honest, and b/c they don't really brown on top, take a little longer than expected to bake, and still have a tendency to crumble if you're not careful. But pretty darn good for a boxed mix.

review/summary: These are awesome!
review/text: This muffin mix is awesome! When you first open the package, the nutmeg smell is pretty strong. At first I was worried that it would be too overwhelming but it wasn't. I made a sampler batch (using oil instead of butter) of cinnamon muffins, blueberry muffins, and chocolate chips muffins and they were all delicious. I had to remind myself that they were in fact gluten free and I wasn't going to get sick from them! Now my sister and I are both addicted to these, they taste just like the muffins we grew up on.

review/summary: Complicated directions, excellent results!
review/text: The whole family (including the still gluten-eating grandparents) enjoyed these muffins.  The texture was wonderful.  We did see that our "mix-ins" mostly sank to the bottom, but I did not mix until thickened as the directions stated.  There were a lot of very specific directions - read carefully before you start.  I see several others had issues with nutmeg - I did not notice any nutmeg in the recipe at all - the flavor of the base recipe was perfect.<br /><br />(We used Dari-free milk in the recipe and added in frozen blueberries and mini chocolate chips, with cinnamon sugar on top)

review/summary: Essential for Gluten Free Baking
review/text: Combine Millet flour with White Rice Flour (3/4 C Millet + 1/4 White Rice) for most baking recipes.  The White Rice gives the Millet the needed glutinous texture to resemble gluten flours.  You can use most recipes by just substituting this combination. I caution you not to open the Amazon box or the inner box with a box cutter or anything that might puncture the bags of Millet flour. I learned this by experience and having to repackage the product.  Happy baking!
