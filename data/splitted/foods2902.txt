review/summary: Artificial sweetener spoils the taste
review/text: I love hot cider, however this one didn't taste great to me. The artifical sweeteners spoils the taste. When it brews the caramel apple scent is just wonderful, and makes you want to try it, but I think it would taste much better if no sweetener was added and you could sweeten it to your taste.

review/summary: Cant use this in a Keurig!!!  WTF!
review/text: This product doesn't fit into a  Keurig K-Cup Brewer.  You just use a knife to puncture the lid, dump it into a cup, and fill it with hot water.  Could use a Keurig to fill it, I suppose.  Wasted 3 until I realized this.  I gave it 1 star because it tasted OK.  Use the Keurig name to charge extra.  Not acceptable.

review/text: I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.  I would've had a clue that I couldn't drink it.  Ingredient labeling should be mandatory.  It certainly wasn't advertised correctly and completely wasted my money.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty. It's warming and relaxing on a chilly fall day. I don't ever drink anything that is sweetened with sugar and I am used to the flavor of aspartame so I found no odd flavors in this at all. I also bought the natural apple cider ones made by Green Mountain Coffee from my local BB&B because they are so expensive on Amazon. I found that I actually don't like those as much as the Grove Square. They are very acidic and don't contain any of the delicious seasonings. If I doctor up the plain apple cider with a shot or 2 of Torani sugar-free brown sugar and cinnamon flavoring then the Green Mountain version almost tastes as good as these Grove Square cider cups. If you regularly use artificial sweeteners in your beverages then I don't think you will be at all disappointed in the flavor of the Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups.<br /><br />As a side note, I always clean out my used K-cups in order to put them in my recycling. Because they contain an instant powder, there is nothing left behind in the Grove Square cups. The Green Mountain apple cider cups contain a really gross mush of nasty reconstituted apple. It's a little off putting.

review/summary: Horrible, spend a lil more and get green mountain
review/text: I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand. Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened. When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway. Luckily one of my roommates enjoyed it so was not a total lose.

The apple taste is pure, the caramel is spot on and the ease of use is outstanding.  Thanks Amazon & Grove Square.  I have this on subscription order for every 2 months.  This will be good for my emergency preparedness "stash" also.  Wow!

review/text: All of the other reviewers seem to be in uproar.  I understand the statements knocking the "caramel" flavor, it is admittedly not very appealing.  The Cider flavor on the other hand is wonderful.  In fact, I would go to say that the Cider K-Cup is my favorite K-Cup product.  My family uses our machines daily (sometimes hourly) and when we have it, the Cider pack is one of everyone's favorites.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it's taking 3-5 weeks to ship at the moment!

review/text: I am not sure why all the negativity about this product. I think it tasts pretty good....even my husband thought it was good; better than the spiced cider and he is pretty picky. a good drink for a cool, fall evening or winter day. We have our own well and only use well water or botten water which has no chlorine in it....I think if you are on city water and using city water it would definitely alter the taste. My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own.

review/text: This product works fine in my Keurig coffee maker... I just do not personally care for the flavor.  It is VERY sweet - - tastes pretty much like most instant cider mixes. For me, making it weaker improves the taste.  Again, the product works fine; my 2-star rating is based mostly on my personal dislike of the flavor.

review/summary: Take the bad reviews seriously....
review/text: I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!

review/summary: Best SF hot drink EVER!
review/text: I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.  Before I brew, I put about 6 cinnamon red hots in the cup, along with a cinnamon stick.  Then when done, I add a light sprinkle of my own mix of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Almost as wonderful as my freshly simmered REAL apple cider!  The "caramel" part of this drink is what really makes it yummy!  Perfect for that cool autumn night, or anytime.  Highly recommend this drink!  And the price is wonderful too.

review/summary: Very Bad Taste
review/text: This product is made with aspartamane, but that doesn't bother me. I only drink diet sodas instead of regular ones whenever I have the occassional soda (try to limit it to 1-2 a week) so the taste doesn't bother me, I also use Stevia and Spenda at home so I'm accustomed the the different sugar-free flavors.<br />I had such high hopes for this drink. I was looking forward to having a cup of hot cider at work. Granted I didn't think it would taste like real cider but I'd been looking forward to a hot apple-y drink.<br />When my shipment came in I brought it to work and had my first cup. Immediately I could smell it. It smelled really good at first. If you put your nose too close you can smell kinda a sickly-sweet scent. I tried it and nearly spat. It tasted extremely chemically and entirely overwhelming. The "caramel" was caramel only insofar as what a machine can reproduce. It was not caramel as I was expecting, not even slightly.<br />I tried letting it cool and drinking it cold. It was perhaps a teensy bit more palatable.<br />I tried watering it down. That helped. The Keurig at work only goes to 12 ounces. So perhaps ones that go to 16 ounces might diffuse the flavor a little more. This is why I gave it a 2 star instead of just 1.<br /><br />Now these things just sit forgotten in a drawer. Maybe I can figure out something to do with them...

review/text: These are excellent.  They keep well, don't tend to be too messy, and taste great.  Only 4 stars because it's a bit misleading to call it peanut butter anything, considering there is no peanut butter in them at all.  Other than that, I like them and will keep ordering.

review/text: I eat one of these on a daily basis on my way to gym after work as an on-the-go meal. These are nutritious and provide a good amount of protein and vitamins but not overly sweet like some other protein/nutrition bars. I have been eating gluten free and these are one of my favorite gluten free products.

review/text: I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.

review/summary: Fresh Nutty & Fruity On the Go Snack
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes.

review/text: I love the cranberry bar. It has the right about of crunch and sweetness. I eat them midday and it keeps me full until dinner. Some people were complaining that the nuts in the bars were a bit stale. I didn't run across that problem, but they were sticky (just pop them in the fridge and they should be fine). You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it.

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as "The Flavor" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good.

review/summary: Wonderfully Nutty and Delightfully Delicious
review/text: This is not the first time I've purchased KIND bars although it is the first time I have ordered this particular flavor combination.  I just love them.  These bars have a wonderfully nutty flavor and are delightfully delicious to me.  Reminds me of a blend of a nutty granola bar and sweet peanut brittle, only better and much healthier for me.  I will definitely be ordering these again.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of "on the go" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for "food emergencies".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores.

review/summary: Healthy Candy Bar!
review/text: Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.<br /><br />I've removed all the junk snacks from our home and put in boxes of KIND Bars; this one is the one I have to restock most often. If you're curious, go to your local health food store and pay $2.00 for a single bar; I promise you'll be back here ordering it by the box.

review/text: My 12 year old son who is gluten, dairy, soy, and egg free loves this bar. He is a little particular about his bars and there are limited choices that meet his dietary requirements. He loves this one and some of the other flavors of Kind Bars (check labels- not all are soy free).

I eat these for breakfast on the go, or for a quick pick me in the afternoon. The Mango/Macadamia Nut are the only ones i have tried so far, but I absolutly plan on trying the other flavors.

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants
review/text: First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars.

review/summary: BEST ALL AROUND NUTRITION BAR FOR A MEAL OR SNACK
review/text: I have tried numerous bars, but the KIND PLUS Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants is the best all around. It is visually & aromatically appealing and the crunchy fruit and nut taste is truly sensational. I have one every morning with a 4oz. probiotic yogurt and my coffee. It is very satisfying on many levels as well as healthy for me. Kind told me that the price I paid for these on Amazon is excellent since they typically retail at $2. per bar in stores. These are so incredible that I possibly could go into 'withdrawal' without my daily Kind fix!

review/text: I normally like Kind bars, but the mango flavored ones are way too sweet. I don't even know how to describe the overpowering flavor. It tastes like the bars were sprayed with perfume and then dipped in tropical syrup. They could have made the mango flavoring a little more subtle.

review/text: I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.  However, even the crunch felt slightly mushy at times.  With no real flavor to make up for the texture, I would not buy these again.

review/text: I have tried many snack and nutritional bars, and these are my current favorite. The combination of flavors not only satisfies my hunger but also satisfies my desire for something sweet. What turns me off about most fruit/nut bars is the syrupy sweet substance that holds the ingredients together. I don't taste that at all in any of the Kind bars. I have this particular variety on auto delivery.

review/summary: Delicious and satisfying all-purpose bar
review/text: Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's "satisfying" and "nutritious."  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.
