review/summary: Amarula
review/text: Amarula must be the best cream liqueur I have ever tried. Move over Bailey's. It has a very smooth taste, really silky smooth, and it has a hint of fruit in it. The fruit is Marula aka Elephant tree fruit. I saw somewhere that Amarula has become the second biggest seller in cream liquor category, right after Baileys. And the maker also supports elephant conservation. If cream liqueur are too sweet for you, then stay away, but if you like fruity drinks, and you like cream liquors, this one is for you!

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious dark chocolate
review/text: Ghirardelli certainly lives up to its reputation for delicious, gourmet chocolate with this bar. For those who are used to semisweet or sweet chocolate, the flavor of this bar may seem surprisingly bitter and take some getting used to. But for those who are accustomed to dark chocolate, the flavor is sublime. The texture is also excellent, and the packaging lovely. In short, this bar is a dark-chocolate lover's dream.<br /><br />The question some may ask who love sweet, milk chocolate is, why pay more money (often quite a bit more) for dark chocolate that doesn't taste particularly sweet? The main reason for most people in the over-50 crowd is the health benefits to be gained from consuming dark chocolate.<br /><br />Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily "dose." The original German studies in 2007 used Ritter Sport chocolate, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product, at 72% cacao, fits well within the parameters of that study. An equivalent amount of this chocolate compared to that in the study would be one-half of one of its individual squares/sections. (Note: the package lists a "serving" as "three sections" which is 38 gms. This is six times the amount needed to improve your health.)<br /><br />The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470440856">inflammation</a> has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.<br /><br />Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.<br /><br />Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.<br /><br />The FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:<br />1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FY8I">unsweetened baker's chocolate</a> fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, "chocolate."<br />2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words "dark," "extra dark" or "intense" for "bitter" if that word is not paired with "sweet," for example as "bittersweet" or "semisweet" or "extra bittersweet."<br />3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids.  It is sometimes also marketed as "dark chocolate," even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.<br />4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.<br /><br />Per the package, the ingredients of this "all natural," dark-chocolate bar are: unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, vanilla, and soy lecithin.<br /><br />People who are allergic to nuts (including peanuts and tree nuts), soy, and milk should not eat this product since it is manufactured with the same equipment that processes those things and traces could be in this chocolate.

review/summary: More than adequate substitute
review/text: I don't do a lot of baking, but when a recipe of mine calls for chocolate, I would always use Valrhona. No exceptions. I discovered it by accident at a local Williams-Sonoma (10-11 years ago) and to this day it is without a doubt the most beautiful bar of chocolate I have ever experienced (creepy I know, LOL). A few years ago (much to my dismay) Williams-Sonoma stopped selling all Valrhona products. In the future I could easily purchase online, but at that point I needed something immediately. I remember trying Lindt's 70% dark bar and thought that it was much too bitter. I've never been a a huge fan of Godiva (too expensive anyway), so as a last resort I trekked on over to my local Shoprite. I was surprised at their selection. I was also surprised to see what seemed to be a premium line from Ghirardelli. Now I've always felt that Ghirardelli's chocolate was on par with say Hershey, except just a bit more expensive. So if all I want is a simple bar of chocolate to chomp down on, why spend the extra dough on Ghirardelli when I can just buy Hershey? But I had a good feeling about this particular 72% bar they called "Twilight Delight". At $2.50 a pop for a 3.5oz bar it certainly wasn't going to break the bank (I now see it on sale quite often at $1.99). As soon as I got home I had to taste it. I was floored. So much better than the Lindt and MUCH less expensive than any bar of Godiva. Still not as good as Valrhona, but a very, VERY worthy substitute. So much so that as long as I can find this at my local Shoprite, I will never go out of my way to purchase Valrhona online again. And I LOOOOOOOOVE Valrhona. But the cost factor simply just not justify spending that much for chocolate. Especially when this premium bar of Ghirardelli is so very delicious!

review/text: I love love love dark chocolate, it has to be my favorite and I am always looking for new chocolate to try, dark chocolate that is.  I loved the name of this bar which is what attracted it to me in the first place.  For dark chocolate it is ok, but it is not my go to dark chocolate bar.  It has a strange flavor to it, it made me kind of sick after eating it.  Its not that it was too rich but it just had a strage flavor to it.  If you want a good dark chocolate bar I would stick with lindt chocolate or chocolove, both great dark chocolates.

review/summary: Tastes amazing
review/text: Let me start by saying I don't like dark chocolate.  I eat a tiny piece every day for the incredible health benefits of having this super antioxidant protect my arteries from plaque and prevent heart disease, a leading cause of death.  If I have to "force" myself to eat dark chocolate, well, that's a sacrifice I will gladly make.<br /><br />I have tried several brands of these dark chocolate bars, which are always labeled with the exact percentage of cacao contained in each.  I have tried the ones that are as much as 90% cacao and can't tolerate the bitterness.<br />This is just right at 72% cacao as far as being highly satisfactory in my mouth and giving me a rich boost of protective antioxidants.  I only eat a few bites of this every day.  The dark chocolate is so rich in bioflavanoids and antioxidants that a very small piece delivers a powerhouse of lipid disposal and plaque protection with a minimum of fat and calories.<br /><br />There have been several studies of the health benefits of daily consumption of cacao (cocoa)<br />and it is right up there in the top five foods that improve health and lead to longevity.  There was a fifteen year study of older men which was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine a few years ago.  This study found a remarkable fifty percent reduction in heart attacks.  There was a forty seven percent reduction in death from all causes for men who regularly ate the most cacao when compared with those who ate the least.<br /><br />The taste of this particular brand of chocolate bar is delicious. With this 72% cacao bar they have hit the  magic balance of taste sensation and health benefits. It is recommended that for the most protective antioxidant benefits, you must eat one ounce per day of cacao.  I make one of these bars last four days.  And I consider it my daily sweet treat. To eat something this delicious and know it's working a small miracle in my body is a benefit not many foods can match.<br /><br />This brand is the hand's down winner in my taste test.  It has made a chocolate lover out of me.

review/text: My favorite standard dark chocolate. Dark chocolate is good for you, the darker the better. 72% is the darkest most people can stand. I love the squares which help me control my portions. 4 squares is the serving size SO if you just eat one a day it's about 60 calories! Ghirardelli is middle of the road for premium chocolates which means they're really good.

review/text: I have tried chocolates with even more cacao but found them to be unenjoyable.  Because everyone's tastebuds and body chemistry are different; no one thing can taste exactly the same the same to any two people.  But for me 72% cacao is the upper limit where the chocolate is still sweet enough to taste good even through the aftertaste..  Of the Ghiardelli bars, Twilight Delight is MY favorite.

review/summary: Half the chocolate was missing - (UPDATED)
review/text: In what is most likely an indication of poor quality control on the factory floor, my chocolate bar was missing half the chocolate.  It was split in half vertically and half the chocolate bar was just not there.  The other half was a very questionable texture.  I didn't want to eat it.  It looked kind of bad.<br /><br />This chocolate is not cheap.  I expect better quality control.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />I wrote a letter to the company's customer service and got a nice response in the mail.  I also got two coupons for chocolate.  I am not sure if I will use them (I don't really carry coupons around with me), but I appreciated the gesture.

review/summary: Almost wonderful
review/text: I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make.  The first lemon flavored Sweet `N Low cake I made was adequate but did not have any fresh tart lemon flavor.  The next time I tried using half lemon juice and half water and something very strange happened to the texture, it felt like a sponge.  Not a sponge cake but a dish sponge.  I keep trying to find the right amount of lemon juice to add and have not hit on it yet.  If you do not mind a mild and slightly artificial lemon flavor, than this is a great product.  For first time users I wish that the product description here specified that these mixes make a single thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.

review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

In addition, the company donates the money to local charities..again so awesome!!

review/summary: Good sustained energy
review/text: This is a solid well rounded energy drink. The best part is the pick up from the drink. I have tired this both cold and warm. Please make sure you refrigerate otherwise the taste is a 2/10. The only reason I give this drink a 4/5 is because of the taste-even when cold. The energy is good, the company is great and its overall a great thing to have in the fridge when needing that extra boost.

review/summary: Good energy
review/text: I often have a big-time energy crash in the middle of the afternoon, and I've tried those teeny tiny energy drinks but find I can only drink half of one or I get a headache. I seem to be immune to coffee; I can drink it all day long and fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. I was looking for something light and refreshing and this is it! I like the grapefruit taste, and it gives me enough stamina to make it through the rest of my day without making me feel unnaturally revved up. Cheaper than those tiny energy drinks too. I can get it at my local store, but I was hoping to see it here on Amazon for less (wouldn't you know it's the one flavor they're out of).

review/summary: Best Hot Sauce out there
review/text: If you want a hot sauce that is flavorful and has quite the kick (sweating occurs when eating) then this is the hot sauce for you.  I tried many different ones until I came across this company when we were visiting a shopping mall in SLC, we bought a sample pack of assorted sauces and one of them was spontaneous combustion.  This stuff has habanero peppers and capsicum pepper combined.  The first time it is really intense then as you use it you start to gauge how much you can handle.  I highly re commend this hot sauce, not for the faint of heart

review/summary: Flavorful for something this hot
review/text: I just got a bottle of this as a gift from a dear friend... really, most sauces I use are no more than 3000 Scoville units if that much.  This is way hotter -- one source on line claims 1.2 million units but I am skeptical.  Still, the few drops I've had, one at a time, strike me as quite flavorful apart from the heat.  If you can stand this level of burn, at least this sauce is providing something other than burn.<br /><br />I suspect that I'll use most of this in cooking homemade soups as a source of heat, where its good flavor will be diluted too much to matter... rather a pity.

You have to pay attention to the expiration date, something most people are not used to with cat treats that are good for ages.  It may take your kitty a few treats to get used to them because they are light and flaky - not heavy chewy treats like most cats get.  My male cat will put his paw in the container and scoop them out if I let him :)

review/text: My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.

review/summary: Warning this product may contain a doggy stimulant
review/text: First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/summary: Canidae 12-Pack Canned Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth, 5-1/2-Ounce Can
review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/text: My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.

The funny thing was that you could find both on grocery store shelves right next to each other, see the same company name on both boxes, read the same ingredient, same amount per packet, same amount of packets per box, yet they charged double the money for Equal than they did for NutraSweet, and even Consumer Reports never got an answer from the company as to WHY that was.<br /><br />Since then, the company that produces Aspartame is no longer "Searle" (then headed by CEO Donald Rumsfeld!) but instead Monsanto, the same company that produced the toxic "agent orange" for Vietnam!<br /><br />If you are looking for a substitute natural sweetener, because you are a diabetic, then STEVIA should be something to look into.  Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a "sweetener" it has to be labeled a "nutritional suppliment" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />Please don't take my word for anything I have just said above, please do the research yourself so you KNOW it is all the truth.

review/summary: Crunchy and Fresh
review/text: I have always loved pistachios, but living two or three thousand miles from the nearest pistachio tree, I had never really tasted fresh pistachios. But I didn't realize that until I received my order of Keenan Farms pistachios from Amazon. I was immediately struck by how green and fresh looking the nuts were. When I got the first of three two-pound bags open and tasted them, I was hooked! Each kernel was so plump, so large, so crunchy and fresh and beautifully green I had to remind myself that I was holding a two pound bag and I couldn't eat the whole thing. I will reorder this item often, and recommend that you order them too.

review/summary: Not the best, but better than most
review/text: What makes for a good pistachio is size, freshness and proper roasting time. If the pistachios and small and over-roasted I won't eat them. Keenan pistachios are generally medium to small in size, and overall quality tends to vary from one bag to the next, lacking consistency. Large pistachios are hard to come by in a bag of Keenan Farms. Setton Farms Pistachios are much better (bigger and fresher tasting on average), but they aren't sold by or through Amazon... Unfortunately. But if you're trying to decide, don't waste your time with that "Wonderful" crap, Keenan Farms Pistachios are much better.

review/text: I've eaten myself sick on these and there's still a couple pounds to go. I bought the 3-pack 32 ounce bags. I love pistachios and occasionally I'm willing to pay the price for them. This Keenan Farms brand is tops. My first bag I made a point to count the unopened nuts. 7 unopened out of 2 pounds of nuts. The second bag? 2 nuts I couldn't open with my fingernails. Most are very easy to open; my neice just turned 3 and she was able to open most of them on her own. (She was VERY closely supervised! Do not worry!) The quality of the nuts were very good, though they are not the largest size (they are not advertise as such). The salt content was perfect for my taste. I can sit and make a pile of shells quickly and easily. Man, I want another three pack! Maybe for Easter...

review/text: Shipping was pretty fast, but ultimately it was the product that won me over. Great taste without all of the normal salt taste you get with the average pistachio. I agree with other reviewers in that it was rare to find a shell unopened. With other pistachio products I have to carry a nut cracker with me, since typically there are a fair amount of shells that are either unopended, or barely so. These nuts are terriffic....give them a shot and you will not be disappointed.

Most shells are open, a few have just a crack opening which is easy to open by inserting and twisting a table knife, and a very few are not open at all but that's what nut crackers are for, right?  Pistacios are healthy for you and a great snack.  I will continue to buy them.

review/summary: fresh, not too salty and great value!
review/text: Great value and they are not too salty at all, compared with the salty version from Trader Joes.  Very fresh and very few unopened, no different from any other store brands.  I use a lobster cracker to open the few that needs a little assistance.  That is one less trip to the stores.  Beware they are very moorish and it is hard to eat just a few, so not recommended for weight watchers.  However, the nutrient value and health benefits are huge and with the huge fibre content, forget about eating activa, it works a whole lot better and also means less dairy fat, which is not good for you (growth hormones in milk fat promotes cancer cell growth so we have eliminated and minimized dairy intake).  Have constipation issue, these nuts will get you on a regular schedule in a couple of weeks.

I've used this product for about 10 years as a staple in my favorite protein shake -- Chocolate Mocha. This recipe blends Chocolate whey protein powder, DaVinci Choc syrup, cottage cheese, maybe some plain yogurt, perhaps a Tbsp or so of cream cheese -- and a blast of instant Espresso powder (or leftover strong coffee). (THIS will get you moving in the morning!)<br /><br />I've tried the fruit flavors of DaVinci and they're OK, but not outstanding, IMHO. The pancake syrup is too thin ( get the grocery store syrup) but the Vanilla DaVinci syrups are excellent.

review/summary: Very good SUGAR FREE syrup!
review/text: Despite the negative reviews, I tried the syrup anyway.  I was quite pleased with it.  I guess when you are expecting a burnt tootsie roll/listerine flavor, you get a pleasant surprise when it's pallatable.  I really think the negative remarks were way off base.  If you buy any sugar free syrup and expect it to taste like the original, your expectations are too high.  All the Davinici sugar free syrups are good.  Some taste a little too similar to the others to bother with.  I have narrowed down my favorites as:<br /><br />1. White Chocolate<br />2. Almond<br />3. Carmel<br />4. French Vanilla<br /><br />If you are looking to make a mocha, my suggestions is to do half Davinci Sugar Free Sauce and half Davinci Sugar Free Syrup.  It makes a great sweet chocolatey mocha.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that Davinci Sugar Free syrups are superior to Torani Sugar Free.  They are much more flavorful and require less syrup to achieve the desired taste.<br /><br />Good luck, and don't give up on this chocolate syrup.

review/text: If you are looking for it then you found it. This is the the famously bad tasting Da Vinci SUGAR FREE Chocolate Syrup. I found one person say it tastes kinda like a tootsie roll. I would say it it is sweet. it is a little tootsie roll flavored. But it also has a burnt plastic taste. The most interesting part of the experience is the after taste. It's smoky but has a slight sensation of Listerine on your tongue. I guess what it comes down to is: I am not a fan of sugar free burnt tootsie roll Listerine syrup.

How did it come to me? I do not recall ordering that particular flavor and they probably send it by mistake (we'll see when I ask for my money back. Over [$...] each cost!). Hard to describe the taste but enough said that when I added some to an otherwise superior cop of coffee this crap made me pour it all-minus that first sip-down the drain.  B-52? What's that, an airplane? Because it sure does not taste normal to me! The aftertaste is enough to make you want to demand your money back! Yes, there are many but only the very few are worth the price.

It is rather difficult to slice it into two equal halves for toasting but with a sharp knife it is possible.I have recommended it to several friends with this condition after I shared some of mine with them.<br />I have ordered my second supply. unfortunately, the price has gone up very significantly by more than seven dollars and I dont know if I will keep up with it.I plan to continue looking around (as always) for new and affordable products.

review/summary: Hamburger buns for pizza crusts
review/text: These buns are thick. But have a good taste. They are not as soft as wheat buns, but in the gluten free world they do fine. My children love these as little pizzas which is my main use for them. I also make peanut butter and bananas for breakfast.

review/summary: Great for travel and on-the-run hamburgers....(if toasted)
review/text: I use these hamburger buns all the time when traveling. I toast them, throw them in a plastic baggie, and have a fast food burger with my own bun. I agree with other reviewers that they are not great when not toasted. And I found a local bakery that makes great, fresh, gluten free buns for use at home. But these hold up really well in a suitcase. They do not crumble, and while they are a tad dry, that works better for me when traveling (so they don't crumble when eating in the car). You can put ketchup, or other sauce on the burger, to cut down on some of the dryness. But, they are much better toasted. If you travel, and need to toast, you can use Tosta Bags so your food doesn't get cross-contaminated.

review/summary: My little girl can eat at in and out now
review/text: My little girl has food allergies the big ones , wheat, dairy, soy , nuts and a bunch more. There are not a lot of good bread products on the market for her, but these hambuger buns are great. We heat them up for a minute in the microwave then take them to in and out burger and make her a double without the cheese or the sauce and she loves it. Small blessing big payoff.

review/summary: Tasty when toasted.
review/text: I am actually not sure I should be rating this a 5, as these taste terrible to me and my family if they have not been toasted. I bought these because I thought it would be simple to just throw some burgers on a bun. well, it doesnt work that way. Although, when I toast these in the oven, I do have to say it feels like we have gone out to eat. They are really good when prepared this way. That I think is what leads me to a 5 star rating. however I rate these at a 3 as when I cook out I just like to throw the burgers on a bun, and I dont like to put the patties on the grill to toast them---thats my own quirk, and if its not a quirk for you, then this will be a total 5 star. I will buy these again!!

review/summary: OK for what they are.
review/text: This is the second time I ordered these. They're extremely dry and don't work for me as their intended purpose -- as a bun. What I do with them is slice each one into 3 thin slices. These make decent peanut butter toast when I'm in a hurry. I buy these because of their vacuum seal, independent packaging so I don't have to have a bunch of them go bad as I only use them as a stop gap when I'm out of my own baked bread. These taste very "GF'y" and eaten as a bun would gag an aardvark. Although they claim these don't need to be frozen, if you buy these in bulk and don't, some will mold before you get to them.

review/text: Excellent product for those on a wheat free diet.  Have a hamburger again with a REAL bun!  Even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great idea...
review/text: I'm not sure why Ener-G isn't making their buns with the light bread recipe?<br /><br />This was thick and HAS to be toasted before use. My husband would go to Burger King, order our food, and a hamburger patty for our daughter. I'd toast these in the oven, and she could eat a hamburger like us...<br /><br />I'd put one in my purse if we were going to leave the house & go out to eat...<br /><br />They aren't that good after they have cooled off. My daughter would eat a little of the bun, and then just eat the meat. The bread tastes fine... Just a little too thick...

review/summary: Dry as a bone
review/text: Even when heating these they taste horrible. Mine arrived already dried out. When removing them from the package they were cracked and crumbly. My sons who are Celiacs almost cried. They miss hamburger buns so badly and I thought with the reviews I saw that these were the answer for them.<br /><br />Both are six years old and both practically gagged on the texture and taste.. all around just plain bad. Even our dog wouldn't eat them and he eats just about everything.. he sniffed them and walked away.. That says it all right there.

review/summary: great hamburger buns
review/text: these are the best gluten free buns i have found. most of the gf breads/buns feel really heavy but these are much more like regular bread.  as some have said they are a little dry compared to regular buns but as far as gf buns go these are my favorite.  i usually toast them on the grill while i'm grilling the burgers.  i would recommend these to anyone with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.

review/summary: Too dry and hard to use
review/text: This was the first hamburger bun we found after our celiac diagnosis. Comes unsliced, was very hard to cut through. They were very dry and too bready.  To be able to eat them at all, we had to wrap them in wet towels and heat/microwave...and eat FAST as they harden up quickly. No way you can toast them or grill them and have them not come out hard as a rock!  Not much flavor either. The size is better than the tastier Schar brand we've found since though, actually is the right size for a regular burger patty.
