review/text: Sent this to my dad for Father's Day, and it arrived on time, and he loved it.  He said it brought back many memories, and included some of his favorite candies from back when he was a kid.  He enjoyed the box it came in, and the candies tasted as they did when he was a kid.  If you know anyone from the 40s definately consider buying them this as a gift.  It makes a great gag gift to.

review/summary: Nice product but lousy delivery service
review/text: The Good:<br />The box was nicely packaged and arrived with even its bow intact. The amount of candy was abundant, the variety was good, and my father-in-law greatly enjoyed reminiscing over the various gums and hard candies.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />When my order from Candy Crate was six days overdue, I emailed the company and received a quick reply. I was assured my product would arrive shortly. I had to send another email after an additional two days complaining that it was Christmas Eve and the package hadn't arrived. Candy Crate contacted the delivery company, refunded my delivery charges, and apologized. Their customer service responses were quick and congenial but I wouldn't order from them unless you plan way ahead or they change the delivery company with whom they work.

review/summary: 40s Retro was 40s stale
review/text: Overall the selection is interesting and reminds me of the candy that my grandparents had at their house, even though there were many uninspired items that are common today.  The quality is rather poor and a good percentage of the items were stale or inedible due to their hardness. Even without the stale candy, the value was lacking since most of this candy is still common today and available in the bulk candy section of supermarkets.  I would reccomend that you skip this one.<br /><br />I bought this as a spare christmas gift (you know for the person who shows up with a gift but you forgot) and didn't need it.  I was excited to open this myself and was almost immediately dissapointed.  The selection was a bit off I think and included candy you can get in the bulk candy section of the supermarket.  This candy was mostly as hard as a rock and stale.  There were cough (throat) drops from the smith brothers. Throat drops are not my idea of candy.

review/summary: Nostalgia ?
review/text: Apparently there is a very small market of us Seniors (76 yrs) who are into nostalgia...attempting to relive our youth at the penny-candy store. This collection seemed promising but perhaps has been in storeage since the 1940's. The candy is dried-out and stale. Familiar names and packaging provided some satisfaction...but at the price? Give me a break.

review/summary: Some of the candy is stale...
review/text: Ordered this package along with some other 'decades' selection. The diversity wasn't bad, but I found a lot of the candy to be stale - as if it was the actual candy from that era, sitting in some candy vault for all these years. The candy that was supposed to be chewy was hard, and some selections (Bit O' Honey, Abbazabba, Turkish Taffy, etc...) had obviously been kept in a hot, humid area because they had melted and hardened into odd unappealing shapes. The hard candy (that was supposed to be hard) was mostly fine. Interesting, but I wouldn't order again.

review/summary: 73 yo Hard to Please Mom LOVED IT ;-)
review/text: Best Birthday Gift EVER!!!  Mom was born in late 30's so I figured that she'd remember candy from 5 yrs and up... so, I went with the 1940's box.  You should've seen her face... PRICELESS... She was so tickled, surprised and it was just sheer happiness remembering penny candy from her childhood.  There were only 2 items that she didn't recall, but she chalked it up to probably costing more than she could afford = 1 cent each.  So, she said anything over a penny she just didn't pay any attention to except for one item that was her favorite.  Her dad would give her extra money as a "splurge" so she could pay the 5 cents for each piece.  Guess what?  It was in this box ;-)  She LOVED it... and, she placed it up on her sofa table to just look at for a few days before eating.  THANKS so much for such a wonderful trip down memory lane.  She told stories about each kind of candy that she took out of the box.  She said it tasted good too.  This woman has everything.  I honestly didn't know what to get her.  For the price, I can't believe how much she enjoyed it.  Thanks for the fast delivery.  It arrived a few days before her birthday.  Thanks again... I will definitely purchase for other family members too!

She had just been talking about some of these candies to me that she used to get as a kid.  So it was great timing when I found it.  My only complaint would be that the box was a bit smushed and had a little tear in the side.  Could have been from the shipping as well but it bothered me gifting it with a rip in it.  Other than that it was a perfect experience.

review/text: I was really looking forward to sharing some of these "old time" treats, I had as a child, with my family.  Some of the most desired items listed were not in the box, like A&W, Target Sticks, Bit O-Honey, etc.  Even so, there was a decent variety.  Sadly, most of the items were stale, flavorless, or too chewy. What was supposed to be a fun walk down memory lane, was just a disappointment. I gave two stars because the hard candy was acceptable and the wrappers were nostalgic, but I cannot recommend this item.

She had several presents next to her, waiting to be opened and still spent about ten minutes looking through the candy and pointing out her favorites from her childhood.  She didn't eat any of the candy yet, so I'm not sure of the candy quality, but the present is worth buying for the nostalgia alone.<br />After reading several reviews about the bad delivery time, I was worried the gift wouldn't arrive in time for Christmas.  The delivery had perfect timing and was even a couple days before its scheduled delivery date.

review/summary: Great Product--Don't Expedite Shipping
review/text: A perfect half-time refreshment. The product is amazing, but there are several house hold remedies to treat dehydration (i'll spare you the nutrition lesson, do your research). The difference is these electrolyte packets provide the sodium & potassium you need to revitalize your energy much faster with less 'filler' ingredients, such as what you may get from mustard or alka-selzer. Bananas & sweet potatoes are great sources for potassium, but they're heavy on your belly (especially if you're a soccer player, like myself, or an endurance athlete).**Avoid choosing special delivery options, just go standard. i paid an extra $11 for a 2 day delivery. It took 5+ days--rip-off.**

However, I do not recommend this product and I will be quite honest in that I cannot believe this stuff made it through Gatorade's product testing.  It tasted absolutely disgusting.  The salty flavor was so strong it overpowered the flavored sports drink I also mixed with it.  It actually made me more thirsty and by the end of the race I felt sick to my stomach.  I had trouble forcing myself to drink it but had to as it was all I had for a 62 mile course.  I paid $1.50 for a tiny little packet of salt.  Save yourself some money and just use table salt or try another brand of endurolytes such as Hammer or Camelback - which actually taste good.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Pretzels - Tasty and Alliterative Too
review/text: Who'd've thought (notice the double contraction!) that peanut butter pretzels could taste so good?  Yes, one serving of 9 sandwiches contains 7g of fat (but no trans fats) and 140 calories, though few could possibly stop at just one serving.<br />Despite the dietary red flags, I've got to give these pretzel sandwiches five stars, just because they taste so good.<br /><br />On the positive side the first ingredient is not ordinary wheat flour, but unbleached wheat flour. Less processing with the unbleached. The peanut butter inside the pretzels is just sweet enough and moist enough to be delightful.<br />If one keeps his or her appetite in check, these can be quite the enjoyable and special snack.<br /><br />Warning: This product does contain peanut products and is processed on equipment that makes dairy products.

review/text: These are our favorite pretzel sandwiches and very difficult to find locally but the item is listed as 10 oz packages (12 packs) but what we received was 8 oz packages (12 packs). We are missing 24 ounces. It makes the price a little high but they are hard to find. We notifed Amazon about the issue and are waiting for a resolution.

review/summary: Chocolate, PB and Pretzels, Oh My!
review/text: A friend saw these on a late-night food show, did some investigating and ordered a box.  She and her husband hid some of the bags so they didn't eat them all at once.  Her enthusiasm convinced me to order a box.  Upon arrival, we opened a bag.  Let's just say chocolate, peanut butter and pretzels never tasted so yummy.  I knew we couldn't keep all those bags in the house so I tucked one in several Christmas gifts.  It was the first thing mentioned in the thank you notes!  Some even asked for a "refill."  I'll be ordering again next year.

I eat them like Oreos; I split it open and lick the cheddar in the middle, then eat the pretzel ends!! :) Kinda fun to eat! Trust me when I say they are delicious.  Oh....and don't just buy one bag, you will definitely want more!!!  Enjoy!!

review/text: I love jasmine tea in Chinese restaurants.  I bought a box of Coffee Bean Dragonwell tea, and a bag of jasmine tea had found its way into my Dragonwell box by mistake.  I am so glad it did.  It was beautiful to look at and just indescribably perfect to taste.  It made me dump out all of my Dragonwell tea in the hope that another jasmine mistake could be found.  I picked up other-brand jasmine tea boxes in the grocery store and read the fine print...they are not true jasmine teas!  They are jasmine tea "blends"!!  Because Coffee Bean packages their tea in a clear, see-through tea bag, I can tell you for certain that this is 100% jasmine pearls.  Not a blend!  I am hooked.

review/summary: Almost a little miracle pill!
review/text: My eyesight has been deteriorating with age (67 now) and it has been very difficult to see closeup without reading glasses.  I have glasses for driving but they are a nuisance and always dirty.  One day I read a column by Susie the Pharmacist who was recommending Saffron pills to somebody and I thought they might help me (out of desperation).  My eyesight has improved, especially for reading, and I no longer use glasses while driving.  Really!! Over-all, my mental outlook seems to be better and things don't look as bleak.  It didn't happen overnight but took about 6 months of taking 3 pills daily (with meals).  I don't take anything else except a low-dose aspirin.  I gave up the Saffron recently to save money, and within 2 weeks I was having to squint (again) while reading.  That convinced me to restart the pills and in a few days my good vision and improved outlook had returned.  No, this isn't a joke.  I am now a Saffron user for life!  YEA!!

review/text: I drink at least 1 gal. of water a day. I've tried sooo many brands. Some are impossible, many are acceptable but very few are exceptional...Glaceau Smartwater with electrolytes tops the charts! This water is great with meals, during & after exercise, just because you're thirsty or if dieting, it helps fill you up if you drink a bottle 20 minutes or so before eating while helping to keep your electrolytes in balance! This is of great importance. When your electrolytes are "off", it can affect your heart as well as other important medical conditions. This is why scientists came up with Gatorade for pro athletes 25 yrs. or so ago. Look what we've learned since then! Thank you for a superior product!

review/summary: Does it work?
review/text: Whenever I have a bottle of Glaceau SmartWater, that's one of the main things people ask me: does this actually work or make a difference? To ultimately tell you'd have to do a batter of tests & such, but for me I'm just judging by the way I feel during & afterwards.<br /><br />Taste-wise, you can't tell that this drink has any electrolytes or anything in it, which is a good thing. Water shouldn't taste like anything other than water (unless you are buying something that is supposed to be flavored). It does taste better than some of the other brands out there such as Dasani, so that's a plus.<br /><br />But does it work? I can't give you a scientific show of proof, but I can tell you that I feel better when I drink it. It just seems to give me energy, something that is a plus when you work 2 jobs & go to college at the same time. I feel more hydrated for a longer period of time.<br /><br />This is something nice that I get on occasion when I need a little boost. It's not going to replace my tapwater at home (I need the fluoridated water), but it is something that I'll buy to take to work.

review/summary: Tastes great
review/text: This water tastes good and in theory should absorb faster. It's a fact that you can die from drinking too much water without electrolytes, due to (reverse?) osmosis. Hopefully this water counters that.<br /><br />As for one reviewer's claim that the electrolytes gives them energy, that is false since the drink has zero calories (just read the label). However, maybe being properly hydrated allows one to properly digest or use other sources of energy.<br /><br />I am not a biologist, just my two cents.

review/summary: Great Water, Horrible Online
review/text: This is by far the best water I have ever tasted. Not only that, it gives me the energy and wellness feeling I need to get through the day. After only 3 days of drinking 2 bottles of 24 oz. smart water, it cleared up a possible sinus infection, and I had more energy. BUT!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE! You can find 1 liter bottles at Kroger for a 1.59 a piece. If you have a Kroger card, only a buck! They are now selling 10 for 10 dollars of the 1 liter smart water bottles. I just bought 20!!! Haha, but if you buy this water, seriously, don't waste your money on these ridiculously overpriced sellers. Buy it at a local store.

review/summary: Waste of Money, Waste of Resources
review/text: I tried this product out of curiosity since it was new.  It tastes like all the others but with a much higher price tag.  I am now at the point where I think bottled water is such a waste of money and natural resources - clogging landfills with all the bottles that no one recycles - that I am going to buy a water filter for my sink and just use that.  You can also buy packets of electrolytes from companies like Emergen-C and add them to your water.  I used those when I ran a marathon and they worked wonders!  Save a buck and save the environment...use filtered water in a bottle you can reuse.

review/summary: If you like "diet" iced tea but don't want caffeine, buy this now
review/text: Even major supermarkets don't regularly sell artificially-sweetened decaffeinated iced tea, and they almost never have it "out of season", i.e., when it isn't summertime.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't even always have it, so if you are an iced tea drinker who wants your iced tea throughout the day and into the evening, buy this when it is available.

review/summary: Grew fine, but cats not interested
review/text: I followed the instructions on the back of the bag and these grew just fine. It took nearly a week for them to start poking through the soil, but they have grown up well and are a very attractive shade of green and are healthy.<br /><br />I grew the seeds in a shallow pot for my two cats, but neither of the cats has shown much interest yet. I also grow wheatgrass, and there's a flat of that going right now. The cats seem slightly more interested in the wheatgrass than the cat grass. I have made some attempts to show the cats the cat grass and get them interested, but so far they're not impressed.

review/summary: Sweet Treat For Indoor Kitties
review/text: My cat enjoyed this grass very much. She's an indoor/patio only cat, and she seemed to really like the new stimulation. I also potted some to take over for my parent's cats. One of my folk's cats was constantly trying to get into my mother's house plants, and this ended up being a much better alternative for both the cat and my mom. One of my parent's cats stays indoors all the time, while the other makes frequent trips outdoors, and they both seemed to equally enjoy the sweet grass treat.<br />After seeding the pots, and setting them on a window sill (winter in Michigan)there were two days of nothing (as expected). On the third day I gave the pot a little light watering and when I came home that night there were sprouts a 1/2 inch high. After that they took off and grew to a height of about 5-7 inches in two days. I was a bit surprised at just how fast they ended up growing! I would recommend only seeding a little amount of it though. I seeded about a tablespoon and a half in 4 inch diameter pots, and it ended up being too much even for my folk's two cats to get through in almost two weeks (which is when the grass started to get weepy and die off). All of the cats nibbled on the grass every day, but it's not like grass is a major part of their diet, and it was just too much. I think I'll cut the amount of seeds roughly in half next time. I should also mention that the grass was really low maintaince, needing barely any watering after the initial growth (and even then I only gave a couple very light waterings). I'd buy it again, although I'm sure I won't have to for a very long time given how well it grows, how little is needed, and the amount that comes in the bag!

review/summary: MY INDOOR CAT LOVES THIS!
review/text: My first purchase of this brand of oat grass was from a local pet goods store. The seeds were easy to grow in the little cup and soil that came with the kit.  When I saw the seeds offered on AMAZON, I decided to buy the seeds without the container and soil. What a pleasant surprise. There are at least 5 times as many seeds for less money than the kit I purchased locally. My indoor cat loves this tasty treat.

review/summary: Happy cat
review/text: I emptied out an old jar, filled it with questionable quality soil (left over from a basil plant i killed) and popped in a spoonful of seeds. Within a few hours I saw some white fuzzy roots start growing on those seeds that were upside down. The next day I had sprouts just above the soil. Day 3 there were grass shoots just to the top of the jar...and on a whim i popped the jar outside for a day while i was at work - there is nowhere in my house i could have left this inside in the sun without my cat finding it (and she was already curious). When I came home, the jar height sprouts had flourished about 4-5 inches above the jar! Simply, easy and the cat is munching on this happily in front of her favorite sunning spot. The only problem (not worth downrating) is that it grew so dense...some of the stalks poke her in the face when she's trying gnaw on stuff in the middle...but it hasn't really stopped her. Great product, simple product!

review/summary: Pretty Sweet
review/text: My picky cat loves the grass!! I put them next to a south facing window in the apartment and they have been growing well, even during the winter. The grains that do grow are pretty hearty. Just don't expect more than 60% of the seed to grow.<br /><br />Also, The cat loves them so much he jumped up on the window sill to get to them and knocked the pot to the floor in order to get to them better. So if you cat is very inquisitive I suggest placing them in a location that is hard to reach. I found out the hard way.

review/summary: Stale Beans
review/text: This company goes on and on about how fresh their beans are. Well, the beans I received certainly were not. On the exterior of the package is a five-digit label that shows the Julian date and year the coffee was roasted. My label read 17811 - meaning the 178th day of the year 2011. This translates to June 27th, 2011. I received my coffee on August 30th, 2011 - more than two months after it had been roasted. The bag is sealed with a sticky label saying "Fresh Roasted". Right - it was fresh when it was roasted, TWO MONTHS AGO. Do your own homework and Google the subject of fresh roasted coffee beans. You will often find information stating that roasted coffee loses much of it's flavor after seven days. Is Coffee Bean Direct dumping its stale inventory on Amazon?

review/summary: Favorite mini bones
review/text: My dogs love these little bones. Every morning my Yorkie comes to me and barks for his mini bone.  The one complaint I have about them is that they are really mini small and the dogs can chew through them too fast. They chew up the middle and leave the ends so little I am afraid they will choke on them. I have ordered the "small" size to see if they last any longer.  I  bought the medium size and they are way too big for little dogs.
