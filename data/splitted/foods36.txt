review/summary: The BEST sugar substitute
review/text: The BEST sugar substitute at this time. Swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home. Bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste. Can't wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets.

review/summary: Dog loves the food, but the cans were badly dented
review/text: My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like "people food" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well.....

review/text: I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart. I highly recommend it, but ask your local grocers to see if they're willing to carry it. This is far too expensive than what I paid going to my grocery store.

review/text: I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman's Advanced Dog formula. I like this better than the regular Newman's, because it has less ingredients. I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements--see above.

review/text: Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's. They love it! One of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds! Really, I timed it.<br />With so many companies recalling dog foods,I felt the Newman company being organic would be more reliable. Keeps me from worrying so much as I pour that bowl of food for them.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food!!
review/text: I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.<br /><br />So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.<br /><br />Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!

review/summary: My picky dog LOVES this stuff!
review/text: I have a 11 yr old Pomimo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 American Eskimo) who seems to only like human food. Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various brands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!

review/text: We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....

review/text: I switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything.  He has eaten Precise foundation formula for the almost two years since I adopted him.  He often goes off his food and/or vomits from time to time.  I've tried switching him to Wellness and Blue Buffalo with no positive results.  I can't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the Newman's...and he looks forward to every meal, doesn't beg for other stuff because he is satisfied, and he seems to have more energy.  He is a 110-lb Great Pyrenees and finally very happy with his food.

review/text: We switched to this brand because one of our dog's eyes always teared, and someone said it could be from a corn allergy.  This is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE brand does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product.

Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{

Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out.

review/text: I read all the reviews before buying this food and overall I was impressed with the product myself.  The dogs like it, they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged (looking at her other reviews I think hers should be tossed by Amazon) and I can get it for even less on a subscription with Prime which means 2 Day No Cost shipping.  Whats not to love?  I do mix this with some Prescription Diet J/D since I have one "older' dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help.  Bottom Line:  It is a good product and after doing a ton of reading (I don't buy my animals cheap food or ANYTHING that I think comes from China) I think it does everything it claims.

review/text: This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.<br /><br />We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it, but once she did she loves it. My dog is quite picky about her food and she likes "junk food" better rather than wholesome food and treats (of course!). She is very used to Newman's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement. Always a plus!

review/summary: My dog loves it.
review/text: I've always given my dog what I thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy.  After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when "people" food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!

review/text: Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.

review/text: I tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater, a cavalier king charles spaniel. When I found the Newmans own I hit gold. My dog loves it, he licks his bowl clean, and best of all it is good for him. His coat looks very healthy and his intermittent stomach issues are controlled. I am really happy with this brand. I wish it was available at more stores.

review/text: I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl.

review/summary: Dogs refused to eat it
review/text: I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, "We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way."  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman's in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it's not Newman's.

review/text: If you are looking for an actual organic dog food, Newman's Own is not the way to go. I accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package, only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic. With all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised "food animals" this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic.

review/text: I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs don't do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains.<br />Not recommended for your furry ones.

Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce.

They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Dog Food
review/text: I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats.

review/summary: Give it time
review/text: I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.

review/summary: Something has changed. Quality control must have slipped as far as being organic goes.
review/text: We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product.

review/text: I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it.  I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring.  My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it.<br /><br />I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names.  The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count.<br /><br />I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food.<br /><br />I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Amazon sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.  I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag.

review/summary: Great dog food for dogs with digestive problems
review/text: I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.<br /><br />A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house.

review/summary: Great product! No hormones or antibiotics in the meat!
review/text: I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not "organic", is "natural" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.<br /><br />According to [...] ingredients list: "Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues." Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.<br /><br />For me the evidence is clear - this is good quality food, my dog loves it and I love that when I buy Newman's Own products, the royalties go to charity!

review/summary: Helped our dog's skin issues
review/text: I subscribe to the 12.5 lb bag of Advanced Dog Formula for Active or Senior Dogs - it's a great value. We have a small border collie mix and she absolutely loves this food. I feed it to her in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G54OU">Buster Food Cube Large Size (Colors May Vary)</a> and she can't wait for mealtime every day!<br /><br />We got her from the shelter where she was on Science Diet. She had a ton of skin issues (formerly had fleas, patches of bare skin, itchy dry skin, and dandruff flakes). Since we changed over to Newman's, the skin problems have almost gone away. It's been about 2 months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas, she has less dandruff and I've noticed a lot less scratching from her in general. Our dog trainer said it was most likely due to the change in diet.<br /><br />Her BMs are solid and very regular. They are also not particularly smelly. I have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food. These are all signs that she is on a great diet!<br /><br />Also, I love the subscribe feature because I don't have to lug heavy bags of dog food from my car to my 3rd floor apartment!

review/summary: Bad batch made my dog sick
review/text: We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem.

review/summary: This food is working shockingly well for our allergy prone pug.
review/text: We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems.  We've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural, Chicken Soup for the dog lover's soul, Royal Canin, and a couple others that I can't remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />My Mom picked up this Newman's food because it was available at the grocery store.  They love the food, but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically.  His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before.  This food seems like a real winner for us.

When we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least 1 time every six weeks. they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape. NO more food alergies. No more vomiting, Made with bells & evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods & other organic food sellers. If its good enough for you, it's good enough for them. All Mr Newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization. Give this food 12 weeks see the improvememnt yourself.

review/text: I really want to like this product because of the great things Newman's have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity. I like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic. It looks and smells good too. Unfortunately, none of this matters to my dog Daisy. She just doesn't care for it. Usually she will sniff it and walk away. Once she realizes nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but I feel bad since she obviously doesn't care for it. Like I said, I really want to like this product, but my dog has the final say. Sadly, I don't think I will buy it again.

review/summary: Allays my concerns over what I feed our first baby
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Dog Food
review/text: I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was "breed-specific" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently "forgot" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the "breed-specific" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!

review/summary: This is the best dog food out there!!
review/text: I have a dachshund.  I have fed her Newman's Own Senior Formula for the past few years.  I used to feed her Eukanuba, but then when there was that pet food scare with China, I started to investigate and found out that Eukanuba contained the same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods.  I wasn't happy.  I contacted Newman's about whether the products in this food are sourced from the U.S. and I was told by one of their scientists that they are.  Recently, I moved and was unable to get Newman's locally, so I tried a couple other organic brands.  My dog didn't like them and she seemed to have a larger stool.  I decided to go back to Newman's and order from Amazon, who I can always count on to carry everything.  Now she's happy and so am I!  And, we're supporting a great cause, because Newman's doesn't compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors.  What more could you ask?<br /><br />One important thing to consider - if you have a senior dog, it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier.

review/summary: I agree with the previous reviewer, the name is deceptive.
review/text: When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole "greenwashing" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.

review/text: My foster dog, Rex, came to me severely underweight with nutrient defficiencies and digestive issues.  After a few weeks of prescription food, I phased him into Newman's Own Advanced Formula.  Not only does he love it, but he's gaining weight marvelously and digests it easily.  It was recommended by many, and has minimal to no fillers.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy the product because as a life-long vegetarian, it was important to find a food with strict animal compassion practices, and Newman's Own apparently has those.  It's affordable as well.  Sticking with it!

review/summary: Best Dog Food Ever
review/text: This is a great dog food product - healthy, organic and great for sensitive tummies!<br /><br />Our Lhasa Apso is nine years old, is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach. We started feeding him Newman's Own Organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really, really satified with this product. He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally. I am a Prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping. I will certainly order it again when we get close to running out.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!!

They have thrived so well on this food, my shepard no longer has stomach problems ... both their coats are beautiful and I am completely satisfied.  When I decided to switch foods, I did alot of research on what good, healthy, mostly organic food to switch them to. I chose Newman's Own, not because I could purchase it easily at a local store .. because I can not do so, I have to order it and have it delivered, but because of the ingredients, how it is made, and because most of the proceeds go to charities. I found the best price at Amazon, and will always order it this way.  I truly recommend this dog food to everyone.

review/text: Our dog has always been a little on the lazy side, and his coat has been fairly unhealthy-looking relative to other dogs we've had in the past. When he began to start smelling on top of it, we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current food.<br /><br />After about a week on the new food, he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier. On top of that, the odor that he emitted started to subside until it was no longer there.<br /><br />We really didn't expect it to be so drastic. We're very happy with Newman's Own dog food.

Well Our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from 13 to 17 dollars for 7 pounds, also at Wal Mart is was past its expiration date and rancid. Thank you Amazon, it comes fresh!It is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which I can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date. I cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs.Our lives are busy, I am a nurse and anything that is dependable, easy, reasonable, comes with excellent customer service, and my friends Maggie, Lucy, and Honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day, Thank you

review/text: I have been feeding this to my Standard Poodle for quite some time. It was recommended by a local dog day care/grooming/training center called Great Dog Shoppe in Seattle. They are VERY specific about which foods they suggest and sell. It must meet certain standards of nutrition or it's no-go. My poodle loves it, but even better, I offered some to my cousin's finicky poodle who "just doesn't eat when she's away from home". She gobbled it right up and asked for more. When I compared the contents of Newman's to her brand (which was suggested by a breeder) there was NO comparison. Newman's Own is far superior. I get it via "subscribe and save" so I never run out, I save over the store price and it's delivered right to my door. What could be easier?

review/text: Our dog LOVES this food!  He was having serious gastrointestinal problems that weren't clearing up -- until we started him on Newman's Own.  Since then, he has been regular, happy, and healthy.

review/summary: My dog thrives on this
review/text: I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding, and he absolutely devours this stuff.  LOVE IT!!!!

review/summary: No Worries-Good Stuff in here
review/text: I am very happy I switched from a very popular dog food, sold in a lot of vets offices to Newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress. All has been well with my fur baby ever since ;-) And to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than I can get it at the local store, how can you beat that?

review/summary: this is the one
review/text: I, like most people, switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods, settled on this one.  My dogs like it and I feel good about it feeding it to them.

review/summary: Not what I thought
review/text: As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />"Stacey"'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by-product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold-out" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. "

review/summary: Are my three dogs too pickey?
review/text: I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise "natural ingredients and better health". I decided to try Newman's Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newman's Own with another brand, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the "other" food and they will tend to leave Newman's Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newman's Own. I am not here to "knock" Newman's Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old.

review/summary: How you can tell it is great...
review/text: The dogs had been eating Purina for a long, long time. I switched to Newman's Own and I noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious of...the waste. They no longer expel foul odorous waste, which Purina seemed to do to them regularly. Since they've been on Newman's, their waste is almost odorless and, well...it is easy to pick up. You can tell it's nutritious by what comes out, and if you have to pick up after your dog daily, like myself, you'll appreciate the cleaner output.

review/summary: Still the Best!
review/text: My goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. So I decided to try two other brands....what a mistake.<br /> Newman's own is really the best: my dog looks better, feels better, and the quality of food is very good. Do not do like I did and experiment around...my poor dogs stomach....stick with Newmans.

review/summary: Great food.
review/text: I switched to this food from Blue Buffalo. I hate to say it, but around the time Blue started doing tv commercials the food started upsetting my dog's stomach. Perhaps that's a coincidence, but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing. The Newman's food has been great. My dog loves the food. He has been energetic and in great health. Not much more that you could ask. The bag of treats that comes in the 12.5 lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag.

review/summary: Great dog food!
review/text: I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!

review/summary: Not as good as it used to be
review/text: This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd), but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newman's, with batch numbers from the bags, but have received no answer. Since then, I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again.

review/summary: Great for my Miniature Schnauzer
review/text: I bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and I feed her a heaping cup everyday. Also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028ZLL8">Nutramax Cosequin Regular Strength Capsules - 180 Count</a>, to help with joint health. I purchased this brand of dog food for my 7 year old mini schnauzer based on the reviews alone. She never has had any digestive problems or issues and also isn't a very picky eater so I cannot attest to these two things. Her stool is firm is easy to pick up from eating this dog food and I have not had any issues with her having diarrhea or runny stool. She has been on Newman's Own Organic dog food for about 6 months and I plan to keep feeding her this.<br /><br />If you want your dog to have a healthy and long life, you will want to feed them the best like this organic dog food. Try avoiding feeding table scraps and make sure they have plenty of exercise.<br /><br />Make sure you sign up for Subscribe and Save for that extra 15% off.<br /><br />****EDIT 04/10/2012<br /><br />Edited to say that Amazon now only has 5% off for Subscribe and Save. Also the latest bag I received also came with a full size sample bag of treats <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045XE32E">Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. It sells for $23 for 6 on Amazon!

review/summary: GREAT for my little guy, HUGE difference over store brand
review/text: My Chiweenie was having issues with dandruff, constipation and a dull coat. We researched different dog foods and bought Newmans Own for Active or Senior dogs. In about 3 weeks, its like having a brand new dog. He is so soft, dandruff free, having healthy 'movements' ;) and he loves the food. I can give him a piece of it as a treat and he really thinks it is, ha ha. Moral of the story, we will never go back to bargain brand. For just a little bit more our dog is healthier, softer, happier and its worth it.
