review/summary: Super Strong Ginger taste & VERY crispy - not very sweet but I liked 'em!
review/text: For those of you used to  a soft, more traditionally spiced & sweetened Ginger Snap, be prepared for a unique, but flavorful experience! If you have trouble chewing hard cookies you should also be forewarned that these are very well-baked cookies and while crisp, they are also a little harder than your typical american cookie - think Biscotti-level-of-crispy/hard and you'll be about right. (As noted further below, you can easily fix this by adding a soft piee of sandwich bread, maybe half a piece to the open bag and then close it tight overnight.  That will soften the cookies up nicely)  That said, these are an interesting treat that are sure to clear your sinuses and your palate!  The Ginger taste is normal with the first nibble but by the end of the half-dollar sized cookie, you are breathing ginger fire! it's not a turly "hot" spiciness but it IS strong and did make my nose run a little after two cookies.  I enjoyed the crispiness and the intensity cuz I like Ginger, so that's not a bad thing. Newman's Own ups the Ginger quotient by adding not just ground Ginger but Candied Ginger Root , which has a powerful ginger flavor.  It's sold in most Asian sections of the grocery store as Ting Ting Jahe and I love it for it's intense ginger flavor, so adding it as an ingredient made sense to me.  I was mildly disappointed that they omitted the normal small amount of pepper from the recipe but that's a more european tradition.  Consider this a very Asian version of the Ginger Snap or just a more adult treat.<br /><br /> These cookies are only lightly sweetened, so you can enjoy the recommended serving of 5 of the 1.5 inch diameter cookies (think of a Kennedy Half Dollar coin) and come away having only eaten 130 calories. Personally, I was satisfied with just 2 of the small cookies at a time due to the strong flavor.  That will sure help my wasitline! If you do eat the 5 cookies as a serving, you will be getting 24 carbs but only 12 of them are from sugar, which beats out most crispy cookies in that regard. The rest of the carbs are from the unbleached wheat flour and other ingredients.  Only 30 of the 130 calories per serving come from Fat. That's better than the average cookie and almost certainly much better than most of the "100 calorie" packages of sweets and cookies.  They've made a concerted attempt to balance the sugar and fat content with other ingredients to produce a tasty treat but not one that you'll feel bad about havinbg eaten after the fact.  Overall, once the bag was finished, I'd say nobody in the house ever ate the full suggested serving in one sitting - usually 2 to 3 cookies satisfied our  "little something indulgent" craving.<br /><br />At first I wasn't too pleased to see Palm fruit oil as the fat chosen for this product because it's a saturated fat and one often sourced from slash & burn agriculture... BUT... Newman's Own uses an Organic Palm Fruit Oil and most Organic Palm oil is made from Palm Kernels, which has even more fat.  Newman's Own uses oil that is harvested from farms that make a strong effort to preserve local wildlife so it's not like the companies that are Green "in name only"  but whothen go and use Palm oil from Indonesian clear-cut plantations.  Newman's Own has a solid reputation to protect and I doubt they'd risk it by using a non-green source of Palm Oil. I trust that they've sourced this from the greenest farms they can find since their price point is higher.  Just to be sure I wasn't steering any consumer wrong,  I looked this issue up on the Newman's Own website FAQ for this product & they explain that they use Palm Fruit oil  which is a better saturated fat than  the food industry standards of Palm Kernel oil or Coconut Oil.  They further explain that they use this oil both for the lower price and the better taste & texture they provide the finished baked good. The Newman's Own FAQ also specifically states that their source is a Green Co-Op in Columbia that is Certified Organic.  That made me feel a lot better since Palm oil Plantations in Indonesia are causing the extinction of Orangatans and dozens of other species at an alarming rate.  I feel good knowing that Newman's Own cares about the same things I do!<br /><br />The price of this treat seems to bother a lot of people and I feel I should address that.  For me, I buy Newman's Own products specifically because I can trust their ingredient sourcing and I don't mind paying a premium price since I know that the profits help fund charitable grants.  Also on Newman's Own Website, they explain that the recent huge increases in Organic food ingredients has impacted their prices and that they have tried to deal with that as best as they can.  You can also go to their site and print coupons for use in your local grocery store and they do frequently run grocery specials here on Amazon.  With these Ginger Snaps, I suspect a smaller amount will satisfy any snack craving I might have since they are so intensely flavored and baked to such a crisp.  Therefore, I'm not too concerned about mindlessly eating myself out of house and home.  Snack foods and sweets are indulgences and if you want the best ingredients with regard to taste, health, and environmental impact, sometimes you have to pay a little more.  Since I've not had the whole bag, I can tell you that my instincts proved correct and that nobody in the house ever ate more than 2 to 3 cookies for a snack.  They filled the "Snack" spot in our menu and did it with fewer calories and about the same cost overall (if I had not gotten the bag for free) as other treats we like that are cheaper.  I will buy these in the store or on Amazon but as usual, I will shop for sales and look at the Newman's Own site for Coupons!<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is a bracingly intense Ginger Snap with a whole lotta crunch!  The serving size is satisfying and the caloric content is well-balanced  in regard to fat and sugar content.  If you find the very firm texture of the cookie to be a bit much, I would suggest opening the packet and putting in half a slice of fresh bread and then re-sealing the bag well.  Within a day, the cookies should soften up a bit by absorbing the moisture from the bread.  Try it!  It might just make these a 5 star experience for you.<br /><br />I took one star off because in all honesty, they aren't the best Ginger Snaps I've ever had and the powerful Ginger taste reminded me a bit too much of eating Ginger Udon Noodles for dinner. These are not a treat for people who crave something truly sweet.  My wife suggested that brushed the cookies with a little water and then sprinkling some brown sugar on top or even dusting them with powdered sugar before serving might help but I ate them without trying to sweeten them up.  I did, however, like them softened up after she tried the bread slice trick on the latter half of the bag!<br /><br /> Even so, 4 stars is a great rating and if you love Ginger, you'll love these.  If you regularly chew the Ginger candy I mentioned above, Tin Ting Jahe, then this will be a 5 star experience for you!  ALso, to acknowledge the price, I felt I couldn't give this five total stars since some people reading this are not in a position to care about ethical ingredient sourcing and so forth; they just want to be able to afford a bag of cookies.

review/summary: Cookies with a Kick!
review/text: Once I get past the concept of "organic cookies", which sounds like an oxymoron, I have to admit: these ginger snaps are not for wussies.  These little gems are really concentrated with ginger flavor; one might even say they're downright spicy.  The little bits of candied ginger are no small part of this potent taste.  They really impress as an old-fashioned style cookie, and remind me a bit of the British "Ginger Nuts".  As cookies go, they're not bad in the fat department either, with 130 calories per serving, 30 from fat.  If you like your ginger flavor strong, these are the cookies for you.

review/summary: Extra Ginger Flavored
review/text: Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps are loaded with ginger.  Both candied and ground ginger give these small hard cookies a real kick.  Taste is a mixture of wheat flower, sugar and molasses.  The ginger kick arrives late and mostly as an after taste.  For someone who likes ginger, this is a good thing.  Children may find this too overpowering and not care for these.  Nice to have on hand for a late night snack with a cold glass of milk for dunking.

review/summary: Vegan, fairly-priced, and comparable to my favorite ginger snap brand
review/text: I'm a fan of ginger snaps and cookies. I can't have dairy, so I give a thumbs up to Newman's for making them vegan.<br /><br />I always think twice about ordering food through the mail since fragility often leads to damages. Mine arrived in great condition and the bag and snaps weren't crushed. These are fairly-priced too, which is a great deal for organic food. Sometimes organic stuff is just "too rich for my blood," but not in this case. I'm giving you the green light to order!<br /><br />The serving size is five snaps, but let's be honest - these are delicious and we're going to eat more than five. They have a bit of a "bite" to the flavor, a real ginger spiciness, which is nice. I'd compare them to Swedish-style <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPP588">Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps</a>, a personal favorite.

review/summary: Could be softer, but they taste good
review/text: I don't generally choose ginger snaps over other kinds of cookies, but I do enjoy them from time to time.  These cookies can't pass for homemade, but they're certainly more interesting than I expected from a bagged cookie.  The texture is a little off-putting; these cookies are definitely crunchy, and that's not as positive a quality when they're so thick.  I think future tweaking of this product ought to include making them either a little thinner or a little softer.  Aside from texture, though, they're definitely tasty.  There's a little sweetness, but the dominant taste comes from the bite of plenty of ginger.  It's a much bolder spice than I anticipated, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I can definitely see myself buying these cookies again in the future - not so much just for myself, but as a last-minute contribution for a holiday party this winter.

review/summary: Crunchy goodness
review/text: "Try this, GMR," I said, and gave him a Newman's Own Ginger Snap.<br /><br />*crunch crunch crunch* Mmmmmmmm, says he.<br /><br />"It's a vegan ginger snap!" I say, and grin around the room as if I had made them my own se'f.<br /><br />I pass them around our comp'ny here in the cove at Killian Knob and everyone takes a cookie and the entire room, the cove, the universe is filled with the sounds of *CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!* - for these are some crunchy cookies and in fact, if they were just one more teeniensy bit of crunchy, they'd be too hard. But good ole Newman knew his crunch factor so danged if he didn't leave it just as it should be.<br /><br />All agreed that lil ole cookie packed a wallop of good ginger taste. What I liked most was that it wasn't overly sweet - thankee Newman, for not sending me into a sugar jitter as some cookie makers do!<br /><br />They're tiny, too, which means we could eat the entire bag and not realize it, save for how crunchy they are - slows down the jawing - haw! - so that we only ate a few. Bet they'd be good dipped in milk, if you like milk that is - if you don't, and sometimes I do and sometimes I don't, then well, it probably would taste nasty, so don't try it on the days you hate milk, especially if that's every day - right? Huhn.<br /><br />So, as I said "It's a vegan ginger snap!" and everyone snapily crunched, no one thought "Ewwww," - oh no, nopity no. Everyone happily crunchified their way to gingersnap heaven. Only one person said, "Aren't all cookies vegan?" and I shrugged and ate another cookie, for I really couldn't remember if there were any lard cookies out there or chicken cookies or liver cookies. . . then I remembered vegans don't eat eggs or milk (guess can't dip it in milk after all - well dang!), and I said, "Nope, all cookies are not vegan," with an air of Great Knowledge.<br /><br />And that, my friends, concludes my review of this little cookie. namaste.

review/text: These are pretty good gingersnaps. They even have little bits of crystallized ginger in them to give that spicy kick that so many mass-market gingersnaps steer clear of.<br /><br />The only thing i didn't like is that they go beyond crispy to downright hard. If your jaw muscles aren't in shape, they will be after you plow through a bag of these.<br /><br />Also, the bag comes with that useless little piece of sticky-tape so you can close it up between binges, but those never really work that well.

review/text: There is plenty of ginger in these ginger snaps, so fans of strong ginger taste should love these cookies.  The ginger is so strong it leaves a burning sensation on the tongue.  These are small, rather hard cookies with all organic ingredients and 130 calories from five cookies.  These would probably go down better with a hot beverage or a cold glass of milk. The bag is resealable to maintain freshness.

review/text: Ginger is one of my least favorite spices; and I have never cared much for ginger bread cookies or ginger snaps. I must say, however, that these from the Newman family are quite tasty little surprises. Supposedly these ginger snaps are made from real candied ginger, and it shows. The ginger flavor is quite strong. I may have to rethink my position on ginger. If I can hold off, I plan to put these cookies in the crust of a a pumpkin cheesecake for the holidays.<br /><br />This product is also dairy and egg free if case you care. I don't. I have been eating them with fat free milk. Everything in life is a tradeoff anyway.

review/text: Warning do not set this bag of Ginger Snaps by your computer.  If you fail to follow this advice you are likely to eat the whole bag without realizing it.<br /><br />My brother, after tasting these Ginger Snaps commented "these should be labeled dangerously delicious."  Why? They are not dangerous because of the ingredients, they are made with 70%+ organic ingredients.  They are dangerous because they are so tasty that it is easy to over do it and eat the whole bag!<br /><br />If you like Ginger Snaps you owe it to your taste-buds to try a bag of Newman's Organic Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />P.S.  Ginger Snaps are one of my favorite cookies so I might be slightly biased.

review/summary: Did not care for texture or flavor
review/text: I received Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps today.  They were delivered by the U.S. Mail and they are so hard, that even the mail carrier did not crush them when they were stuffed in my mail box.  I did not expect the cookie to be so hard and have a burnt appearance.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these cookies because I do try to buy organic products when I can.  However, these cookies had a strange flavor that lingered long after I finished one.  The ginger is just overpowering.  My tongue is still tingling a bit.  Maybe it is just me because other reviewers have given this cookie high ratings.<br /><br />I think that Newman's Own Organics makes some wonderful items, but this is not one of them.  I will buy Nabisco Ginger Snaps next time.

The ginger flavor is bracingly fresh and clean, without that annoying "bite" -- that cloying aftertaste -- that most other ginger snaps have.<br /><br />And there is a little bit more grit to the texture than with other store-bought ginger snaps.<br /><br />I also like a neat little feature on the packaging -- a peel-and-stick strip of tape you can use to reseal the package after you munch a bunch of cookies, to keep the remaining snaps snappy.<br /><br />Looking at the list of ingredients, I see that most appear to be the product of Mother Nature, not laboratory science.<br /><br />At a little under $3 for a 6-1/2-ounce package, these classy cookies seem to be not too unreasonably priced, a rarity these days.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a superior ginger snap on the cookie shelf of your favorite supermarket, I suggest you give these a try.  I give them thumbs up -- with a snap!

review/text: This cookies have a great bite to them - the perfect gingersnap! The ginger tastes fresh - like it's just been peeled! They're crispy without being rock hard as some bagged cookies tend to be. Even more impressive than the taste is the short ingredient list - no fillers, fake colors/ flavors, or nasty preservatives. They have a good fat- to- total calorie ratio, so I'd be comfortable keeping them around as a quick snack, and the peel-off sticker for resealing will help them good on the road. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone who likes ginger!

These are the closest you will get to a real ginger snap that isn't homemade by your grandma.  If you have dental problems, you might not want to try them because they are just that crunchy.  But I liked the crunch.  My little kids, ages 3 and 8, initially really liked them too, but after 3-4 cookies, they were complaining of the spiciness.  That is a plus in my book--don't have to worry about my kids eating all the cookies before I even get one!

I actually prefer the chewy ginger cookies as opposed to the traditional crunchy snaps! I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but Newman's Own should offer both a crunchy ginger snap and a chewy one. I get migraines from MSG and flavor enhancers, so I have to only eat organic products.

Spice is code for MSG, Monosodium Glutamate, a potentially harmful ingredient if ingested.  I am sure that the cookies, just like all of Newman's products I've ever tasted, are delicious. Unfortunately, I can't eat them. Thumbs down Newman's for using this harmful chemical in your product.

review/summary: Snap these up!
review/text: I am particular about ginger snaps and have a select few that I really enjoy. I have now found the one that has become my absolute favorite. Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps have everything that I look for in a ginger cookie.<br /><br />These are spicy, but with a pleasant bite, and a buttery finish. They are crispy but not rock-hard. The are organic (always my preference) and come from a thoughtful company who donates their proceeds (another nice touch).<br /><br />I haven't been disappointed by a Newman's product yet, and this is no exception. Absolutely give these a try!

review/summary: Organic Ginger Snaps with a Double Ginger Kick
review/text: Newman's Own Organics (co-founded by Nell Newman) started as a subsidiary of Newman's Own in 1992 and became a separate company in 2001.<br /><br />Fans of NOO begged for a ginger snap cookie to be added to the line and they got their wish.<br /><br />These ginger snaps are made with ground ginger and candied ginger. There is a double ginger bite and kick to these cookies.<br /><br />These organic snaps are addictive and it is easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting. Separate five cookies each into six bags and you will stick to eating 130 calories for a snack instead of the entire bag.<br /><br />Fun Fact: The American Gothic picture on the package features "Pa" (Paul) Newman and daughter Nell Newman in appropriate costume.

review/summary: Gingery Ginger Snaps
review/text: Newman's ginger snaps are exactly that - small, very crisp cookies with a strong ginger taste.  I'm  a habitual label reader and I was also pleased to see that they weren't made with a long batch of esoteric chemicals - only recognizable natural ingredients. The package also comes with a convenient peel tape for re-sealing after its initial use.  Why three stars?  I personally found the ginger taste a bit strong for my palate, and the cookies a bit hard.  But if you like a pronounced ginger flavor in a crunchy cookie, these ginger snaps are for you.

review/text: This bag of cookies didn't survive more than an hour in my house which pretty much sums up how good they are.<br /><br />Above all, check this out in the description: "All natural; made with 70%+ organic ingredients; no artificial flavors or colors; no hydrogenated oils; no trans-fatty acids; dairy free; egg free; vegan". We're currently doing the vegan thing so it's great to find tasty snacks like this that make you forget about oils, butters and the things you're giving up.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of ginger so it's simply not possible to have too much in my opinion. I loved the crunchiness and appropriate bite size as well. I'll be ordering more now that the freebies have gone.

review/summary: Tough and Gingery
review/text: Like Paul Newman himself, these cookies are tough and gingery. I gave it 3 stars because some people will like the snap to one's teeth as one bites down, and also will like the lingering hot ginger taste after one has swallowed. I didn't. In fact, the ginger buildup in my mouth was so intense after only two cookies that I stopped eating them.<br /><br />I thought the taste was adequate with a good sugar content. Frankly, I would have preferred less ginger and a softer cookie.

Just over half of the package of cookies were too done on the bottom, that does not say much about their quality control. I do like that they are organic, it is hard to find sweet treats that are, so I did give them a three out of five.

review/summary: Snappy Ginger Cookies
review/text: I love cookies and I love Newman's Own products, so when I saw that Newman's Own were coming out with Organic Ginger Snap cookies, I had to try them. Made with Organic Flour and Sugar, these Ginger Snaps are form the Newman's Own Organics line, run by Paul Newman's daughter, Nell. Now I have to say these cookies pack a powerful punch of flavor. If you don't like your ginger snaps to be too spicy, I would steer clear of them. They are very crunchy and tasty,but I had to have a tall glass of iced tea by my side when eating them because they really have a load of ginger in them. They are a great bite size and have real candied ginger bits in them. Even though they are a bit spicier than I generally like, I still polished off the bag quite quickly! I am looking forward to trying more from the Organic line of Newman's products.

review/text: I am fond of ginger. I use fresh ginger root and ground ginger in many recipes, especially stir-fries. It's aromatic, flavorful and has some spice heat.<br /><br />You can really taste the ginger in these Newman's Own cookies, but I just didn't care for it that much. They don't skimp, I'll give them that much. My feeling, though, is that it needs to be toned down a bit for use in cookies. It's a little too prominent here.<br /><br />Also, there was a very definite bitter under-taste here that I don't think comes from the ginger. I think they may have been somewhat over baked.

They are very crisp and not that sweet (I thought the not so sweet was a bonus) but the sugar coated ginger lacks for the sweetness in the cookie. There are little pieces throughout the cookie that I found to strong for me. I like ginger and use it often in my cooking but these were to overwhelming for me. The cookie was good but not one of my favs from this company.

Who can ask for more? I knew when I ordered the ginger snaps that they would be good, but hands down, these are the BEST ginger snaps I have ever had in my entire life. They are super crunchy and spicy and even have a slight hint of salt that makes you want to eat them until the last one is gone. They are made with organic flour and sugar and taste like they were actually baked in someone's kitchen...a quality not often found nowadays. I love, love, love all of Newman's Own products and this product is beyond delicious (and low in fat!). Highly recommended.

review/text: If I'm one thing, I'm a cookie guy. I even started my own website for Cookie Athletes. Normally I'm a chocolate cookie guy but I'm an equal opportunity eater. So when I tried these ginger snaps, they quickly became my favorite ginger snap cookie. Not only does the organic aspect appeal to me but so does Newman's commitment to giving back.<br /><br />I think the thing that really makes it for me is the candied gingers in the cookie. It adds just a little bit more texture and "umph" to the cookie and really solidifies it as a great cookie. If you like the texture of dried fruit in food, then this tiny piece of candied ginger make it perfect.<br /><br />The only con is that sodium is a bit high at 180MG, but hey, it's a cookie!

The ginger burns in your throat for about a minute after eating them and it's a powerful flavor.  It's nice to have a cookie that actually fills your mouth with taste, instead of just sweetness.  I like the tape on the bag that lets you seal it up after eating.  The zipper type bags sometimes just don't seal right or tear.  This is definitely a delicious treat.

They're full of ginger punch, which I love. The spiciness really lays heavy on the pallet, and the cookies have a lot of good texture. These are perfect for a pie crust and the fact that they are made from real food and not a bunch of additives makes them less a guilty pleasure and more a wholesome treat. Give me a plate of these with a glass of milk, and I'll be happy.

The taste is strong but not unpleasant. I haven't yet seen these cookies in the store but will be buying them as soon as they appear in our local supermarkets. Newman's own uses organic wheat flour. This helps to make the product both robust and flavorful. When you see these Ginger snaps, don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy them.

It is hard to bite into with front teeth because the cookie is so hard, but it is small enough to pop the entire cookie into your mouth and enjoy. Gives you a nice spice aftertaste. It was actually kind of hard for me to eat just one, I like the flavor. For some reason these cookies kind of remind me of Mother's brand cookies.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and there is a reseal tab attached to keep the freshness of the cookies. Nutrition Facts says the serving size is 5 cookies (30g) and 130 calories per serving.

This batch seemed well done; I don't know if they're supposed to be that dark--and a trifle black on the bottom of some.  They're smaller and thicker than what I'm used to--and hard and crunchy.  You definitely need to soak them in milk longer, but yes, I really like them.  One family member thought some cookies were burned, but she loves them and plans to buy more.  We both noticed pieces of candied ginger, which we all love.  Another family member doesn't think they need to be dunked in milk.  The best thing about them is that they truly are ginger snaps.

review/text: There is no question that Newman's Own has made some really outrageous and clever cusisine, but it has been benefiting so many people for years. But when I heard about their cookies, I was absolutely very skeptical about them. Their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps, really bring out the ginger of the gingersnap cookies. Each cookie, really tastes like you smelling a freshly minced piece from ginger root. It is that strong, in fact a bit too strong for kids, but not for adults. They do taste good, but I do think kids might be a bit turned off with the cookies though because of the strong ginger root smell and taste. Still, Newman's Own does really make it worth its while, and I do recommend you give Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps a try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: Good cookie...strong ginger taste
review/text: I love ginger snaps, so I'm always willing to try a new brand.  I traditionally like the Nabisco ginger snaps and those are my brand of choice, so that's the baseline to compare these to in my mind.<br /><br />These cookies are smaller, about the size a a half dollar coin.  They are very crispy and have a good flavor.  They seemed to be almost over baked as they were very dark brown on the bottom of the cookie (though they did not tast burnt).  The ginger taste is a bit stronger than Nabisco snaps, and they are slightly less sweet.  There seems to be a bit less molasses flavor as well.  I did notice a slight aftertaste with these cookies that I don't get from Nabisco cookies.  I probably atribute that to the stronger ginger flavor, so if you're a bit fan of ginger, you might like these a little more than I did.  I shared these cookies with several co-workers and most of them gave a thumbs up, although a couple people did comment that they did notice the aftertaste.<br /><br />Organic is always nice, but in a cookie, I'm probably less apt to buy these just because they are made from organic ingredients.

review/text: Newman's Family Recipe Ginger Snap Cookies have a strong but pleasant ginger flavor, with molasses and other spices adding to the taste.  These cookies are about the size of Nilla Wafers, and a serving is considered five with 130 calories total.  They have a crunchy texture and aren't messy if you want to grab a handful to eat on the go.  They are also vegan and made with all-natural products.<br /><br />Just noticed while examining the package that it comes with pull off tape which lets you reseal the package. A nice touch, if you ask me.<br /><br />I did get a couple which had a dark brown/blackish bottom, but those were exceptions, and overall, they were tasty with no unpleasant aftertaste.  If you want to be more decadent, try putting a small scoop of French vanilla ice cream between two for a homemade ice-cream sandwich.

There is a deep spice flavor that leaves a lingering zing on your palate. If you prefer your sweets to be more savory than sweet, you'll really enjoy these cookies.<br /><br />There are five cookies per serving. At 130 calories and 3.5 grams of fat, they are a good choice for your healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />While not all of the ingredients were organic, such as the Molasses and spices, the majority ingredients were organic.<br /><br />These are good "grown up" cookies.

review/summary: Real spicy ginger flavor in a biscotti-like cookie
review/text: Woooo these are addictive.  I think it's the power combo of spicy ginger, sugar, a bit of pronounced saltiness and crunch.  They are about an inch in diameter and pack a real subtly-heated punch of authentic ginger flavor.  I love ginger any way I can get it; pickled, candied, fresh in sweets and savories, you name it.  It says they have candied ginger pieces in them but after popping about ten of these I have only encountered one chewy morsel.  They are organic and all natural, so that might account for the inconsistency in texture.  Some were exactly like a puffy, hard-crunch biscotti and others were flatter, denser and slightly chewy with crunch around the edges.  But all of them were extremely delicious when dipped in coffee.  They're okay alone, but the coffee dipping made them truly awesome.  Really yummy and great for Fall and holiday time.  I bet you could blend them up nicely with butter like you would for a graham cracker crust for pies or cheesecake.  2 cents.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic sugar, molasses, organic palm fruit oil, candied ginger, ground ginger, salt, leavening(sodium bicarbonate, monoccalcium phosphate), soy lecithin, spice.<br /><br />Serving size 5 cookies<br />130 calories<br />Total fat 3.5 g<br />Saturated fat 1.5 g<br />Sodium 180 mg<br />Total carb 24 g<br />Fiber 0<br />Sugars 12 g<br />Protein 1 g

review/summary: An unfair take on the flavor of ginger
review/text: At the end of the day I am a fan of the flavor that is "ginger".  Ginger has a taste that is both smooth yet has a zing, which makes it very versatile for food.  It has found a home in the realm of Asian cuisine, the ginger man cookie would be lost without it and nothing says "adult soda" like a glass of ginger ale.  And this is only the beginning of what you can do with ginger (root).  Yet it must be remembered that a little can go a long way.<br /><br />This brings us to this "ginger snap" cookie by "Newman's Own".  In a word I would have to describe this cookie as "awful".  It is too gingery, to the point that my mouth feels like I just ate too much hot sauce once the cookie is chewed and swallowed, in other words bad after taste. The cookie has no balance in flavor; it is just straight up ginger, a sweet aspect would be nice. If I wanted to experience that much ginger I would just chew on ginger root. The cookie itself is as hard as a rock.  I was actually concerned I might chip my teeth when biting into this cookie and this is no hyperbole.  Not to mention that the back of almost every cookie in the bag were burnt.<br /><br />The bag itself is very small and the cost is rather high for what the product really is.  This cookie is also made with organic ingredients.  The one category of food marketing that fails to impress me is organic foods.  For the most part they aren't any healthier and are way too expensive.  So at the end of the day I would suggest on passing on this cookie and go for an old school Pepperidge Farm ginger man cookie.

review/summary: No thanks!  If you must, dunk them first.
review/text: I LOVE ginger snaps, and we are fans of Newman's Own products in this household, but thumbs down on this one.  First of all, they were very hard and over-baked.  In fact, our bag had several with almost burnt bottoms on the cookies.  We found we could tolerate them better if we dunked them in cold milk first, then they weren't so hard, but it still left a funny aftertaste.  They are very strong with ginger and some other spice we couldn't identify but didn't like. I've never met a ginger-snap I didn't like...until now :(

review/summary: Skip These
review/text: I generally like all of Newman's Own food products, particularly their salad dressings, so was surprised to find these ginger snaps completely inedible. It doesn't matter how healthy a snack might or might not be - if it doesn't taste good, the healthy question is a moot point. And Newman's Own simply got something wrong with this recipe because these little cookies are just no good. I let various members of my family try them just to make sure it wasn't just me who found them tasteless, and there was a unanimous thumbs down. I'll go for other brands of ginger snaps and stick with salad dressing, pasta sauces and such from Newman's.

review/summary: Too Much Ginger
review/text: I wish I could give these cookies a great review.  However, I can't. At first taste, they remind me of regular ginger snaps. However, after the second bite, I found the ginger to be so overwhelming that it's almost hot. The aftertaste lasted so long in my mouth that I couldn't get rid of it even after eating something else. I appreciate that they are organic, but I did not find them at all appealing and could not even finish the first cookie.<br /><br />Ellen Gable Hrkach<br />Author, Stealing Jenny

review/summary: Crunchy and strong ginger flavor
review/text: We loved this cookies. I was surprised at how much "gingery" the cookies taste. Also they were very crunchy which made it a very satisfying cookie.<br /><br />My husband loves to have cookies with his afternoon coffee. He tried the ginger snap cookies and absolutely fell in love with them. I had to take the package out of his hands or he would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting!<br /><br />The package includes a little tape to close the bag. Very useful if you do not eat the entire bag in one sitting.<br /><br />The list of ingredients are: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (Ginger, Sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Mono-calcium Phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. I can pronounce all those ingredients so the claim of organic holds.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cookies for those who like ginger snap cookies.

review/summary: Flavorful Snaps
review/text: These are the best ginger snaps I have ever tasted. The ginger taste is intense but not over-powering. I like that they added little pieces of candied ginger to the cookie. It's a nice touch. I appreciate that the ingredients are ones I can actually pronounce. There are no ingredients in this cookie that make me wonder what I am eating. These are all ingredients that one would use baking cookies in their own home. The cookies are approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in size and there are approximately 30 cookies in the 6.5 ounce bag. The bag comes with a resealable tape so you can close the bag up tight to preserve the freshness and snap of these delightful little cookies. The cookies are very crunchy but not break your teeth hard like some ginger snaps can be. They have the perfect density for a ginger snap. I highly recommend these ginger snaps and I myself will be buying more of them.

review/summary: Pleasing for Ginger Lovers
review/text: If you like ginger, you will more than likely appreciate these ginger snaps from Newman's Own Organics.  Unlike many ginger snaps or other ginger-containing products, you not only taste the ginger in these cookies, but you can feel it, too.  Here are the particulars of my review:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  Real ginger taste - Even after just one cookie, I had that telltale spicy burn in my mouth unique to ginger.  In addition to ground ginger, these cookies contain bits of candied ginger large enough to chew on.  If you really love ginger, you'll probably like these cookies.  For those of you who are sensitive to the spice, these may be too much in my opinion.<br /><br />*  Thick size - While not terribly large, about 1.5 inches across, these are fairly thick - about 1/4 inch.  That makes them thicker than most ginger snaps I've run across and also satisfying to eat.  You don't feel cheated by having just one.<br /><br />*  Ingredients - These are mostly made up of ingredients listed as organic on the label, though not all the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*  Palm oil - For those seeking to avoid this particular ingredient, this may be a drawback.  Saturated fat comes in at 1.5g and even though the palm fruit oil is listed as organic, it is the type of fat that may turn some people away.<br /><br />*  Crunch - For this reviewer, these were a little too crunchy - even to the point of being jarring.  I was surprised initially and it reminded me of eating especially hard Corn Nuts or un-popped popcorn.  Maybe it is because they are so thick, or perhaps because they have been baked a little longer.  I could imagine that people with sensitive teeth could have a problem with these.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />Overall, I think these are good and tasty ginger snaps.  I happen to like ginger, so the strong ginger taste is fine by me.  That ginger spice burns lingers a good 15 minutes after eating these...<br /><br />My main issue with these is how crunchy they are; perhaps I got a batch that got over-cooked, or maybe they will fine tune them as production continues.<br /><br />So if you like ginger and you want to lean towards organics ingredients in your snacks, don't pass these up without giving them a try.

review/summary: Good, Mostly Organic Cookies
review/text: I have not had ginger snaps in a long time, so I was excited to get these.  They contain mostly organic ingredients and are very good!  They taste "fresher" than most store-bought cookies and less processed.  They aren't too hard or too soft, though ginger snaps are harder than normal cookies.<br /><br />There are wheat and soy ingredients in them, so if you have an allergy to those two things, then you're out of luck.  I also don't know if I would call them vegan since they are "manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, tree nuts, and dairy."  The ingredients do not list any animal products, so it just depends on how "vegan" you want to be.  There are 130 calories in 5 cookies which is not bad, and only 30 of those calories are from fat.<br /><br />I would recommend these and would buy them again next time I get a craving for ginger snaps.

review/summary: not crispy, hard as a rock
review/text: I was looking forward to these. The shipment got lost in the mail and arrived three weeks late, however, from inspecting the cookies inside they were not damaged at all. The cookies have a very VERY good gingery taste without any after-taste of chemistry. Organic as homemade, just as you want from Newman's Own. They are riddled with chunks of candied ginger, too, to amplify the flavor. Flavor is top notch.  A ginger-snap is supposed to be crispy... BUT... these are hard-cooked to dog-biscuit consistency, over-browned on the bottom and tooth-breaking solid. Would not purchase again, unless I run into a few in the bottom of the bag not so dark and hard.

review/summary: Not your typical ginger snap
review/text: Bottom line first: these are tasty, and you can definitely taste the ginger.  I am a cookie fan first, and a ginger snap fan second, so I thought they were very good.<br /><br />My wife informs me that true ginger snap connoisseurs will notice that these are larger than most, and their texture is rougher than most.  If you simply must have small, smooth ginger snaps, I guess you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />But if it's all about the flavor for you, I think you'll enjoy these.  They are very fresh and spicy and flavorful, with pieces of ginger popping up randomly.<br /><br />The packaging is sort of interesting - the package does not include a zip-lock style re-sealing strip, but they do give you a piece of tape (attached to the outside of the bag) that you can use to keep the package closed between bouts of snacking.<br /><br />Also, is it just me, or would "Bouts of Snacking" be a pretty good name for a band?

review/summary: Paul Newman's name is being used in vain.
review/text: When Paul Newman was alive his big foodie project was salad dressing - and it was GOOD.<br /><br />Then his daughter got into the mix and decided to peddle foods that are on trend with certain diets (vegan, organic, gluten free, etc.) and the results are dismal.<br /><br />Overpriced small portions that aren't particularly good or even when not awful are not better than other brands. These cookies are NOT good.<br /><br />Small in size I couldn't help but notice how everyone in the bag was uniformly burnt on the bottom. Surprisingly flavorless for a gingersnap UNTIL you bite into the candied ginger. Then you have a sudden burst of flavor stuck like a gummy candy to your teeth while the rest of your mouth is trying to process a hard cookie. Not my favorite sensation. Normally I love to dip my gingersnaps in milk, unfortunately even this did not improve them for me. I did not finish the bag and will not be recommending them to anyone else.<br /><br />If you love Paul Newman & want to support his charities - stick with the salad dressing.<br /><br />If you want a great gingersnap that is awesome with milk - get Stauffer's!

review/summary: Great Taste, but then FAIL from there
review/text: I love ginger snaps and was excited to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.  They taste really good and have that amazing "bite" that real ginger gives.  Amazing.  Truly.<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies cannot ride on flavor alone.  They are really hard.  So much so, that chewing them hurt my teeth (and I'm an ice cruncher, if that tells you anything).  I was chewing so hard on these that I bit my lip and inner cheek just trying to manage these snaps in my mouth.<br /><br />If I can get the exact same taste in another brand, but not mangle my mouth and give myself a headache while chewing, I will go with a different brand.

review/summary: Real Ginger Flavor
review/text: These cookies are made with real ginger, which gives them a sharp, hot flavor. If you're used to artificial flavors it might seem strong, and I think this is the "aftertaste" that other reviewers are mentioning. But this ginger is the real thing. The cookies are small enough that you can eat several without consuming your day's calorie quota. These are great lunchbox items and they travel well. By the way, ginger is supposed to be good for stimulating your digestion and dispelling nausea, so there are good reasons to eat these, and not just because they taste good. :)<br /><br />Newman's ginger snaps have more surface texture than most store-bought brands, resulting in a somewhat grainy texture. It's not unpleasant. The cookies are not as hard as some ginger snaps I've eaten, but they're not really chewy, either. There's just enough give that you don't feel like you're going to break a tooth when you bite into them. I like to dunk ginger snaps in my coffee. Well, these held up just fine, without dissolving. So for all you cookie dunkers out there, I'm sure they'd survive milk, too.

review/text: If my gramps taught me anything it was that cookies are for dunking.  These little tasty cookies hold up in the dunk process be it coffee, tea or milk.  The ginger taste is strong and distinct - if you ate these blindfolded you'd shout out "ginger".  The ingredient list was short and pronounceable and the calorie/fat ration was not too bad.  Organic is always a good choice and Newman's is a brand name you can trust.  I'm going to try these Ginger Snaps as a pie crust ingredient instead of graham crackers - that's if I don't eat the whole bag first.  These are a good tasting cookie choice for that late afternoon pick-me-up.

review/summary: Snappy Little Cookie
review/text: Delicious!  This little snap has everything I want in a cookie.  It's very firm and crunchy (after all, it IS supposed to SNAP).  The texture goes from crunchy to chewy (at the end you will get  almost caramelized, chewy bits of real ginger, leaving your mouth enjoying that authentic ginger flavor).  While I enjoy a gingery taste, I don't always appreciate a hot feeling in my mouth.  This cookie doesn't do that to me.<br /><br />It's nice to indulge in sweets that are fairly healthy.  Eating something that doesn't have lots of chemicals in the ingredients list makes me feel better about eating it.  Newman's' products rely on a reputation of being natural and of good quality.  These ginger snaps meet that requirement.  Being able to eat five cookies with just 130 calories is a plus, too.  And being so crunchy, they last a little longer.<br /><br />There's just one caveat to this product.  If you don't like ginger, you simply won't like this cookie.  I had six people test this ginger snap.  Those who don't care for ginger, did not like the cookie.  But, those of us who like ginger LOVED this cookie.  One of the taste testers is from Jamaica and she RAVED about them.<br /><br />Frankly, I can hardly wait until these ginger snaps are available at my local grocery store.  I want to buy them--now!

review/summary: If you like chewy, gritty, bitter cookies, then these are for you!
review/text: I'm not a huge cookie fan.  I like my desserts fruity, cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top, the one exception is ginger snaps.  I like them even when I'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish, I like them with tea, I like them with coffee, I like them with pepper jack cheese (everything goes with pepper jack). Also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when I go to the trouble of baking them, they seem to last longer than other cookies (I mean they still taste good the next day, not that I can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet).<br /><br />But these ginger snaps are not right.<br /><br />They are chewy and gritty.  Stale but burnt in places.  I know, it sounds like a manufacturing problem and I thought perhaps the unburnt, not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked.  Nope.  I picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt, I put them in the oven to 're-crisp' at a low temp (250F) for about five minutes, in the end they still tasted bitter, gitty, stale and overly sweet.<br /><br />The price is right at around $3 a bag, but I think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand, such as Nabisco Ginger Snaps (sweetish, super crispy, reliably cooked for an even crisp texture) or Anna's Ginger Thins, my new favorite store brand of Ginger Snaps (they are wafer thin, spicy and go well with ice cream).

review/summary: not for me
review/text: I never understood the appeal of ginger snap cookies.  The taste is sort of overbearingly sweet, you can't dip them in milk to lessen the strong taste (and plus they fall apart and sink to the bottom of the milk glass instead of turning soft) and well, the taste itself isn't very appealing either.  Not sure what kind of people these type of cookies are trying to target but it sure ain't the younger crowd, and it sure ain't me!  Usually when people hand me a plate of ginger snaps at an adult party or whatever, I take one bite just to be polite and crumble the rest of the cookie inside a napkin when no one is watching.  One of these days I'm going to get caught and then, well, let's just say I probably won't be receiving anymore party invitations. :)  Now I understand why my local grocery market used to have stacks of these cookies sitting on the main shelves in the front of the store.  Too many were shipped to the place and nobody wanted to buy any (and understandably so).

review/text: These Paul Newman ginger snaps were surprisingly tasty, especially considering that they are vegan and thus made without butter or eggs. They are satisfyingly crunchy with just enough softness on the inside to make the texture interesting. They taste strongly of ginger and have an overall great flavor, not too sweet and just spicy enough. If I could change 1 thing about these cookies, I would make the bags larger, so that there would be more cookies in each bag...the cookies disappeared too quickly! Six cookies (6.5 oz. total) is not enough, even if they are a fair size.

review/text: These are a really nice ginger snap with a very strong ginger taste.  If you don't care for ginger (why would you eat these if you don't?), then you may want to stay away.  I loved the crisp cookie with the spicy ginger flavor.  Really nice with a cup of tea or coffee...as well as dunked in milk!

review/summary: The Best Snaps I've Ever Eaten!
review/text: These are the greatest ginger snaps I've ever eaten.  The bits of candied ginger set these far apart from the crowd.  They are also extra tangy compared to most ginger cookies.  Almost peppery if you eat too many, which I am prone to do.  I tried these under the Vine Program, and have since ordered two additional cases.<br /><br />Almost everyone who tries them loves them.  A few friends and family members find them to be too sharp to eat more than one.  But they always comment about that candied ginger!<br /><br />Excellent product.

review/summary: Flavorful, but a little tough to chew.
review/text: I love the flavor of these cookies. However, they can be a little tough to chew. You might best enjoy them with a cup of hot chocolate, or a cup of hot coffee, so you can dip them in the hot liquid to soften them up a bit. These would be a perfect bedtime snack with what my local coffee shop calls a "steamed cow" - a hot, steamed milk (usually flavored) made using the milk steamer on a cappuccino machine. These cookies are just spicy enough, and don't go overboard on the ginger, so they are just right. I love ginger  bread and ginger cookies, and I enjoyed these cookies, although they aren't very chewy right out of the bag.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: The ginger snaps had a nice, not too sweet flavor balanced with a good amount of ginger spiciness.  But overall I wasn't impressed. The cookies tasted a bit stale and were incredibly hard, although I am not sure if they were  overbaked, old or somehthing else.  Although they are organic the cookies left a funny aftertaste and I was incredibly thirsty after eating a few of these. I don't recommend these snaps and would rate them as mediocre.

review/summary: Delicious, and a Real Handy Item.
review/text: Upon strolling the snack food isles of my local Costco Warehouse store, I discovered a huge plastic jar (44 ounces) of UTZ Pub Mix, an assortment of bite-sized salty snack items. Some resembled small crackers, some resembled small straight pretzels, some were cheese flavored, and some were like small rye bread wafers. The only thing they all had in common is that they were all fresh, tasty and, in fact, delicious. The salting is very light, which I prefer, and there's a nice assortment of tastes associated with the different types. They refer to it as a Pub Mix and, indeed, that would be an excellent usage.<br /><br />I'll use this delicious mixture as snacks around the house. The boy (3 years) loves them too. If we ever have a gathering this would make an excellent beginning snack. I could just empty this big 44-ounce jar into a good-sized bowl and, viola, snacks for everyone. Of course, a few other finger-food items might be added. These are gonna work out just fine. And that big jar can be sealed tight to preserve the freshness of any leftovers. Why didn't I notice them before?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

This team smelled like perfume, as well as tasted like it. It left my mouth smelling like I drank a bottle of perfume and it just wasn't pleasant at all. I can usually handle things that taste bad, but this was an exception. If you can get over the strong taste, however, I'm sure you'll be fine.

This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be "organic" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.

Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good.

review/summary: Helped with illness and recovery!
review/text: I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.

review/summary: Hard to Get Used To
review/text: For those who have not had mate before, this is an interesting herbal tea that is somewhat hard to get used to. The flavor profile is very, very herbal and grassy - quite strongly so. The mate itself actually looks and smells somewhat like cut grass. Once steeped (generally slightly below boiling for about 5 minutes), the result is a slightly greenish tea that tastes very earthy. I am of mixed feelings about it. I like earthy flavors and after two or so days, I got used to it and almost liked it. On the other hand, if I am comparing it to roasted mate (which is darker and has a sort of nutty flavor), there is no contest; the latter is better. (Davidson's also sells another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SARK1Y">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Mezclado De M&aacute;te, 16-Ounce Bag</a> that allegedly is spiced with cinnamon and I bet that is pretty decent). If you like earthy teas, you might give this one a try and would probably come a similar conclusion: 3 stars. If you dislike earthy flavors dominating your tea, you might avoid this mate.<br /><br />FYI: this tea is often drunk for its high level of caffeine without the jittery effect of coffee. While it is true that mate has as much caffeine as coffee, the caffeine metabolizes slowly (because it bonds with the tea's tannins). Therefore, the caffeine absorbs in the bloodstream fairly slowly, giving the drinker a more pleasant 'steady flow' of energy.

review/text: This is a great mate. Some people are just not used to the different flavor of mate as compared to regular tea. It is great, especially to keep you awake and sharp during the morning at work. In my experience mate is far stronger than tea (more caffeine?), it also helps to curb your appetite (this is one of the big secrets that Argentitnans, Uruguayans and some people in Brazil use to stay in good shape). Again, mate will taste a bit stronger and a little more bitter or grassy as compared to a regular tea, as this is part of the mate's natural flavor.

review/text: I normally order my mate from Brazil and decided to try Davidson's because I love Amazon Shop and Save so much and have ordered Davidson't green tea in the past. This is a classic yerba mate and if you're into mate it's perfect. If you're into roasted mate (as in the other customer review) an unroasted mate is quite different. I've also recently ordered a bombilla from Teavana and looking forward to trying it as it's authentically meant to be enjoyed.

review/text: I was buying tea packets of yerba mate and going through them too fast for the price I was paying. I decided to try buying mate in bulk; I like Davidson's products, so I gave this a shot. Great tasting tea! I did notice this mate is slightly more smokey/strong than what I was accustomed to, so I simply decreased the amount I used; the result was the same great tasting mate I was accustomed to before with my packets. I'm going to save a lot of money having begun to purchase in bulk instead. Anybody with a taste for Yerba Guayaki mate will appreciate this product but I suggest using less in your tea-ball because it is stronger and you don't need to use as much for a great cup of mate. P.S. I suspect the two or three negative reviews on here are from those who had never tasted mate before and not accustomed to the taste.

review/text: Honestly, I'm not really a big fan of carbonated drinks, but upon seeing "Switch Watermelon strawberry in the vine program I figured I'll give it shot. I do like weird drinks and weird food so why not? What really grabbed my attention is the fact that the drink is a supposed blend of real juices and carbonation with NO sugar added and no corn syrup. Sounds pretty natural, and it packs only 140 calories. (is that good?)<br /><br />The important thing is the drink does taste like a blend of watermelon and strawberry; although I think the strawberry taste is a little stronger. Its liquid properties have a soft texture and it does leave a weak aftertaste in your mouth. It is good and not very sweet, but I still needed some water after finishing the can.<br /><br />The packaging looks a little "sporty" that kind of defeats its supposed exotic image. While I am not a big fan of carbonated drinks, I would prefer this to cola. It is good, refreshing and that's all we should care about.<br /><br />I like it!

review/summary: Tasty but relatively high in calories
review/text: This is a tasty drink that is all natural.  However, a small 8.3 ounce can contains a relatively high 140 calories which is roughly the same number of calories in a 12 ounce Coke.  Only, a Coke is about 50% larger in volume.<br /><br />I like sweet, but to me this is a bit too sweet.  It might be nice as a mixer in an adult beverage though.  I haven't tried to mix it, but you could probably make a nice fruity alcoholic drink out of it.<br /><br />The price isn't a bargain.  At nearly $1 per can, as of this writing, it wouldn't seem to be a compelling value.  I do like it, but I doubt I'd purchase it again.  It also left a bit of a lingering metallic aftertaste that I wasn't thrilled about.  Still, if you don't mind the calories, enjoy a beverage that is sweet and are looking for a natural drink, then this could be worth considering.
