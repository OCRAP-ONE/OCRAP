review/summary: Good but expensive
review/text: The Ovaltine in France is different and has a better flavor than what is sold in the US. We found this, which is indeed the European style, as advertised. It is just fine to replace what our child missed after we moved back, but the cost of shipping makes it impractical to order routinely.

review/text: Back in the day, I used to just eat these right out of the tin.  I've always loved clams in any form.  Same is true for smoked foods.  You can't beat the combination of flavors.  But let me toss a couple ideas at you:<br /><br />1) Get the big scoop sized Fritos, add a blob of cream cheese and one of the clams.  Repeat until you fill a tray.  Easy hors'dourves!<br /><br />2) Big sushi rolls.  Add strips of cream cheese, the clams and some chopped green onion.  Yum!

review/summary: Thank you for the smoky goodness!!!
review/text: My local grocery stores had stopped stocking smoked baby clams some years ago, I suspect this is because my mum and must be the only ones that would buy them. When I was little my mum would crack open a can of smoked baby clams and we would share the can as no one else in the house would eat them. I was happy to have them to share with my mum as I get a tummy ache eating an entire can myself. As I got older the size of the clams in the cans got larger as well. So large that I would not concider them baby or even small clams. Maybe this is why the grocery stores stopped stocking them, they got too large for the can :)<br /><br />As for this product this is one of the best smoked baby clams I have ever eaten. The clams are quite petite, as the name "baby" would denote. And the smoke flavor is not overpowering. Just right. I would agree with a previous review that there was a large amount of oil, but this is of minor consequence as there is a major feast in each can.

review/summary: A Star For Every Baby Clam (if I only could)
review/text: Move over oyster - the smoked baby is the new pearl.  Now the signature mark of the outdoorsman - or woman - of impeccable taste in transportable haute cuisine, legend has it that most of the peaks in the Santa Catalina range, AZ have a can or two of these beautiful Bivalvia stashed away for those in the know.  This, the most recent version, is clad in raw umber wrappings and flaunts a convenient pull-tab lid, traits that effectively redefine the remote dining experience both in terms of aesthetics and kinesthesia.  Anchored by a questionable yet delightful consistency that always keeps one guessing about the nature of the next squish, SBCs (with an assist from the steadfast Wheat Thin) just may replace the role of the venerable potato chip within our lifetime.  Crown Prince has surely secured its fame by producing such a fine, fine, seafood product as this.  From wind-blown mountaintops to surf-swept beaches around the globe, I find these little canned clams to simply be the cat's meow.

review/text: I've been on a campaign to increase the seafood part of my diet and I've stocked up on a lot of canned seafood items, one of which is Crown Prince Baby Clams (smoked, in oil). I enjoy things like this for a light lunch. Just today I opened a can of the baby clams and had them with Wisecrackers (with Roasted Garlic and Rosemary). They were excellent. Nice lunch. The taste was good with the light smoke flavor. I'd prefer the smoked oysters, but that's just a matter of personal taste. The only difficulty was keeping the cats at a distance.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The Jell-O No-Bake Oreo Dessert tastes excellent. It's very easy to make and tastes better than the Oreo Ice cream pies that you get pre-made in the grocery store. All you have to do is mix the ingredients together and put it in your fridge or freezer. It tastes good cold or frozen. It was a huge hit at my last dinner party. I served it for dessert and everyone loved it. Everyone, young and old, raved over it and asked for seconds. I thought that the pie would be too crunchy because the box contains a lot of crushed Oreos but it wasn't. The pie has just enough crunchiness to not overpower the smooth, creamy and rich flavor of the pie. It's not overly sweet and sugary tasting which I like. The only thing I would recommend is that you put this in an 8 to 9 inch round pie plate or something similar in shape so that the pie comes out looking better, if presentation matters to you. Plus, that's what the recipe called for anyway. I neglected to check that out in the store when I bought the mix. I didn't have a round pie plate so I used a 9-inch square Pyrex dish so the pie didn't look as good as the picture but thank goodness it still tasted awesome.

review/text: This would get five stars except for the price. It has a flavor reminiscent of the salad dressing I used to buy from an Asian restaurant--a little sweet and gingery (though I don't think ginger is an ingredient). This is my favorite of all the dressings Foods Alive makes. It's best used straight out of the fridge. Otherwise, it thins out too much and doesn't stick to the salad as well. It ends up in a puddle in the bottom of the dish.

review/text: Enstrem's Toffee is absolutely the best candy I have ever eaten.  When I was a kid living in Grand Junction, Colorado (the home also of Enstrem's) my parents used to get a box of this every year at Christmas.  Needless to say the box would not last very long.  This is thick, rich, and buttery toffee at its finest.  Whole almonds inside this delicious toffee make for the excellent crunch and the crushed almonds and milk chocolate on the top is beyond yummy!  After you eat this awesomeness, there is the crushed almonds, bits of the toffee and chocolate, at the bottom of the box.  You literally have to shake the box of these delicious crumbs in your mouth!  Enstrems has become world famous not only for their toffee but for their chocolate, hard candy, and so much other delicious candy.  They have shops in Colorado from Grand Junciton to Colorado Springs.  It is now easy to order Enstrem's off the internet and their website is outstanding!  I order at least a pound of this delicious toffee every Christmas and have to be careful not to order it every month of the year!  But, I just torture myself and wait to Christmas to order this.  I can't recommend this delicious candy enough!  5 stars and more!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DELICIOUSNESS!

review/text: I love the blend of favors this coffee has. The tones of irish cream, caramel, and hazelnut tastes very good. My only complaint is when the coffee cools down or builds on your pallate it can get an acidic after taste but it isn't overbearing. I love this coffee so much that this is the only store bought coffee I will buy and it's been this way for almost two years. I would be willing to pay a bit more for the coffee if they would upgrade the quality or their beans as I think that is the reason for the somewhat bitter after taste. I drink the coffee black and have been doing so for over 25 years so as not to taint the taste of the beans. So maybe that's why I am being a bit picky on my review. No bitter after taste earns this blend a 5 star rating but because of it I knocked a star off. Just being honest even though I love the blend.

review/summary: Enticing and aromatic
review/text: I love the way the house smells when we brew this coffee. When people are over and they smell the aroma of Highlander Grogg, they always ask "what is that smell" and never refuse a cup. I've tried many different brands of Highlander Grogg, and this is my favorite by far. It's pretty strong, but that's fairly easy to combat with extra water or milk. I love the smell so much that I dump the grounds in my garden by the front door so the scent lingers outdoors as well.

review/summary: Better than most other canned soups, try adding some red wine and fresh ground pepper!
review/text: I just ate a whole can of this by myself, I didn't really stop to think how many servings were in the can.<br /><br />I generally dislike canned soups, but Progresso makes decent ones.<br /><br />This one was rather light on the beef, but what was there was of very good quality, tender and no gristle or fat.<br />The vegetables, especially the potatoes were perfectly cooked, making me wonder how Progresso can manage to put perfectly cooked veggies in their soups, but other brands are not able to.<br /><br />The flavor was very nice, with none of the off notes that I have tasted in other ready to eat soups (Campbells, shudder, yuk)<br /><br />I like to add a little oomph to canned soup, for this flavor I added a dash of red wine and some fresh ground pepper, really made the taste super good.

review/text: Progresso has changed the recipe for their "Rich & Heart Soup, Beef Pot Roast."  The new "Rich & Hearty Soup" has a thinner consistency.  The meat and vegetables are smaller and less tasty.  There appears to be more liquid than vegetables when compared to the same soup about a year ago.  Progresso's soup is ddefinitely not the "Rich & Hearty" they claim it to be.

review/summary: we love this peanut butter!
review/text: We love Reeses peanut butter (though we loved the crunchy even more,  but it was discontinued a few years ago)  However it's really hard to find in Manhattan for some reason,  every supermarket and bodega around me doesn't carry it, and we've tried countless other brands but none of them were salty, sweet and creamy enough,  (and Reeses is never oily!)  So I was thriled to buy this 6 pack from Amazon - we can get our fix and not get anxious as the jar empties... there's another one waiting in the cupboard!  Arrived very quickly and we'll definitely order again!<br /><br />We ordered this again in March 2011 and it came quickly and reliably.

review/text: I've always wondered why Reese's didn't have a peanut butter and well, now they do!  You can open a jar of this stuff, put it next to every other brand and NONE of them can compare to color, freshness, etc.  I've used this stuff for years and won't use anything else for my gourmet peanut butter fudge.  It makes such a HUGE difference in the taste, that I actually tossed out a batch of my famous fudge when I substituted another brand and the results were terrible!  It is so amazing to me how one brand can make that much difference in how a recipe can turn out, or not, as in this case.  Can't recommend this stuff enough - it's loved in this house.  Highly, highly recommend!

review/text: I was told that Reeses Creamy Peanut Butter tasted like the filling of a peanut butter cup.  Delightful, I thought, but not something that I'd want to use every day.  I finally decided to acquire a jar of the stuff, however, as a good treat to add to ice cream.<br /><br />This peanut butter is nothing like the filling of a Reeses peanut butter cup.  It is, in fact, regular peanut butter.  It isn't bad.  It is quite good.  But so are many other brands of peanut butter.  I don't taste any difference between this and store brand.  So given the price difference, I say just skip it.

review/text: Oh how I love Reese's seasonal pumpkins, trees, hearts, eggs (am I missing any?) so I became overly excited when I found that they offer peanut butter in jars.  I read the reviews and knew not to expect it to taste just the middle part of their candy, but I was hoping for something...more...better...  The taste is okay.  It didn't taste very fresh and it seemed waxy, or maybe they used cheap oil or something.  I am a huge fan of Skippy Natural, and Reese's didn't even come close.  I am almost embarrassed that I gave some of the jars away to friends and family.  Needless to say, I will never buy this product again.  However, I ADORE, love, and am completely addicted to their seasonal candy.

They no longer sell it and I can't find anywhere that does.  I now live in western PA (but no matter where I live, northern NH will still be home!).  On a trip to Hershey, PA last year (Hershey makes this peanut butter), I looked in a couple of markets and couldn't even find it there ): . . . . I also enjoyed the crunchy kind and was sad to learn it's no longer manufactured.  I brought another brand of peanut butter on my recent trip to NH--the stuff didn't compare; gross and tasteless. I did look for Reeses again in the markets I frequented in NH, but still did not find it.  I'm tired of looking in the stores anymore.  I signed up for an e-mail to receive a notice when this product is available again.

I am a "Reese cup freak" people (especially the holiday cups because the peanut butter to chocolate ratio is increased) The Big Cups are awesome too but the chocolate is too thick for me in spots(i know..just how I am)and I love "jar" peanut butter and Reeses in a jar is good but if Reeses was to make the same peanut butter that they make in their cups they would slit their own throat. They sell it because of the name... Resees peanut butter cups are the #1 candybar sold in the world by "almost double" over all other candybars. Their peanut butter filling is a highly guarded secret but it can be duplicated pretty damn close by adding powdered sugar and salt..you gotta experiment with it, give it a few good tries..there ya go people!!

It isn't really sweet like the PB mixture used in the peanut butter cups - it's just a really nice, creamy and flavorful PB.  Creamy is the only version I've found, though I'd like to see a crunchy variety someday.  Nice fresh peanutty flavor, and velvety consistency.  Very nice!

review/text: We have ordered this peanut butter before.  We use to be able to buy this peanut butter at our area store but for some reason, it is no longer available and when I contacted the company, I was advised that I could buy it on line.  It is so much better than any other peanut butter on the market!

review/text: The family likes this peanut butter the best.  Yes, we know it is not the same peanut butter in the peanut butter cups.  However, it is better than any other we have tried.  It is creamy and full of peanut taste.  The family now forces me to hunt this type down.

review/summary: Does not taste like Reese's cups.
review/text: I bought this item as a Valentine's Day present for my mother, whose favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Today the package arrived and upon tasting it, I discovered it tastes nothing like the candy. Now I'm stuck with a case of this stuff when Jiff is tons better. Bottom line is if you are buying this because you think it'll taste like Reese's, don't. It's average peanut butter with the Reese's name stamped on it. No wonder why they don't sell it in stores.

review/summary: Not my cup of tea.
review/text: When I bought this product I was hoping that it would actually taste like the peanut butter filling inside the actual candy but this peanut butter tastes just like a plain peanut butter, nothing that special.  It is a nice peanut butter but not really something I would buy again.  I much prefer the natural peanut butters as they have more of a peanut taste to them.  I think it is just because I have gotten so use to real peanut butter that my taste buds just dont get a thrill from this PB.  So dont expect this to be like the candy bar, because in no way does it come close to that, still its an ok PB.  I am glad that I tried it, but I am going to stick to the natural PB's and save this for the customers who actually love this stuff.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious, EASY for kids and me.
review/text: I have probably read 10,000 reviews on Amazon and I'm embarrassed to say this is one of the first (the first?) one I have written.<br />And in the interest of full disclosure, I am related to the founding team so I sort of HAD to give Weefulls a try. But now? I'm hooked. They are so good and so easy. Weefulls, Plum organics, Justin's nut butters, smoked salmon, Planetbox, where would I be without you?<br />Eating healthful food is a huge priority in our household, but I have NO TIME, with work and two small kids. Knowing that I have a bag of Weefulls mix in the cupboard allows me to pull together a last minute breakfast, lunch or dinner that is both delicious and healthy for my whole family.<br />My son really only wants pancakes, waffles, or bagels in the morning for breakfast, and the other alternatives in this category are full of junk!<br />It took me a few tries to get the right ratio of water to mix, and to make pancakes that cooked all the way through in a reasonable amount of time. (They suggest making it more like crepes with more water so they taste better and cook faster).<br />I am going to get a waffle maker for the holidays because I've had Weefulls as waffles and they are even better than the crepes / pancakes.<br />Anyway, it is definitely worth buying a few bags to see how Weefulls might fit into your weekly routine. A breakfast here, a dinner side there (I usually do a protein and a weefull and a few other fruits and veggies) and you will be hooked. Keep up the good work guys!<br />Oh, one other thing!  To save even more time, you can make and freeze a whole batch of these at the beginning of the week and then just toast the ones you want each morning.  Cheers.

review/summary: Great PANCAKES too!
review/text: I am an Amazon addict. I always read reviews but hardly ever write them.  But I had to let folks know that this product is mis-branded.<br /><br />Oh not because they are not delicious or un-nutritious but because the package suggests its only good for making crepes and waffles when actually I think the batter works best to make savory PANCAKES (just add an egg).<br /><br />The other interesting thing is that the recipe on the package helpfully guides you towards making batter just enough for one serving ... so you can whip it up for just one kid's breakfast.  But we never do it that way ... while our 2.5 year old loves them, we are equally weefull about chowing down these tasty PANCAKES, yes I said PANCAKES.<br /><br />Oh, and for Amazon cheap-skates like me, they are WORTH THE PRICE; once you do the analysis for buying organic fruits and veggies, never minding your time to blend them and figure out how to compensate for their water mass in making your own batter.<br /><br />Bon appetite.

review/summary: weeful batter
review/text: Hi and thank you for the chance to review the weefuls batter mix.<br />First- I do not like it. I am not pleased with it at all. The mix was very hard to work with. Accordinging to the instructions on how to mix the batter it came out too thick. I even thinned the batter, and still on three different occasions, I attempted to make crepes and they fell apart or tore in two trying to flip them. Even when I tryed taking them off the crepe maker. I tryed the skillet method and the same thing happened. The batter needs something..?  This is a product I will not buy again. I still have the apple cinnamon weeful mix unused and un-opened. Also, please let the company that makes this food product, they need to include expiration dates on these eatable items.There was no expiration dates on the packaging and this is not good for food products.<br /><br />  Sincerly<br />  Ms.Stilwell

review/summary: Very good for anyone who needs to replenish moisture.
review/text: I've been buying a variety of flavors of this stuff for about 6 months now, and it does a great job of replenishing fluids and electrolytes.  What's really appealing is that it does not have the acid taste and stomach souring after-affect of other sports drinks.  I can drink a lot of it when necessary and not get nauseous.  I've dealt with the folks at the factory and they're great to work with as well. although I generally mix a large batch to have on hand, it's handy in these small foil packs because it's just enough to use with a small bottled water as well, and the pack keeps it dry and ready to use on the job.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: My rating does not reflect this product at all.  I give the product a "10".  They are delicious and addicting.  :)  I give the product a low rating due to the seller's price for the product.  I hope people are not actually paying this price.  You can find this same brand in a 32 oz (2-lb) bag at most Costco's for $9.55.  If your Costco does not carry them or your store does not carry them, you can politely ask and your store will likely start.  I was appalled to see this seller has these for such a high price.  I love this product and Amazon, but I will make of note of the seller and never purchase from them.<br /><br />After further review I see Brookside is actually selling this product on Amazon for more than stores charge for the very same product.  I expect more out of a company then to try to swindle their consumers with excessive prices.  I understand the whole concept of saving by buying in bulk, but 100% markup to the direct public seems extreme.

review/summary: Two Paws Up!
review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/summary: They like it!
review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/text: but not as good a weruva -- much more chunky and the cats do not seem to like as much.  All and all a solid back up for the back of the cupboard.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Really Good !!!
review/text: Awwww another winner from Weruva, i really like the brand and they made the BFF line with us in mind. It's a little cheaper than the actual Weruva brand cause its seafood based. Their seafood has the lowest mercury levels but still this isnt recomended for everyday use on your kitties, you're supposed to switch it around. I only give it to my babies 1 or 2-ice a week that's it. You should hear them begging when the can is popped open ha ha ha.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/text: This is not very expensive compare to other brands, grain-free, my 3-year old cat goes crazy over it! It looks like canned  tuna with chicken gravy. Just started feeding him his second car, let's see if it'll improve my cat's health

review/summary: Finicky Cat Eats It
review/text: My cat is somewhat choosy about her food, and she likes this. There are little meat-ball like pieces in here that she leaves behind if I don't smash them a bit with a fork before serving, but that's not a big deal. Satisfied.

review/summary: Absolute Life Saver!
review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: What a great treat!
review/text: I don't feed fish to Hanx too often, but this has become a go to occasional treat for him! He loves this stuff and devours it in a flash! I trust Weruva as a brand and so far like b.f.f. a lot, so does Hanx.

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/summary: best feline cat food
review/text: My cats love this food.  They pick at other brands or won't eat it at all so I decided to try this brand. I can't find it locally and when I was ordering the Weruva decided to try a case.  I mix half a can in with the dry Blue Select and they inhale it and want more.
