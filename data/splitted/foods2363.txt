review/summary: The only treat my cat will eat!
review/text: I rescued a cat not long ago and have had a hard time getting him to come out from under my sofa. When offered about four other kinds of treats he turned up his nose, these were the only treats that would get him out from under the couch! They must taste good!

review/summary: My cat is not interested
review/text: I have a cat who only likes to eat dry food.  His favorite is Meow Mix.  When I attempted to "treat" my cat with Hartz Crunch n Clean he was not interested - at all.  I tried all sorts of things to get him to eat it (like putting a little Meow nearby) and he only wanted Meow.  I gave the product 3 stars because I don't know for sure if it is my cat's problem.  So I'll give Hartz the benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise I would give the product "zero" stars.

review/text: I've had a chance to try this product now with several cats (I seem to be magnet for abandoned or lost cats).  While I haven't done a close-up assessment of the cleaning power of this product, I can say that unlike other brands, all of my picky cats immediately dove into these kibbles.  Even if the cleaning is no better than other products, the fact that my cats actually seem to like it will certainly result in cleaner fangs.  This is a product that I will buy on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cats ate them...says enough!
review/text: My 14yr old orange tabby Rusty had to have a tooth pulled so we've been looking for treats to clean my 3 cats' teeth vs having to brush their teeth for them as recommended by the Vet. Rusty's not one for the brushing thing.<br />So we've tried a few other treats but these are the only ones where he actually ate them. Normally he puts them in his mouth, licks them and spits them out. His sister Sammy cleans up (thank goodness) after him.<br />So next Vet visit I will update after we try these for a few months and re-evaluate the rating. 4 stars as I don't know the full effect just yet.

review/text: These healthy new treats blocks tartar formation with DentaShield.<br /><br />Almost all of my cats that eat dry food happily accept these treats. I have one cat that won't eat any dry foods or treats.<br /><br />My very finicky cats loves them so they must taste good to cats.<br /><br />That they help clean the teeth are another plus. My cats also love Greenies which are beneficial to their teeth too.<br /><br />I will keep buying Greenies and these Hartz treats too. They both seem to be great products and cats really look forward to different treats. I like providing them with a variety.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats to cat owners for their pets.

review/text: These are good cat treats.  My cats are picky but they eat these.  As for the treats plaque fighting powers, I really have no way of measuring that.  I'll take the company's word for it.  My one cat puked a few of these up after eating them.  But she pukes all the time so I can't say it the treats made her vomit or if it was just her puking like she always does.  Cats are irritating sometimes.

review/summary: Trix says this one is a keeper~
review/text: My cat Trixie loves snacks of any kind-anything that is not the dry crunchy kibble that is in her bowl so the idea of giving her a treat that would also help keep tartar at bay seemed like a win-win.  Though she had been eating "Pounce" as her treat which is soft, she went for it and then after eating about eight of them just sat and looked at me like, "hel-lo", shake out a few more and stop being so stingy".  So I did, and then zipped the little pouch closed-two steps behind me there she was again, so I can only glean from this that this would be a five star rating.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever tried to brush a cat's teeth (we tried this ONCE  when our obviously sadistic vet suggested it)will enjoy just throwing a few treats out and letting their cat crunch that tartar right off.<br /><br />I would definitely look at purchasing this item for Trixie again.

review/summary: My cats enjoy them!
review/text: My two cats definitely give these treats "two paws up"! After I shook out a few of these treats for my cats (and they were promptly gobbled up), I set the package on top of a bookshelf and left the room. When I returned, I found one of my cats balancing on top of the bookshelf, trying to chew through the package! So they must be pretty tasty. Plus, one of my cats has a *very* sensitive stomach and most treats come up as promptly as they go down; these stayed in, thank goodness!<br /><br />Head over to hartzcrunchnclean dot com for nutritional info and coupons.<br /><br />I think the price is a bit high, but I can see myself purchasing these for my two cats in the future since they enjoy them so much.

review/summary: One cat tried to bury them.
review/text: Normally, my cats all love crunchy treats. I've seen them try to chew into the packs to get to the treats. I have 3 cats, a 13 year old male, a 1 year old male, and a 1 year old female.<br /><br />I gave them all some of these treats. The two males ate three pieces each and left the rest. Well, actually, the younger male tried to bury the ones that were left, making the same motions he does in the litter box. The female ate five pieces and then was done; she would not touch the others' leftovers.<br /><br />I have never in my life seen any cats walk away from treats like these. And since the recommended amount for teeth cleaning is 5 pieces twice a day, these obviously are not going to work even if the cats could be persuaded to try them again, if three is all they can stand.<br /><br />Looking at how the cats were chewing them, I might guess that these were _too_ crunchy for them to enjoy. But that wouldn't explain why the one cat thought the treats should be buried.

review/text: As far as taste goes, they all come running when they hear me opening the package.  I can't vouch for the teeth cleaning properties, as it appeared to me they were mostly swallowing them after a couple of bites.  I keep snacks to a minimum to prevent obesity.  What we need is a flavorful chew for cats they could mouth real well.  I have a couple that would chew them, cleaning their teeth without a lot of calories.

review/summary: Meow!!
review/text: I recently tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q9EGFY">Hartz Crunch n Clean 3-Ounce Cat Treat, Salmon</a> and they were a big success, so I thought I'd give the chicken flavor a try, while Kitty didn't seem quite as excited about this flavor, I would still have to consider them a success.<br />As for the tarter control aspect of the treats, I really couldn't say that they work either way. Perhaps some people have an intimate enough relationship with their cats to be able to tell if a specific treat is reducing tarter or otherwise protecting their teeth, I'm not one of those people. But, the worse case scenario is that her teeth are in the same condition before the treats as they are after, as I would be really surprised if they made her tarter problem worse, so I'll continue to feed her the tarter control treats. Maybe her teeth will be a little cleaner when she bites me in an attempt to convince me to give her more treats.

review/summary: One of the few "teeth cleaning treats" that my cat will eat.
review/text: Cats are a finicky bunch, mine in particular. On the plus side she isn't interested in people food, on the not-so-plus side she turns her nose up to almost everything I buy for her to eat. With that in mind it was a small miracle when she actually ate these the first time I gave them to her and then looked up and asked for more. I can't comment on how well they work on keeping her teeth clean but I can say if they do work as advertised I'm more than pleased with the product.  I have tried those other products and my cat has no interest in them. I will buying more of these.

review/text: Banjo review (by proxy): I give it two sniffs. I ate the first couple, but ate around the next few in my dish. When offered this "treat" a third time, I licked them but found Mousie-mouse-mouse MUCH more interesting.<br /><br />Proxy's review: There are a LOT of treats in the pouch. If your cat likes them, this is a good thing. If they actually do work as a "dental shield" as the package says they will...that's a good thing too. Banjo was not interested. He much prefers the "tastations" and "whiskas" treats. I also thought that the treats are on the small side--which leads larger cats who, um...might be hogs...to NOT chew them at all thus defeating the whole purpose of the "dental shield"<br /><br />SO two stars. Other cats might like these, Banjo did not. (He's a 13 lb. Mainecoon & Tabby mix who is 8 years old and an active healthy eater)

review/summary: If your cat likes treats....
review/text: I have two cats and on occasion like to give them a treat. This is partly because I like my cats, and also to give them some variety in their diet. I have one cat who will eat anything, and will gobble any treat. She loved these treats and quickly gobbled them down - and I had to hold her off from eating her "sister's" treats as well. My other cat, while not a finicky eater, just is not as motivated by food. So for her, there is not a treat that she likes. This one was the same, and her buddy got to eat them all. These are supposedly better for their teeth but hard to evaluate such a claim on a personal basis. To get the maximum benefit, you are are supposed to feed them these 4-5 treats TWICE daily! I suppose the claim might work (the special ingredient was developed at the Indiana University Dental School), but these are certainly costly cat treats!!! I mark them down, because my one cat will eat anything, they are very costly, and my cat who is not into treats is not into these either. I do mark them quite high for being potentially useful for preventing dental problems, being low calorie, and in that sense, quite different from most cat treats.

review/summary: Little nuggets of intense flavor!
review/text: As far as flavor goes, these treats get A++!  My cats are crazy about them...and my dogs beg (unsuccessfully) for them. For some reason, I was expecting a much bigger "biscuit," but these treats are very tiny and thin--a bit smaller than most cat food pieces.  I like the resealable package.<br /><br />I have a 19 year old (very healthy and active) cat and one that is 7.  Both eat them quickly and earnestly, but I noticed that both of them just swallow most of the nuggets.  That's certainly not helping their teeth (and the reason I only gave 4 stars), but I suppose they will get the vitamin benefit from them.  It strikes me that maybe these treats should be just a bit larger, so cats would have to bite them in half and chew before swallowing...but, of course, they should not so big that there would be a danger of choking.<br /><br />As my cats love the taste so much, and because of the vitamin content, I will most likely buy them again.  But I hope they are reformulated to be larger in size.

review/text: I wasn't sure exactly how to review cat treats--since I don't have any frame of reference--never having eaten them before. Just kidding.<br /><br />So I have one 17 year old cat who throws up everything and another 7 year old cat that is extremely picky when it comes to anything other than her normal brand of cat food. I was going for the concept that they would eat them and I wouldn't find any surprises on my bed when I got home from work.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough they both loved them (this is rare--they don't even like the same cat food!). I didn't step on any squishy disgusting things (well, except a couple of soggy toasted oat cereal--but that's not my cats--that's my kid).<br /><br />I don't see this replacing regular dental hygiene or vets visits (too bad) but they are a paws up winner at our house!

review/summary: Excellent and does clean the teeth!
review/text: Before giving these treats to my cat Felix, I wanted to make sure to include a vet's opinion of this product in my review. So, I scheduled an appointment and took Felix and the treats in. Upon inspection of the bag, my vet (Sally Foote) looked closely at the dietary information.<br /><br />Table:<br /><br />Crude Protein:  25%<br />Crude Fat:  08%<br />Crude Fiber:  04%<br />Moisture:  10%<br />Vitamin A:  2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin B:  14 IU/lb<br />Zinc  75 mg/kg<br />Taurin:  0.1%<br /><br />While the vet said that the Crude Fat content was a tad higher than she would like to see, the fact that it only had 1.1 calories per treat is very favorable in her opinion.The dental cleaning is a plus and my vet did compliment the product on having that but she also stated that if you are trying to do away with daily brushing, your kitty would have to eat alot of these treats.<br /><br />Now came the real test: Felix himself. When I placed one small treat in my hand and presented it to him, he was hesitant. Sniffing it, he wasn't sure if he should try it or not. At first glance, I would say he hated it but decided to try again when he wasn't distracted by anything. So, after his nap, I presented the treat to him again and this time, he eagerly cleaned it up and wanted more. I ended up feeding him 5 treats and he still wanted more.<br /><br />This morning I found the package that WAS on top of my refridgerator, ripped up and emptied on the floor. I assume he loves them! I'm gonna have to buy more.

review/summary: 3 Stars - I Guess??
review/text: I'm not really sure how to review a cat treat.  I assume my only course of action is to describe how my cat, Cleo, reacted to these new treats.  I should say first of all that Cleo is used to eating moist treats and hard food - she may have just associated this crunchy treat as a pebble of her food.<br /><br />Treat 1 - She ate it.  Cleo is a very tiny cat with tiny teeth (I usually have to find food that has very small pieces in order for her to eat it) and I noticed that she had a hard time chewing this crunchy treat.<br /><br />Treat 2 - Sniffed at it and licked it.  No eating.<br /><br />Treat 3 - Wouldn't go near it.  I picked it up and put it in her food bowl. And I noticed this morning that the treat was removed from her food bowl and kicked aside so that Cleo could eat her food.<br /><br />I gave this treat 3 stars because I like the idea of the green core that cleans the teeth - although, that green core is very hard. All in all, I'd say that my cat hated these.  But, she's a picky kitty.

review/text: We have 3 cats.  We have had cats for 26 years.  We have gone thru lots of different types of treats.  These seem OK.  Our youngest (2) liked them the most.  The middle cat (9) thought they were worth eating sorta....i.e. she could take 'em or leave 'em.  The old lady (12) thought they were good.  She doesn't usually like new things so it was a nice treat for her.  Overall, it seems to be a good treat.  I don't know about the 'cleaning of the teeth' thing, but all of my cats ate the treats.

The 3 0z. bag contains quite a few of the pieces [it doesn't say how many on the package, but I'd guess over a 100].<br />I can't speak for the tooth care, but her teeth are pretty healthy anyway since her primary food is dry kibble...crunchy as well!<br />I left off a star because they used artificial food coloring, which I try to avoid...it is unnecessary [while cats supposedly can see colors, they apparently have trouble with red, and are better with blue/green...and they don't appear to care as much about color as we do...so the coloring is for the owners, I gather].<br />Note: The chicken has titanium dioxide [white] and blue #1, while the beef has them as well as red #40, yellow #5 and blue #2.<br />Now, if they would offer one that was all natural, I would give it 5 stars!<br />Efit: 7/17/09...still lovin' these treats...I have even been able to train my cat to sit...although, cynics in our household claim that she is sitting anyway to get ready for the treat!

review/summary: A hit with the cats
review/text: All four of my cats loved Hartz Crunch and Clean - chicken flavor.  All of them were complaining loudly when I opened the resealable pouch. They wanted their treats immediately!<br /><br />The suggested serving for maximum dental benefits is four or five crunchies twice daily. Since each crunchy is only 1.1 calorie, I don't need to be overly concerned about these treats leading to my cat's obesity.  Cats need to consume about 30 calories daily for each pound they weigh.  The ideal daily serving size of 10 treats would amount to an eight pound cat receiving around 5 percent of its calories from Hartz Crunch 'n Clean.<br /><br />I have no idea whether or not Hartz Crunch and clean removes 3 times more tartar (3 times as much as what?) as the front of the product advertises.  However since my cats loved the treat so much, I give this product 5 stars.

Therefore, I'd say it's a decent value as well.<br /><br />It's also a treat for my daughter to give these to the cats.

review/summary: They must taste great!
review/text: As soon as I opened the package, both of my cats were practically sticking their little heads in the bag so they could have some of these treats.  They each ate the 4 or 5 that I gave them right away, so I can tell they really liked them.  One of my cats is very finicky and hesitates to try anything but her regular food, but she loved these.  I can't vouch for the tarter removing benefits because I'm sure it will take time to see, but I'm all for products that have some health benefits along with great taste.  There are vitamins and minerals in the treats too and so I'll feel good about giving them to my cats every day.

review/summary: Half the team approves - HIGHLY APPROVES
review/text: It started with a look.  Them asleep in their beds, me dropping a treat on the floor near them.  Their heads shifted slightly to size me up (without moving their perfectly folded bodies of course) - Dad kneeling near their beds?  A mouse scurrying across the floor that must be stopped immediately before it reaches its destination?  A toy?<br /><br />Once my presence was established their attention shifted to floor and small brown nugget laying close to their beds.  Alex, who's ALWAYS hungry and eats anything I put before him, favored his bed to the morsel and only considered leaving it to perhaps rub against my leg - a favored past-time second only to eating.  Lewis, the more timid, more picky, and generally more cautious (after 6 years I still don't think he's yet convinced I'm not trying to kill him) crawled slowly from his nest to inspect.<br /><br />There was a sniff...  maybe two.  And then I couldn't believe my eyes when he actually ate the treat. He's since had more and has learned what to expect when I pull the bag from it's spot in the pantry.  A frenzy complete with mouthy remarks ensues.<br /><br />Technical details:  The treats look and feel like most other cat treats we've tried.  They're crunchy (vs. chewy as the title suggests) and bite sized (perhaps the size of a pea but flat).  I haven't noticed a difference in their oral hygiene at all but neither cat has any teeth or gum problems.  The pouch itself is easily resealable for later use of course.<br /><br />I hope to post a video of this soon!

review/text: The cat loves these but never chews them. How does that help with tartar control? It's so small that our average-sized cat just gulps it down and wants more.  For cats like ours, the treat needs to be large enough that she will chew it first.<br /><br />Do these companies actually test these treats before they release them?

review/text: My cats love these treats. I love the fact that I only need to feed them five of the treats a day (they get other treats as well). I think that these work really well. I had been giving my cats these treats for maybe 3 or 4 days, and then it was time for their annual check-up at the vet. He was very impressed with how their teeth looked, and my cats are both 10 years old. So I highly recommend getting these treats!

review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

The deodorants are flaky on the skin, and don't do their job for very long - for me it's maybe a few hours, though might get up to 6-8 hours if I'm not too hot that day. I recommend going with the "fresh" line instead.

review/text: This is a delicious tea that is not easily found in stores, even in upscale gourmet food item stores. The strawberry flavor come through clearly in clean and fresh notes and tastes fresh and natural.  The tea bags are foil-sealed and so the tea maintains its fresh taste.  I like that the manufacturer has opted not to use a metal staple so there are no metallic tastes to interfere with the tea and strawberry flavors.  Everyone to whom I have served this tea has raved over the taste.  I waited some time for Amazon to re-stock this item and have now taken to providing a box as an occasional gift.  This is one of the teas I always want to have available in my home.

I normally only drink straight black or green tea - I'm generally not a fan of flavored versions.

And if you are craving something luscious and guilt free, try it with non-fat half and half - it tastes like strawberries and cream - amazingly decadent.

review/summary: delicious mix of choc and fruit
review/text: I'm typically not big on chocolate covered fruit but I bought these at an airport convenience store a few weeks ago and was hooked. I finally re-bought them online because I kept thinking about how yummy they were. The apricots are soft inside, not too sweet, not too tart; it's a perfect flavor harmony with the chocolate. I also purchased the coconut (good but not a wowing taste experience like the apricots) and the cherries (chocolate is too sweet for me on those -- probably the same chocolate as on the apricots but with the tarter cherries, the combination of chocolate and fruit just doesn't work as well for me). I will definitely re-buy the apricots. Ok for those to come in the 4-pack. Wish I didn't have to buy a 4-pack of cherries and coconut. Have since found out that my Whole Foods carries the same products. Should have checked there first so I could have purchased single packs : )

review/summary: The Ginger People have outdone themselves
review/text: Been a ginger freak for ages, ever since I discovered it at home in NYC, via Indian food, when I was a teenager. I always check out any new ginger products, especially when they're from the illustrious Ginger People. Found this yesterday in my travels and I'm eating it right now atop an English Muffin. Delicious. The texture is smooth and welcoming, and the taste is swoon-worthy. It's not expensive and it doesn't need to be refrigerated once opened, the GP say at their site. Can't wait to try it with Gouda, not to mention many of the other applications they recommend, plus a few of my own. Happy camper.<br /><br />Added 8/3/12 -- Just tried this in oatmeal -  WOW. Agree with PixelGoddess! A little bit goes a lonnng way; incredible taste.<br /><br />Added 8/9/12 -- Here's a great open-face sandwich I made: English muffin halfs, with a little of the ginger spread, some ham (I used Trader Joe's rosemary ham), topped with a slice of gouda. Broil at around 375 for five minutes, until the cheese melts. Fantastic.

review/summary: I want Brinjal Pickle and Basmati rice for my last meal!
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer.  I first discovered Patak's Brinjal Pickle/Relish in England.  I've been known to eat half a jar with Indian food, rice, cold meat, etc.  This is a "not-to-be-missed" experience.  I've introduced friends and neighbors to Brinjal Pickle and have converted them as well to the taste pleasures of Brinjal.  I've even taken Brinjal with me to Indian restaurants.  It's not too hot - medium - and the flavor and texture are wonderful.  I've told my wife that if I had the ability to order my last meal before dying, I'd ask for basmati rice and Brinjal Pickle.  What a way to go!<br /><br />The sad thing is that it goes virtually unnoticed on grocery store shelves.  Who knows what Brinjal is?  It's only when introduced to someone that the joy is shared.  When we were contemplating a move from D.C. to N.C. four years ago I walked into our soon-to-be upper end grocery store and they had Patak's Brinjal Pickle on the shelf.  I told my wife - it is okay to move!  Sadly, today I discovered that it is no longer offered locally and I'll have to buy it online.<br /><br />Do yourself and your friends a favor:  Buy a half dozen jars and spoon it up on rice, curry, etc.  You won't regret it.

review/summary: International taste sensation!
review/text: I discovered Patak's Brinjal Egg Plant Relish in the 1990s, before the label was sold to a UK food conglomerate. At the time, it was called Patak's Brinjal Aubergine (or Bringal Pickle Aubergine in some markets).<br /><br />When the company transferred across the Atlantic, the new owners chose to abandon this little gem in favor of Patak's other chutney's and mint pastes -- all of them terrific. But for me, it was like losing a best friend. Talk about COMFORT food... I called the new owners at least once a year begging for a return of ambrosia.<br /><br />For me, it was like trying to break a drug addiction, but in this case, there was no methadone in site. It's difficult to describe a flavor in a text review, but let me try...<br /><br />Some of us like our pastes, sauces and relishes *HOT*. (This one is modestly rated as "medium"). But when recipes add chili or other heat, it is far too easy to drop the ball on the other flavors. Would you like some sweet, spicy & natural flavors dancing amongst the tangy heat? Do want a flavor that makes you close your eyes and praise the designer for giving you a tongue? If this describes you, then this is as close to paradise as it gets. Next, let's talk about VERSATILE. I spread this baby on everything (the word "spread" requires artistic license. Some firm eggplant chunks are as big as your little finger!)<br /><br />Do you have to be Indian to eat this relish? Heck no! I'm a mid-west raised, New England Yankee. But this little jar of heaven has become one of my raison's d'etre (Translation: "reasons for existence"). To be fair, you have to love Indian or Mediterranean spice. It's loaded with chili, fenugreek, coriander, mustard and turmeric -- and especially fresh garlic (definitely not roasted or denatured!). And of course, it has just the right amount of heat. The basic flavor component is a bit like fermented raisins or rum w/raisin, though I doubt that there is any alcohol.<br /><br />Verdict: 6 out of 5 stars. (That's not a mistake. It's THAT good!)<br /><br />Want a sanity check? Sure, why not! Write to me:<br />ellery (at) starbus (dot) com

review/summary: Best bagged green tea!
review/text: I became a fan of green tea when my Navy duties took me to Japan and Korea.  In Japan, particularly, I learned a little about the differences in green teas (shade-grown, finely ground, and so on).  Since returning to my land-locked home in the Rockies, the only good green tea I've been able to get my hands on has been through mail order.  (If you're drinking Lipton brand green tea and have judged green tea accordingly, you really are missing out...)<br /><br />This is the first green tea in a bag (as opposed to loose leaf) that really reminds me of the good teas I had in Japan.  At work, I don't make time to pre-heat my tea pot and my tea cups and brew it "properly," so I really appreciate a delicious tea in the convenience of a bag, and if you like green tea, I'm certain you'll like this one!

review/text: *****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Best "Temple of Heaven" tea on the planet!
review/text: This tea is wonderful! "Temple of Heaven" green tea (a gunpowder style) is pretty darn hard to find anywhere else, and this one of the best I've tried.<br /><br />It has a very full-bodied mouth-feel, and a warmish smokey flavor without being too bitter like other gunpowders often tend to be. Oh, and it's whole-leaf too! (None of that powdered stuff here!!) It steeps equally well in the bag it comes in, or removed from the bag to brew loose to add to your favorite blend.<br /><br />For an extra treat and a nutritional & mental boost, try brewing one bag of this with one bag of Wisdom Of The Ancients Yerba Mate Tea - 25 Bags. I can't start my day without a mug of this combo.<br /><br />Finally, the value is unbeatable, especially considering that it's super-saver-shipping-eligible! I am utterly impressed. Amazon, thank you so much for carrying this outstanding product!

review/text: I ordered green tea while at the Cheesecake Factory (at the Grove in Los Angeles) and they brought me this.  Very mild, soothing and flavorful.  I was very impressed so I went online to see if I could find it.  Don't let the name (Gunpowder) discourage you from buying this. That name conjures up smokey, dusty, bitter images.  But this is the opposite. Very tasty.

review/summary: Just a pinch will do ya
review/text: I first bought this salt when I visited France about 4 years ago when I saw it in a grocery store. Then I saw Ina Garten using it. Well the French and Ina are right.<br /><br />This is a lovely finishing salt. Definitely do not use it when you are cooking. It is too crystalline and not meant to be used that way.<br /><br />It is something to add just before serving.<br /><br />I love just a pinch on veggies or eggs or whatever you want. Adds a nice salt crunch and is not too briny.<br /><br />Remember just using a pinch at a time makes this last a long time so it is a good bargain as well.

review/text: This is a mild sea salt that does not have the harsh bite of some sea salts or table salts.  It tastes salty, but mellow.  It has to be tried to be believed.  I buy the three pack, but never manage to keep all three.  When guests come over to our house and try the salt, they like it so much that I end up giving them one of my "extra" containers.  Yummy and worth the money.

review/summary: Excellent finishing salt
review/text: I'm a French-trained cook and I wouldn't be this wonderful ingredient that turns good or even great dishes into something sublime. You can get a sense of how different it is from ordinary table salt or even standard sea salt by putting a few flakes on your tongue -- it actually has a flavor, and a delicious one at that. I sprinkle it on soups, just before serving, or steaks or over fresh tomatoes or even sweets -- it enhances everything and is well worth the admittedly high cost. If you really love this stuff and are going to France or know someone who is, you can get this for a couple euros in just about any supermarket.

review/summary: This salt is a revelation
review/text: I tried this salt while on vacation in Provence and found it so remarkable that I ended up buying a bunch of boxes to bring home and to give away as gifts. In regular French grocery stores the same amount sells for about four euros per box, so the export mark-up is huge but still worth it for anyone who appreciates flavorful cooking. I agree with other reviewers that it's best used as a finishing salt.

review/text: I first bought this salt while on a trip to the south of France in 2005. Basically as a souvenir gift due to the very attractive container (also we had visited the Carmargue where salt is supposedly harvested). Once at home, I used it myself (and kept both containers) I like it so well that I keep re-ordering it on the web whenever I run low. I've noticed that is is often used by many of the TV chefs. This is a WINNER!

I loved it and could use it for everything including baking. So when I saw the same label here I thought this was the same thing. The salt I received is very coarse though, fairly big chunks, not finely ground.

I haven't tried the flowering teas, but have become intrigued with the Numi teas after trying the Ruby Chai (tm) Spiced Rooibos.<br /><br />The quality of the Numi teas is immediately apparent. In a similar way to how the Tazo teas are blended, there is an art to making Numi teas. Each tea is hand-blended with organic whole leaf teas, pure herbs and real fruits. This tea contains Rooibos, Cloves, Allspice, Ginger, Cardamom, Nutmeg and Cinnamon. All organic! Each teabag is a work of art and the flavor of the tea is preserved in a natural filter paper and then packaged in biodegradable and recyclable paper.<br /><br />Can be served with milk or is delicious alone with a natural cane sugar, honey or Stevia. If you enjoy this tea, you might also like Red Mellow, Sweet African Red, Bushmen's Brew or Golden Chai.<br /><br />Now and then I brew one Tazo Tea Awake teabag with one Numi Spiced Rooibos and the result is a mildly spicy tea that wakes you up and is very comforting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Spicy Adventure in An Herbal Teasan
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic rooibos, organic cloves, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, and organic cinnamon. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Earthy, vanilla organic Rooibos and a sultry blend of spices come together from around the world in Numi's caffeine-free chai. Warmed by the South African sun, Rooibos is lauded for its high anti-oxidant properties. It is full-bodied like black tea, yet soothing any time of day. We've sourced the highest quality cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, mingling them with sweet Indian allspice and vivacious Chinese ginger. A kiss of cardamom unites this fabulous caffeine-free alternative to Numi's Golden Chai. Share in the savory warmth of Ruby Chai."<br /><br />If you are used to black tea or coffee and are wanting to get accustomed to herbal caffeine-free teas, this is a great way to start, since the flavors are stronger and thus less subtle than most herbal teas. Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br />*****

review/summary: Excellent, tasty mineral supplement
review/text: The taste is good but subtle enough to not alter your consumption positively or negatively. I largely use this as a sodium supplement when NOT exercising (the scientific evidence is actually strongly against the use of electrolyte supplements during exercise: see Tim Noakes' excellent book Waterlogged for more details).<br /><br />Some misc. notes:<br />* They are sweetened with trace levels (&lt;1g) of sorbitol. I normally avoid any sugar alcohol other than erythritol because of the laxative effects but because the levels here are so low the sorbitol has no negative impact. And of course being a sugar alcohol and in such trace amounts it has no glycemic impact.<br />* Compared to other brands, the one negative is that these take quite a while (~10 minutes) to fully dissolve.<br />* There are some other negative ingredients like sesame oil (bad polyunsaturated fat) but probably in negligible quantities.

review/text: I got a tube of these as a free sample. Not sure I'll even use the whole tube.<br /><br />It's hard to tell what they were going for with this. I'm not seeing much of an upside. It seems you're supposed to put it in water, let it fizz, and drink. I'm used to a powder you can dump in, shake a couple times, and drink. But, I found it took this a few minutes to fizz out and then I still had a little floating chunk. Maybe I should cap it up and shake it? Not sure. It wasn't exactly quick and easy.<br /><br />Also, I didn't like the flavor. I like most lemon lime stuff, but this was very weak. I would have expected at least a little sour or tart flavor, but there didn't seem to be any. It has stevia in it, but it wasn't sweet, either. It had some flavor, but it wasn't a familiar one, like lemon, lime, or sweetness. Maybe it's the sorbitol?<br /><br />Ok, it's sold as an electrolyte replacement, so I checked the nutrition info. One of these tablets has 320mg sodium (13% DV) and 55mg potassium (2% DV). It's ok, but not a huge selling point.<br /><br />The current price here on amazon works out to 43 cents per serving. That's pretty steep compared to the alternatives. I'll stick with either water or something that also provides a bit of sugar (usually cytomax) for my liquids and S Caps for electrolytes. The S Caps are about 1/2 the price of the GU Brew and I can take 2 at a time if I'm sweating a lot without side effects.

review/text: I am a huge fan of these things. A little fizz makes the extra refreshing on my long bike rides. I much prefer the orange to the lemon lime ones, they have quite a bite to them.

review/summary: Handy but expensive
review/text: I like GuBrew the best of all the sports drinks, especially for long runs (10 miles +) when Gatorade's sweetness can be cloying.  I carry one or two of these tablets to make refills a cinch, but for normal uses I prefer the large container of powdered GuBrew--much, much less expensive.

review/summary: High Quality Beef Treats
review/text: I have two dogs who primarily prefer chicken treats.  I've been on the lookout for beef treats -- as a change of pace for them -- but they're particular and don't like most of the ones I've tried (from cheap to average to pricey).  They loved these -- almost as much as their chicken.  They are thin circles of beef about 2 inches in diameter and easy for them to chew.  There aren't a bunch of additives.  Highly recommend these!

review/summary: Healthy food-grade treats: RARE!
review/text: It's not so much the price, etc. Do you know how hard it is to find treats using human-grade food and that is NOT made in China? Do you know how many so-called treats are actually bad for your dog. LOTS. Look closely at your treat ingredients. same with almost all dog food. Do some research. You'll get scared--even of the so called premium brands. As for this, got mine at Costco. Dogs liked it; but more important, it's healthy for them

review/summary: They LOVE it!
review/text: I first found this product at Sam's Club, and was delighted it was available on Amazon.  It isn't always at Sam's...<br />The pugs will do anything to be rewarded with them.  Soft, fragrant and obviously tasty [ I am assuming this because their rapt attention follows opening the jar] the dollars are a perfect size and texture to break into pieces for rewarding.<br />The price is right too!

review/summary: Nice treat, but not sure it's better than cheaper alternatives
review/text: I wanted treats that would be appropriate for training.  My dog doesn't seem more interested in these treats vs other cheaper treats.  Maybe it depends on the dog.  The treat does crumble easy which can be a plus or minus - all depends on how you want to use.  Both of my dogs enjoy the treat, but I'm not sure it is worth the premuim price.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious taffy
review/text: I cannot get enough of this taffy.  I've already placed two orders, and will probably place another one as that's how good it is.  The colors are wonderful, and the selection in each tin is really varied.  I pass it out to co-workers who find it irresistible, so now I'm on tap to continue bringing some in.  Anyone looking for some great taffy will not be disappointed in this!!!

review/summary: Birch Xylitol
review/text: I am always looking for an alternative sweetener to get away from fructose. Most of the artificial sweeteners on the market are terrible for your health - I will name splenda as one of the worse. Stevia is made directly from the dried leaves of the Stevia plant so that is acceptable, but I find it kind of bitter and it is very expensive. You can google "xylitol benefits" and get all kinds of interesting information, but I will just reiterate some of the very interesting benefits I found when googling:<br /><br />Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol that has been recognized by dentists and health professionals worldwide as a great alternative to white sugar.<br /><br />Commonly found in chewing gum and breathmints, Xylitol is known to have a many health benefits associated with its use.<br /><br />1. Safe For Diabetics<br />Unlike sugar, xylitol is not easily converted to fat. Because it is not easily converted to fat, it has almost no effect on insulin levels, making it a safe sugar alternative for diabetics, body builders, dieters, pregnant/nursing women, and also for babies and children.<br /><br />2. Helps Prevent Cavities<br />Since it is a non-fermentable sugar, it cannot be converted to acid by oral bacteria. Thus, the alkaline-acid balance in the mouth is maintained, which helps in preventing cavities.<br /><br />3. Helps Prevent Ear Infections<br />Xylitol can also be used as medicine in prohibiting certain bacterial growth to help prevent ear infections in young children. It will also help clear out earwax and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in the pharyngotympanic tubes, connecting the nose and ear.<br /><br />4. Slows the Growth of Candida<br />Xylitol helps prevent bad breath, ulcers, and stomach cancer by slowing down the growth of Candida Albicans (a serious yeast infection), and other harmful bacteria like H. pylori.<br /><br />5. May Improve Bone Density<br />According to research from the University of Oulu in Finland, xylitol was shown to help improve bone density in rats. This indicates it has potential as a treatment for osteoporosis in humans. For optimal bone health, it is recommended that you eat foods high in calcium or take a calcium supplement.<br /><br />6. Helps Tooth Enamel & Strength<br />In addition to preventing cavities, consuming xylitol in small amounts helps decrease plaque formation, and promotes salivation to prevent "dry mouth", which aids in enhancing mineral absorption for repairing damaged tooth enamel, while increasing tooth strength.<br /><br />7. Increases White Blood Cell Activity<br />Xylitol, when taken in small amounts, can help increase the white blood cell activity in fighting bacterial infections, to help build immunity, protect against chronic degenerative disease and have anti-aging benefits.<br /><br />8. Prevents Streptococcus mutans In Newborns<br />When used by nursing mothers on a regular basis, it helps reduce the transmission of Streptococcus mutans (oral bacteria that causes cavities) to children by up to 80% during the first two years.<br /><br />9. May Help With Allergies & Sinus Infection's<br />When used as a nasal spray, xylitol is said to be able to help reduce the prevalence of sinus infections, asthma and allergies. It helps decrease the amount of harmful bacteria that may be in the cells of our nose.<br /><br />10. May Lower Risk of Ovarian Cysts<br />Xylitol may help lower your risk of developing ovarian cysts, polycystic ovarian syndrome (a condition that disrupts or stops the ovulation cycle), fibroids, endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome and possibly breast cancer.<br /><br />So, there appear to be a lot of benefits. For negatives, there are a couple. If you are looking for xylitol on the market, you will find that most of the xylitol offerings come from corn sources. Now, almost all corn is GMO and I personally stay away from genetically modified food. So,  looking for xylitol from some other source, I ran across this brand which uses organic birch trees. The other negative is that xylitol can cause gas in some people. It really bothers my wife, so she stays away from it in food. It does make me a little gassy, but if you use it in small amounts, it appears to be fine. I like to use it in mixed alcoholic drinks instead of sugar. I tried to slip some into some muffins I made, but my wife detected the after-effects, so she put a kibosh on that use around the house.<br /><br />So, it is kind of expensive, but this 1.5 lbs will get you by if you use it to sweeten coffee, mixed drinks, etc. It does taste pretty close to regular sugar and it does have some health benefits as stated above. I like it in muffins and other baked goods - I just have to eat whatever I make by myself since the wife does not like the after-effects. If you are a non-GMO person, then this is the brand for you.
