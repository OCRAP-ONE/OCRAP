review/text: This water is really wonderful.  I enjoy drinking it and have noticed many positive effects.  Most quantifiable though is the impact this water has on our herb garden which is producing delicious, fragrant, beautiful herbs on our deck.  We enjoy drinking the water and then refill the bottles with tap water - this is what we give to the plants - and they are thriving! So a little indeed goes a long way.

review/summary: Amazing results!
review/text: My 11 yr old daughter's pierced ears were infected, red, and crusted. I put the Trivedi water on a cottonball and soaked her ear lobe before she went to bed. In the morning the infection was completely gone, and she was able to wear earrings!<br /><br />Also, I took in a stray kitten who had an eye infection. I kept bringing her to the vet's but her eye never stopped leaking and drooping for many months.  and put some Trivedi Energy Infused water in her water dish. Within one day, her eye cleared up and completely matched the other, so much that I had to think twice about which eye had been infected. The infection has never returned.

review/summary: inner guidance
review/text: If you are connected to your inner guidance you don't need to read these reviews. Just check within yourself and ask if this water is right for you. If you do not feel you can get a clear answer within yourself you might want to try the Trivedi products as they have helped many people, myself included, to be able to more clearly get our own answers and guidance. What a gift! I have been waiting for the Trivedi water to be more accessible and will be ordering ASAP.I have been using the Trivedi probiotic Shanti for a little more than a week now and find myself to be more  peaceful quiet.This allows me to hear my inner guidance even better. If you try the water and other products pay attention not only to "outside" changes but also to the changes in your "inner world".

review/summary: The Trivedi Water is AMAZING
review/text: Recently, my eleven-year old nephew drank a cup of the Trivedi water.  After a few sips, a big grin came across his face and he said he felt a pop in his brain like something was clearing.  He had so much energy that evening to do homework, laugh, and play!  The next day he drank the other half of the bottle of water and had the same experience.  He experienced more clarity and, of course, lots of energy!  This water definitely energizes your body.  Thank you so much for creating this wonderful product!

review/summary: A way to get this energized water at lst
review/text: I have a long-held interest in energized waters, from Masuru Emoto's work with Messages from Water, which has had such a profound effect on our understanding of water as a carrier of energy and thought, to waters from sacred sites such as Lourdes, to water energized at the healing house of John of God, to lingam water blessed by Sai Baba. And even more waters than I can list here.<br /><br />We are made mostly of water, so the water we ingest has such a critical role. When I went to a recent retreat, a woman showed me a picture of a tree on her property which had not bloomed in years. After rather carelessly pouring 1/4 bottle of Trivedi-blessed water on the tree just to see what would happen, the next picture showed it in full bloom, a huge difference. That was one of the first things to grab my attention. I was interested in trying the water out on my plants and pets, but there was no reliable way to get it on a regular basis until I heard this announcement that it will be available on Amazon.  Finally I have half a case and am beginning some experiments with my cat and with my roses and hydrangeas. The flowers will take till next spring, but the cat, who has a tendency to be high strung, is already calming down. I look forward to being able to get this water delivered to my door so I can more liberally experiment on myself!

review/summary: Energy Infused Trivedi water and products
review/text: I have been experiencing the beneficial effects of the energy infused Trivedi water since I attended my first Trivedi seminar in the Spring of this year 2011.  As you know, everyone will experience benefits in their own unique ways.  Personally, I have noticed a significant improvement in my emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual expansion.  For example, I no longer have the symtpoms of PMS.  WOW!  Now, that is amazing for any of you woman or men who have experienced the uncomfortableness of that once a month!!!<br /><br />I am also enjoying a level of confidence, strength, mental clarity, and peace in my life and thoughts that did not exist before.  As a medical professional in America, I am aware of the proven effects of Mr. Trivedi's energy infusions and transmissions in regards to physical ailments, emotional ailments, etc.  Feel free to peruse the over 3,000 studies completed on the energy that Mr. Trivedi has been selected to channel to the plants, animals, people, and objects on earth.  The websites are: [...] and [...].  As I always recommend to my clients, investigate the information for yourself; and, decide if these products resonate with you.  Trust in your heart and intuition, for there you will know.  :-)

review/summary: It Helped the Spider
review/text: I've personally seen Mr. Trivedi turn poor quality champagne and wine into great tasting stuff, and I've experienced the uplifting effects of his energy transmissions, so I have every reason to believe in the powers of the Trivedi water. Because I am receiving energy transmissions from Mr. Trivedi, plus drinking the water and taking Trivedi probiotics, it's hard to determine which of the amazing effects are due to the water, the energy transmissions, or the probiotics, but I can tell this story about the water: I accidentally scalded a large spider in my bathtub. I really hate doing that, because I like spiders. I fished him out of the water, but he looked limp and dead. I watched him for a really long time and was sad that he never moved. I put a very small amount of the Trivedi water on him and left, and when I came back, he was gone. He obviously got up and walked away.

review/text: I am happy to report the profound effects this energy infused water has had on my children and I. I've done energy work for sometime now and I am able to see and feel the enhancements this product offers in addition to the other self improvement techniques I practice. My children drink the water more than they have ever drank water before without having to be told. They are 4, 14 and 15 so water is normally the last thing they want to get as a beverage option. Since the 11/11/11 retreat, they have gone thru 2 1/2 cases! They are getting along better, calmer and have even seemed to study and retain information better. I am more focused and now have immediate solutions for the challenges I face in my daily business with clients and business associates. I'm sleeping well and feel refreshed throughout the day instead of my former downtimes that required a sugar fix...lol. I think Trivedi Water will help anyone to enhance their energy transmission experiences and overall life. I will continue to invest in this product for my family.

It is more hydrating than most lotions and creams...and a lot less expensive! :) I developed some kind of rash or excema on my right eye, in the corner. It was slightly itchy and red. I started applying Trivedi Water on that area several times during the day and within a few short days it was reduced to almost nothing. My plants and my cat love it too. My Christmas cactus has more blooms this year than ever, one on almost every branch, and I'm sure it is due mainly to this miraculous water and Mr. Trivedi! Did I mention that it tastes like ambrosia and I could drink it till the cows come home! lol. Thank you Mr. Trivedi. Lisa H.

review/summary: I like drinking this water!  It has vitality - or life.
review/text: I was introduced to Trivedi Water last November (2010). I was waiting in a crowded hotel room for many hours and I was starting to feel the effects: fatigue, sluggishness...  Someone handed me a bottle of this water.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The water was refreshing, it satisfied my thirst and I felt energized immediately after I drank it.  My system "rebooted." I became clearer, the fogginess lifted, the room became brighter and I felt a surge of energy.  I felt alive/awake with a sense of well-being.  I did not know about the scientific data or other claims at the time.<br /><br />At my next opportunity I bought a case and took it home.  I placed the case of water by my bedside so I can enjoy a bottle first thing in the morning.  My daughter, who was 11 yrs old at the time, wanted to try my water.  She had the first bottle and later she asked if she could have more.  She said she liked how it tasted.  (When this water is available she will pick this water over any other drink in the house.)  I gave the water to my sons (ages 5 and 3.5) when they were sick with high fever and vomiting.  By the next morning they recovered and did not have any of the usual "after being sick" symptoms (pale, dry lips, constipation, puffy eyes, etc).<br /><br />I have been drinking water, the purest and/or the best I can find on the market since college. I drink mostly water and I am well aware of how my body feels when it is optimally hydrated.  There is something more to this water.  It has vitality - or life.  I like drinking this water.  It is the best.

review/summary: Clears painful skin lesion
review/text: There is no rational explanation - this water is amazing. A lesion developed behind my right ear. It was extremely painful, swollen, and very red. It was the size of 2 peas side by side. I thought: let's try Trivedi water on it. I rubbed the lesion with a little Trivedi water about 8 times a day. After a few hours the pain left. Within 36 hours the lesion was greatly reduced. Within 72 hours all the swelling was gone. All that is left is some new pink skin. Trivedi water has a power. If it cleared the sore so quickly; just image what it can do to keep my bodily systems working perfectly. I look forward to drinking Trivedi water on a daily basis.

review/summary: Better than an energy drink
review/text: My wife and I have been drinking reverse osmosis water for about twenty years.  (Ever since a pot of tea I made had a head of foam on it like a beer.  Interesting water we have down here.)  Two months ago we got hold of a case of Trivedi water.  We each drank about half a bottle of the Trivedi water a day.  We both noticed that our energy level and mood improved.  And, we didn't have to drink as much water to stay hydrated.  My skin was also less dry.<br /><br />When you drink the Trivedi water, it somehow seems more full bodied than regular RO water.  For both of us, it is like drinking an energy drink.  It wakes us up and gives us energy.  Unlike an energy drink, it also improves our mood and doesn't cause a crash later.  My wife likes that you can drink the Trivedi water and still go to bed and get a really good night's sleep.  We brought several cases of the Trivedi water back with us from the retreat in LA.  I'm looking forward to having a whole bottle every day.<br /><br />We gave a few bottles of the first case of Trivedi water away to some friends.  They also really liked the water.  Some have bought more of the Trivedi water from us after we returned from the LA retreat.<br /><br />I tried the Trivedi water on some cut flowers.  The flowers with the Trivedi water looked good for three weeks.  The same batch of flowers with regular RO water only lasted 10 days.

review/summary: Amazing Trivedi Water
review/text: There are many subtle benefits that are not easy to put a finger on, but suffice it to say that just drinking Trivedi Water makes you feel better, clearer and more energized.<br /><br />If my husband has a little too much to drink, he has found that drinking Trivedi Water in intervals over night removes any sign of a hangover the next morning.<br /><br />Also, as everyone knows, consumption of coffee can cause a person to be a little shakey and produce an anxious feeling; however, if Trivedi Water is used to make black teas or coffee, there are zero side or negative effects from drinking these highly caffeinated drinks, plus I have observed that compulsive people no longer feel the need to continue drinking caffeine after their initial desire has been satisfied.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this is no illusion, it definitely works on virtually every level.<br /><br />The most amazing thing is that a product like this is now available to people (their animals & plants) at an affordable price.

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I started drinking Trivedi water every day about two weeks ago, when my Amazon order arrived. I drink two or three bottles a day, which is rare for me, as I don't often feel thirsty.  The biggest positive for me is that my digestive system has shown great improvement almost from the first few days of drinking the water.  As I have made no other new changes and the problem I have experienced over two or three years is remarkably improved, allowing me to discontinue any and all of the products I was taking for this problem, I will continue drinking Trivedi water and can recommend it without hesitation.<br /><br />One more thing, when I burned my forehead slightly when doing my hair with my flat iron, I put a bit of Trivedi water on it. The result -- no effect of the burn on my forehead at all!  This is<br />not your ordinary water!  Many I know have also had great results with their plants, too.  I am prety bad with plants, so I am closing this review now to run outside to pour some Trivedi water<br />on that shrub I noticed isn't doing so well along side my patio.  I will be back to let you know what happens!

review/summary: Proof in the plants, placebo effect not possible! See youtube video link.
review/text: Long, but worth the read, I promise!<br /><br />My very first introduction to Mr Trivedi was last year when I heard him on a radio interview. I was skeptical, but very hopeful, because they said there was scientific testing behind the Trivedi Effect. So I purchased the intro package to receive the three energy transmissions via remote group calls. I knew in my soul that what was being offered to help self healing was possible. After the second group call and energy transmission, a knee injury of mine had nearly disappeared. I wondered if my knee injury healing could have been from the placebo effect. However, we all know self healing is possible; just look at how the body heals a scrape on your skin. So with the energy transmission from Mr Trivedi as a catalyst, I got excited at the possibilities.<br /><br />Then in January of 2011, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to attend a "Miracles Do Happen" presentation live in San Diego. I was blown away at seeing all the scientific studies done. And seeing the before and after pictures of crops and trees exposed to an energy infusion transmission. I was also very intrigued by the testing they were doing on water, and how Mr Trivedi said water was a very good carrier for this energy. So I bought a case of bottled water that had been infused with this energy by Mr. Trivedi.<br /><br />The first thing I did after drinking a full bottle for myself, was to share a bottle with my plants and animals. I poured a little directly in my pets bowls, and in every plant in my house. But then I remembered they told me that for animals it should be diluted 50/50, and for plants five parts regular water to one part Trivedi water. So I thought I better follow the recommendations, plus I wanted to be selfish and drink most of the case myself.<br /><br />So I decided to do an experiment with two of my plants that had previously been struggling for years to survive. They are African Violets, but never flowered. The leaves were always yellowing and dieing off faster than they should. The stems grew out sideways, and were often limp.<br /><br />The first day of my own home scientific test, I took photos of these two plants that had seemed to have the biggest struggle to survive in my home. I followed the instructions and filled a bottle of water with one fifth Trivedi water, and used only that water on these plants to see how, if any difference, would appear over time. I knew that you couldn't have a placebo effect on a plant.<br /><br />To my amazement, after only a short period of time, both of these plants were not just surviving, they were thriving for the first time ever. The leaves started turning a darker green, and had more shine to them.  The leaves were also thicker and much stronger, they were no longer limp. The stems started growing upward; vertical, instead of the previously horizontal fashion they had been. I was in awe!<br /><br />I continued with this treatment, changing nothing else; no fertilizer, no change in location, only the one fifth portion of Trivedi water once a week. I continued to take photographs every few weeks, for six or seven months. and... well, see for yourself... [...]<br /><br />(You may need to copy/paste link above to browser.

review/summary: Great tasting water
review/text: I would like to share with you who are contemplating Mr. Trivedi's products, I was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux. I was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no,s.  About 3 months ago I found out about this incredible water, since then that is all I drink.  I had the most amazing results, not only easing my acid reflux,but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which I am not especially noted for.  At the 11-11-11 retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in Soho, she remarked how different and calmer I was compared to 2 months ago. I know there will always be skeptics, I am ready for them.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Trivedi

review/summary: Better than Visine/Cured a Bad Infection in my Cat's Tail
review/text: I dumped the Visine out of the bottle and use blessed Trivedi water as eye drops. It soothes and gets the red out better than.  My cat had a very bad infection on the underside of her tail from an animal attack. I considered a trip to the vet, wondering if she needed antibiotics, but decided to try Trivedi water first. Two days later the infection was completely gone and it healed perfectly. Our plants are tall and healthy.  I sip it during my hectic days as a teacher and it seems to help smooth away the stress.  I feel it is well worth the investment - much better for me in many ways than buying pop, expensive coffee or alcohol!

I did bring a case home back from the retreat and gave some to my 3 children.  One of my children notice that his cold didn't last very long.  As for making it for tea, it was fantastic. It bought out the favor out more. The most important thing I like about this product, it is backed up by science. Now I can't wait for this product be available on Amazon for Canada and for the world on to try, so they can experience this wonderful water.

review/text: I have been drinking this water for about 4 months.  I find that it absorbs into me better than other water, it also reduces my appetite.  The scientific research done on this water is amazing.  I feel good when I drink this water.<br /><br />UPDATE: I noticed that another reviewer tried the water on a cold sore.  Yesterday I felt a cold sore forming in my upper lip so I decided to give it a try.  Every hour or so, I applied a paper towel soaked with the water on the affected area.  This morning there is barely a trace of it.  The water definitely arrested and reduced the development of the sore.  I expect it to be completely gone today.<br />Very cool

review/summary: Water is good for everything
review/text: This water is amazing. It is far better than any energy drink or vitamin drink. It will help with any condition, depression, or illness as well as help your happiness and bliss. I find it especially good with skin problems, just take a small bit of the water and apply it directly to the skin. It clears up acne, rashes, fungus and viral infections. It also is good for plants and pets. The cost of this amazing product is ridiculously low. It has been verified by many clinical trials. I am sure that it will be difficult to get because everyone will want it. When it becomes available, best get as much as you can.<br /><br />Use your imagination with the Trivedi products. I had surgery this morning that is notorious for being very painful. The surgeon recommended that I use ice to reduce the pain. I took some Trivedi water and froze it and put it on the wound. There is now no pain and I am not taking any pain medication. The surgeon said I would be in intense pain for a week and I had to take pretty heavy pain medication. Now I don't need it at all!

review/text: Trivedi Water!  I recommend it!<br /><br />I have purchased several cases of Trivedi water from Amazon. A friend stopped by this past week with a bouquet of tulips wrapped in wet paper.  She had just purchased them and they were already hanging limply.  I put them in a vase with Trivedi water.  Two days later, those tulips are standing up straight and now five days later they are still standing.  Unbelievable!  Also, I was about to throw out my Christmas poinsettia plant.  The leaves were pretty much withered so I decided to clean it up and water it with Trivedi water.  Well now, there are beautiful little green shoots sprouting all over the stems!  I personally can't seem to drink enough of it.  I notice that my hair is becoming shinier!  Neat!  All good!  I recommend this obviously powerful water to anyone and everyone.

It's good tasting water, but not at $39.00 for 24 which works out to $1.63 per bottle. I am going back to my Crystal Geyser water that costs me 11 CENTS PER BOTTLE.

The photos are lovely and the description "Guavas have a subtle and floral flavor with sweet and sour undertones. Soft and creamy when ripe, Guavas have a fully edible rind and small seeds that are edible too. No one can resist its rare and irresistible floral aroma. One bite will transport you to a tropical paradise. " was really enticing.<br /><br />Sadly, not only was I not transported to the tropical paradise, no floral aroma and certainly not creamy they never ripened.<br /><br />Of course, had the fruit ripened I would have enjoyed the delightful fragrance that only Guava can give and would have relished every bite.

review/summary: Eat These Bangkok Streen Vendor Style
review/text: These came green and crisp, the way I prefer them. A couple were very green and I ripened them a bit by setting them under my heat lamp (used to cultivate indoor tomatoes) until they got the very slightest tinge of yellow. While these are just a bit pricey (you get 8-9 mid-sized apple-sized guavas for the price), these are the type of guavas you run into in Thailand (usually imported from Vietnam and there, they come about the size of grapefruit). These came shipped via USPS (took 4-5 biz days days overall)and were individually wrapped and individually bagged. Each of the fruit I got was in perfect condition without a blemish or soft spot.<br /><br />I love the green guava and eat it sliced into wedges with the following (borrowed from Bangkok street vendors):<br />- 1 part salt<br />- 3 parts sugar (4 parts sugar is fine better than 2.5 parts sugar)<br />- crushed/ground dried red pepper flakes to taste (I like my mix peppery).<br /><br />I keep this mix in a small plastic tub and dip almost all my fruit in it. The guava, at the stage I eat and prefer it, has a flavor like green apple but not quite as sweet or tart.<br /><br />If you are looking for a riper guava (one more in keeping with being eaten ripe), you may want to look into the feijoas, which is a different breed from this type and, as I discovered the hard way, not so good green as this type. The feijoas were pretty bitter green.

review/summary: Great seasoning for meats
review/text: I have used this seasoning for years and love it. It is a simple seasoning that enhances the natural flavors of the meat instead of overriding them.<br /><br />Overall my favorite application for this is to use it on steaks or hamburgers I intend to BBQ. No prep required at all simply toss the meats onto the BBQ, put some soy sauce on the meat followed by some Adobo (basically treat it like salt, an easy sprinkling is enough). When you flip the meat repeat the process. People often rave about my burgers and steaks, and the truth is I have very little to do with it, it's the combination of the soy sauce and Adobo.<br /><br />It also works well for Chicken, potatoes, etc...<br /><br />The best part of this seasoning as mentioned before is that it does not drown the natural flavors of what you are cooking, used properly it enhances the flavors without destroying the original products flavors. There are other versions of Adobe (with pepper, with lemon pepper, etc...) but I generally find that I like using the base Adobo without any additional seasonings, I can always add the additional seasonings myself if desired, but find that the normal Adobo is usually perfect without any additions.<br /><br />Adobo consists generally of the following ingredients:<br />Salt, Garlic, Oregano, Turmeric<br /><br />These are spices I often use myself in cooking, but the blend and ratios are just perfect in the Adobo to enhance the natural flavors of what you are cooking

The 27 oz package cost per chew is 0.78 cents each chew the 36 oz package is 0.85 cents per chew. Why buy the larger tub for more money. am I missing something here? Great product though just misleading price and value advertising. 3 stars only because of the misleading value advertising.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but they're not healthy
review/text: Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.

review/text: I bought "Greenies" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff.

review/text: Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.  She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little.  Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix.  I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply.  Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.  And my dogs love Greenies.

I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky.

review/summary: Bonkers over greenies!
review/text: We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not for my dog
review/text: The product does seem to work. If my dog has had a few of these over the course of a few days, her breath is noticably fresher. However, I walk her every single day, and she usually has to use the bathroom around this time. I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag. However, I cannot completely slam this product, as it did help her breath somewhat.<br /><br />If it matters, my dog is a 5 year old long-haired Black Cream Daschund. She hovers between 12 and 12 1/2 lbs.

review/summary: Nice Size Bundle
review/text: We previously got a few of these at a local pet store to see if our dog liked them. Sure enough, she loved them. They are quite costly compared to other dog treats but they do a good job with keeping her breath "fresh" and as previously mentioned, she loves them.

review/summary: Dog thinks they're GREAT!
review/text: These lower calorie Greenies are just what our dog ordered, or would have if he had fingers.  They are great for his teeth--and waist line--and beat brushing.

review/summary: Deceiving description
review/text: Package description reads canister, therefore I was expecting a canister/container containing the dog treats.  The product box contained two resealable pouches upon receipt.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: Nothing gets our dog's tail wagging like a Greenie!  I like that they come with a zip-top inner pouch to keep them fresh.  That way I can buy the big economy tub and save a little $$$!  Thank you Greenies!

review/summary: Coffee
review/text: I purchase this product for my mom. She is a elderly, handicap  lady .  I enjoy the fact that she can get the six bags at a time. She new that she wouldn't run out since she was getting it every 2 months. She doesn't always get out to purchase the coffee. The store in her town doesn't always carry it and when they do it is usually $2-$3 dollars more than what we pay on line , plus it just comes to the house. She doesn't get out that often. She is really disappointed that you are discontinuing the product. Please bring it back as soon as possible. Thank you.
