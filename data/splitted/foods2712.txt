review/summary: The Very Best Chips
review/text: This is my third order of Popchips.  My husband and I both love them, and he takes a bag in lunch nearly every day.  I shared them with coworkers, also, and they thought they were great.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: The Barbeque Popchips Are Awesome!
review/text: I first tried a small bag of the Barbeque Popchips on a business trip in California.  They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).  They liked them so much, I ordered a 24 pack online so they could have one in their lunch each day.  My kids shared these chips with their friends at lunch and told me that everyone loved them!  All their friends wanted to know where we got them from!

review/summary: Healthy and tasty!
review/text: I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that "hmm this taste like health food". Which the BBQ doesn't have that effect at all. Though I'm still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips.

review/summary: Not for everyone!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste "weight" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.

review/summary: Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious)
review/text: These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!

review/summary: Much better than I thought
review/text: I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!

review/summary: Great introduction to these chips
review/text: Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.

review/text: Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.

review/summary: These things are sooooo addictive
review/text: These things are great. I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great. When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor.

review/summary: The best chips EVER!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!

I would rather eat these BBQ chips than any other chips and I love all kinds of chips.  I have now switch over to POPCHIPS as I know I am eating a better chip and its healther too.  For 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat, I feel it is a good choice and the taste makes it worth wild.  I have taken some of these to work and have gotten some co-workers hooked on these as well.

review/text: I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.

review/summary: Way too much Vinegar for me
review/text: I totally love POPCHIPS - but the Sea Salt and Vinegar just has too much Vinegar taste for me.  I felt like I was eating just vinegar.  I took the rest to work and some people like the flavor and some said just to much vinegar for them.

review/summary: Self-Control is the Issue!
review/text: I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best  "potato chips" that I have ever had -- so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.<br /><br />Believe me, you have to try these chips!

review/summary: salt &pepper popchips are the best
review/text: Anyone that likes Salt and Peppercorn Kettle Chips will like this snack.<br /><br />Salt and Pepper Popchips are one of the best munchie snacks that has come out in a long time.  No saturated fat, and no trans fat...Great taste with no guilt.<br /><br />Granted they are not quite as addicting as the Kettle Chips,  but they have a lot less fat.<br /><br />i am concerned that safeway and nobb hill grocery stores are not carrying this product anymore.  i am thinking about ordering a dozen cases and stockpile them up so that i am INSURED of my supply.

review/summary: I never thought I'd switch from 'chips'
review/text: I am an avid chip eater. Ever since I was a child (I'm now 29),I was always a 'salty' tooth.<br /><br />I've gone through Ruffles and every other type of chip.<br /><br />The problem is that no matter if I buy a small or large bag; I'd have to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />I read about this item in my "Shape" magazine for being a low-calorie food and yet being yummy.<br /><br />I tried to find at my local stores but haven't been able to (I live in the Seattle area).<br /><br />Thankfully, I found on Amazon and anxiously awaited my case to come. I was a little nervous to commit to a whole case but was pleasantly surprised when I opened my first bag.<br /><br />I chose this size (0.8-oz over 3-oz) cause I think it's about the right size for a lunch bag.<br /><br />The flavor has a little bit of a kick with it, not too spicy but definitely not a boring bbq flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone who loves chips but can't stop with just one to try a bag of these. They definitely satisfy and don't taste like they're not fried.

review/text: We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream/onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.<br /><br />I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.<br /><br />Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper.

review/text: These BBQ chips are crisp, well-spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.<br />We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re-ordering program!

review/text: I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.

It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same "crunch" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D... POPCHIPS ROCK and are a part of my daily 3pm snack routine :D

review/text: Well the main thing here is that you are trading oil for starch. I found that it had a slightly funny taste at first, but the salt and vinegar flavors are true to form so its a very workable substitute for oily chips. When I eat chips I tend to eat them for the salty flavor, not the oil.

review/text: I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.

I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said "you have to try these chips, (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy. I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them. I sent a case to their home since you can not get them on the east coast and they are almost finished with them. Time to order another case. BEST CHIPS EVER. We keep many bags in the house.

review/summary: ADDICTIVE
review/text: After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you.

Instead of chips and dip, I now have popchips plain or with fat-free dip or salsa and still loose weight eating something that I truly enjoy!!!  Popchips are the best tasting 120 calorie snack on the market.  It truly does replace your craving for salty, high fat potato chips, doritos, fritos, etc.  You may be amazed when you try these popchips!!

review/summary: THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :(

review/summary: super super yummy chips, minus the guilt -- Salt & Pepper
review/text: These Popchips are my absolute favorite. I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended.

review/summary: Healthy & Delicious Potato Chips
review/text: Oh, these chips are wonderful. They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips. Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty. Problem solved -- Amazon's are much more reasonably priced and I can stock up -- and this snack is as close in flavor to actual potato chips that I've found to date.

review/summary: LOVE these with one caveat
review/text: I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, "sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil." Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil.

review/summary: Good alternative to potato chips, but very salty!
review/text: After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.

review/text: I had to fight to open the sweet potato chip bag because my mind just doesn't want me to be eating sweet potato chips.  Anyway...I get the bag open and I expected them to be gross.  The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.

review/text: I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.

My favorite is the sea salt and vinegar flavor -- not too much vinegar, and just the right amount of salt. (The plain Pop Chips are solid, too.) These chips are unbelievably light. They give me the same satisfaction as munching on popcorn, but with less guilt and hassle.

review/text: I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version. I wasn't sure if the texture of pop chips and the sweet potato flaver would work together.<br /><br />I liked and enjoyed them but they aren't a flavor I would have as my 'go to' snack. I think for sweet potato I prefer real veggie slices.  These are light, crunchy, a little sweet and a little salty and perfect for times when you crave both sweet and salty. They are only 100 calories per bag and they came 24 bags in a nicely packed in a box. Great for lunches, or to keep in the car/desk/purse for a little pick me up snack.

review/summary: Yummy goodies!  But are they any healthier?
review/text: Yum! Yum!  I liked these and they are certainly yummy chips.  They are a tad sweet and a tad salty mixed.  I guess they are more sweet than salty, though. Why only four stars?  These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case, sweet potato), and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me, "pop") them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost, I would imagine.  Still, a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)

review/text: The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.

review/summary: I loved them!
review/text: I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.

review/summary: The crunch has it!
review/text: We frequent Whole Foods and love to buy the larger "Pop Chips" that they make. They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack.
