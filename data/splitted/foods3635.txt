review/summary: Adult Twinkie
review/text: I got this on the Friday Sale at a great price.  The packaging is good.  The cake is vacuum sealed. However, there are too many chemicals in the cake.  It tastes like a rum soaked twinkie without the cream filling.  I was able to salvage the first cake using some homemade rum-raisin ice cream.  I will not be buying these cakes again.

review/summary: My Favorite Ajvar
review/text: I've grown up with ajvar, and always liked its taste. It's a great condiment, and enhances flavor of any meal. Of all the ajvars that I've tried in recent years the Marco Polo brand is my favorite. This ajvar tastes very fresh and light. It doesn't have all that much oil, which for me is a huge plus. I prefer the mild variety to the hot one, primarily because I can enjoy it with a wider assortment of main dishes.<br /><br />I usually get it from various ethnic grocery stores, but it's also nice to know that it's available on Amazon in case I run out of it and am having a craving for it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: DECEPTIVE PRODUCT: This is NOT "UMF 16+" manuka honey!
review/text: I have researched and used Manuka honey since 2004, including UMF 12+, UMF 16+, UMF 17+, and UMF 20+, and write to warn against this product and this seller. This product does NOT have a "UMF 16+" level of MANUKA FACTOR and is NOT CERTIFIED "UMF 16+."<br /><br />WARNING: If you seek a Manuka honey able to provide the medical benefits of a UMF 16+ manuka honey, THIS PRODUCT IS A FRAUD. It is merely a basic table honey.<br /><br />The label is intentionally deceptive.  It seeks to confuse consumers by including "active" and "16+" but this is meaningless. STAKICH HONEY IS NOT CERTIFIED by the Active Manuka Honey Associaion to have methylglyoxal (MGO).  MGO is the factor present in SOME -- not all -- manuka honeys.  MGO is responsible for the medical benefits shown in scientific research.  (A side note: be sure to check the research itself, not the claims on sellers' websites, to distinguish the real from the illusory medical benefits of CERTIFIED manuka honeys.)<br /><br />Having consumed several different UMF 16+ and UMF 20+ honeys (the two strengths that I use for different purposes, in addition to manuka essential oil) across the years, I immediately could taste the LACK of MGO in Stakich's honey.  (I'd not been able to see the label detail in the small photo here.)  But rather than presume, I contacted Stakich for some validation of MGO in the honey.  In reply, Stakich sent a dodge rather than a substantive answer.<br /><br />I wrote a second time, indicating that mine was not an idle inquiry because I use the honey for medical purposes; I depend on an accurate UMF label to be assured I am using an appropriate product for the several purposes to which I put these honeys.  Stakich's second reply delivered an insult in lieu of a responsive answer.  Thus, in addition to warning you about the product, I'll also say that I am disgusted with the evasive and condescending "service" Stakich provided when confronted with their deception.<br /><br />Before you buy a manuka honey for other than regular table honey use, check the AMHA's website to see whether it is sold by a member of the Association and has been certified to have an MGO level accurately represented on the label. If all you want is a table honey, you can get one many times cheaper from a truthful seller who clearly lables both its higher UMF and its low UMF honeys.

review/summary: Really Great and a good price
review/text: The other review on this is harsh and incorrect.  This honey is really great, I've bought it twice.  What the other reviewer fails to mention is that in the US the regulations are different and UMF if not a designation recognized by the FDA so it is not required on the packaging. You usually find it on bottles actually imported from New Zealand so if you really want to pay extra for that then go for it. However to call someone a fraud when their company has been in business for so long is rude. If you don't like the honey well then...don't buy it.<br /><br />Their customer service has been great, the only issue I had is that one of the glass bottles I purchased broke in the mail and I left a message which was promptly responded to and a replacement bottle was sent right away with many sincere apologies. I have more trust in a company that has been around for so long and has great Amazon reviews over someone who is adamant about designations, but relies on his sense of 'taste' to evaluate what he is complaining the company isn't evaluating scientifically.<br /><br />This honey is great tasting and worth it!

review/summary: The BEST Giant Breed formula out there ...
review/text: We have a 15 months old Blue Great Dane ... we still consider him as a puppy, even he is already 120 lbs. When we first got him at 10 weeks of age he was on Nutro Natural, but we switched him immediately to Eagle Pack, veterinarians and breeders pointed Eagle Pack as the shrpest formulated food for Giant Breeds.<br /><br />Since then we tried with Boston several other samples, from other brands. He seemed to like Nature's Choice Farm Stand Selects and Nutro Ultra food, but only for sampling. He's always happy to find a bowl full of Eagle there waiting for him to take of it.<br /><br />Regarding ingredients and supplements, Eagle Pack Super Premium is the far best of all. And the fact that it is specially balanced for Giant Breed dogs is something that You won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />Consider this food for Your Giant Breed best friend. Look at the labels, check the ingredients, read about protein balance and other stuff that your dog needs. I guarantee that You won;t find any other food that will come close to Eagle Pack. Let me now if I'm wrong. I will be happy to let Boston sample something else and than look at him when his all happy to go back to good ol' Eagle.<br /><br />Cheers !!!

review/summary: NOT good food
review/text: Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well.

review/text: I was really leery of spending $45 on dog food when we first ordered this for our 100 lb German Shepherd.  After being on it for about 4 month or more now I am convinced that it is worth the price for several reasons:  Our dog eats less of this food because of the higher protein content so a bag last a long time, his coat is shiny and he doesn't stink like our other dogs did.  That is what amazes me the most is that his breath isn't horrible like most dogs and that he doesn't stink at all!  I will continue to buy this for our dog as long as I am able!

They also had very bad gas and were belching non stop. Needless to say the 3 of us did not get any sleep at all that night. There are way better foods out there for the same price, although just because it did not agree with my dogs does not mean it will not agree with yours.

review/text: In our cooking we use quite a number of different brands of bread crumbs and different flavor combinations.  Indeed, we make our own from time to time.<br /><br />Of all the different crumbs we use though, the Progresso Panko is our favorite - the "Plain" bread crumbs - the crispy ones.<br /><br />We use these crumbs primarily for fish and chicken although at times my wife will use them on a couple of different pork chop recipes. We have found that the plan variety serves our personal needs better than the other combinations available.  We add our own spices and herbs to our dishes and have very individual tastes.  We do not want any other flavor interfering with what we add ourselves.<br /><br />The quality of the Progresso Panko is simply better than most.  It gives our fish and chicken a nice crispness which is pleasing and the plan flavor is good.  The cost here on Amazon is quite competitive to that we find in our local stores.<br /><br />Following is the nutritional data from the box...this is for a � cup serving:<br /><br />Calories - 110<br />Calories from Fat - 20<br />Total Fat 2g - 4%<br />Saturated Fat - 0%<br />Trans Fat - 0<br />Cholesterol - 0%<br />Sodium (50 mg) - 2%<br />Total Carbohydrates - 6%<br />Dietary Fiber - 0<br /><br />Ingredients include:  Wheat Flour Bleached, Canola Oil, Yeast, Dextrose, Sugar, Salt, Natural Flavor, Freshness preserved by Ascorbic Acid.<br /><br />NOTE:  This product does contain Wheat Ingredients.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent bread crumb mix and meets our needs perfectly.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Does not contain hydrogenated oil like many other American panko brands
review/text: Once I discovered panko breadcrumbs a few years back when cooking from a Japanese recipe, I have never used any other sort of breadcrumb since. Since then, I've always used imported Japanese brands and so this was my first time trying an American brand of panko.<br /><br />Now, if you don't know what panko breadcrumbs are and how they differ from regular breadcrumbs, the main difference is that panko are more like flakes than tiny crumbs. Because the flakes cover a wider surface of whatever you're breading to cook, this means that it turns out crispier and crunchier. I also find that substituting in panko instead of regular breadcrumbs in things like casseroles where you are combining it into a mixture results in being much much lighter, which I absolutely love.<br /><br />As for this particular brand, it is very comparable to the imported Japanese brands I'm used to. The one thing I have noticed though for other American panko brands is that many of them contain hydrogenated oil which make them unhealthier than most regular breadcrumbs. The Progresso Panko Crispy Bread Crumbs (Plain) here though does not. Here are the listed ingredients: wheat flour (bleached), canola oil, yeast, dextrose, sugar, salt, and natural flavor.

Not only because I have seen the great results of taking soy powder, but also because I just feel healthier and this product is not overly sweet. It is just perfect.<br /><br />You can mix up this shake after a workout or drink it as a breakfast shake. Basically, you can drink this at any time of the day and feel good about this Fat-Free and Cholesterol-free product.<br /><br />Ingredients: IP Isolated Soy Protein, fructose, maltodextrin, guar gum, natural flavor, canola oil, cellulose gum and a Vitamin and Mineral mixture that contains: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron, Vitamin E, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B-6, Folate, Vitamin B-12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Phosphorus, Iodine, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium and Copper.<br /><br />For the best results, blend this in a shaker or use an electric blender.<br /><br />For some reason, this product is especially good when you are eating a Chocolate Brownie Clif Bar. The two products are just delicious together. I've also been adding a scoop of All One's Antioxidant Vitamin Powder to the blend.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: LOVE this protein shake!!!
review/text: If I could give this 10 stars I would! I am lactose intolerant and a distance athlete and need to supplement my protein intake. It is very hard to find soy protein in retail stores, as they all sell Whey. Not only does this powder have 14g of protein per serving, but it tastes INCREDIBLE! I mix it with soymilk for even more protein. It is a treat I look forward to after a hard workout. I can't get enough!

review/summary: Best Tasting Powder/Shake I have Tried
review/text: I had tried this shake product a few times at a friend's house before an 8-12 mile walk.  It kept me full throughout the walk, without feeling filled up and heavy.  I decided to buy this product because I loved the taste so much.  I use 3 scoops as per the directions on the canister along with 8oz of vanilla soy milk and 8oz of ice.  The added texture of the ice gives it a more shake like consistency.  I do not get hungry in between meals when I have this for breakfast; it is a great weight-loss/weight maintenance product.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: FYI: The "Natural flavors" claimed on the container appear to be "dust" and "all-purpose flour," and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never "mix" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.

review/text: I tried this vanilla shake mix amd am presently surprised.  It is tasty, and easily satisfied my sweeth tooth.  It is MUCH less expensive than the Atkins shakes and in powder envelope form it is easy to take to the office.  Each box comes with seven packets. You just add water and a few ice cubes and shake (about 2 minutes to prepare). I am a diabetic so I tested my sugar after drinking the shake and it did not raise my sugar. I am definitely going to purchase more and try the other flavors.

review/text: I found these granules when I lived in Africa for a couple months. It took me forever to find them again once I got home, I actually packed some in my luggage to take home.  They make gravy by just adding them to boiling water, the chicken is a little darker then you think of as chicken, but good. They're especially nice if making gravy for one or two people, thickening stew or soup etc.

It's hard to find so thought I would check Amazon and here it is, so happy to have found some.<br />I tried something new while making some instant mashed potatoes, I put the granules in the liquid before I mixed in the instant potato flakes.  I didn't have to make any gravy to put on the potatoes, it was good with it just mixed in.  I would imagine you could do it when making regular mashed potatoes also.

When cooking chicken in the pan it's always great to just add some veg and water and pour a little bit of this in while you're still cooking. That way you get a great gravy and the taste seeps into the meat.

review/summary: Better than Kool-Aid
review/text: I've always liked Kool-Aid.  I loved it when I was a kid and I've been a fan of the regular sugar version for decades.  (I'm old enough to have owned a couple of the 'smiley face' pitchers.)<br /><br />BUT I've got to say that this Hawaiian Punch 'Wild Purple Smash' is wildly superior to Kool-Aid's diet On-the-Go options.<br /><br />The difference is taste.  The 'Wild Purple Smash' is has more flavor, more depth of flavor and is zippier and more reminiscent of the old grape Kool-Aid.  I think the difference comes from HP's using Citric Acid instead of Kool-Aid's Maltic Acid.  The Citric Acid seems to cut the taste of the diet sweetener --I'm not a fan of diet sweeteners, but I'm on a diet so it's a necessary evil -- and it just makes for a more lively beverage.  The Kool-Aid version is bland in comparison.<br /><br />Give this a try if you are on a diet and hunger for flavor.  Ten little calories.<br /><br />Pam T~

I use the 4 oz. setting which is supposed to be used for iced tea-it brews coffee as well, though. This is not very cost efficient, of course, but I do like having the taste without too much caffeine. On another related point-Green Mountain says that Half Calf is half the caffeine of a regular cup of coffee. But half of what type of regular cup of coffee ? Exactly how much caffeine does it have ?

review/summary: Green Mountain Half-Caff
review/text: A real dissapointment.  With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years.  When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't.  This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater.  Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery.  Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf.  All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf.  I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great.  The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees.  Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste.  Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and decaff coffees and deep six this product.

Newman's Own uses and all natural water process.  Or hey...you would be better off with one cup fully loaded with caffeine.  You would be better off...and so would your baby.

review/summary: Not vegan!
review/text: This is advertised as being a vegan dog treat product, but it is definitely not vegan. Its Amazon title even has the word, "vegan" in it: "KONG Premium Treats Sweet Potato Vegan Treats". I ordered one of these, and gelatin is in the ingredient list. Gelatin is not vegan.<br /><br />The product does not contain any animal "by-products" (rendered meat) and even says so on the package. I think that's what confused the person who labeled it "vegan".<br /><br />Ingredients: Sweet Potatoes, Barley Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Maple Syrup, Vegetable Glycerine, GELATIN [my emphasis], Natural Flavor, Salt, Carrots, Peas, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Natural Smoke Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary.<br /><br />And if I were nitpicking, I'd say the Natural Flavor and Natural Smoke Flavor could also be non-vegan. I can't say for sure.<br /><br />The use of acids in this is also a little weird. I don't usually see three used. And phosphoric acid isn't typically in dog treats, I don't think. It's just odd.<br /><br />I also think it's odd that they used maple syrup, since it tends to cost a lot more than fructose syrup. I guess they suspect people avoid fructose syrup or HFCS. But maple syrup is just another sweetener, probably just as "bad" as HFCS.<br /><br />Other info: "Crude protein: no less than 6.0%. Crude fat: no less than 1.0%. Crude fiber: no more than 4.0%. Moisture: no more than 28.0%."<br /><br />Anyway, just wanted to chime in to mention that it's not vegan like the title says.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

review/text: I e-mailed the company to clarify the source of the "gelatin" in this product.  They responded that they use agar, or vegetable gelatin.  In my opinion, they should make this clear on the packaging.  I do think it is misleading to list gelatin, instead of agar, or vegetable gelatin.<br /><br />Otherwise, my dogs like these treats and they are easy to cut into small pieces for training.  Worked well for training my dog to walk on the leash without pulling!

review/summary: Extremely Disappointing
review/text: I love the Dunkin Donuts pumpkin coffee and pumpkin spice latte, so I asked for pumpkin syrup for Christmas and received this as a gift.  I was incredibly excited, until I tasted my coffee.  At first, I thought my milk had gone bad, because the coffee just tasted unpleasant and odd.  I tossed the coffee and poured a new cup, adding milk from a different container, and was met by the same putrid taste.<br /><br />To me, the syrup tastes like rotten squash/pumpkin.  I didn't taste much (or any) spice, though that may have been the overpowering smell of something spoiled.  I tried several proportions of coffee:milk:syrup and could not come up with anything palatable.<br /><br />I strongly suggest you do not purchase this product, unless I got a terrible batch (in which case, Torani needs to tweak their quality control process!).

review/text: I bought this syrup hoping to be able to make coffee or lattes at home that taste at least a little bit like Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts pumpkin spice lattes.  Not only does this taste nothing like either, it is actually gross.  My husband took a whiff of it and gagged.  The bottle was sealed when it came so I don't think mine was tampered with.  I just think the flavor and smell is so far off from any other pumpkin flavoring out there.  We ended up dumping it down the drain.

Yet nope, still tastes like butternut squash. Really gross. I'm pretty miserly but just poured the whole bottle down the sink.

Simply because a 5 star review is reserved for the greatest chocolate ever - the Ritter Sport Butter Biscuit.<br />The Neapolitaner Waffel edition is basically Ritter Sport chocolate (one of the best in the world in my opinion) with Neapolitaner ("Manner") wafers and nougat.<br />The nougat, unfortunately, is a bit much and overpowers the taste of the chocolate and wafers.<br />Ritter's quality is always outstanding.<br />Remember, the way you open any Ritter Sport is to break it in the middle. If you do it right the package will open properly in the middle of the back of the package. Enjoy!

review/text: My 2 cats, age 14 and 15, looked at this food like, "Where's the GOOD food!". They had been eating Fancy Feast with gravy which is fine but contains corn and they throw up alot. They have been trowing up about 90% less on Natural Balance. They each put on about 1/2 to 1 pound. Their coats are glossy and I feel better knowing this food is alot healthier. At first, I bought some cheap tuna and had to mix the canned on a 1:1 ratio to get them to eat it, then 1:2, now 1:3 (1 can tuna to 3 cans Natural balance). I will soon wean then off the tuna but there was crying for a few days at first and my 15 year old flat out refused to eat for abot 4 days and lost a pound but finally started to nibble on it and now eats it well. The dry was better received but they need canned also. Worth the bother as now they cry when their dish is empty!!

The one thing that I hadn't taken into consideration when I purchased it is that brown mustard does not contain turmeric...an herb which is very good for you. However, organic yellow mustard has turmeric. Be that as it may, Organic Brown Mustard is a very good buy.  It gives a very good flavor to cabbage, meats, fish. You can experiment for yourself and find out which foods you enjoy it as a seasoning or flavoring. It's a very good product.  I just prefer organic yellow mustard because it contains turmeric. Still, I think that Organic Brown Mustard deserves five stars.

I can't get anyone in my family to eat leftover chicken except perhaps a chicken breast sliced up and put on top of a salad once in a while. I discovered Tony Chachere's Creole Gumbo Dinner Mix and it was a perfect solution to using up leftover meats and vegetables.<br /><br />The base has rice, veggies, and seasonings all in one packet. I add in any leftover veggies and cut up the leftover meats along with some water and have gumbo in about thirty minutes.<br /><br />The next day it tastes even better!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the gumbo is somewhat underseasoned for my tastes. I like to add some hot sauce but served as is even kids can eat this.

When we fix it we add a bit more rice, which doesn't affect the quality (and I love rice).  The gumbo has a nice bite to it, but is not overly spicy.  (I like real spicy food so I add a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce.)  It freezes well, and a frozen serving makes a wonderful breakfast dish after four minutes in the microwave.

review/summary: Oh My My!!! Good Chocolate! Not Waxy or Syrupy Sweet!
review/text: This Lucienne Orange chocolate bar is crisp and crunchy with a hint of orange flavor. You smell the fresh, citrus orange flavor more than taste it. I find it very satisfying when I'm craving chocolate. The taste is light and chocolatey without being too bitter.<br /><br />If you want a chocolate bar that tastes like the sugary sweet, waxy common chocolate bars, this is not for you. However, if you want a purely chocolate taste that is just a bit sweet, this may be what you're looking for. I truly enjoy this one.

review/summary: Orange?
review/text: This is an OK tasting dark chacolate, however I was not able to either taste or smell any orange. It would benefit from a touch more stevia and some orange rind.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: This is a great product - just like I remember when I was a child. Great for a raspy throat or anytime. I should have enough now to last me and my friends for an entire year. Thank you for carrying such a great product. I am very thankful that I could find these on line to order :) I wish these could be found locally so that I wouldn't have to pay shipping charges.

review/text: Order was well processed, but lemon flavor was not very good. Not an exceptional candy like some from other sources.

review/text: Delish. Exactly what I was hoping for. I ordered these to include for wedding favors and wedding decoration. (Last name of the couple was Lemon.) They were big, beautiful and tasty. Couldn't ask for anything more.

review/summary: No Dairy
review/text: I got this in an experiment to avoid dairy. It's one the few with no dairy. I really like it and now that I've abandoned the dairy-free I prefer it to any other. Unfortunately it's too expensive, so I'll save it for a rare treat.

review/summary: Modern chocolate with a wonderfully old-fashioned flavor
review/text: I purchased this chocolate because it is gluten free. I was HIGHLY impressed, and can't wait to purchase more bars of this chocolate!<br /><br />It is modern in that it is gluten and dairy free, but for those people who are sorely missing the taste of chocolate from the early 80s and back, I think you'll find yourself wanting to taste this bar . . . over and over again! It truly reminds me of the chocolates I used to get as special treats on the holidays; before companies started adding so many preservatives and waxes to candies, forever ruining their flavors. Don't miss out on this delicious treat!
