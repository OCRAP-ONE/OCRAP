review/summary: my dog's favorite treat
review/text: my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase.

review/summary: Perfect- even for a finicky eater with allergies!
review/text: My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine/chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it- she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!

review/text: My dog is 11 years old and has a bad back. He is a VERY picky eater.  He LOVES these treats and asks for them if we forget to give him one. (Which is seldom because he is so spoiled) There is a bit more of a perk in his step since we've discovered this product. The cost here on Amazon is fantastic too because the stores have been charging me $7.99 a bag. (NYC prices yikes)

review/summary: Great made in China product for dogs.
review/text: I've noticed that quite a few people don't seem to believe the labels of products made in China, when it is usually a U.S. company that dictates what goes into the product.  Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China.

review/text: My little Schipperke could hardly walk in the morning because her hips hurt so much.  Even though she is only two, we worried that she would need surgery to get around.  We started her on Happy Hips and in less than two weeks, she was a pup again... running around and enjoying life.  And, she runs to the kitchen in the morning to beg for her "treat" because she loves the taste.  What a great product.  Thank you so much.

review/text: I have given these treats to an array of doggies: english bulldogs, a boston terrier, a hound mix, and several mutt breeds...the overall consensus? Two very enthusiastic paws up! Not one of the dogs turned it down. Pretty impressive. No matter how fussy your dog, or how limited his or her dietary restrictions, these treats not only drive them wild, but have added goodies to improve their health. Ya' can't go wrong! I also would try the other varieties (heart health, breathies, vitality) each has a lil' something to address your dog's specific needs, and above all, they will love 'em.

review/text: I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......

review/summary: Good deal on a great item!
review/text: Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.

review/summary: My dogs are loving these, thinly sliced so easy to chew
review/text: I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other brands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot - I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)

review/summary: BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so "addictive." My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is "decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods." So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]

He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite "except" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still "Made in China" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again.

review/summary: reommend you avoid chinese sourced food products for your pet
review/text: These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.

There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China.

review/summary: Causes diarrhea and vomiting!! Do not buy!
review/text: I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!

review/summary: My dog feels better!
review/text: I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a "subscription" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20/month for us, it is well worth the "investment" - it just plain made him feel better!

review/text: Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.

review/summary: Made in China? Not feeding THIS anymore!
review/text: Up until now, I believed I was feeding my dogs a healthful treat that was good for them. Of note: the glucosamine and chondroitin content in these jerky treats is of the highest I've seen in a treat that they actually "like" and look forward to having. I was feeding these as a daily joint supplement to my poodle in particular who, as of late, had been experiencing more joint issues after a traumatic hip injury years earlier.<br /><br />Thanks to the savvy poster who brought to light this product is now being produced in China. Costco sells jerky treats made in China as well, and I no longer purchase those and warn my clients about purchasing them too. Only made in the USA and USDA inspected, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Why oh why can't pet owners find a decently priced, trustworthy jerky treat for our pets that is A. High in glucosamine and B. Isn't manufactured in China? Being that China has shown little diligence with regards to creating a child's toy that isn't later involved in a recall, I'm certainly not about to give any credence to something that will be ingested by my pets. I'm tossing the rest of these treats in the trash!<br /><br />No. Thank. You.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!

review/text: My dogs LOVE duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so I though I'd give the duck a try.  Bad idea.  The treat was too tough and stringy for my small female Westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting.  I order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the 6 bags.  I too hate the fact that these are made in China, but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so I'm back to the chicken formula.

Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china, advised not to buy.

review/summary: Not Sure
review/text: My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand.

I feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken, when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices.  They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print.

review/summary: CAUTION!!!!
review/text: I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!

review/summary: Dog went Crazy - Neighbor Dog Wants to Move In - These are Disgusting!!!!
review/text: Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other "flavors" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like "beef jerky" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat.

review/text: My dog absolutely loves these treats. We have tried many treats since we have had her, and she has never loved any of them as much as she loves these. When she is done eating one, she will stalk the bag and try to manipulate us into giving her another one. She literally goes crazy for them. I like the fact there are so few ingredients and that they do not have any grains in them. Our dog is getting older, so I feel good about the ingredients for her joints. The only reason that I gave them four stars instead of five is that they are made in China; I really wish they were made in the United States. I must warn you though; your dog may become addicted--just like mine :)

review/text: In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.

review/text: We were shocked to find out that Dogswell a company we have been buying our dog treats for last several years have started outsourcing these dog treats to China. This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text "Made in China" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China.

review/text: I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.<br /><br />I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese "treats"

review/text: I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again.<br />It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick.<br />AVOID!

review/summary: Beware - Made in China
review/text: My 8 year old Maltese loved these treats.  I didn't know about the FDA warnings until after he died from a "mystery" illness that started out as vomiting followed by lethargy.  He had been very healthy before.  The vet did a necropsy and said my dog's liver was severely enlarged and his kidneys were also affected.  Please don't feed your beloved pets ANYTHING made in China.  If I had known about the dangers, I would never have given these to my dog.

review/summary: made in china. unsafe
review/text: all of the veterinary products made in China are potentially dangerous to your pet.  Do not buy pet products made in China.  Along with the melamine issues of a few years ago, there have been reports of Salmonella on these so called "treats".<br /><br />Additionally, there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis.<br /><br />And Amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products.

review/text: As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. We stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. We threw them out. Stay very far away from this product.

review/summary: the real review
review/text: My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns. Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />Hello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELL�.<br /><br />The DOGSWELL� manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions.

If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely. Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn. I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process.<br /><br />Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly.

review/summary: Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver
review/text: I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.

review/summary: Chinese Product Masquerading as American
review/text: I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) "U.S.A. Rawhide" and on the back, in fine print, was "Made in China."  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our "furry kids" that won't make them sick or kill them!

review/summary: Quality has gone downhill
review/text: I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.

review/summary: Zero stars- my dog became ill after eating these
review/text: My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.

review/summary: Made in China, causes some concerns
review/text: I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?

review/summary: Made in China - won't buy anymore
review/text: My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!

Finally, I have found a treat that's healthy, not only for his hips, but for his teeth, also.  They're nice & chewy.<br />I read food labels constantly, and it helps to be able to read the ingredients before purchasing on Amazon.  Also, buying Dogswell in bulk (15oz./pks of 3) as Amazon offers, is the best deal I have found, so far.  My 13yr. old, 33lb. dog gets 3 chicken strips a day.  The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer, whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh, and one last thing, Ranger Bob will bury pig ears, real bones, biscuits,"green bones" etc. but not these Dogswell strips!

review/text: I ordered three packages because the price was so good, then I saw this. I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]

review/text: FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, " A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China." (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that "small number" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?<br /><br />We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.

review/text: It's more than a year that I daily feed Dogswell Happy Hips treats to my now 12 year old dog who has arthritis in her hips. Her moves are more fluid now, without the 'stiff' look to her stride because of the glucosamine and chondroitin contained in this product. Plus she looks forward to getting the treats every day (her favorite is the Duck Breast).<br />I also give my dog a Best Pet Health chewable tablet every evening that contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM. These products really do help my arthritic dog a lot.

review/summary: Has The Manufacturer Changed the Formula?
review/text: I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.

review/summary: WARNING-NO RETURNS ACCEPTED
review/text: I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.

review/summary: FDA Warns Chicken Jerky From China May Harm or Kill Your Dog.
review/text: STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search "chicken jerky treats china" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am "fortunate"... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal of 2007 that killed 1000's of our four legged friends...TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY.  I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status.

review/summary: dangerous treat
review/text: I have been giving my dog this treat for a long time,I found it here on Amazon and it is much cheaper! Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of "made in USA", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend.

review/text: These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?

review/text: These treats are a wonderful way for me to keep my old dog moving. He enjoys them and I enjoy being able to give him joint supplements and the benefit of real meat in his diet.  Thank you Dogswell for this great product and thanks to Amazon the good price.

review/summary: Awful advertising - THESE ARE MADE IN CHINA... NOT USA
review/text: My dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in China. Chicken jerkey products from China need to be avoided. I threw out the rest of these as a result.  Stay away and buy something American made.

review/summary: Do not buy this product!
review/text: I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.  That's when the vet told me not to give them to her because they were made in China.  She said dogs have been getting sick from eating jerky treats made in China.  I can't believe I have been poisoning my poor little dog!  I will never buy another food product from CHINA!

review/text: My little Shih Tzu, Honey, can hardly wait to get up each day! Her first order of business is to sit for her Happy Hips chicken breast strips. She gets two every morning and this starts a happy day for her. Buying it direct from Amazon is about 1/3 of what local vendors charge! Wonderful, pure treat!<br />CCW

review/summary: Great product. AMAZING PRICE!
review/text: I have been giving this to my dog every day for about 2 years because he has a patella problem. His limping has completely stopped as a result, not to mention he cries for it! Definitely his favorite treat by far. I was spending more than 1/3 the price at the local pet store for just one pack! I should have checked Amazon sooner! This is an amazing price. I will be buying this here exclusively from now on.

review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE Dogswell products!
review/text: I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa-Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high, runs like a maniac and is spry as a pup. Between this and various other dogswell treats that care for his eyes, hair, coat, breath, teeth, etc, he's going strong which makes momma very happy. All in all, I love these products and recommend them to all my friends who have dogs.

review/summary: Vet says NO
review/text: These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems. She asked, are these the ones made in China?  I said yes, and she said she wouldn't take the chance.  I just threw the last (full) bag into the garbage. Please don't take a chance with your pup!
