review/summary: Unique taste
review/text: I initially bought this thinking that it was like the German hot chocolate pieces. It is in fact chocolate or coca powder. It still a unique product with a unique cocoa taste. So if you need your British hot chocolate fix or have never had Cadbury's Drinking chocolate before then I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Tastes like hot chocolate not like the candy
review/text: Let me just start off by saying when I bought this I didn't know what I was expecting. I LOVE cadburys the candy bars and I drink chocolate milk but I had no idea if this would be anything like the candy bar.<br /><br />I drink nesquick chocolate milk on a daily basis with the powder, in comparison the Cadburys Chocolate powder really tastes like hot chocolate WHICH if you are in the mood for it'd be perfect with some marshmellows but it is nothing like the candy bar.<br /><br />I hope that helps :-)

review/summary: Really incredible product
review/text: As someone from the US, I was hoping Cadbury drinking chocolate would be half as good as their actual chocolate... very pleasantly surprised that it was more than I had hoped for. I saw some reviews about how the drinking chocolate is less sweet than a "hot cocoa," but it's plenty sweet and absolutely delicious! Must-have for any chocolate fan!

review/summary: NOT as Advertised
review/text: This product is NOT drinking chocolate.<br /><br />I realize that a lot of folks out there probably don't care about the distinction, however, COCOA POWDER is not DRINKING CHOCOLATE.  Drinking chocolate refers to a product that is some form of sweet, dark, or milk chocolate, shaved or ground, then added to hot milk and whisked or whipped over heat until the chocolate melts into the milk (or water as the Europeans do).  It is akin to a ganache where chocolate and cream are combined over a double boiler; it literally is drinking liquid chocolate.<br /><br />Cocoa powder is a different product.  Cocoa powder is produced solely from chocolate solids with no cocoa butter added, and although it is a chocolate tasting drink, it is not Drinking Chocolate.<br /><br />The Cadbury product is a fine cocoa powder, however it is MISLABLED and not what people looking for drinking chocolate are interested in.<br /><br />I will keep the product for when I want a glass of chocolate milk.

review/summary: Most tasty fast rice so far
review/text: I so like the flavor and texture of this rice! The texture is remarkable. I think the big plus is that the rice was sprouted before cooking, witch also adds nutritive value over un-sprouted steamed rice. It is so tender but not mushy, with a rich nutty flavor. This takes about a minute to heat and is easily packed for meals away from home.<br /><br /> The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is my sense of frugality. We all know how much less expensive it is to steam one's own rice. Paying $2.45 for about 15 cents worth of rice pushes my guilt buttons. That noted, for those who can afford it, or when it can be justified as a needed convenience, this is a terrific, whole, un-messed-with fast food.<br /><br />I currently justify the expense because easy access to wholesome food is of enough value to pay the balance. How much is good nutrition worth? Skip the fries and chips, zap a bowl of this. Maybe splash on some tamari and add some microwaved fresh mushrooms or zucchini, and you will be eating well and quickly, with minimum fuss.

review/text: I love this product. Cooking a single serving of rice is too much of pain, but with this product, problem solved. A serving of brown rice whenever I want it.<br /><br />Also, since it does not require refrigeration and has a fairly long shelf life its great for taking to the office. I cook it, combine it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Entree, Madras Lentils, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> in a large bowl, nuke for 2 more minutes and I've got a tasty filling low fat high fiber meal for at the office.<br /><br />From a Weight watchers standpoint, the rice and the lentals add up to 10 points total, but its filling enough that I often split it in 1/2 for 2 meals.<br /><br />ALSO, I live across the street from a whole foods, and buying it from Amazon with super saving shipping is a money saving option.

review/summary: GFCF Chick: Annie Chun's Sprouted Brown Sticky Rice
review/text: About one year ago, I underwent some (blood) testing that showed that my digestive system was hyper-sensitive to Gluten and Dairy.  Everything pasta/bread and cheese-like was a main staple of my diet.  To find something that I should be eating, is convenient enough AND tastes good - well...that's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack.<br /><br />My first encounter with Annie Chun's was with their White Sticky Rice.  I ate that for several months and then when Amazon had it on back order (gasp), I took a leap of faith and ordered this.<br /><br />I have always loved rice but brown and/or sprouted rice...not so much.  Now, I prefer it MUCH more over Annie's Sticky White.<br /><br />The Basics (which apply to both products): Very portable, cheaper if you order it on bulk through Amazon than purchase it locally ($3.99 x 6), and microwavable.<br /><br />Why I like this better: It's easier to digest, it isn't as "sticky" as the white version, it has some fiber (white does not), and the minerals - although not a huge part of the overall package - are still a good thing to have in your diet (i.e. iron, Vitamin E, lysine, niacin, amino acids), and when I mix it with whatever (beans, chicken, veggies)...it still has its own, subtle taste.

review/summary: Excellent - fresh, tasty and perfectly steamed
review/text: This is an excellent, convenient, super healthy product. Sprouted grains have tremendous nutrition and digestibility (sprouting activates enzymes which help release and absorb vitamins), enhancing healthy, fiber-rich brown rice even more. I am very satisfied with the quality and taste of this rice - nuke it a minute in the microwave and you have steaming, fresh, perfectly cooked brown rice.<br /><br />The price on Amazon with S&S is great - usually at Whole Foods or another organic store, each box is around $2 - $2.25. Buying in bulk saves here.<br /><br />It would be great for a work lunch, except the portion size is a bit large for me - I usually steam half of it and save the other half in the freezer/fridge. It's perfect for two people- for one, a little much. If they had "mini" portions of this rice, I'd snap it up by the dozen.

review/text: This is my first Annie Chun food experience and I have to say that I'm pleased with this item.<br /><br />I eat rice daily and particularly love Black Japonnica rice, so I didn't expect to love pre-cooked brown rice.  I bought this item as a healthy food choice for those times I'm traveling on the road.  I haven't used this product in that way yet, but I have eaten it at home when I had something I wanted to serve with rice but hadn't had the time to cook my favorite rice that day.<br /><br />It's a bit sticky and even though 6 oz sounds like a lot of rice, it's really just about right for 1 serving if you enjoy rice as much as I do.<br /><br />As for cooking method, I have avoided microwaves for years except for the time or two I cooked this rice that way.  Surprisingly good.  I've also cooked this rice on the stove top with a bit of water and coconut oil which was also good and almost as quick as the microwave.<br /><br />If you're a rice lover like me, I think you'll enjoy the convenience and the taste of this product.

review/summary: Yummy and Great Texture
review/text: I've been eating brown rice for the last couple of years because it's better for my health, but sprouted is even better still. I eat sprouted wheat bread, but I'd never seen rprouted rice before running across Annie Chun's.<br /><br />One thing that I dislike about brown rice is the very chewy texture and apparently that problem is solved by sprouting. The texture is more like white rice and the flavor is fabulous. I ate it the first time with just a little salt and it was the first time I've truly enjoyed brown rice on its own. It's terrific as a light lunch with some soy sauce.<br /><br />It took one minute in my microwave and the serving size is quite generous. With the addition of some veggies or meat, it would make a substantial lunch for me. As a side dish, I think it would serve two well since I don't really believe in serving huge portions of starches, even healthy ones.<br /><br />What was even more impressive is that my 'meat and taters' hubby loved it, too. He puts up with all the whole grain foods I prepare, but he asked me to serve this rice instead of the regular baked brown rice I used to make, which was pretty good.<br /><br />With the sale that's currently on and Subscribe and Save, I got them for 9.60, which is a very good price.

review/summary: this is quite yummy
review/text: I love brown rice, generally speaking. But sometimes buying it prefabbed can mean eating something that hardly seems cooked. This rice, however, has a superb texture that makes is really easy to include brown rice in just about every meal.<br /><br />When you peel the plastic top layer off the bowl, you will see what looks like normal short grained brown rice. Touch the cold rice with a fingertip, and you might think it's going to be another barely-tolerable brown rice experience. But put the little bowl in the microwave for about 90 seconds, and you will experience something entirely different.<br /><br />When I pulled the little bowl out of the microwave and touched the rice with my fork, the fork sank down into the steaming rice, which now had the lovely feel of a dense brown pillow rather than a rock. The rice which had been so hard just seconds before had softened and become incredibly moist.<br /><br />In short, it was absolutely delicious and refreshingly easy to down with a side of rotisserie chicken (my fave pairing, especially if I have some steamed broccoli to go with it). Yummy!<br /><br />The rice remains a bit sticky, so using chopsticks won't be tough.<br /><br />My suggestions:  use this rice as a side for a meal higher in protein and veggies, like tofu and broccoli or chicken and cauliflower or. . .you pick the combo! Shrimp, broccoli, snow peas! Yeah!<br /><br />My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  the serving is too daggum small! I try to console myself with the fact that I'll be eating fewer carbs, but dang--them's tiny bowls!<br /><br />Oh, well. Consider that Ms. Chun's attempt to  help us low-carb our diets. :-)

review/summary: Yuuummmmmmyyyyy Treat
review/text: My 3 Westies will do anything for a these treats - they absolutely love these snouts!!  Since the snouts are pretty big, my husband cuts them in half with a tree limb cutter.  I use them as reward for good behavior or as treat after a nail clipping session which is their most hated thing in the universe.  I can get instant forgiveness with a snout offering.  I like giving them this treat because: 1). helps clean their teeth, and massage their gums, 2). they are baked so are not loaded with fat, 3). they are lightly smoked so that it doesn't stain their little faces, and  4). most importantly, they are made by an American company.  This gives me assurance that this product is made under sanitary conditions and that no harmful chemicals are used in the processing of the pig parts.  After the China pet scare, I am careful not to give my Westies pet food/treats not made in the U.S.

review/text: Having read reviews on general Pig Snouts for dogs, I thought we would try these  out since they aren't as expensive as some others. Both my dogs seemed to love them. I could have sworn I had read somewhere that they would last hours. They didn't look like a strong chew when they arrived but I was open minded. Unfortunately, my 6 month old large breed puppy gobbled it up in 1o minutes. Oh well. They will be a nice treat for special occasions but not long lasting.<br /><br />Also mine weren't individually wrapped unlike like another reviewer on here.

review/summary: Ask our Dogs
review/text: Pepper and Nikki asked me to let you know how much we really enjoy munching on these gems.  They would do it themselves except their paws keep getting tangled in the keyboard.  People are asked often to rate dog products without any knowledge of the dogs' feelings about the food.  We eat these as our daily reward and are just delighted with the taste.  While they may be a little pricey they are fantastic.  We can spend the better part of a day munching on one off and on.  The best part of this pack is the size.  If you are not sure of your dogs appetite and taste you might consider the 6-pack so that in case your dogs are as picky as we are (we are Yorkies and you might know that we are really picky) and they do not like them you have not spent an arm and leg.  If your dogs do not like them just send them here and these honyocks will gobble them mui pronto.  Hope my ramblings were not too awful but you know that dogs are not to hep on this writing stuff.

review/summary: Piggy Snouts - Not as Tasty as Some
review/text: My dog likes these pig snouts.  They are huge.  And one of them will last him several days.  They say they are smoked, but apparently it is a "light" smoke.  I've found other smoked pig snouts that are a deep color and they have a "strong" smokey smell.  Bandit really loves these extra smokey ones so they only last about 20 minutes.  The extra smokey ones are smaller but much lower in price.  So Bandit says, "I want some of both."

review/summary: Superb coffee at a great price!
review/text: I have been using Starbucks Espresso coffee beans for the last few years and could never drink anything else (got addicted to it!). I took a chance on this coffee and boy, am I glad I did!<br /><br />We use a cheapo (but great) Capresso <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVXCI">Capresso 303.01 4-Cup Espresso and Cappuccino Machine</a> machine for coffee and one caveat with this coffee is that you need to use the right amount of water depending on your taste. It produces strong coffee at the beginning and gets a little watery towards the end of the cycle (this is normal for most coffees but more pronounced with this coffee).<br />Resulting espresso is quite strong, smooth taste (not too bitter), medium acidity and great flavor! For me this coffee tastes better than the one I used before and so I am hooked on this coffee now!<br /><br />While India produces good coffee, you don't get to see Indian coffee in the US (partly because it is not exported much? and the shipping costs are more? don't know). This is the first time I got to see Indian coffee and I like it!<br /><br />While I am giving 5 stars for the coffee, should only give 3 stars for the shipping - Amazon is using Ontrac for shipping this and for whatever reason, they couldn't deliver on time and the package got delayed by 3 days.

review/summary: Amazon vs Coffee Bean Direct (directly!)
review/text: We've been drinking Monsooned Malabar coffee from Coffee Bean Direct for about four years, first ordering 5 pounds monthly from the roaster and about a year ago switching the order to Amazon's subscription service. We've been disappointed with the decreasing quality of flavor and freshness of the coffee, not knowing whether it might be due to a greater delay from roasting to delivery or the manner in which Amazon stores it.<br /><br />To check our perceptions, we again ordered directly from the roaster, Coffee Bean Direct, and found its coffee to have the flavor of Monsooned Malabar we originally enjoyed. But it comes at a cost. With the higher price of the coffee itself plus shipping charges, we paid significantly more ($46.25 compared to $33.81 for the Amazon subscription).<br /><br />We're disappointed with the product we've gotten through Amazon lately, puzzled by the decline in quality, and debating how to proceed.

review/summary: Very smooth and great for blending
review/text: We discovered Indian Monsooned Malabar coffee while on a trip this past fall in Colorado.  A local roaster in the small town we visited produced the coffee and it was for sale at several local businesses.  We really liked it and have ordered this coffee online since returning home.  The other premium coffee bean sources are a bit expensive and, when the shipping is included, it makes for a pretty costly morning brew.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans from Amazon seemed to be a viable alternative and the shipping is free.<br /><br />I admit the beans were a bit of a disappointment at first.  The beans we had used previously were darker roasted and very oily.  The CBD beans are a lighter roast with only a bit of surface oil.  Upon grinding, the beans did not have the pungent aroma we were used to.  Brewing a pot showed the first impressions were pretty correct.  While the IMM flavor is there, it is very subtle, not as full-bodied as we remembered.  In fact, using our standard amount of ground coffee to water results the taste being somewaht thin.  I would call it Indian Monsooned Malabar Lite.  But, in full disclosure, both my wife and I like our coffee stronger than most of our friends.<br /><br />Since we mostly mix decaf and regular coffee (so we can drink more and shake less!), I tried the Monsooned Malabar mixed with CBD's own Dark Decaf Sumatra beans.  This is a most satisfactory blend since both coffees are very smooth and low in acid with the darker Sumatra roast adding a little more body and the IMM adding a subtle nuttiness.  I think someone who is more experienced in blending coffee beans than I am could come up with a truly great brew.<br /><br />On the whole, I like this coffee but it's not as flavorful as I've had from other Indian Monsooned Malabar.  Easily 4 stars, especially considering the bargain price.

review/text: This has to be one of the worst whole coffee beans I've ordered.  I don't think it was due to coffee bean direct or that the beans were old.  I actually believe them to be pretty freshly roasted.  The coffee bean itself I think was subpar to begin with.  It was like someone took all of the beautiful aromatic notes out of the coffee and left me with an old balsam like note (Kind of like the smell of a cheap cigar).  The taste was bearable once I put some chicory in, but without it I didn't want to drink it.<br />If you want to buy 5lbs of coffee please stick with one you can trust.  A sumatra, columbian, or even costa rica blend would be better than this.

review/text: Excellent marinade.  Shipping changes are over the top.  I wouldn't order it again on line unless I could find free or at least less expensive shipping.  Sometimes the shipping becomes more expensive then the actual product.  You can ask in your local supermarket for it to be ordered for the store.

review/text: This sauce/marinade is superior to others out there; it just has the perfect taste!  I tried an Iron Chef sauce that is supposed to be comparable, but it was too citrusy.  I really like to marinade salmon in this sauce for 20 minutes and that grill it on the BBQ.  It is so delicious!  I'm so glad that Amazon sells it because the Costco where I live no longer carries it.

review/text: I was introduced to Yoshida's Sauce on a camping trip when a friend used it to make meatballs.  She herself had gotten it from a warehouse store where they had been giving out food samples.  I can see why she was hooked.<br /><br />In its most basic form, this is soy sauce sweetened with syrup and it's delicious -- just the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  I love the versatility.  It tastes great on beef, fish, pork, chicken, and shrimp.  I've used it on the grill, in the oven, in a slow cooker, in a pot.  When all is said and done, you'd think I'd slaved all day.  Great stuff.  I keep a bottle in my fridge handy as a staple for whenever the mood strikes.

review/summary: Killer chicken and salmon every time
review/text: I used to buy this great sauce at Costco but don't have one close by any more, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. It does a brilliant job on slab salmon fillets, whether you use it as a pre- marinade (a half hour before you cook) or a cooking sauce. You don't need to use too much, either. Marinate skinless boneless chicken breasts for a few hours and grill, pan-fry (non-stick pan) partially covered, or oven bake. Fantastic taste, juicy, and gets better in the fridge!! The taste is very slightly Asian, but not unfriendly to any other food tastes you want to pair it with.

review/text: I use this for chicken, beef and venison. I love to add it into any Chinese food we are having and the kids pour this out as dipping sauce for all kinds of foods. I have one child who is so picky I can hardly get her to eat anything.  But when I picked this up at Sam's club a few years ago, it worked so well to get her to eat meat that I went and bought four more. A year later I went back to Sam's and they no longer stocked it. I was so disappointed. Then on a whim I put it into the search engine on Amazon and there it is. I only wish that my local grocery store would carry it so that I wouldn't have to wait for it to be delivered. Also, it is not a Prime product so that the savings you realize are put right back into the shipping. But that is an Amazon issue, and does not detract from the value of this product.

review/text: Mr. Yoshida's Original Gourmet Sweet and Savory Marinade and Cooking Sauce -Wow, what a long name, but is is highly descriptive of a truly marvelous product.  You can cook meatballs in this and they are amazing.  Using it as a marinade gives meats a unique asian slant with some sweetness added that will really "kick it up a notch".  It is especially good on pork tenderloins.<br />We make chicken yakitori by marinading skinless, boneless chicken thighs in Yoshida's Sauce overnight, then cooking them on the barbeque grill.<br />Serve them with a little fried rice and some stir-fried veggies, and just before serving, pour a little extra warmed sauce over the veggies and rice.  That is so good you will slap your Mama!
