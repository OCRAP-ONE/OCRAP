review/summary: Not As Good As Starbucks, But Better Price
review/text: I bought this item for an occasional treat but still have to find the right setting use to make it have that perfect flavor. The largest "Travel Mug" setting leaves the coffee too weak and the smallest "coffee cup" setting is too much and even the middle size isn't "just right" and sort of tastes like a "lite" cappaccino. I never thought I was hard to please but it seems like this has proven me wrong.<br />The price is pretty good so I can't complain on that note, but I guess I'm going to continue to drink this item and let it grow on me. As a now-and-then cup of cappaccino it's ok.<br />The 4 star rating is for the price and convenience of not traveling miles to get a cappaccino.

review/summary: Good Flavor, not real coffee
review/text: It is a great tasting "coffee" but in fact it is more akin to a hot chocolate than a coffee.  The flavor is coffee (not chocolate-y), but  I noticed it didn't give me the pep as my other Kcups, so I decided to open one of the Cappuccino Kcups and noticed that (unlike my coffee Kcups) this was only a powdery mix - NOT ground coffee placed over a filter - the standard innards.  If you are ok with the idea that this is a coffee equivalent of a hot chocolate powder mix, then this is a great tasting buy, with less pep than coffee.

review/text: First, it's not coffee. It's an instant powdered mix, which is completely disappointing. I was expecting flavored coffee, not instant mix in a small container. Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is "Instant Coffee".<br /><br />I would never buy this product again.  It smells wonderful, but tastes like what it is, and that's simply not good for someone looking for a cup of coffee.

review/text: I love this French Vanilla cappuccino!  It is exactly what I was looking for to make in my Keurig.  You see, I am NOT a coffee drinker so I am always on the look out for tea or other speacialty drinks to make in my Keurig.  This would be similar to the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha and Chai Latte.  It is a mix that fully emties when you run it through the Keuirg.  A word of warning to the die hard coffee drinkers...this is not your Starbucks cappuccino.  It's more like your gas station cappuccino, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Great taste even on the largest cup setting on the Keurig platinum.  My new favorite morning pleasure.

review/summary: Gas station coffee dispenser garbage
review/text: This stuff tastes like the "coffee" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s.  The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino.  That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste.  I took 2 sips about 45 min ago, and still can't get the taste out of my mouth.  Definitely avoid.

review/summary: Really good for what it is
review/text: This was very different from what I originally expected it to be.  That being said, I found this to be probably the best k-cup I have ever had.  It is very creamy and has a great hazelnut flavor.  I enjoy a cappucino once in a while and I love hazelnut coffee.  I expected this to be more of  cappucino with a light hazelnut flavor.  That was not the case.  This is like a creamy coffee/hazelnut flavored hot cocoa without the cocoa.  I was expecting something completely different but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  This is a great after dinner or mid day pick-me-up and this will now hold a permanent row or two in my revolving k-cup counter top display. If you want a real cappucino, this isn't for you.  If you want a great tasting hot liquid sweet snack, get this.  I liked this so much, I will be ordering the French vanilla version to give that a try as soon as I complete this review. Also, you cant beat the price....less than $10 delivered to my door.  Wooooo Hooooo!

review/text: So I thought these were just regular cappuccino cups, when I got them, I saw the Hazelnut and thought oh boy....much to my surprise, they're very tasty!  I've always been a hazelnut fan, but wow!  They're very creamy and flavorful.  So this will be a re-order when I need to re-stock on my cups, very pleased!!

review/summary: Husband Loves it!
review/text: My husband is particular about his coffee.  This has a good flavor and he loves it.  It's definitely not traditional coffee though.  This is instant and is like the cappuccino you get out of the machines at gas station rest-stops.  As long as you're not expecting real coffee, it's great!

review/summary: It taste ok!
review/text: I love cappucchino & carmel. After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and buy this. The only thing I wish I had done was buy a smaller box. It doesn't taste bad but it isn't so DELISH that I would be running back for more. I am not a real coffee drinker and before Mcdonalds switched over to the stronger mud tasting cap I LOVED theirs so I thought this would taste like it. It is not real sweet (as other reviewers have indicated). I didn't add anything to it but I will have to doctor it up in order to drink all three boxes. I did not taste any aftertaste either. For me it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that GOOD either. It was just ok. I would be willing to try a sample of the French Vanilla. It might taste better.

review/text: When I first got my kcup maker i went to walmart and found these kcups,For those who like a really nice creamy cappuccino hazelnut this is delicious. I would not recommend their reg coffee, but the hazel nut cappuccino is the best on the market nothing to add just make and enjoy but i recommend not to use more then 6oz.serving size to get the best flavor, using a larger amount will weaken the flavor very important!they also have vanilla cappuccino and carmel cappuccino which are both very good also.

It was a cool day & when I got back to the car, my coffee was cold. I picked it up & took a sip, I was pleasantly surprise at the creamy cold taste, it was fabulous.  So now I drink it cold & hot. Very satisfied with the taste & creamines. So glad I tried it.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Sylvia Lorenzano

review/text: I have been very happy with the Grove Square K-Cup products.  I really like the creamy Cappuccino French Vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla is great when you want a coffee that's creamy with a light flavor.  Great Price, cost less then other K-Cups which is also a great selling point!  I also like Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, and think the Grove Square Medium Roast is okay (it is an instant coffee, so it's lighter in flavor but still good).

review/summary: Fantastic coffee
review/text: This is my new favorite coffee.  I have tried over 20 different k-Cup brands and flavors and this one beats them all.  It comes out of the coffee machine looking like chocolate milk and has a very great French Vanilla flavor.  I would highly recommend this flavor.

review/summary: Great Deal
review/text: I really like this product and at such a low price. I am happy anytime I can buy k-cups for 50 cents or less per cup. Has good flavor and my only complaint would be if you use the biggest cup setting it's a little too weak so I use the middle setting.

review/summary: Great deal for a cappuccino
review/text: I make these on the small cup setting and they are yummy, but not a suitable replacement for a good cup of coffee.  I bought them for my 11 year old daughter and they work perfectly because you don't need to add any sugar or cream.

review/summary: Like but Not Love
review/text: Don't get me wrong, this is a good coffee. Only reason for the 4 stars; I am partial to the Hazelnut Cappuccino. We all have different tastes, you may love it, so I recommend you try it. Good pricing, worth a try. Remember, it you don't like it, I believe you can return it.

review/text: These are not sold on Keurig website and this is the only place I will buy them, due to good pricing. Another coffee that gives me the caffeine I need PLUS it's so, so tasty. Like having dessert ... wonderful and delicious! Yes, redundant, but it's that good! Give it a try.

review/summary: Mmm
review/text: This is the 2 nd time I've ordered this flavor. I love the taste of it. But if u want it sweeter put a little sugar (I use Truvia) & I also put one Carmel Macchiato single creamer. Don't forget to use the 6-8oz setting

review/summary: way too sweet by itself.  but makes a good mixer
review/text: way too sweet by itself.<br /><br />however this and a bold coffee makes a pretty good mix.  just do 5oz of this then replace, and do a 5oz of a bold coffee of your choice in the same cup.  then stir.

review/text: Wow, these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go. They don't require cream and sweetener so just brew and go! The only thing I would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free. They do taste yummy though and for the price, you can go wrong!

review/text: I thought Gloria Jean's cappuccino was good--but Grove Square cappuccino is much better!  It is smoother and creamier--and it costs less.  I'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Carame Cappuccino for Keurig
review/text: Nice price, fast shipping. A Keurig machine is not necessary to brew. I found the product to be very sweet so I add it to 12 ounces of hot water rather than the 8 ounces in the directions.

review/text: I bought this coffee after reading multiple reviews that it was just like gas station cappuccino (which I LOVE). Turns out it really is! It has that sweet creamy vanilla taste that requires absolutely no creamers or sugar!I am so pleased that I don't have to go to my local gas station to enjoy this sweet treat anymore!

review/summary: Pretty Good if You Like Cappuccino
review/text: I must admit up front that I don't really drink cappuccino. I'm a fan of stronger, black coffees and espressos. I purchased this for other family members and friends who visit. That said, I did taste it and it tastes, well, like cappuccino: ceamy, light, sweet. Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.

review/summary: YUMMY!!!!
review/text: I'm a vanilla coffee-aholic, and I love this product!!!  I usually use the medium or large setting on my Keurig for one cup, or one of each when I fill my thermos.  What I love about this product is that I don't have to add any additional creamer or milk or sugar, it's just perfect!
