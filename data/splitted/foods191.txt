review/text: I snack on these all the time.  It's hard to find dried fruit that is organic and doesn't have added sugar.  It's also tough to find healthy things that are crunchy and this is.

review/summary: Delightful Apple Cinnamon Treat!
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are sweet, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are very sweet and taste especially delicious because of the added organic cinnamon.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: If you are looking for a fairly healthy snack, these are a good bet. They are quite tasty and crunchy not to mention pretty good for you as well. I removed one star only based on the fact that they are quite expensive but if you are willing to pay for them, you do get what you pay for. Will be re-ordering more.

review/summary: apple crumbs?
review/text: After purchasing a few bags and receiving just crumbs, I wrote to the company.  No offer to replace, no refund and most important not even a thank you for taking the time to let them know; just that they will try and fix the problem.  I am sure the flavor is quite good but they were literally just smashed crumbs. And expensive crumbs at that.  In this economy, I tend to stay away from people/companies that don't stand behind their product.

review/summary: Great Healthy Snack
review/text: I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents.

It's a quick healthy snack and the price is just right, the price is even better if you sign up for subscribe and save!  I also enjoy having a package on my doorstep which reminds me I didn't have to go to the grocery store and it's fun to have tasty treats inside the package!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Unevenly Seasoned.
review/text: I wanted to like these because they come in bigger bags than Brothers and Sensible.  But the product is so inconsistent, even within the same bag.  Many of the apple pieces are chewy and some have no cinnamon flavour while other pieces are overpowered by it.  I don't appreciate the toughness of those of the pieces because since theyre already dry by nature, they have a tendency of sticking to one's teeth.  Some even taste stale.  Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of scraps of peel (in this way it reminds me of pig slop).  I don't know if it's the season or what, but these apples are very sour.  I begin to notice after eating 1/3 of a bag.  I bought this because it promised "crunch."  At best, this is a lackluster characteristic of the Bare Fruit CInnamon Apples.

review/text: This is my new favorite tea.  I give it a HIGH rating.  I still prefer black tea (which this is), but I like the infused mango flavor - just the right amount - not overwhelming.  The hint of vanilla is a perfect addition; very mild.<br /><br />I participated in a coffee/tea exchange and selected this with a beautiful tall mug.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered this case.  I'm giving a few boxes to friends to enjoy, taking a box to the office for my afternoon "break" (to avoid my breaking), and savoring the rest.<br /><br />I appreciate the aroma, like a good wine; and I find that sipping it relaxes me!

review/text: I became addicted to this tea when the student run coffee shop chain started carrying it, and I being a lover of mango ordered this tea. It smells like vanilla, kicks like a black tea, and tastes like sweet ambrosia of the gods. It's not super fruity, but it's wonderfully complex for a tea. If you want something that tastes more mango, go with a straight fruit tea, or a white tea with mango, but for those of us that need a steady drip of C8H10N4O2, this is one of the most pleasant ways to consume it I've ever tasted.

review/summary: Delicious tea when I want a change from Barry's Gold
review/text: I'm not usually a drinker of flavored tea, in fact this is the only one I really drink.  I bought this Mango Ceylon tea several years ago at my local nature food store on a whim and I fell in love with it...(and so did my kids).  Since then the store told me that the flavor was discontinued, but I believe it was only discontinued by their supplier, not the manufacturer (thank goodness!).  I have bought this tea from other online retailers, but this 6 box package was the cheapest I could find this time around.  I'm glad its still available.  It's not overly fruity and the vanilla is a nice touch.<br /><br />For your regular tea drinking I urge you to try Barry's tea from Ireland, the one in the red box (Barry's Gold) I believe is the best.<br /><br />Enjoy your cuppa!

review/text: I should have known when I saw corn syrup as the first ingredient.  This is glorified jelly.  I hoped there would be more whole raspberries or at least pieces in the filling but could not find many (if any) in two cans.  Admittedly, I purchased this to use as a topping for cottage cheese instead of baked goods.  It is terrible in that capacity.  I prefer Comstock pie fillings, which have actual fruit instead of a bunch of congealed syrup.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found I enjoyed this very much as a topping for greek yogurt.  It is still too high in sugar to enjoy regularly though.

review/text: This mole is definately better than Dona Maria.  I find that the flavors of Dona Maria are not well balanced, too spicy, too much dark cocoa, etc.. Rogelio Bueno on the other hand has several notes of cinnamon and clove as well as a lighter cocoa that pairs well with Chicken and Pork.  Adding a pinch of sugar gives it just a bit more sweetness which balances the spicy/smokiness of the sauce.  When I use this mole, I often serve extra sauce, whereas with Dona Maria, people clearly don't think the sauce is anything special.<br /><br />Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth is the way to go.  Approx 1 1/2 - 2 14 oz. cans is a good amount.  Extra salt is not necesary.

review/text: Very salty to my taste, but this is readily available in the grocery store and seems to be the best bet if you don't hit a market serving the Hispanic population. I never know what the do with the glassware after using up the mole. It's too small for a drinking glass (at least in my household) so some have been used for sorting small screws and nuts, and others for watercolor painting.

review/text: The omnipresent Dona Maria mole has a stronger cocoa flavor but I like this one better.  I boil a chicken and use the broth to thin the sauce.  I char 3 flour tortillas on my stove and make crumbs that add a smokey taste to the sauce. I also puree a 28 ounce can of tomatoes and add to the sauce.  Learned from my neighbor who was raised in Mexico. Bone the chicken and add to the sauce.  Serve over rice or wrap in warm tortillas.  Would buy again over the Dona Maria brand if it becomes available.

review/summary: Crispy and Yum Yum Yum
review/text: When I was a kid, Shake and Bake Chicken used to be one of my favorite "treat" meals.  Now with kids of my own, I decided to make Shake and Bake for my kids to try too.  The response was as good as I remember that I had - it's crispy and delicious!  Shake and Bake is really easy to make: simply put the Shake and Bake in a plastic bag, wet your chicken a little and toss in and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!  Bake it for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees and you'll end up with some crispy "almost like fried" chicken.  The flavor isn't too salty, and leans more on the mild side.  If you like it a little spicier, rub on a little tabasco before coating the chicken.<br /><br />This version of Shake and Bake doesn't come with the shaker bag included.  You will need to either 1) have a ziploc bag to put the chicken in, or you can just put the S&B in a pie dish (or other shallow dish) and coat it that way.  We don't like using too many bags, so we just used a large bowl and tossed the chicken around until coated.<br /><br />For people who are having problems with getting soggy bottoms on your chicken, an easy way to keep that from happening is to crumple up the foil and put the chicken on top.  This creates some air pockets under the chicken so that less of it is sitting on the foil.  If you're using chicken wings, you won't even have to crumple the foil because most of the chicken is off the pan.  You can also use a wire rack to make the whole chicken crispy.  Each pack can coat about 6 pieces (we did 2 each of wings, thighs, and drumsticks and had a little left over in the bowl).

review/text: I used to love Shake N Bake when I was a kid. I also remember my mother not caring for it. Now I see why after trying it for the first time in years. There are pros & cons. It doesn't taste bad, but it's very bland to me. I just feel like it needs a little something extra. The pro side is that it is extremely fast & easy, just wet the chicken, throw it in a ziploc bag with the packet contents & shake it up. Once in the oven it bakes up nicely with a crispy exterior & keeps the chicken moist. I just wish it had more flavor. As for shipping, you get a clear plastic bag with 12 pouches inside. Someone else mentioned using this to flavor dishes, I could definitely see this as a crispy topping on baked mac & cheese.

review/text: I missed Shake 'n' Bake.  I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid.  It was so easy, except I was surprised by one thing: it didn't come with a bag.  It is just a packet of seasoning - I thought I remembered this coming with a bag.  No big deal, I always have spare Ziploc bags on hand, and I didn't even use one for this.  I simply poured the seasoning on a plate and dipped the raw chicken onto it, and it covered very well.  I didn't need to coat the chicken in egg or water or anything, the seasoning stuck very well.<br /><br />As for taste, it was very good.  Interestingly, it tasted slightly similar to Old Bay, so I tried it on some Tilapia and that was good, too!

review/summary: Quick and Easy Meal
review/text: Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is very easy to use. You can use it on 6 - 8 pieces of chicken, either bone-in or boneless. You simply moisten each piece of chicken, put the coating mix in a bag, put the chicken in the bag (one or two pieces at a time), and shake the bag until the coating mix covers each piece of chicken. Once that is done you put the chicken in an ungreased baking pan, heat the oven to 400 degrees, and cook for either 45 minutes (bone-in) or 20 minutes (boneless). You just stick it in the oven - no need to turn the chicken during cooking - and forget about it until it is done.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating makes for a quick easy meal to prepare that tastes good. I have to confess that I'm not a particularly good cook and I don't have the patience to fix fancy meals but even I can't mess up when using Shake `N Bake. It is very easy to coat the chicken (although if you have large pieces of chicken you may run out of mixture) and it only takes a matter of seconds to rinse the chicken, coat it, and put it in the oven. You can use it on either bone-in chicken or boneless (for a quicker meal) and while both taste equally good, I prefer to use it on bone-in chicken. It tastes good (sort of like fried chicken) although a bit greasy. The pan can be a bit messy after cooking but it is still an easy cleanup.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is great when you need to fix a quick easy meal.

If I try this I'll let you know if it works) and a lovely moist interior<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars was one thing...I personally don't really care for celery as a seasoning and it's very strong in this packet.  For me at least that's not a great thing :(<br /><br />Another great use is just to use it as a general seasoning...works in rice and my boyfriend's "veggie burgers" (made of oatmeal and onions)...gives a really nice flavor this way too.

review/summary: Who doesn't like Shake 'N Bake!
review/text: Shake 'N Bake has been a part of my life for years.  I can remember doing chicken breasts and pork chops with my mom many years back.  It is fun and easy, and makes plain old meat more fun.  Now my son is my "shaker" and he now loves it like I did.  That being said, let me tell you that it will never look like it does on the front of the package.  The coating is never as thick as in the picture.  What you get is a nice thin coating.<br /><br />This particular style of Shake 'N Bake comes in a pouch so it is missing the plastic bag that you get when you buy it the old fashioned way.  It is not difficult using a Glad or Ziplock brand bag to do your shaking.  This is a nice way to change up your usual grilled or sauteed chicken.  Give it a little shake, bake it in the oven, and enjoy!

review/summary: Shake n Bake
review/text: I usually pan sear chicken and then throw it in the oven.  Adding spices before I put the chicken on the pan and during the process allows for a good amount of opportunity to make the chicken to my liking.  With this product, you place a clean, washed piece of chicken in a zip lock bag, and shake it with the ingredients found in this Shake n Bake pouch.  Problem here is it's hard to get a full, even coating around the chicken and just putting it into the oven means you're missing out on some of what you'll get if you are used to a different preparation.  Now, overall this isn't a bad product just a limited one that you can use if you're running low on time in terms of preparation.  Seasoning wise, it's at times hit or miss, you'll get some taste in there but it again depends on how you like to prepare your chicken and with what flavors.

It is crunchy and tasty, but not full of pizzazz - it is a bit bland, but sticks around in the same nostalgic way that Twinkies, Hamburger Helper, Ketchup, and Jell-o do ... these products will never die, but I highly doubt they will ever again enjoy the glory days they once had.

review/text: I don't have any real "issues" with this product.  The small packages are fine for a small batch, which of course is the reason for these small envelopes instead of a large can.  Sometimes you'll open a large can and if you don't use it, then it becomes "stale".  But on the other hand, bread crumbs can be a lot less expensive.  Also, if you want to spice-it-up, then try adding a little extra seasoning. . . . For example, a little cayenne pepper or hot pepper flakes.  Perhaps a bit of Mrs. Dash.  How about a touch of garlic powder.  You might also try jerk seasoning. . . Cajon seasoning. .  .or other dry seasoning blend.

review/summary: couldn't be any easier
review/text: Sure you could bread your chicken with flour, egg and breadcrumbs and get basically the same result.  But then you have 3 dishes to wash all that glop off of.  With Shake 'N Bake all the mess stays within the plastic bag.  Simply wet down your chicken, toss it in the bag with the mix and bake it.  I found some of the coating peeled off when I turned my chicken half way through cooking, so I just patted on some more of the mix to fill in the holes.  The chicken was tasty and moist with very little effort and zero mess.  The mix adds 40 calories and only 1 fat gram per piece of chicken which is probably no more than the traditional egg method.  Super quick way to throw together a tasty home cooked dinner the whole family will love.  I plan to try the coating out on some cod since Vine was kind enough to send me a full 12 package order :)<br />UPDATE:  The cod was yummy!  Didn't stick quite a well as on the chicken, but the flavor was perfectly compatible with fish.

review/text: I had never used Shake 'N' Bake before trying this out. It's incredibly simple, and it bakes up nicely with a crunchy exterior. The flavor, though, isn't the best. I normally use flour and a mix of spices as a coating for chicken, and that tastes better (and is cheaper) than buying Shake 'N' Bake. I did find a great use for the Shake 'N' Bake, though--I coated wedged potatoes with it, then drizzled them with olive oil and baked them for about an hour at 375 degrees. Delicious! (I don't know why it tasted so much better on the potatoes than on the chicken, but it did.) The Shake 'N' Bake comes in a pack of 12, and I'll be using the remaining packs to make more oven baked potato wedges.

review/text: I had never tried any sort of shake n bake product before this. But i regularly bake or fry chicken with breadcrumbs, so i wanted to try this out.<br />There was almost no difference as far as i could tell in the taste. Only difference is that shake n bake coating is somewhat more saltier.<br />Also the breadcrumbs work well both frying and baking chicken. Shake n bake coating works if you fry as well but sometimes comes off. So for those who use breadcrumbs i would say stick(no pun intended) to them as there is virtually no taste difference and is multi-purpose.

It works wonders with chicken & pork, keeping it moist and providing a slight crunch with just the right amount of flavor to keep things interesting, but not overpower the flavor of the meat. It's also a tasty addition to meatloaf, or as a topping for casseroles. Sure, it's a little more expensive than just buying bread crumbs, but in my opinion it's worth it. Good stuff!

review/summary: Quick and Easy
review/text: Admittedly I normally would only use breading or flour for my chicken, but that gets messy (what with the eggs and frying and such) and during the summer I had a handful more mouths to feed with my siblings inviting their friends over to eat every other night.  So for me Shake 'n' Bake, which I haven't had since I was at least 10 years old, was the perfect solution.<br /><br />I do however caution that while this worked perfectly well with the full sized chicken breasts, everyone seemed to prefer it more when the chicken was pounded thin.  The chicken came out juicier and less dry and the coating wasn't overwhelmingly salty.<br /><br />As a test group I had three 20somethings (not including myself) and two teens, and made the Shake 'n' Bake with both regular sized breasts and thin cutlets.  Excluding the time it took for me to butterfly the chicken breasts, it took maybe ten minutes total to coat the chicken to our liking and pop it in the oven.  The packaging says to cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes at 425, but I found that cooking it for 20 minutes, and letting it rest for an additional 5 minutes, worked out perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint received was the saltiness, I didn't season the chicken beforehand (for obvious reasons) and pretty much everyone had assumed I did because the coating was salty.  Point of interest, my sister made a Honey Dijon mustard sauce to dip the chicken into and the coating worked perfectly with that, balancing out some of the sweetness of the honey Dijon.

review/text: Wow. I had this long, terribly witty review that I was about to post about this Shake N Bake stuff, and then my son interrupted me to ask for seconds. Now, dinner has been over for at least an hour, and he wanted seconds! Not popcorn. Not candy. Not a trip to get ice cream. He wanted more of the chicken I made tonight.<br /><br />Before anyone jumps on me, let me say this: I'm old enough to remember when the Shake N Bake commercial involved a child bragging about "I helped!" Yes, it really IS that simple that a child can help make it, or even make it on their own. And, no, we don't take our kid out to buy snacks after dinner very often, although occasionally we do take a trip for a family ice cream run. (C'mon, it's ICE CREAM!)<br /><br />But, as a budget-conscious Mom, I have to admit that I get very tired of finding ways to make boneless, skinless chicken breasts interesting. This? Wow! I remember now why, as a kid, we looked forward to pork chop night: because my mom was using Shake N Bake. (Seriously, it was only one of three dinners she made well.)<br /><br />I love, love, love how easy this is to make. (Hello? We're in a heat wave here in the Midwest. This took 3 minutes of effort and, WOW!, I was out of the kitchen.) And, having tried a number of "baked fried chicken breast" recipes? Wow, again. This was AWESOME. I'd cut our chicken breasts into 3 oz servings, pressed them down with the palm of my hand, and expected to get something tough but at least low calorie. How wrong I was.<br /><br />Bottom line: stop searching for 'oven baked fried chicken'. Start using this. Amazing, yummy, wonderful stuff. And, because I grew up eating it with pork chops when I was a kid, this is a GREAT comfort food for me!

review/summary: Don't understand this product
review/text: If I were going to make breaded chicken my first thought would be to use generic breadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake does have a few pros - it's finely ground so it sticks to every surface of the chicken, and it does leave the chicken moist.  However, it's more expensive than generic breadcrumbs and is less flavorful.  The whole shake and bake concept could also be used with breadcrumbs... I am a little baffled as to why anyone would spend the extra money for Shake N Bake.

review/summary: quick and tastes pretty good...
review/text: My mom never made this but my husband had fond memories....  so we decided to try it.  It is quick and easy and tastes pretty good (though it might benefit from some added cayenne).  However, I think it works best with skin-on chicken.  I don't think it will stick to skinless - but I guess I could try dipping chicken in egg first.

review/summary: better then I remembered
review/text: I admit it's been years since I've had chicken cooked with Shake 'n Bake. I remember my mom using it back when you'd put it in a little plastic bag and shake it. So when I saw this I just had to try it. When my wife saw what we got in the mail(12 pouches 2.05 oz) she laughed, I didn't even know they still made this, she said. Well, we had it for dinner the next night. Easy to use and it creates a delicious coating on the chicken. Moist, tasty, it was just right! Highly recommended. I'd get it again.

review/summary: "Fresh Mixers" to "Lunch Express" Not Good For Consumers
review/text: Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.

review/summary: Easy cooking, sub-par taste, interspersed plus and minuses
review/text: I purchased a bunch of easy and quick microwave meals that I could take with me to work for lunch without the need for a refrigerator. This appeared to fit the bill, so I bought a six-pack!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy cooking - Very easy to cook, finished in under four minutes, and requires no additional materials (except about a cup of water).<br />2) healthy - is fairly healthy (all things considered).<br />3) Contains meat - this is a debatable pro, however I've found it difficult to actually find microwave meals (that require no refrigerator/freezer) that contain meat. This does, although not very much...<br />4) Acceptable serving size - given that the base of the dish is rice, the serving size is acceptable for a light lunch. I certainly feel full for most of the afternoon if I eat this meal with an extra snack during my lunch hour.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) low-average flavor/taste - I've definitely had better microwave meals (even microwave easy mac beats this). I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute-rice. I will not be re-purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor.<br />2) Uneven rice texture - The base of this dish is quick-cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture.<br />3) Very sparse serving of veggies/meat - despite the fact that this meal contains veggies/meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken/veggies.<br /><br />All-in-all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no-fridge/to-go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much. I won't be purchasing again.

The rice is light and provides a good base for the sauce and chicken.  The sauce is not too sweet, nor too sour and has chicken and veggies already mixed in.<br /><br />The only con would be the excessive amount of packaging, but I don't know how else they could make a kit that allows for cooking two separate components.

review/summary: Quick microwave meal
review/text: Not quite as good as Chinese takeout, but it has the convenience that you can keep it in a desk drawer if you have a microwave at work.  It is a two step process to prepare, so it takes a few minutes.  The rice comes out better than in some microwave meals because it is prepared separately.  The flavor is OK.  The small chunks of chicken look like dark meat (so many things taste like chicken, who knows).  The Healthy Choice brand uses less salt than some other food brands.  It has 400 mg of sodium which is OK.  The protein and fiber are in good balance, and the calorie count is OK if you are on a diet - it is a reasonable size portion.

To be honest this one would be better if you ate it blindfolded, as the chicken chunks and sauce really make it look like you are eating cat food.  Ignoring the visual appear, or lack thereof, the flavor still doesn't compare to the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken.  I will not be reordering.

review/summary: I can enjoy soda again this summer! This really is a nice grape flavor soda pop, even for stevia haters (like me)!
review/text: I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated "better" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.<br /><br />Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.

review/summary: Zevia's Best flavor, hands down
review/text: I've always been a fan of grape soda, but I never drank it that much compared to the colas.  Mostly because my favorite was "Nehi Grape" and it was super difficult to find.  Harder to find than TAB, even.  Fast forward maybe 15 years, Zevia comes out with Zevia Grape and it's awesome.<br /><br />It has a very similar flavor to Nehi Grape, but with stevia instead.  It's a little on the sweet side, but not hypersweet or bitter like some of their other flavors (mountain zevia and grapefruit citrus/ginger ale, respectively).  This is a by far my favorite zevia flavor in their lineup of sodas; and it's close to perfect.<br /><br />One final note: I want to say is that this is a fakegrape flavor, and although it is pleasant, it resembles nothing to grape juice whatsoever.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I purchased the 6-pack of these lemon tea cookies and waited with great anticipation for the melt-in-your-mouth, powdered sugar-covered shortbread lemon tea cookies I was expecting; what I received was 6 boxes of cookies that tasted like chemicals. I don't know if they were old and had gone off or had been stored in some plastic container that had leached the plastic into the cookies or if the makers just used some sort of artificial lemon flavoring rather than actual lemon but any lemon flavor they might've had was nearly undetectable, overpowered by a medicinal chemical flavor. They kind of tasted like Bactine smells. Needless to say I would not recommend these cookies to anyone but if you really want to try them let me know, I still have 5 unopened boxes... (To be fair, I can't say for sure ALL the boxes tasted like this, just the one I happened to open. I will not, however, be trying any of the other boxes I still have.)

review/summary: Lemon Divine would  be more accurate--they're from heaven!
review/text: These cookies are simply scrumptious! I gave my mother some as a gift, since she loves lemon flavored desserts. What a hit! They became her instant favorites, and she begged me to get her some more. They are small and round, about the size of a large marble, with a crisp, light consistency that just melts away in your mouth, covered with powdered sugar for sweetness, combined with that tart little zing of lemon. A very elegant and grown-up sort of cookie. I love them, too. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Very High Quality Tea
review/text: Our extended family goes through a lot of tea and we have some genuine aficionados; some may even say snobs.  We originally tried Newman's Own tea because we liked their other products and appreciate their charitable giving ethos.  What we were expecting, at the price we paid, was a relatively low-grade, re-branded tea.  That is not what we got.<br /><br />What we got was not only a consistently high quality tea, but also an astonishing value.  What really impresses me is that the quality and taste of this tea is so consistent; it's really the best black tea you can find, box after box, for the price anywhere near where they sell it, even much higher.  To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.<br /><br />It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped. Personally, I would prefer if they were loose; even though we recycle all the little paper bags they come in, I would feel better if they didn't have those at all.<br /><br />Easy to give this product an enthusiastic five stars.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: The BEST black tea on the market!
review/text: Hands down, this is the best black tea on the market. I'm a black tea junkie, and this has a rich taste, not grassy, very refreshing. Do I need to point out that it's organic? Consistent quality and taste, let's hope they don't change it, this is a must buy.

review/summary: Phenomenal tea~
review/text: A little while back, Newmans Own Tea was on sale and we have enjoyed all the other products under the brand name and appreciate the fact that proceeds benefit charities! The tea is phenomenal~ has far less bitterness than others, has a mellow flavor, lovely hue,whether your preference is to have it plain, with milk, with sugar,lemon or orange wedges, iced, or with a few oz. of pomegranate juice. I am not at all uncomfortable with having 6 boxes of 100 bags in my house for my husband and I and guests....my sister-in-law just decided she thinks it's the best there is and I gifted her with a box!There's no chance of it lasting long around here. It would also make a great Christmas gift with a lovely antique tea cup and old fashioned sugar cubes!

review/summary: Best tea by far
review/text: I have been using Newman's products for 5 years now.  I just recently bought this black tea and also a box of the green tea.  I can't say enough about the quality of these teas.  I'm enjoying a cup right now!  Sometimes certain teas can have a bitter after taste to them but this tea is perfect.

review/summary: suggested Retail Per Box is $3.99 !!!!!
review/text: Amazon appears to have outdated information for their "list price."<br />I went to Paul Newman's web site and the suggested retail price per box is $3.99, which would bring six boxes to 23.94!<br /><br />Amazon need to revise the "list price" on its web site as they are charging more than suggested retail!

review/summary: Holy Cow that's a Lot of Tea!
review/text: Purchased this for my Mom as a gift.  Somehow 600 tea bags seemed much smaller in my head then when I got the packages.  Needless to say my mother was amused!  However, like other reviewers have mentioned this is a really smooth tea.  My Mom said that it wasn't astringent, and there was no aftertaste or bite.  I'll be sure to purchase another box in a year when she's done with her 600 tea bags ;)
