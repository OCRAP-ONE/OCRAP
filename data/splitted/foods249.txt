review/text: I know Oreos are celebrating 100 years, and I feel badly about it, but I've had to switch loyalties.  Somewhere along the line they've changed and I am not as fond of them.  I tried the Newman's gluten free version last year when I became Vegan.  Surprise!  These are Vegan friendly as well, not to mention organic if you care about such things.  They are crisper and have a better tasting filling than Oreos (I just bought a bag last week so I did the side by side taste test.) They freeze beautifully (and they are even better frozen by the way.)  I buy them on the subscribe and save plan and am well please with the service.  Note there is some breakage in shipping, but who doesn't have a use for chocolate cookie crumbs?  Love these cookies. I use them with these molds http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Hearts-Cookie-Candy-Mold/dp/B001CEG9Z8/ref=pd_sim_k_1  and Wilton Candy Melts to make fun gifts and party treats. Don't miss the Newman's Ginger'Os if you like ginger cookies, they are a winner too.

review/text: Recenly purchased a 6 pack of these cookies because my 3 year old loves oreo's and had recently bought Country Choice at a local health food store and loved those.  Found Newman-O's to be a few dollars cheaper and figured they would taste pretty much the same as the other organic brand.  Next time I'll pay the extra money for Country Choice Organic chocolate sandwich cookies.  I do like the fact that Newman's cookies are organic and have no trans-fat, but they lack a bit when it comes to taste.  We'll finish our 6 pack but won't buy these again when there are other organic cookies out there.

review/summary: Kalamata halves
review/text: We were initially hesitant to try this volume of product, but are happy that we took a chance and were pleasantly surprised. The container tub is constructed of extremely tough material, which was very important because the shipping box arrived quite mangled but there was no damage to the product.  The olives have an excellent flavor but they are very salty though a quick rinse in cold water will deal with this satisfactorily. The olives are great in a summer pasta salad. We like that there is nothing added to the product, just olives, salt and water. We will definitely purchase again much sooner than anticipated as they are disappearing rapidly.

review/text: I used to order kalamata olives in small containers by the case through a food co-op.  Since retiring/downsizing and moving to a large city I do not have the storage space for case orders even when they are available.  However, one small container won't last long here.  This large jug available through Amazon was a good buy for me.  This arrived in a large box with other ordered items.  However, it was securely wrapped in plastic.  This was a good thing since about a teaspoon of liquid had leaked.  The lid was on tight and there was no evidence of mishandling.  The liquid never went beyond the plastic wrapper.  The olives are fine.

I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.

I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

Not so stiff now and it's easier for him to jump.<br /><br />Recommended for people who have senior dogs with skin or arthritis problems.

review/summary: Gassy and loose stool after 1-2 weeks?
review/text: My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??

review/text: The color and flavor is both deep and bright. Really tasty.<br /><br />So far my favorite use is to stir in a little milk, along with some cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg, then pop it in the microwave for a quick and healthy treat. It's also good added to plain yogurt, or in a smoothie. Next, I want to try freezing it in ice cube trays (after adding aforementioned spices- and whatever else strikes my fancy at the time - maybe a dash of coarsely ground black pepper, or vanilla extract?), then putting it in the Vitamix along with agave & lemon, to make a pumpkin sorbet.<br /><br />Would definitely buy this again when it's on sale. No dented cans either.

It is actually cheaper for me to buy this on Amazon then my local grocer so I decided to try my luck. Each pack of twelve are as mentioned in other reviews, factory packed and then in my case, both cases where put in another box by Amazon to ship.

review/text: I ordered one case on a lightning deal since it was significantly less per can than any grocery store in our area. My shipment arrived in perfect condition. It was packed well, and no cans were dented at all. The contents in the cans are the color and taste I would expect for pureed, commercially canned pumpkin (not gray or tart as some reviewers mentioned).  The pumpkin worked well in a vegan pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, in pumpkin spice muffins for breakfast and in a cream cheese pumpkin dip to accompany ginger snaps on New Year's Eve.  I ordered a second case on a Manager's Special and that one arrived in excellent condition as well.  I was also pleased with the long shelf life.  I would give this product five stars if it was packed in BPA-free cans.

review/text: I purchased Farmer's Market Organic canned pumpkin because I could not find Libby's anywhere. The shipping was first rate. Product is somewhat different than Libby's in that it is more liquid, not as solid, but pie was very good except sweeter than we are accustomed to. So will just reduce amount of sugar, which is a good thing anyhow, and enjoy the rest of the cans of pumpkin. I am glad to have enough for the upcoming holidays even tho Libby's is now back on grocers shelves. Thank you Amazon.

review/text: I bought this because of the pumpkin shortage (which is now over) to be sure I had canned pumpkin for the holidays.  Like other reviewers, I received a few dented cans, although only one was so badly dented that I hesitate to use it.  I have used the pumpkin in pie and pumpkin bread. It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery.  I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up.  The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great.  This made excellent pumpkin bread.  My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night.  If you are having difficulty finding pumpkin, don't hesitate to order this product.

review/text: I bought this pumpkin because there is none available in our markets due to the great pumpkin crisis of 2009 or something equally drastic.  Its primary use is to prevent hairballs in my cat and it works.  I usually mix it with some canned cat food, but when I ran out one night, I gave it to him straight and he scarfed it down as if it were candy.  It lasts a long time (he only gets about 2 tablespoons a night), smells wonderful and I plan to use it in some muffins as soon as I get the time to make them.  I like being able to give him something organic, as he's an older gentleman, and I like having organic for my own cooking.

Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this.  I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.  Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them.

That said--my second shipment had two VERY badly dented cans--but the rest were only slightly dented.  (This compared to my first shipment where every can was moderately dented).  Since I am using this for dog food--I have no problem using.  I just don't like to see this product sold as if it has no problems.  I am glad it is available though since there is such a pumpkin shortage.<br /><br />I'd like to update--my third shipment had only a couple of cans slightly dented.  I don't know if I just got lucky this time, or whatever issues there were have been worked out.<br /><br />That said, I am upping my review to 5 stars--however as other reviews have noted, the pumpkin is more watery than other canned pumpkin I have used in the past.  For my purposes that is fine.<br /><br />Taking my review back down to 2 stars.  I just received a shipment with extremely dented cans.  Too much trouble to return--and I will use them to feed my dogs.  I really hate that I don't feel like I have another choice right now.

review/text: I needed canned pumpkin to supplement the dog's diet but could not find any locally in Ohio due to the shortage. Amazon came to the rescue. The shipment arrived quickly in perfect condition. There were no dented cans. No problem. The dog loves the pumpkin and everyone is happy.

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: I have another pumpkin eating dog (it really has helped her IBD) and couldn't find canned locally. I ordered three cases of this (error on my part but not worth undoing due to scarcity) and awaited arrival with some trepidation thanks to negative feedback on damage to cans. To my very great delight, only 1 of the 36 cans had a even a small dent so looks like the problem has been solved, at least as far as my shipment goes. Can't comment on product itself beyond saying that it really is helping the dog.

review/summary: who won't like pumpkin
review/text: taste was very good but texture was watery compared to other brands . i make a fat free /sugar free pumpkin custard using egg whites. only 400 calories for the whole dish . with other brands of canned pumpkin it is the same texture as a normal pumpkin pie minus the crust . this brand comes out a bit soupy but still quite tasty. for a custard it is fine but for a pie ,it would never hold up to being a pretty slice, to hold it's shape unless you  over baked it. mind you - with the shortage we are having i would buy it again , i will buy it again because the taste is good unless you over bake it .

review/summary: Product is Fine, Shipping is Iffy
review/text: I've bought this pumpkin before but cannot find canned pumpkin in the grocery store during non-holiday periods, for some reason.  Although the consistency is not as nice as Libby's pumpkin - this is a little watery, the fact that it's organic scores big points.  I mix it with my dog and cats foods, so the wateryness is not an issue.  My complaint is that it was not well packed for shipping.  Almost half the cans were damaged to a point that I would not have purchased them in the grocery store.  The contents seem to be fine, but I will try to find some other source next time, as the shipping seems to be a consistent issue in other reviews I have read for this product.

review/summary: I like my pumpkin in the can!
review/text: I've been eating pumpkin from the can for years. All it takes is a can opener and a fork (and unless you're from Maryland -- one should never use a spoon) and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />Yum! Pumpkin is my favorite edible gourd. Though I do miss the delicious pumpkin seeds you can get from fresh pumpkin. Sometimes I'll bake the seeds and throw a little sea salt on top. That's a nice treat on a cool Fall day. I'll make a steaming hot cup of tea and eat pumpkin seeds and just think about things out on my porch.<br /><br />I imagine that Susan Lucci and I are married and that she's very experimental in the bedroom and not afraid to invite company to join us. One time I imagined this so hard I blacked out. I woke on my porch with pumpkin all over my chest and a slight burn on my calf from the tea.

review/summary: Good pumpkin, bad cans!
review/text: This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes. Pumpkin is WAY to hard to come by right now and I was happy to have found your product on Amazon.  But, it has turned out to not be such a deal when I have to even throw away one can of pumpkin.  I give you a five star rating for your pureed pumpkin, but I deducted two stars for the wasted can.

review/summary: Can issue resolved? No problems with cans, just with texture
review/text: I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the "Amazon Frustration-Free" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.<br /><br />However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the "Farmer's Market" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order.

review/summary: What a waste!!
review/text: I got hit by the same problem many others have...dented cans.  Of the 12 cans in the case, eight were dented.  When you divide the purchase price by the four useable cans that comes to $5.55/can!  RIPPPPP  OFFFFFF!!  As many others pointed out, the box was fine, it was just the cans inside.  I planned to return the offending cans, but in the meantime, I opened one to give some to my dog.  I thought I was buying pumpkin puree but instead I bought orange water.  Now that pumpkin is in stock at my local grocery stores again, I shall return to Libby or Publix brand.  You get 100% pumpkin (be sure you choose pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling).  No water and no dents and most important only $1.49/can instead of $5.55/can.  I couldn't give this product zero stars which is what I wanted to do.

review/text: This is the best pumpkin available -- if you are using it for your dogs or yourself. I have two dogs with issues -- one is older and has a little trouble with upset tummy from time to time, and the other was on prescription food -- but this product fixed all that.<br /><br />Now they can eat the same food as the dogs with no issues -- and they all love it! That is a nice plus -- if you are worrying that your dogs won't eat pumpkin, I will be surprised if they don't eat this. My pickiest dog thinks it is wonderful.<br /><br />I also eat some of it myself, because I read somewhere that it is good for humans too, and I like the flavor. However, I didn't try to bake anything with it, so I can't say if it makes good pie or pumpkin bread . . .<br /><br />When I read the reviews, I was a little worried about getting dented cans, but mine were fine -- no dents at all, and nicely packaged in a box.<br /><br />Five stars and two thumbs up from me -- your experience may vary . . .

review/summary: Watery and Bland
review/text: I found it to be watery. At least, more so than other canned pumpkin. It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.<br /><br />The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.<br /><br />I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.<br /><br />Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer.

review/summary: The Best Canned Pumpkin
review/text: I've been using Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin for a couple of years now.  During the great pumpkin shortage of 2009, Amazon seemed to be the only place that I could find canned pumpkin and so I decided to take a chance.  It is perfect!  It is creamy and smooth with no additives.  When it became available for Subscribe and Save, I jumped at the chance.  Buying it locally was a bit cost restrictive at about $3 a can.<br /><br />What do I use so much pumpkin for?  I first learned the wonders of pumpkin from Hungry Girl's daily newsletter.  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312377428">Hungry Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World</a>).  Sugar Free Devils Food Cake mix and a can of pumpkin = fudgy brownies.<br /><br />Then I inherited a cat with, ahem, problems.  Poor little thing.  While refreshing my pet care knowledge, I read about folks using canned pumpkin for their dogs.  What the heck.  Gave it a try and it seems to help.  BUT!! now she won't eat her meals without it.  She's hooked on pumpkin--a pumpkin junkie.  Thankfully, with Farmer's Market Organic, I can rest assured that, like her cat food, there are no harmful additives.<br /><br />Sadly, I've been unable to get the pumpkin from Amazon of late.  I even resorted to that other named brand and the difference is startling:  stringy and off colored.<br /><br />Fortunately, Farmer's Market Organic pumpkin is available in my local stores once again, however I am going to miss the Subscribe & Save option.

review/summary: Great Product at Great Price
review/text: I love pumpkin for baking and cooking, but my puppy loves it to keep her digestive system running smoothly. I ordered a case of these for 1.63 per can.  As this can be such a hard product to find, that was a great deal for me.<br />I also use this for teething treats by  freezing little bits in ice cubes (for freshness) and letting the puppy chew on them to help her gums.  There is no sugar or other ingredients and very low water content.<br /><br />I also did not have the problem that others encountered with the cans denting.

review/summary: Good quality pumpkin
review/text: While these cans aren't flying out of the pantry like other bulk cans I've purchased from Amazon, it's not a problem because they don't expire for more than a year. I find this pumpkin brand delicious and nutritious. Also, the Amazon price is way cheaper than the Whole Foods price for this same brand.<br /><br />None of my cans arrived dented.

review/summary: Doggone good!
review/text: Due to our dog's  intestinal issues it was suggested we give him a couple tablespoons of pumpkin with his meals. Not the pie mix, but pure, organic pumpkin.<br />It was pretty pricey at the pet store and not available in our supermarkets since it is a seasonal item. I always find the best deals on Amazon and this was one of them. Good price and FREE shipping on two cases, that stuff is heavy so the free shipping and no tax was a welcome reward. Now that Max is over his tummy upset we continue to give him this  product. You can also use this for baking, adding your own sugar and spice.

review/summary: Love the puree, hate the price
review/text: Our cats love this stuff, and we love what it does for the cats' digestion.<br /><br />Price seems to have jumped pretty high recently on Amazon.  We shopped around on the Web and found cheaper sources.<br /><br />Free market at work.
