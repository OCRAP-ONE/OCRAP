review/summary: Used to be great, now it's junk food.
review/text: I assume market forces dictated that Cascadian Farms add sugar and a more "refined" appearance to their cereal, but now it's just another box of sweetened junk--albeit organic junk. Too bad. Me and my two-year-old son were very happy customers--but now we'll have to look elsewhere. And I'll have to start reading the ingredients of everything I buy from Cascadian Farms with a skeptical eye, now that I know what their business plan is.

review/summary: Terrible mistake! (or maybe not?)
review/text: My family used this product for over 4 years, but last year the recipe was changed, sugar was added. That decision was probably driven by Cascadian Farm's desire to increase profits (cheaper production, more appealing to mainstream sugar junkies). Unfortunately, there aren't many choices right now for nutrition-conscious individuals. Even the so called organic/health cereals are loaded with sweets (all sorts of syrups, juice concentrates). Starting a morning on that note sets you up for a roller-coaster ride of high-low blood sugar. I had nothing else to do but to start cooking whole grain cereals (oatmeal, millet, buckwheat). It takes a bit of planning - you have to allocate time for cooking in the morning or cook the nigh before, but in the process you can save a ton of money. For instance, a pound of organic millet costs from $0.99 to $1.79 depending on the retailer (or $0.06 to $0.11 per oz). In the process of cooking grain absorbs water and increases it mass at least 3 fold. That makes the price of cooked cereal go down as much ($0.02 to $0.04).  Compare that to $0.48/oz price for Purely'Os! Then maybe the recipe change introduced by Cascadian Farms is truly a blessing for your wallet, if you are willing to wait 20 minutes, while you cereal is boiling on the stove. This time is not lost, but gained - you can use it to practice sun salutation to make your morning even more glorious!

review/summary: just another junk-food cereal
review/text: I'm looking for an oat cereal to feed a young child and was excited to see that General Mills offered an organic alternative to its well-known conventionally-made Cheerios.  Imagine my dismay to see that they've recently adulterated the product both with sugar and with cheap corn fillers.  When General Mills acquired Cascadian Farms, they made a big show out of keeping on founder and CEO Gene Kahn to run the new subsidiary.  Now, Kahn holds the title of Vice President of Sustainable Development at General Mills.  It seems he's either lost touch with the company he founded, or has sold out to the interests of his new mega-corporation paymasters.<br /><br />Shame, Gene!  Is this sugared corn-stuffed junk really what you founded Cascadian Farms to produce?

review/summary: Now Sugar O's
review/text: We received an email back from Cascadian farms. "People" in the US like sugar.<br />I've enjoyed Purely O's for quite a few years until I noticed something different. I thought it was the milk, but no, I eat them from the box of the evening if I need to take medicine with food. They were a 5 star and we bought them in quantities on sale until we noticed the taste and started checking around. Sugar? If I wanted a sugary taste and sugary cereal, I'd chose a a regular branded sugary cereal, there are plenty of them.

review/summary: Sneaky and potentially dangerous change
review/text: 3 years ago we looked long and hard for a sugar free, whole grain finger food for our then 6 month old.  Our son enjoyed this cereal as a snack and until recently, as a cereal, but then I bought my most recent box and noticed right away they didn't look the same.  When I tasted one I immediately knew they were sweetened and sure enough, when I checked the nutrition label it showed 3g of sugar per serving.  The label is completely unchanged except for the ingredients and this is dangerously misleading.  We live in a country where diabetes is rampant and sugar can be very dangerous.  How frightening that they Cascadian Farms/General Mills would sneak sugar into their cereal without changing any of the main labelling.  I will never buy anything from them again!

review/text: These used to be our and our 9 mo. old daughter's favorite snack. Unfortunately the company changed the formula altering the flavor and the nutritional value - not for the better. We plan to throw out the current box and stop buying this product and possibly others from the organization. The reason: Cascadian Farms, and their owner General Mills, dramatically altered the product without changing the packaging. It might seem like good business; however, it comes across as deceptive. Now, to find other cereals that meet the nutritional and flavor needs we used to get in the real Purely Os.

review/summary: bait and switch - used to be great, now it's junk - AVOID THIS CEREAL
review/text: I've lost all respect for Cascadian Farm in recent weeks for taking our favorite cereal bar none and turning it into junk overnight - this cereal had been our staple for half a decade since our son was a baby (now he's almost 5), because it tasted great and had no added sugar.  I found it when specifically looking for a cereal without the sugar, and it fit the bill for years.  Then suddenly a week ago our son said it didn't taste right and refused to eat it and I looked at the box and while nothing else on the box had changed the ingredients certainly had - I had one leftover old box and the old ingredients were whole grain oat flour, whole grain barley flour, wheat starch and sea salt, and the new ingredients are whole grain oat flour, corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, wheat starch, sea salt, tapioca syrup, molasses (i.e., they have now added corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, tapioca syrup and molasses and removed whole grain barley flour).  It's completely misleading - the new box has a picture of the old Purely O's, but the new cereal looks completely different from the old one, even though the picture hasn't changed. Now we're stuck with cereal we won't eat and can't return because it's opened.  I contacted the company to complain and asked where I could get the old formula and their response was not helpful - they didn't answer the question of where to get the no-sugar version and the response was pat - i.e., they were sorry to hear of my disappointment regarding this reform and would share my thoughts with the appropriate individuals.  This is so misguided and a perfect example of large companies getting into the organic business and managing to end up serving us junk by another name; the old product was quality, the new one is one to avoid.  While boycotting an entire company's product line is not typical for me, I am leaning toward refusing to buy ANY of their products any longer due to this change and the company's response to my inquiry; I can't in good faith buy from them when other companies are acting more responsibly.

review/summary: Cascadian Farms ruined this cereal by adding sugar
review/text: My family has loved this cereal for around 7 years or so before they ruined it. Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality. How we do care what we feed our precious growing tender dependent sweet little bundles of joy!

We bought it often, but were surprised and saddened to see the latest version sneaks in added sugar. Even my 2-year-old saw the change; after eating a few he looked and me and said, "they are sweet!" Of course, he's still a fan, but I will not be buying these again unless CF reverts to the old (perfect!) formula.

review/summary: Just another overpriced sugar cereal
review/text: I have been buying Purely O's for the past few years.  Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.  It's no longer worth the premium you need to pay.

It only has 1 gram of sugar per serving and it no longer contains corn.  Last year when I first tried it, it contained 3 grams of sugar per serving. I didn't like how sweet it tasted so I stopped buying it. Then I came across a review about the new recipe so I decided to research it. Seeing the new nutritional label here on Amazon, I decided to give it another try. Glad I did. Now my only complaint is it contains more sodium than Cheerios, hence the 4 stars rating. Cheerios has 160 grams while Cascadian Farms has 190 grams per servings.<br /><br />Ingredients: *Whole Grain Oats, *Whole Grain Barley, *Wheat Starch, *Malted Barley Extract, Sea Salt, *Oats, * Malted Barley, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols)<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Zinc and Iron (mineral nutrients), A B Vitamin (niacinamide), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) A B Vitamin (folic acid)

I suppose the backlash resulted in them dropping the sugar content.<br /><br />1 gram of sugar is just fine for my family and me. If that's too much for you, you should consider making your own cereal out of your own home-grown and home-milled grain.

When I found Purely O's a few years ago I was happy to have found a cereal that did not contain sugar or corn products which I need to avoid because of a corn allergy.  I had intended to buy another box today. I took the time to read the label to make sure that nothing had changed. I could not believe that the ingredient list now lists CORN!  I am so angry!  Purely O's were my go-to breakfast when I needed a something quick or was in the mood for cereal.  There is nothing that this  company makes that I can now eat.  When will these people learn humans aren't pigs! Everything in a supermarket should not contain corn!  If I had wanted corny oat cereal I would have bought Cheerios.

It has just a kick of heat to it, just enough to make it addictive, and not too salty.  So glad to find it here on Amazon!  I'll be trying it as a general seasoning, too, once I get a new supply.

review/summary: Best seasoning ever!
review/text: I was very excited to find this seasoning on Amazon considering that it is not sold where I currently live. When I lived in New Mexico, I used this seasoning in everything! I kept it right next to the salt and pepper because it is so versatile. I am very excited to use it again!

review/text: I use them to make fillers for dumplings and ravioli, I mix a can with a little wasabi mayo for a shrimp salad sandwich, I sprinkle the little guys on a salad (there is no chemical taste that you can sometimes get with canned seafood) ... there are a hundred great uses for these canned shrimp, and that makes me especially glad that they are responsibly harvested.  I am very pleased to be able to order 12 packs of this item at a bulk price.

review/summary: Eaten 3 cans in 3 days!
review/text: Whoa nelly I love this stuff! WOW.<br /><br />I made myself some shrimp cocktail and devoured an entire can the first day... drank the remaining yummy juice...mmmmm!<br /><br />Now I'm addicted to a shrimp cocktail appetizer and then I dump the rest of these guys into a rice/cream-of-shroom/lemonjuice concoction that's out of this world. The remaining shrimp broth is perfect for drinking but I like to spice up my cat's meals with it since she seems to like it too :p<br /><br />I did not expect to love this that much... not sure what I expected but I thought it would be difficult, at a minimum, to make it through a can per meal. Nope... there's plenty per can but I can't stop myself. I think it will refrigerate well (not sure for how long) especially when prepared in other dishes.<br /><br />But I've already caught myself doing the math on how I'll afford to eat this every day or every other day -- at least for as long as my obsession lasts. O' Wild Planet wild shrimp: I CAN'T QUIT YOU.<br /><br />I am so very happy with this product!<br /><br />THANK YOU!

review/text: To be completely honest, at my house we did not like this shrimp at all ... nope, not at all (shudder). So I tried to send it over to my sister, but after she sampled it she said even her cat wouldn't eat it.  We thought about sending it to a food bank for homeless people but decided against that so as not to disappoint anyone there.  Never again, I swear, never again ... :(

review/summary: Different kind of shrimp, but seems an ok product..maybe
review/text: Seems to be a high quality product. Taste is fresh and natural. This is tiny "pink shrimp" and it has a different, unique flavor and texture - milder then the "usual" shrimp. The can is tightly packed. In the beginning got excited about the product, tried it, liked it, ordered more. With the new shipment - have to change the 5 star rating i gave this product to an uncertain 3.  Not sure whether there's some unlisted chemicals added, or is it poor quality/freshness control, or both... I did not get my usual allergic reaction, like i do with pre-made foods filled with who knows what. (soy, corn, gluten)...  However, after having a couple of cans from the new shipment on an empty stomack as a no-carb "snack", my friend and I both started having a belly ache and bloating;  had to run to the bathroom soon after..  Suspecting germs, I decided to cook it next time i ate it, and again, a family member and I had a bad belly ache, bloating and the same type of natural "relief" from it... Go figure...  Never get it from fresh seafood of any kind. Guessing, the "cat" review by another perplexed customer here had something to it...?

review/text: This is a serious shipment of Swedish Fish. Hefting these bags out of the box is a lot like standing on the slippery desk of a schooner in the Baltic sea.. except.. well, like with sugar water instead of salt water.<br /><br />Anyway these are nice soft (as in fresh-ish) Swedish Fish. There's even some stray piece of other candy from a factory, it looks like maybe a Sour Patch Kid or something, in the bag I haven't opened yet. Which totally lends to the illusion of a big net-full just reined in from the bottom of that sugary, sugary Baltic.<br /><br />This will keep my visitor cup running-eth over of Swedish Fish at the office for the winter.. and hopefully will not promote my pants size. If you were going to eat this many Swedish Fish, you'd need to order like some kind of Kama Sutra of ways to eat Swedish Fish to go with it. This is a massive haul of the good old chewy fellas, of the large variety. My only complaint is that it isn't like 100 pounds instead of 10 pounds. Ahoy.

review/text: I have a sister who is crazy about Swedish fish, so I decided to get her a 1 gallon candy jar and fill it with fish for her birthday.  I wasn't sure how many fish it would take to fill a gallon jar, so I went with this package, thinking that it should at least fill most of it.  I was pleasantly surprised when the fish arrived and just one of the two included bags was enough to fill the jar almost entirely!  I was able to give my sister the full jar with a nicely packaged refill.  I'll most likely be buying this package again in the future, great bang for the buck.

Save your money and go to Sams or Costco and get two of these boxes for the same price plus a little left over for gas money. I'm kinda disappointed that Amazon even lets this happen.

review/text: These peanuts are OK.  They are obviously far better than most "store-bought" brands (such as Planter's).  However, they are nowhere NEAR as tasty as the peanuts I've ordered from Amazon which are produced by the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg.  Plus, the "blisters" in the Virginia Diner brand seem to be mostly broken in half (i.e., not intact), and they are actually somewhat hard to bite into.  For a few extra dollars, the additional investment in the Willamsburg variety is well worth it.

The taste of an authentic Hurricane was still fresh in my mind (having enjoyed, um, several of them), and I found this mixer overly sweet and heavy, and only vaguely familiar.  It was like rum mixed with Hawaiian Punch if the punch was more syrupy.<br /><br />It was good, but not authentic.  It seems the only way to enjoy an authentic Hurricane is to spend $7.50 for one at Pat O'Briens on Bourbon Street.

But not when I<br />have just a few drinks. It's a total bummer.<br /><br />That's why I was pretty excited to try Pre-Game.<br /><br />And after trying it, I have to say, the product works. I pop one<br />of these before I start drinking and the next morning I don't<br />have a hangover. I'm able to get out of bed and go about<br />my day feeling good.<br /><br />The little energy kick it provides is an added bonus before<br />you head out for the night and in the morning when I need<br />a little pick me up and I don't want to drink a big coffee.

review/text: I purchased this when Amazon itself was selling them, not an outside seller. The price from them was great! This is such a nice kit. Has a nice selection of various marinades. One thing that is incorrect though is the picture shows each marinade having it's own injector syringe, but they do not. There is only one syringe, but it is easily cleaned. The dry spice was fresh and the mariandes have good expiration dates. I hope Amazon itself gets more of these in  so I can order this again. It's a great deal at the Amazon price, plus free prime shipping. The spices are flavorful but don't burn your head off...they just leave a delicious flavor in whatever you inject :-)

review/summary: Tastes like peanut butter sawdust, but I love it
review/text: If you suffer from blood sugar issues and tend to get dizzy, shaky and sweaty if you don't eat I recommend this bar. It doesn't taste fantastic but it will help regulate your blood sugar and keep you from crashing. I keep a few around me most of the time, so if I don't have a chance to eat I don't go all crazy.<br /><br />I personally don't get blood sugar crashes if I exercise a few hours before I should eat.<br /><br />If I eat it during a crash, I feel kinda yucky and low energy, but the shakes etc go away.

review/summary: Peanut Delight Bars are GREAT!
review/text: My favorite Extend Bar is the Peanut Delight, it reminds me of a "Rice Krispies" peanut butter treats.<br />I have trouble with my blood sugar dropping, especially in the evening or night. When I eat the Peanut Delight bar as a snack at bedtime I do not have any problem.<br />I am not a real chocolate person,if you are a chocolate person you will love the chocolate bars and the other flavors are very good too.<br />I give this product the highest recommendation that I can, try all the flavors I am sure you will love them too. The benefits for diabetic patients are great.

review/summary: DELICIOUS, NO; CONVENIENT, YES
review/text: I have tried all varieties of the Extend Bars.  In all honesty, I'm not crazy about any of them but the Peanut Butter Crunch, to me, has the most flavor.  If you follow a diabetic diet faithfully and experience Dawn Syndrone, these bars will help lower your early morning blood glucose readings.  They taste okay for a low carb bar but don't expect your taste buds to jump for joy. Of course, everyone has their own idea of what taste good.  I guess the most important thing to remember is that these bars do what they say they do; help control blood sugar and satisfy hunger.<br />For diabetics, Extend Bars are a welcomed tool in helping to manage a healthy diet.

review/summary: Quite Good Chili. Somewhat Zesty.
review/text: My nearby grocery store carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry.<br /><br />Gsry Peterson

review/summary: Best cat food!!!!
review/text: Although it is a little pricey compared to most cat foods, my cats are worth it!  :)  Their coats have been softer and they eliminate less waste while eating this cat food.  Additionally, this is such high quality stuff (look at the ingredients!) that you don't have to feed them as much as standard "commercial" cat food found at a typical grocery store.  I'd say I only have to feed them 50-75% as much.  I have two cats and a 6 pound bag lasts me a little over two weeks.  And on the occasion that I did not purchase this brand (due to convenience typically), my cats are always crying and hungry because their little bodies are not fulfilled!  This is the best cat food!

review/summary: Coconut oil
review/text: Interesting product.  It smells distinctly of coconut in the jar (whether solid - below 76 degrees F, or liquid - above 76 degrees F), but does not seem to impart that to anything you cook in it.  Haven't tried it in salad dressing yet, but fear the scent of coconut will come through.  (I think it may be perfect for coconut shrimp or even Asian cooking.)<br /><br />Pretty pricy for cooking oil, though it claims to have health benefits.

review/summary: Messy but healthy
review/text: I am on the bandwagon now of believing that coconuts along with products derived from them as being healthy. The problem is that is expensive to keep up a regular supply of coconut oil; this product was cheaper than our local health food store, though. The box arrived with oil stains on one side; it had leaked out from the packaging, so that was disappointing. It is also messy to pour it out of the very wide-mouthed container; it usually drips onto the outside of the canister. I must say that I will be sticking with extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil until the price goes down on coconut oil and more user-friendly packinging is available.

review/text: I have heard about the benefits of this type of fat and so finally bought some when it was on special here.  It was still sort of expensive, but I had heard so many good things about it, I bought it.  I now have a lot of it in my pantry!  The coconut flavor is VERY strong.  I thought that perhaps it would cook off, but it does not.  Nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food  that aren't supposed to have coconut.  Therefore, I only use it when I am cooking stir fry or Asian--then it is fine, but it is A LOT of product to have around for 2 or 3 meals a month.

review/summary: I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications
review/text: I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut "oil" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot "eat it out of the jar" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve. I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.

review/summary: Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free
review/text: I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find "packed on" and "best before" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the "best before" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as "organic." Do a little research; "cold-pressed," "organic," AND "hexane-free" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar.

review/summary: Great for like, everything.
review/text: My bf and I both have subscriptions for this coconut oil. It's a great way to get it for an AMAZING price. I used to order the larger size and I was disappointed when it was unavailable for a while and I had to order the two pack in this smaller size (although really 29 ounces is not that small) but in the end I like it much better. With two smaller ones we can each have one if we end up running out around the same time otherwise, half of the coconut oil stays fresh and unopened. Oh, and if you want to put some on right after a shower, the smaller jar is more likely to actually fit in your shower.<br /><br />We tried other coconut oils and they were...well...gross. Really rancid tasting. We use this in deep dish pizza crust and the one time we used another brand we basically ruined two giant 14 inch pizza pies. We also use it for flour tortillas, pie crust, refried beans, smoothies, coffee cake, um, all kinds of things. I am planning to try using it instead of butter in a croissant recipe, although I expect it will be quite tricky since it melts at a slightly lower temperature than butter, and gets harder when it hardens. Put it in the fridge and it is hard as a rock.<br /><br />Anyway, we now use this stuff about as much as we use olive oil, and we've found it actually showing up in recipes in some newer cookbooks now, too, rather than us just trying to substitute and seeing how it works out. It does have a strong coconut smell and flavor, which enhances some recipes in a FABULOUS way, but may be detrimental in others.

review/summary: Great for Baking-
review/text: This is great for baking.  I use it in place of butter for all baking at 350 degrees F.  Everyone loves my gluten-free, dairy-free brownies. The oil is hard when refridgerated (cold brownies), but liquifies above 78 degrees F., so it literally melts in your mouth. It also gives brownies a great extra sweetness. You can use it in place of butter or lard in most baking recipes. I also use it in the pancake pan and egg pan and to grease pans before baking. However, this larger-sized bottle is more expensive per oz. than the subscribe and save's other option- two smaller bottles.

review/summary: Amazingly fresh coconut smell and multiple uses, plus ORGANIC
review/text: This is a marvelous product with some interesting health benefits (google it up). You can use it in baking, frying, in sauces, for vegan raw pies, mix with chocolate for puddings, moisturize your hair or skin, soothe rough elbows, etc.<br /><br />This melts really fast in a pan, so you don't need a high heat. I fry eggs in it, and the coconut taste is subtle. Any ethnic dish that requires sauteeing or saucing and can benefit from a fresh coconut flavor, this is useful. I've cooked meats in it, as well. If you hate the smell/taste of coconut, obviously, this is not for you.<br /><br />This brand, Nutiva, is organic and virgin. It smells so good. And I have an old jar that I never finished (really big one), and nearly two years later, after sitting right by the stove, it still smells fresh, like Cuban coconut candy my mom used to make. Yes, solid and fresh and white and fragrant TWO YEARS LATER. This is a very stable product.<br /><br />Recommended.

It goes on your skin a little greasy but soaks in within 5 minutes.  I no longer break out and my skin looks much clearer, much like when I was a kid.

review/summary: The latest plastic container is a number 2 HDPE
review/text: I had to chime in here.  I have the 29oz and have looked all over the web (including the Nutiva site) to see if they mention what plastic this container is.  Nowhere is it to be found.  There are a handful of mentions of no. 1 plastic (when it was in a clear jar).  But nothing about these white plastic jars that now seem to be the norm for most sizes.  So when I got home today I turned mine over and found a "2".  HDPE.  Don't have to worry about BPA but I don't know much about HDPE.<br /><br />If they carried this in a glass jar I would be happier though I would need to find at local brick and mortar stores because I am sure shipping would be a lot. Like others on account of the container, I give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />This is the BEST EVCO I have had to date and I will continue to use it.  As for transferring it to another container: I have many Ball jars because I use a foodsaver vacuum sealer to keep things.  However, the lining of the jar lids is apparently BPA rich.  So, I will keep it in the white plastic number 2 and hope for the best.<br /><br />Again, this is a great quality EVCO and I haven't heard a single bad word about it except for the plastic jar so wanted to add what information I could for those making a decision.

review/text: I got this mainly because of  all the talks about the Coconut oil as as skin moisturizer. It might sound silly to buy 2 jars of coconut oil just to use it as moisturizer, but I thought I can try it in food as well. I like the smell, as opposite to other people, though it's not strong to hurt your nose, and it disappears in few minute. Cooking in coconut oil, is like cooking in water, it does not have the same texture as olive oil, it looks watery, and it gives a nice taste to the food. Having it on your skin, it dry in couple minute leaving your skin smooth and not oily at all.I never tried coconut oil before, so I cannot compare it to other brand.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: This is the only coconut oil I buy!  It is a great product and Amazon has a decent price. If you like coconut oil check out coconut flour too!  I just learned about coconut flour and I have loved baking with it.

review/summary: WONDERFUL TASTE
review/text: When I started using coconut oil I bought a different organic brand but it tasted like soap.  Nutiva has the most wonderful smell and taste that doesn't change no matter how long you have it and it lasts forever.  I don't even buy butter anymore, I love it in my oatmeal, on popcorn and steamed veggies, as well as blending it into my morning protein smoothies.

review/summary: YUMMY
review/text: This is the best oil. Everything tastes so good when you use it, not greasy, french fries turn out golden brown and moist and fluffy inside.  I'm sure it is the oil.

review/summary: Makes AMAZING popcorn
review/text: I am a popcorn fan, eating it around 5 times a week.  I use an old-fashioned popper, and put around 1-1/2 T coconut oil in the bottom, with 1/3 c Paragon popping corn <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLGA0W">Paragon Bulk Bag Yellow Corn (12.5-Pounds)</a>.  The popcorn pops up very nicely in this coconut oil (better than any other oil I've tried), and if I put a dash of fine sugar (not confectioners) on it right when it gets out of the popper, it tastes like kettle corn (aka crack corn).  If I'm feeling super indulgent, I put on a little butter topping <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VZWFZU">Odell's Original Popcorn Butter, 10-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 3)</a>, but the coconut oil has a delightful mouthfeel even without the butter.  And just the lightest hint of coconut is present to make the popcorn seem exotic.<br /><br />I was so happy when I heard that coconut oil had just gotten a bad press a few years ago, and it's actually good for you.  Especially since it makes such amazing popcorn!

review/summary: A very nice surprise
review/text: I purchased this order so that I could make home-made soap for the holidays. I hesitated because of the price but yet I wanted a organic "quality" home-made soap so I clicked the buy button. When the shipment came I opened it and fell in love with the smell. I tasted it and loved the taste and was hooked. I started putting it in my oatmeal and bake goods, replaced standard oils in all my cooking--the taste was AWESOME. I also just ate some on a spoon and used it as a lotion. The first thing I noticed was my hands and lips (both were very chapped prior to using) became very soft. My husband said today how young my hands looked--and told me how his twin brother (who is single) said you can tell a lady's age by there hands and my husband said mine looks much younger (I will keep him too).  Another thing I noticed my lab-mixed dog would beg for it everytime I opened the jar. He would come running from where ever he was into the kitchen to beg. My husband broke down and feed him some, and HE LOVE IT! He has very dry skin and it seems to already help him. He now begs us for our oatmeal at breakfast. This dog has been trained not to beg but something in the oil makes him forget his training. Plus, I never heard of a dog liking oatmeal or oil. So today I will order more and give the jars as gifts and hopefully someday I will have enough left to make my soap.<br /><br />UPDATE: Gave this out as stocking stuffers and at first people were looking at me strange at such an odd gift BUT the feedback has been so positive (even got a call at 11:30 pm to tell me how yummy it was on their popcorn and it was the hit of their movie night party) and wanting to know other ways to use the oil. I was also told by someone who orders coconut oil from amazon, to order it only in the "COLD" months because the oil's melting point is so low and the spring/summer heat will melt the product and may leak---SO I will make sue I am stocked-up for my hot-weather needs.
