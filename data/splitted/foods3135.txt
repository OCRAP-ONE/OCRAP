review/summary: In one word....delicious....
review/text: I could tell as soon as the box was delivered this was going to be great coffee.  You could already smell the coffee through the box.  I know....then it wasn't sealed or fresh.....wrong.  It was as fresh as I have had.  The price breaks down to be cheaper than buying the usual pound at a time from the store...in some case significantly....and the quality was on par if not higher than our usual store bought brews.

Adding 1/2 caramel truffle to 1/2 caff makes the perfect cup of java, for me anyway.<br /><br />This is my new favorite and joined the "club" insuring I will never run out !

review/summary: Great for new coffee drinkers.....
review/text: At last, a coffee I like.  It's a very light taste and won't knock you silly with strong flavors.  I've tried to drink coffee on and off for years but never found a coffee I could really enjoy.  My husband is an avid coffee drinker and likes to try new flavors occasionaly.  Recently,  I walked into the kitchen and the aroma led me straight to the coffee pot.  OH, MY, MY, MY it smelled so good.  I automatically reached for a cup.  I think I actually drooled as I poured that first cup.  I was hoping I wouldn't be dissapointed, again, and I wasn't.  I drank the first cup black.  My husband is delighted with my eye opening experience because this is something else we can explore and enjoy together.  We have since purchased a new coffee maker (after much research) and are enjoying trying different flavor combinations.  I highly recommend using fluoride and chlorine free water--makes a substantial difference.<br /><br />I guess I'll stop gushing about this coffee and go brew a pot.  My mouth's watering--happy drinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: The smell of the coffee is wonderful. However, when you make the coffee it loses the majority of the taste.  It doesn't have the caramel flavor you would think it was going to have.  I first had the coffee in one of those little packages you get that only makes about 2 cups.  It had so much more flavor.  The big package did not.  Again, when you open it it smells great it just doesn't sustain that flavor when made.<br /><br />Thank you...

review/text: Been told and I should have listened, that any flavor coffee is never going to be as good as a regular kind. The fact that they are flavored indicates that no expensive coffee is used in the preparation. I learned this lesson and I am glad this particular kind, Millstone Caramel Truffle Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2), is gone and out of our lives. Live and learn, and we all have learned not to buy flavored coffees anymore. Starting with the smell and then the taste there was nothing special to write home about it. We have graduated from those days to about to purchase a quality coffee grinder so we can enjoy beans which presumably is the way to go. In the meantime we are drinking Peet's Coffee, which in my humble opinion, is better than most Starbucks roasts. Please don't shoot me if you are a Starbucks fanatic for my only crime, if any, has been to attempt to find a good cup of coffee. One with body, gusto and why not?, class. Compared to the better coffees out there it is very apparent to determine that Millstone Caramel Truffle Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2) is just average at best.

review/summary: Nice taste of the islands
review/text: It was great to find this drink on Amazon, after we returned from a cruise to the Saint's islands. When we want to kick back and relax, my wife and I share a bottle of Ting and remember the catamaran trip with the wind, the smell of the ocean, the music and the fun.<br /><br />The drink itself would get a 5 star rating, no problems at all with the taste or packaging or anything along those lines. The problem keeping it from 5 star's is the shipping cost, it is way more than the cost of the drinks themselves.<br /><br />If I could buy Ting locally I would, but we haven't found it in the Houston area. It means, unfortunately, that we won't be ordering this too often, since the shipping cost is twice the cost of the Ting itself.

review/text: I received the product today. None of the bears were broken, but there were one or two of them that had some of the peel wearing off(only marginally though). The bears were not melted either. They came in a Lindt Box with a cute storage for each of them, and had a plastic top as mentioned in the other review.<br /><br />The chocolate was very delicious. I took one and tried it and it tasted just like a Lindt Truffle, albeit without the truffle goodness inside it. The bears are adorable and I will be using the majority of them for little thank you for teachers and friends. They all have an expiration date on them (for me, it was May 2012) and come exactly as the picture states.<br /><br />I'd recommend the other reviewer to ask Amazon for a refund...it seems the bears were sent in a hot location which is why they melted. My bears came in 65 degree weather so they managed just fine.

review/text: The manufacturer, Faerie's Finest, has confirmed with me, that there are "TRACE ELEMENTS" in this product that may cause an allergic reaction.  I have been using this product for some time now and really like it and I wanted to make a peanut butter flavored cake for a friend who has allergies to peanuts, so I called the manufacturer as to what the actual ingredients are.  I waited almost 2 weeks for an answer.  I finally had to call them back and had to wait for the owner to reply later in the day.  The person answering the phone read me the ingredients stating there were natural ingredients but this is NOT WHAT THE LABEL STATES. The label says ARTIFICIAL flavors. But she "assured" me it "should be fine"!!  I waited to hear from the owner/manufacturer.  When I got the call back I was informed that the ingredients were naturally derived and contained trace elements that may cause an allergic reaction!  I am SO GLAD I CALLED!  The labeling is not accurate and poses a severe health risk to those with peanut allergies.  The product should be discontinued/recalled until proper labeling can be established.  Otherwise - if you have no allergy to nuts it is a good extract.

review/text: Despite the fact it's not 100% whole wheat (it's got some semolina mixed in), this is a DELICIOUS pasta. This is probably one of the few pastas I could eat directly from the pot, without sauce or seasoning (not that I would, but I don't mind testing it while it's cooking....) It reminds me a lot of the fresh egg noodles I ate as a kid at huge family dinners.<br /><br />Doesn't disintegrate or get gluey, and doesn't get that weird bitter or nutty flavor some whole wheat pastas take on. Cooks VERY tender and not sticky. Lovely with all sorts of sauces, and we also just toss it with a little oil and some veggies.<br /><br />This pasta is great.

review/summary: flavors up dishes nicely but no so different from the enchilada sauce
review/text: I like this skillet sauce.  It has a nice flavor and adds a richness to taco dishes.  The overall flavor is not so very different from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFVCM">Frontera Pouch, Enchilada Skillet Red Chile, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  This skillet sauce is a little chunkier and a little darker in its coloring than the enchilada sauce.  I have used it with vegetables and also with gardein products (vegetarian meat substitute) and have loved the results.  I would not consider this to be a spicy sauce.  Additionally, even though it has chipotle peppers, it is not very smokey.<br /><br />Vegetarians:  This New Mexico skillet sauce is vegetarian.

review/summary: Wow! talk about authenic flavor!
review/text: Great stuff,  I could never duplicate this flavor at home even if I had the ingredients.<br />Bought this sauce packet couple months back, it was the only one of the shelf.  Recognized Rick Bayless name looked around couldn't find anymore.<br />Thought I'd save it till husband home, got desperate one night and used it for boys tacos.  OMG.  Boy did I wish I'd saved it till husband was here to<br />enjoy.  This sauce has the deep layered chili flavor you can only get in certain areas of southwest.  It was a shame to waste it on kids that (like the review from New York guy who obvouisly background in southwestern cuisine)don't have full appriciation of what they were eating, don't get me wrong, they loved it!<br />Now there is none available locally (Alaska) am impatiently waiting for my mega shipment from Mothernature.com.  It has been over a month, I've emailed twice, and now read all negative reviews for this site.  Guess I'll be ordering from Amazon, wish they sold more than one package in shipment (6x) like the other Frontera sauces.

review/summary: Deep rich flavor that tastes like homemade or restaurant quality
review/text: This product was purchased with a coupon at a local store. For 98 cents I thought if I didn't like it at least I tried something new. Pressed for time on a weekday morning I took 2.5 lbs. of fresh boneless chicken breasts and placed them in my crockpot and dumped a package or this on top with one packet full of water and set it on low. I came home 10 hours later after working all day and dinner was served! It smelled spicy and I grabbed forks and shredded the chicken and wrapped the meat in soft flour tortillas and served it with some warm bean dip. My son is a picky eater and he ate two of these. The deep smoky intense peppery flavor is authentic and it tastes delicious. I will definitely buy this again to use with pork chops or ground beef also. Perfect flavor that tastes like you made it fresh or bought it at a restaurant.

review/summary: Bland, and with an unpleasant aftertaste
review/text: I had very high hopes. I've seen the Rick Bayless show on PBS and always thought highly of his eagerness of unique and original flavors. Unfortunately the New Mexico skillet sauce was not at all what I expected and it did not live up to the price. Per the directions, I used chicken to create a shredded chicken taco. What resulted was a very thick, pasty red mess that tasted like the generic "chili seasoning" spice mix. It was oily, devoid of any complex flavors, and just rather unpleasant. I guess what bothered me most was that an apparently good cook, Bayless, put his name on this. It's a case of the hype not living up to reality.<br /><br />With some kitchen work, I was able to salvage the skillet of chicken, but it required a fair amount of massaging to create something edible. It seemed like the sauce wasn't complete. In the end, the sauce helped to create some good chicken, but it was not at all a one-pack solution as advertised.<br /><br />In the end, if you want a unique and much more flavorful chicken, try the Chi Chis original seasoning. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MBN5TK">Chi-Chi's Restaurante Seasoning Mix, 0.78-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. It is much better, and a much better value.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Peanut Butter and Company products.  They make some of my favorite natural, no-stir peanut butters.  However, this particular product is not among their best.  While on the hunt for a plain, creamy, no-stir peanut butter, I tried this product.  It reminded me of the peanut butter found in Reese's cups--thick, a little too sweet, and a bit gritty.<br /><br />My proposed alternative?  Try PB&Co's The Bees Knees instead.  It seems to be smoother and, oddly, less sweet.

review/text: Naturade's Bavarian Chocolate flavor is outstanding.  I've been taking this product for breakfast and lunch at work since about September 2005, and I'm not sick of it yet.  Not even close.  I'll consume as much as I want during the day when I want.  I feel completely full for a few hours with one drink. I mix it in a 20 ounce bottle with two scoops.  Your body will appreciate the health benefits of this drink, unlike fried or fast food that will take down your energy level and leave you feeling groggy.  You will lose weight also from taking this product.  I lost 20 pounds and am now at a level of maintaining my current weight, and I owe a lot to Naturade Soy.  I've also tried the Vanilla flavor.  I was not impressed. Buy the Bavarian Chocolate and try it out.  You'll be glad you did.

review/text: I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!! The new and improved formula is the way to go!!!!

review/summary: As good as they say...
review/text: This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...

review/summary: Tried others, this one is best value
review/text: I have purchased another soy based chocolate power product (ASIN: B000HCX5RQ), and that other one wasn't as good as this Naturade Total Soy.  We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1/2 scoops, 8-12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after-taste - probably due to the soy - but it's better than using pure cocoa!<br /><br />Update: All Star Health is very very fast.  I reordered it on 9/10 and received the very next day.  It wasn't expected to arrive until 9/16.  I will order from them again.  It's too bad this item from them is not on the subscription program.

The juicy juice box that holds the 4 packs were somewhat crushed, sticky and the bottoms of the boxes were soaked.  I immediately contacted customer service again and I have 2 more shipping out.  I did make a recommendation to Amazon about improving how they ship this item as the box was way too big for this product and was bouncing around.<br />Otherwise, my children love juicy juice, it was a great price, and the customer service was awesome.

review/summary: Think of this product as a delicious starting point....
review/text: My wife and I love Indian food - I prefer the hotter the better, but she prefers mild with rich flavors.  The Tiger Tiger products fall right in the middle as an excellent compromise.  We've tried the Chana Masala, Mutter Paneer and Veggie Korma, all with excellent luck, but with a word of advice.  If you think of these products as complete meals (as they are advertised), you will be pleased but not blown away.  However, if you think of them as an excellent place to start, then the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />With the Chana Masala, we usually add another can of chick peas and some cilatro or other herb that cooks well.  Then we just let it simmer on the stove top for 30-60 minutes.  With very little supervision, and medium low heat, you won't have any concerns over burning, and like many "saucy" foods, it just gets better with time.  They give this a 3-star spice rating, but it is NOT hot in any sense of the word.  I usually add a little chili oil to my serving to punch it up because it adds hot without affecting the flavors.<br /><br />The Mutter Paneer is excellent as is, and the only thing we have found that we like to add is a very healthy dose of chopped fresh spinach.  Spinach is already one of the ingredients, so we just put the Tiger Tiger sauce in a pan and add about 6-8 oz of fresh spinach.  It takes about 7-10 minutes for the newly added spinach to cook down, and the result is great.<br /><br />The Veggie Korma is probably the easiest to doctor up because it closely resembles a sweet Thai curry sauce (in our opinion, anyway).  You can add any combination of steamed vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, carrots, etc.) and protein (chicken, shrimp, fish, tofu, etc.) and you'll almost certainly come up with an excellent product.<br /><br />As for comments on the rice - it's all a matter of taste.  The Basmati Cumin rice packaged with the Chana and Korma is on the al dente side, but this can be helped by adding a little water to the packet before you microwave, and then cooking it a little longer.  The flavor is fine, but not very intense.  Our favorite is the Basmati Pilau rice packaged with the Mutter Paneer as it starts softer and has a little more flavor to it.  We do find that when our creations are done, we sometimes need to steal the rice from an uncooked package, and when we use plain old brown rice the next time, it's not a huge loss.<br /><br />Finally, one reviewer stated they had lots of sand or grit in their meals.  We have probably eaten 15-20 of these so far with zero occurrence of any contaminants in our food.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 5 stars because I feel it is an excellent tasting product, that when purchased on sale (think $12-$15 per case instead of $25) is an exceptional value.  If you are a regimented cook who likes to follow the rules you may not enjoy the more relaxed method with which we experiment.  In that case you may wish to try these individually from the store before purchasing in bulk.  In any event, I feel you'll be pleased with the results, even if you think you know better.  (NOTE: I published the same review on the Tiger Tiger Chana Masala page, too, as it accurately describes all three of the Tiger Tiger products we've tried.)

review/summary: Great meal
review/text: I gave it 5 stars for quality of the meal, but I would give it 0 stars for what Amazon did. They used to sell this for around $30 (when I bought it from Amazon) and eligible for Prime; less for Subscribe and Save. A good deal.<br /><br />Now I see they only offer it for a grossly inflated price $56.46 from some money grubbing partner. Way to go, NOT! [Edit - has been rectified - see below]<br /><br />BAD decision.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a wonderful meal, but you would do much better to try to find it locally. This price is just absurd.<br /><br />[Edit] I must add that at this point Amazon has added a much better source at half the price for product + shipping! It's still not eligible for Prime, but next best thing. Good work, Amazon! It's appreciated. (The local market has this for sale at 7 months past the use-by date).

review/summary: Eating well when you don't have time to cook
review/text: Of all the 'heat & eat' products I've tried, this is easily my favorite (though it makes too large a meal to be really practical as a one-dish microwave lunch at work, which is usually what I look for in a heat & eat product).  It makes a delicious meal for nights when actual cooking is just too much to face, but you still want to eat well (though the portions in one box are a bit skimpy for two persons, unless you add extra veggies to the Mutter Paneer sauce).<br /><br />The Basmati Pilau Rice packet cooks beautifully in the microwave, as does the Mutter Paneer (either at the same time, or -- when I want to add some fresh vegetables to take advantage of all that sauce -- poured over vegetables in a dish before 'nuking').  I've also tried sauteing extra vegetables on the stovetop and then pouring the sauce packet over them to heat up at the last, which offers more control over the doneness of all ingredients.  I favor the frying pan method, except for when washing the pan afterwards still seems like too much work.<br /><br />Strict vegetarians might want to take care, though:  there's no meat listed in the ingredients, but it always seems to me that there are a few shreds of chicken meat (or something very like it) in the Pilau.

review/text: I agree with others that the one or 2 negative reviews amidst all the glowing reviews for each and every Kitchen of India product might be planted by Indian restaurant owners. They are that good. As a lifelong vegetarian I've eaten lots of Indian food at both high end and family style Indian restaurants in New York City. These products are as good as any Indian food I've had. The only exception is the one curry containing spinach because I think spinach gets bitter once prepared. All of the others are excellent. It's hard to believe something this good can come in a freeze dried pouch.<br />As an added bonus it can be stored in the pantry.

review/text: This is my absolute favorite Indian food mix for ease of preparation and pure crave-ability. Excellent with chicken, but as I've since become a vegetarian, I still make this with peppers, onions, and potatoes. I'm sure it would work with tempeh or veggie protein too. By comparison to foil-pouch grocery store Indian meals, or even the simmer sauce you buy in a jar, this is an outstanding product. (PS - I use lemon juice instead of the 'lemon curd' it calls for on the box)

review/summary: poor quality control
review/text: I ordered a case of six boxes.  Each box was to include a pouch that contained the sauce and a small packet of spices.  Of the six boxes, only two contained the spices.  I was lucky in that I was making a large batch and used more than one box, so when I discovered the problem, I used one packet of spices for every three pouches of sauce  that I made.  But had I prepared only one box at a time, four of them would not have contained any spices at all.  For this reason, I would not purchase this product again.  It is very tasty, but since you cannot be sure you will get everything, I wouldn't advise taking the risk.

review/summary: Love the Curry Paste...but be warned, it is HOT!
review/text: My wife and I have been using Kitchens of India products for a long time now, and have always been very satisfied. Biryani is one of my favorite dishes, so when I saw this product I had to try it.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Kitchens of India products is that fact that the ingredients list is all natural, and you can identify every single thing on the list. I'm not someone who eats solely natural or organic products, but I do appreciate it when I am able to do so.<br /><br />The taste of the resulting Biryani you will create using these packets is absolutely outstanding; considering how simple the recipe becomes using this paste, the taste to effort ratio is incredible. I won't lie and say I've never had a better Biryani in a restaurant or homemade by my wife's grandmother, but I can't imagine another product being this easy to use and still tasting anywhere close to as good. The only thing I would warn is that if you follow the exact instructions on the packet, your biryani will be HOT. This is coming from two people who can handle a decent amount of spice, if you use the entire paste packet in your recipe, the resulting outcome is almost unbearably hot to eat.<br /><br />Not a problem though, as there are two very easy options. You can either use HALF (yes, you really will need to cut it down by 50%) of the paste in each packet, mixed with the recommended amount of meat. Or, you can use the whole packet, and just double the amount of meat, and the result is perfect as well. We prefer the latter, as both of us are always left wanting to eat leftovers again the next day!<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great, simple way to make homemade Indian food that is quick enough even for weeknight meals, you will love this Biryani paste (and probably lots of other Kitchens of India products). Just be warned, if you use the whole thing, it will be SPICY.

review/summary: Spicy, Flavorful, and Delicious!!
review/text: If you find some of the Kitchens of India recipes a little bland, this one is the opposite: very strong flavors deliciously blend to create a wonderful meal.  This one takes a little longer to make due to the need to marinate the meet for 20 minutes, and also because the recipe calls for 1/3 cup lemon curd (I had to Google this but found it easy to make from a few common ingredients). So while not exactly a "heat and serve" recipe, it is still easy and very delicious if you like Indian spices.  My wife and I both loved the strong flavors in the dish, but my wife found it a little bit on the spicy-hot side, while for me "nothing is too hot", and this dish was just moderately spicy.  I was tempted to substitute yogurt for the lemon curd, but was really glad I made the lemon curd like the recipe said, because I could taste the hint of lemon in the final product, and it was a really nice touch.  I highly recommend this meal if you like strong flavored spice, and enjoy moderately spicy-hot foods.

review/summary: Poor instructions, poor taste
review/text: The instructions suck, and fail to mention that "lemon curd" is lemon yogurt. This is pretty important. The contents of the spice pack (consisting of the bay leaf, cardamom pods, etc.) are not removed or contained during cooking and are easy to get eaten (not so much the bay leaf, but the small seed/pod spices will give you an unpleasant jolt if chewed). I've followed the recipe (using lemon juice and plain yogurt) and experimented by using uncooked rice and simmering everything together instead of the pre-cooked rice it calls for, but the results are nothing even remotely close to a real biryani. Despite the other flavours that the spice pack should add, the overwhelming flavour is hot; there is no complexity, even if you use more rice to dilute the heat.<br /><br />I got this on sale and paid about $1 per pack, and even at that price it's no bargain, and not worth wasting the other ingredients on it.

review/summary: Feed this to your cat and it'll be strong and healthy.
review/text: My cat has been eating this since I found her when she was 2 weeks old. She was 9 ounces, a little scrawny feral kitten. Four years later, she is now a 15-pound muscle cat, and she has never (really! No kidding!) never hacked up a single furball. This food keeps her coat sleek and she is robust and vigorous. She is the first cat I've owned who absolutely does not shed. My vet remarks on how well she's doing and how far she's come, and I attribute it to the love and care...and all the good food. My vet also has told me how important a good diet is for proper brain development and although I cannot claim that Fromm's food made my cat any smarter,  it's reasonable to think she has benefited in lots of essential ways. I highly recommend it, and although it is admittedly pricey, it's well worth it. It's much better than anything else I've tried. She ate some of the most expensive supermarket brand for approximately 30 days once, and I could see the difference in the quality of her coat right away. She started shedding, for one thing, something I've never had with Fromm's. I like that it's manufactured by a company who is dedicated to producing a high-quality nutritionally superior pet food. Love your cat? Want a healthy cat? Feed it this food. End of story.

review/summary: I am so happy to have made the switch to Fromm
review/text: I had heard of Fromm through a friend, who knew, I cared about what I feed my fur family.<br /><br />To make a long story short. Before I made the switch, I was feeding my cat's Blue Buffalo. And, please understand that my review is not meant to knock another company but to relate my experience. I like Blue Buffalo but my cats, their bowl movements were so obnoxious. It made the whole house smell every time they used the kitty litter. I know I have a small house but this was disgusting.<br /><br />So, when I heard about Fromm and went to purchase for my dog. I had to check out the cat food. I decided to try the Salmon and I slowly introduced it into my cats diets. They took to it well. Their  digestive systems seemed to adjust easily to this food and after a short amount of time. I noticed a change when they use the kitty litter box. I no longer feel like I need a gas mask when the kitty litter has been used. My cats coats are much healthier looking and seem to be doing much better on this food then before.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an American owned and operated pet food company. All food, from what I understand is made here in the USA. Not only do I find this rare in this day and age but very comforting considering all the recent scares animal lovers faced with food bought that was made in China.<br /><br />Buying online was a first for me concerning cat/dog food. I am glad I did. I don't have to lug it home. It is delivered right to the house. The price is fair considering to other companies that sell this online and arrives in good condition. The cats are ready to eat right out of the bag.<br /><br />Please be full of care when your package arrives and you need to open it up carefully. If you are using a knife, scissors, or box cutter be mindful of the fact if you push to deep you will cut open the bag of food. If that happens it will go everywhere. I learned this lesson the hard way. :)<br /><br />My cats give this 5 purrs up and a big old Meow! High praise from my kitty cats!<br /><br />Thank you for reading.

review/summary: Love Tiesta Tea: will buy it again!
review/text: We love green tea, we love fruit teas: this tea has great flavor, is fresh and aromatic. The tin made several pitchers-ful that we drank hot when fresh brewed, then chilled and enjoyed later. Our college son wanted to confiscate it for himself and his roommates. We've tried other blends, too. Now I'm coming up with ideas to re-use the tins. I'll keep some and give some as gifts.

review/summary: Great cup of Green Tea
review/text: This is really a great little green tea. The flavor of the green tea comes through even with the sweetness from the gojiberry and pomegranate seeds. Enjoyed this very much hot, and can see that it would be excellant served over ice.<br /><br />Since Green tea loose leaves can be brewed more than one time, decided to see how it would stand up to a second brewing. The flavors still came through strong so I went for a third brewing and still was very statisfied with the flavor profile.<br /><br />Excellant loose leaf tea. Will be purchasing more of this in the future.
