review/summary: Black &Decker BD1769 Roary Garden Cultivator -
review/text: The cultivator is light yet very effectiven in covering the seeds sown on unprepared soil.  It is strongly built although it may sometimes feel incapable of handling areas consisting of an abundance of small stones.  The tines are very sharp and are not easily damaged by stones.  I owned another brand before which fell apart after a few uses. That seemed to be the result of the soft metal from which it was made and the tendency to jam during use for no apparent reason.  I recommend this cultivater to anyone who likes gardening and is not very strong. The price was right and the cultivator really does a good job -- thanks to Amazon.  Otto Gillings

review/summary: applaws chicken for cats
review/text: I tried this cat food because my one cat has stomatitis, which is very painful and he can't eat hard food when he has a flareup.  Also, my vet felt that allergies to additives and grains in cat foods could be part of the problem.  There is nothing in the applaws except shredded chicken breast, no taurine or other nutrients.  Romeo loved it.  It looked delicious and smelled like something you would want to eat yourself.  When I ordered a case of the 5 oz cans it was not so great.  The smell was off and my cat wouldn't touch it.  I ended up shipping the the case of larger cans back.  If this alone was fed to a cat, veggies or other nutrients would have to be added.  Now I am trying Weruva which has necessary nutrients added, but no grains or fillers. Bottom line is that smaller size cans are more expensive.  There dosen't seem to be consistency between these small cans and the larger size.  Also, necessary nutrients for cats not present.

review/summary: The best value in coffee so far
review/text: I learned to drink coffee in the Navy, so it was a long time before I learned that it didn't have to taste like battery acid, or have similar gastronomic effects.<br /><br />I started with Pete's and Seattle's Best, graduated upward to some excellent local roasters, and then after moving out to The Boonies, tried about every organic coffee on Amazon. Medium, dark, espresso, french roast, Italian roast, from nearly every corner of the globe; you name it, we tried it.<br /><br />Then I stumbled upon the Bean Company, which attracted me initially because it is located close to home. Think global, invest local, I say. We tried several of their roasts, and this one wins hands down. We use a Capresso burr grinder and a Saeco espresso maker, extra fine grind, compressed 40 pounds, and about a 25-second draw. Pure bliss. Perfect balance, perfect roast. Dark, yes, but never burnt. The French roast makes a better espresso than their espresso beans do, at least with our setup.<br /><br />Can you get better coffee. Yes. Definitely, but not for anywhere near the same price. I had a shot of espresso at Stumptown's in Portland last year that sent me out of this world, but so did the sticker shock. The Bean Coffee Co. french roast, on the other hand, is so cheap and so good that nothing comes close in value. You could spend 3-4 times as much, and not be as good.<br /><br />We've gone through about 30 pounds so far, with amazing consistency, and I bet we go through hundreds more.

review/summary: Dark Espresso
review/text: The bean quality and roast quality of this bean is a step above the average bean at this price point, but the darkness was a little more than expected. There seems to be a lot of ambiguity when buying a French Roast, so much that it's hard to gauge it's true meaning of darkness. This bean falls more into the category of an Italian Roast, being truly darker than the majority of French Roast's that I have tried in the past, mind you this is labeled as a "Dark French Roast".<br /><br />Remember, there is no such thing as an Espresso Roast, just blends. This bean does a great job at producing a quality / smooth espresso pull every time so far. You do need to grind it a lot finer than you would a mild bean, and don't expect the caffeine quality to be high (Darker the bean, the lower the caffeine). I pull a 28 second shots on a Gaggia Classic using a Virtuosa Percisio Grinder at setting 9k, and tamping with a Rattleware 58mm Tamper with roughly 30 lbs of applied pressure to the puck. The taste as said is smooth, but only for those who enjoy a strong, very bold, espresso drink. Makes wonderful Machiottos and Dupio Espresso though, be watching for a shot of the beans shortly.

review/text: This is a very refreshing and clean tasting product.  I love the fact that the tops come capped with this nice thick foil to keep any dirt out off the part your lips go.  The orange flavor has a bit of a bite which, to me, just means its not loaded with sugar to counter the bitterness.  Don't think this product is bitter, just not too sweet for my taste buds.  I hope to try the lemonata by the same manufacturer when it goes on sale.

review/summary: Very Tasty, Crisp Orange Soda
review/text: I have loved these San Pellegrino Aranciata's for many years now. Finding them here on Amazon for a subscription price of $16 and change was too great to pass up. They are generally around a buck each (or more) everywhere i shop.<br />The taste is bright and crisp, with just the right amount of sweetness. I dont let myself do so, but i could easily drink a twelve pack in a day if i wanted to. They are that delicious. They also make great mixers, if you are of a mind to enjoy an adult beverage.<br />So, for me, great deal, and a pleasure to have a ready and cheap supply.

review/summary: Price was right, but shipping method wasn't for this fantastic beverage.
review/text: First off, all of the San Pellegrino Sparkling fruit beverages are fantastic Italian style sodas!  I only wish Amazon would carry the San Pellegrino Chinotto (bitter orange flavor Italian soda), as it seems this flavor in particular is quite hard to find. In fact I can't find it at a decent price and in large quantities at all within a 110 mile radius of my city!<br /><br />Now I must say that the price was right for this product when I ordered it, but the shipping method didn't work out so well. The box was pretty beat-up, the corners seemed crushed and the walls were bending. The box was really a little too big and the bubble-padding material was either popped during shipment or not inflated when it was packed. For a product like this, it should be properly padded, as these types of carbonated beverages can explode or leak when the cans get dropped or dented.  Many of the cans were dented. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the package was dropped or had heavier boxes on top of it.  The carrier may have had no idea what was inside, but Amazon did.<br /><br />I felt lucky that none of the beverages exploded or leaked, being that most of them were dented around the edges of the tops and bottoms. Maybe this was just a problem with my individual shipment? It is just soda, but I think it deserves to arrive in new condition like any other item and not banged up.<br /><br />Overall, this product is wonderful. I would consider ordering it again as long as the price is comparable to buying it locally, but I hope my next order is packaged and handled with a little more care.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: I found this product to be much cheaper in the same quantities at a local club/warehouse type of store... I am now leery about about having items such as soda cans shipped and even more reluctant to re-order if the price is higher than what I can buy it for locally.

review/summary: please bring back the prime price for a case from March 2012
review/text: I am now sipping my last can from an order I placed March 8 2012. (As you can see it is July so I enjoy this beverage as a rare treat.) I shared this with 4 different family members during visits and they loved it too. The cost in March was $23.90 on subscribe and save.  A month or so ago Amazon informed me that the Aranciata was removed from subscribe and save.  As I slowly savor my last few sips I thought I would check to see if Amazon had reinstated this as a prime subscribe and save product.  Good Grief!  The price went up to $ 52.98 for the case (4 six packs).  I found it off prime for $17.98 + $24.60 shipping. I guess I am about to have the last taste of my first and last case of this yummy drink as an Amazon purchase.  :(

review/summary: Orange Crack!!!!
review/text: This amazingly refreshing fruit drink from Italy is the real deal. It's made with real orange juice, cane sugar, and carbonated water. The taste is crisp and slightly tart, without being sickly sweet. The typical American orange soda is way too sweet, with a noticeable artificial flavor. The only suggestion I would make to enhance this product is to cut the sugar altogether and substitute some additional juice concentrate, e.g., apple, pear, peach, mango, papaya, guava, etc.

review/text: First impressions is it looks like a quality product. What soft drink do you know of where each can has a gold seal over the top? San Pellegrino is the only soft drink I've seen that has that. The taste is like that of orange juice. It's lightly carbonated which works well for me as I can't drink normal canned soda without pouring it in ice first as I think the carbonation is too strong to drink straight. I prefer to drink tea most of the time, so I really like this soda a lot as it's only lightly carbonated. It's not overly sweet which is a big plus for me. It's very refreshing if you drink it cold. My new favorite soda.

review/summary: San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparkling Beverage
review/text: I found this refreshing beverage serendipitously while looking for something to drink on a hot Southern California day a while back. The 7/11 store was out of 7up and I was tired of the cola beverages, so in the specialty section with all the juices there were a few can of San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparkling beverage. I bought one of the Aranciata and one of the Limonata. I used to drink a lot of Orange Crush and Sunkist and those were too sugary for my adult taste and didn't drink an orange soda for years. . . until aranciata cam along. The fact that it contains 16% orange juice with a tad of sugar just enough for my palate. The Limonata has a lot of pucker power and is a bit to tart for me, but may be good for a mixer beverage. The Amazon price is reasonable with FREE shipping is great as this item is difficult to locate even though some say that Costco sells it, but wasn't stocked whenever I visit the store.

About a year ago I tried one of these and was blown away.  It was like someone rewound the clock 25 years.  This is actually a carbonated beverage that is refreshing on a hot day, doesn't load you down with sugar, and just tastes "clean". I don't know if it has enough additives for the American market, but I hope more people continue to buy it so I can get my fix a little cheaper.

review/summary: Great sweet orange taste
review/text: I hate sparkling water, so I was reluctant to try this for fear that it would taste like S. Pellegrino's sparkling mineral water...much to my amazement, I LOVE the taste of this! I love oranges, and although this beverage isn't really a strict, strong orange flavor per se, it has enough of an orange flavor to it that it can be categorized as an orange beverage. This looks like a traditional soda, since it comes in a traditional soda aluminum can. This, however, is more of a carbonated orange drink that is more cool and refreshing than any regular orange soda. It isn't excessively sweet, but it does have a bit of sweetness to it. By contrast, the limonata beverage <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KJ7FOY">San Pellegrino Sparkling Beverage, Limonata, 11.15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is fairly sour, so depending on what you're looking for, you can choose between the two. If you like oranges or if you are tired of the usual Sunkist/Fanta/Crush orange soda flavors then give this drink a try. It is a refreshingly different twist on a familiar flavor.

review/summary: Several packages for the same yummy product
review/text: OK, so I'm used to drinking (and have a preference for) the cans that have the aluminum top you peel back--it's a teeny tiny frustration to have to, well, clean the inevitably dusty, traveled top of any can, whether with a damp towel, rinsing, or my shirt if I'm not feeling particularly energetic.<br /><br />That said, the price through Amazon (at $2 higher than The Chef's Warehouse that charges $9.95 for shipping) is much better, and this is JUST the kind of thing that, while it's pretty near-identical the price of my local grocer, I appreciate not hauling far.<br /><br />Now about the soda... I'm NOT a soda drinker. I abhor that corn syrupy colored mess called cola (though Cheerwine keeps a spot in my less than three!)... in general, my stomach, as I sort of banned this drink category for 360+ days a year at the age of 13, gets very upset when carbonated water is put in it, especially with caffeine in most carbonated things... and another interesting tummy woe is orange juice. Unless it's fresh squeezed and "normal" orange juice (not the awesomely rich Florida kinds of oranges), well, I'm sorta not able to handle that, not even after prilosec entered my world.<br /><br />Now for the confusion. This stuff... it tastes amazingly fresh, the carbonation isn't excessive, with 18% juice, I get some natural vitamin C (pills are no good anyway, not for 99 thousand out of 99,001 people), and I'm not drinking pure buzzed OJ. I am also not getting mouth sores or anything of the sort that I recall getting when OJ was one of those everyday 12 ounces of it items... yeah, I wasn't terribly smart, but then again, metabolism of a hummingbird forgives just about all food habits... I'm older, wiser (don't use semicid), and this is that mature drink for me...<br /><br />I think it is perfect for people who, like me, can't do straight OJ, who can't quite bring themselves to inhale pure sugar/corn syrup sodas, who don't want their drinks tasting like food coloring, you get the picture... it just tastes like a fresh citrus spritzer, like the bubbling of champagne with the juice content of a margarita and no alcohol. If you like tonic water, this could replace that kind of unhealthy addictive drink (for your eyes in particular, as quinine leads to blindness when used for more than a couple months). If you like margaritas or screwdrivers or want some fizz without it being fake Fanta fizzle, then this is what to drink.<br /><br />It isn't particularly surprising (to me) that this happens to be my run-to drink when I'm eating cheesy Italian foods... it seriously was made FOR rich Italian dishes (seafood, I'm not so sure on--I think vino would be better for fish dishes)... plate me up something with creams, cheeses, maybe prosciutto and butter sauces, etc... and this somehow feels like its bubbling acid is helping my stomach along--maybe just because the most healthy of adult tummies still (well, when the diet has gone adult and is less saturated with fats, less gooey, less fried, less American in general) have some trouble digesting cheese on cheese on gooey awesome cheese with some roasted-in-olive-oil veggies, of course, and the occasional land mammal commonly consumed in Italy.<br /><br />My point? If you're eating pizza, calzone, lasagna, or even other Euro-derived foods... or if you're eating some fried chicken, even, this drink is an amazing counterpart. If you take anything like proton pump inhibitors regularly (prilosec, aciphex, etc., or even zantac types of meds), then this could be that perfect add-on when you go off your healthy food diet and splurge for something you know might irritate. No, I'm not selling it as a medicine, though mmm this DOES remind me of when cola used to be good stuff (when it was just a bit of sugar and when real cherries were in the cup) and why they decided to put some things in such syrups to deliver more effectively... it's darn good stuff. It's NOT your everyday soda. To my knowledge, they are adamant against using corn syrup, and having had the stuff in blue, in pale blue/yellow, and in a couple other cans, also having had it in glass bottles (panna is also made by them, so you can imagine the quality of the water that goes into this drink!)... well, it's all been some water, some OJ, some sugar (but not a lot), some natural CO2, and ... maybe natural flavor? Hmm, would have to get off my currenly lazy rump (with a currently terrible signal to post this review) and check... but I do indulge in this one soda here and there, despite "knowing better" from years in med school and more years teaching integrated nutritional sciences alongside medicine (to try targeting the source of so many health woes, we really DO have to check in on our diets!)...<br /><br />As long as it stays caffeine free and low on the carbonation (which is reckless and artificial in US sodas--really disgusting and rather harmful)... then I'll drink this... not daily, but maybe go through a 6 pack or 2 in a month, depending on just how often I do splurge on foods that my stomach feels just a bit... weighted down by... and I can even drink it on an empty stomach, meaning the carbonation is seriously low compared to our crazy sodas and "energy" drinks.<br /><br />Mmm, I think my lazy rump might need a bit of sizzling refreshment in the form of aranciata san pellegrino... the healthiest soda I've found SO FAR that still keeps its cost around a buck with tax.

review/summary: Neatly packed, efficiently cut, perfect for batch sizes for the home sausage chef
review/text: This was my first time ordering casings on amazon, and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Previously I've ordered sausage casings from Butcher Supply stores, and while the prices were agreeable, the casings were clearly designed with large quantities of sausage in mind, and usually arrived in large bags of saltpack, tangled up worse than a rats nest of TV cables.<br /><br />These however, come neatly packaged in a small, re-usable and re-sealable pouch. Any excess casings can be tossed back in with some kosher salt and be re-used quite easily.<br /><br />The casings also come pre cut in 10ft long strips which are just about the right size for stuffing small batches of sausage. Cooks looking to make batches greater than 5lbs will probably be turned off by this, but for someone like me who only has a kitchenaid mixer for my sausage stuffer, it's just the right size and length to work with.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic product, and I'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Worked fine but rinse repeatedly before use!
review/text: I'd never stuffed sausage before last week when we decided to make a batch of boudin blanc to take to my mother-in-law. From reading elsewhere, I knew that even if these casings looked clean they should still be rinsed. This not only ensures their cleanliness but helps expand them, too, thus preventing the tears mentioned by another reviewer.<br /><br />The casings should be cleaned after soaking in warm water for 30 minutes. Cleaning is most easily done by inserting the end of a funnel -- or sausage stuffer attachment -- into one end and *slowly* running warm water through the entire length, unraveling and untwisting as needed. This should be performed at least twice.<br /><br />Since we'd known to do that, we had no problems whatsoever with these casings. The boudain turned out wonderfully, and I'm looking forward to making more!

They were roughly the same length.  The bag said it would make 25 lbs of sausages and we made 25 lbs with no left over meat or casings even though we were not very consistent with our thicknesses.<br /><br />We followed the directions and soaked them for 30 minutes and rinsed them twice.  The casings were flexible but strong.  We ripped the casings only three times when stuffing, but each time I wasn't paying attention at the time.  Like I said first time sausage maker.  The casings smoked and bloomed nicely.  They worked great and were the cheapest I could find.  I would use them again and I am trying to find a local supplier.

We made various styles of meat sausages and the skins wokred out great, you have to be very careful not to over fill them, but this is more of a user controlled thing than anything that the skins could do differently.  The onyl downside for me was the quantity, I would have preferred multiple smaller packets inside the pouch, there was so much skin that you could have made sausages for a family for a year!  The product packaing suggested that the skins wouldnt last that long once the seal was broken so we prepared them all in water ahead of time and then tossed the stuff we didnt use.

You can make 4 to 5 sausages with each string. I used the Kitchen aid sausage stuffer attachement and the Eastman varity mix. Do not over grind your game. Use course blade one time if you can. Do use pork shoulder and pork fat, 40% for your lean game. I thought the Italian mix was the best and added hot peppers to make it even better. All good.

review/summary: Not all I had hoped for.
review/text: First the good aspects, and there were a few. The casings are easy to untangle and sort, and, when smoked and cured, they are not too tough to the bite as they sometime can be. However, there are some serious drawbacks. The casings I got were riddled with holes, most of which were too small to cause much trouble. However the majority of the casings in the pack had at least one serious breech that led to a number of blown casings in the stuffing process. If you get this product (not that there are many alternatives here), make sure that you inspect the casings carefully as you rinse them out and cut out any bad spots. You will get a shorter chain of sausage links, but you will avoid the frustration of a blown casing when you are halfway through a chain and all the associated waste.

review/text: Eastman natural hog casings are a fine product at a reasonable price. They are salt packed and will keep sealed, under refrigeration for a year. Easy to work with and the only downside is the kinda funky smell....but consider the source. Good to have an online source for those of us in the hinterlands.

review/summary: First time sausager, long time listener
review/text: I had never made sausages before; bought the kitchenaid grinder and sausage attachment; these casings...<br /><br />Results were spectacular.  I am holding a sausage-making party next weekend and these casings will be plentifully available.<br /><br />I rinsed mine for no more than five minutes, and let them sit in cold water.  Did not seem necessary to me to rinse for an extended period as another reviewer had noted.<br /><br />Biggest problem I had was I put them somewhere stupid in the pantry, made sausage mixture and then spent an hour tearing the kitchen apart and swearing at my loved ones.  At 10:30PM.  Glad the sausages were good!

review/summary: Great casings to work with
review/text: These casings weren't bad.  I generally buy from my local butcher but they were out, so these were what I bought. To work with, they weren't too terrible.  The ones from my butcher are a bit easier to handle, but, then again the ones I get from them aren't packed in a ton of salt either.<br /><br />Oh yeah speaking of the salt, make sure you really rinse these bad boys well.  On the package it says soak for 30 minutes, but at 30 minutes these weren't ready. I let soak an hour in tepid water, changing the water twice.  The runs are quite long, which I appreciated.  The day I used them I made 10lbs of chicken sausage.<br /><br />FYI, for those who use collagen: I started out on collagen because it was just easier to work with.  I gradually moved to natural because of the taste (they do taste better after cooking!) So while I did have to learn to use a more delicate hand with natural, for me it was worth learning.  So there's a tradeoff that each cook has to decide on.<br /><br />And out of all the sausage I made, I only had 2 major breaches.  In my book, thats not exactly terrible, because shit happens.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.

review/summary: Sausage Skins
review/text: I wasn't too sure this product would produce perfect sauasges. They surpass my expecations! They are so thin and give a sausage the prefect coating.<br />Have to work out the correct number to use, and how to master getting them onto the stuffer, but my second attempt (learn by disaster)gave me the easy perfect sausage I was looking for.<br />Begin by soaking them in cold water first while preparing the meat.Set up the stuffer and then GREASE the outside of the stuffer.Only a small amount of butter is needed! Place one end of a casing onto a small plastic funnel and run warm water through until they bloat up.Then thread the casing onto the stuffer and happily stuff your sausage with the meat.<br />Hint:- Feed the meat into the stuffer with  one hand and guide the casing with the other.<br />When cooked the sausage has the skin but so fine you can't taste it. Very fine product.

review/summary: Holes upon holes
review/text: I have made a lot of sausage, but this was my first time trying Eastman brand hog casings.  I used up almost an entire package of casings preparing for a recent large BBQ, and I was very disappointed with how many holes I found in each length of casing - between 2 and 5 holes per casing.  Any sausage maker knows the frustration of having to chop casings into 1-2' lengths - just as you get a groove going with your stuffing, you have to stop and put on a new casing.  I bought two packages of Eastman casings, so I am hopeful that I happened to have a bad pack... but when every casing in the pack as multiple holes, it leaves me doubtful.  I will happily update my review if I have a better experience with the second pack.<br /><br />Aside from the holes, I was satisfied with the casing.  They were well-packed in salt, plumped up and softened very nicely after soaking and flushing, and had a nice amount of snap after grilling.

review/summary: Essential product for the home sausage maker
review/text: I bought these casings for my first attempt at making fresh sausage at home. They arrived quickly and as described for the most part. There are a few key things to note about these casings:<br /><br />1. There are 5 separate casings (each to hold approx. 5 lbs. of sausage), which simplified the process for me as a sausage-making rookie.<br /><br />2. The package is resealable, which is great for making 5 lbs. of sausage at a time. The casings can be stored in their own salt or you can add a bit of kosher salt to ensure freshness for several months.<br /><br />3. After being soaked in warm water for 30 minutes, it's really necessary to rinse them in cold water a couple times to remove the intense salt flavor. I used a small funnel, which really simplified the process.<br /><br />4. Make sure to include enough water in your sausage recipe, or else these casings will tear rather easily as you stuff them. I used my LEM 5-lb. stuffer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQDTRC">LEM Products 5 Pound Stainless Steel Vertical Sausage Stuffer</a>) and suffered a few broken casings initially due to not adding enough water.<br /><br />5. These casings take smoke very well and have held up nicely in my Weber smoker.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this product for its convenience, natural taste and texture. The only downside I've seen is a lack of durability, but that's not much of an issue with a little practice.

review/summary: Less flavor impact than liquid
review/text: I had previously used faerie's finest liquid raspberry flavoring with good results.  As many of my recipes require a low amt of liquid, I opted to change to a powder.  The powder is much less flavorful than the liquid.  The smell is not obvious (expected for powder).  However, this same effect carries over into the product.  The powder and liquid measurements are supposed to be equivalent.  However, putting in 1/2 tsp of powder resulted in minimal scent and taste.  I ended up using twice as much powder as liquid to get an equivalent effect.  The powder is a much weaker flavoring product than the liquid.  The taste is OK but does taste a bit more chemically than the liquid.

review/summary: Don't Fault the Seller...
review/text: In the past, Knorr has had at least two versions of this product, one for Asia (I was told it is not to be sold in the US) and one for the West. This is the wimpy, nearly tasteless version intended for the West. Get the best - seek out the Asia version which can often be found in your local Asian market in spite of what Knorr says. It is MUCH better.

review/text: This is one of the best hot and sour soup mixes I have ever used. It's easy to make and very tasty. It comes out kind of murky but taste is great.

review/summary: Vegetarian and tastes good
review/text: This is the best tasting vegetarian beef flavored broth I have ever tasted.  My wife is a vegetarian, so I try to find products that meet her needs while still tasting close to the real thing.  This product meets the challenge.  While their beef flavored one is good, we find the Osem Chicken consomme to be even better tasting.

review/summary: Next best thing to getting them in Germany
review/text: These are just like the Lebkuchen we got in Germany, they really are very good and next best thing to getting them on the streets of Nuremberg at the Chris Kringle market. We also get them at Trader Joe's when available around Thanksgiving, but you have to stock up as they go fast.  I personally like the frosted and chocolate versions best.

review/summary: Packaged version of a German Christmas staple
review/text: While not as good as home or bakery made, these cookies are a tasty alternative of the traditional German Christmas lebkuchen. I buy them at Trader Joes when they become available each November. While drier than fresh-made, my friends and I still enjoy them. The gingerbread is mildly spiced and full or dried nuts and fruit. For the record, the white wafer on the bottom is not rice paper but egg-white, and would traditionally be an Oblaten cookie. The best Weissella are the chocolate covered ones rather than the plain or frosted. You might eat the first one out of curiosity and be uncertain if you love them afterward. But, I guarantee you will become addicted quickly. Happy Holidays!

review/summary: show one thing - sell another
review/text: I bought saffron advertized on this page from "GourmetFoodStore" - its not good and we didn't like it.<br />When I bought it, they were selling it as "AlTaj" Crown brand saffron which is much better in quality IMO. What I got was "Harvest of saffron" - the one displayed on the page now.<br />I had to send many emails to get a reply, I filed a buyers claim but the seller kept delaying their response and finally amazon close the claim as time-out -- hello amazon , you should have checked with me first<br /><br />So my feedback in short<br /> - I didn't like this "Harvest of Saffron. IMO Al-Taj and Gathering of Saffron are much better brands<br /> - I didn't like the seller. So check other's reivew and feedback about seller before buying.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.
