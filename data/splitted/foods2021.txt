review/summary: Great taste, poor shipping!!!
review/text: Love the flavor of this coffee!!!  My only complaint is the lack of thought involved in packing and shipping my items.  Not sure who the genius was who decided it would be great to ship an 8lb gate on top of the box of coffee, but I would love to meet him/her.  Needless to say, I ended up with 3/4 of the K-cups and the 1/4 of the cups which spilled over into the box, permeated coconut aroma all over my office.  The aroma lasted for days and smelled wonderful. Overall, I cannot knock the product, it tasted great!

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I REALLY like coffee.  And I strongly favor the darkest, boldest flavors.  I'm generally not a big fan of flavored coffees.  Most of them use the flavors to hide the fact that the coffee itself is not that great.  Imagine my shock when I found the opposite to be true of this coffee.  Even without the coconut flavor, this would be a rich, delicious coffee.  And the coconut flavor just serves to enhance what is already a tasty brew.  Quite simply, this is by far the most delicious flavored coffee I have ever tasted.  But do yourself a favor...try it yourself, and take a few moments just to inhale the aroma.  From the first tantalizing scent to the last sip, this coffee is a great  experience.  By the way...I just ordered some more of it!

review/text: I heard about this coffee late.  It is a Special Edition flavor of Green Mountain, that only comes out in the spring till it's gone.  I think it would have been even better with a more bold say medimum roast versus the light roast they use.<br /><br />If you like coconut it adds an unusual and different taste to coffee.  I would never have thought of coconut as a flavor for coffee but it is actually very good.

review/summary: My favorite flavored coffee EVER
review/text: Coconut sounded like a weird flavor for coffee, but then I remembered: years ago my favorite little coffee shop ago made a delicious Almond Joy-inspired drink that prominently featured coconut flavor, and I had completely embraced that recent Toasted Mochanut Frappuccino that tasted like a Samoa/Caramel Delight Girl Scout cookie ...so, apparently I already like coconut coffee! I grabbed a small box of this flavor once I'd worked that out, and I cannot believe how much I love it! Most flavored coffee is too in-yer-FACE! for me; I end up cutting it with unflavored because it's too cloying or strong, but this is just right. I have noticed that some Keurigs brew differently - the fancy one at my work makes this pretty weak, but using my super-simple one at home it comes out nice and tasty. For me, this one works just as well hot as it does iced. My only problem is that little "limited edition" label on this - I'm planning to stock up like it's Y2K. :D

review/text: My problem with this coffee is that it is too light. I can't brew it on the 10oz setting because by the time its about half done it looks like water dripping down. I tried it today on 8oz which was a little better but still very light. No I am not a strong coffee person. I prefer medium blends so I was surprised at how light this was. Otherwise I do like the coconut flavor, its not overpowering and its not too light but I won't buy again.

review/text: I can't say enough good things about this K-cup. This was one of the flavors brought into work recently and well, I've been in a coconut mood lately.<br /><br />First off, you can taste the coconut flavoring in this without it being overwhelming. One of the biggest flaws with flavored coffee is that many times you'll get drinks that say they're flavored with some sort of taste, but it's so subtle that you'll wonder if it was added at all. No worries with this- you can taste the coconut and it tastes good. The coffee underneath is nice and smooth, very drinkable.<br /><br />This really was a great tasting drink. Even with Sweet and Low (which I absolutely hate), the drink tasted great. If you're a coconut fan, this is a must try. Now I just have to figure out where my coworkers bought it and buy more of it for my house.

review/summary: Something different
review/text: I LOVE the Keurig brewing system and I have tried many different kinds of k-cups. This is up there with the good ones, in my opinion. I drink coffee every morning, and was looking for something different and "summery" to replace my pumpkin spice and hazelnut flavors (I know hazelnut is a classic, but it just makes me think of fall/winter for some reason). Like others have stated, the brew is pretty weak (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Don't buy this if you're looking for a full-bodied, bold coffee. The coconut flavor is really nice, and the smell when the coffee is brewing is to die for! I think it would be the perfect flavor for an iced coffee. Overall, I recommend this product to you if you have a variety of k-cups and want a fun new flavor to add in for something different.

review/text: I'm a coconut junkie, so was very excited to try this island coconut flavor.  It is extremely weak.  I use coconut creamer, and if I put in my usual amount of creamer the coffee turns white and has zero coffee flavor.  I'm not really a strong coffee drinker, but I like to be able to taste the coffee AND my creamer.  I'll keep looking for a stronger brew coconut coffee, and finish off this box mixing it half and half with regular coffee.

The coconut taste is wonderful without being too mild or too overpowering.  For me, this has been a great blend from Green Mountain. Much like their blueberry coffe, I will continue to buy the Island Coconut throughout the season.

review/text: I can say hands down this is the best coffee for me.  It is slightly coconut flavored and a very mild roast.  When you brew a cup the entire house takes on the island coconut scent.  I wish that they produced this flavor year round and I also wish it came in decaf.

review/summary: My favorite flavored k-cup!
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee should really consider making the Island Coconut k-cup available year round! It is my very favorite flavored k-cup! The taste is fantastic black and I also love it iced for a nice summer treat. It's not necessarily super sweet, but just right and enough flavor to make it an amazing coffee. I also get a lot of comments about how good my coffee smells when I bring this flavor to work in my travel mug. Please keep making this flavor, even if it is just available for part of the year!

review/summary: so good iced
review/text: This was one of the first K-Cup blends I tried. It's a very light coffee, and I was very disappointed with it as a hot drink. After some looking around I found people put it in the fridge and then have it as iced coffee.<br /><br />This is genius. The coconut flavor really pops when the coffee is cold, and it doesn't taste watery. I would not attempt to make it like the specifically iced drink K-cups but if you have time to spare, putting a cup of it in the fridge really makes it better...maybe add some chocolate syrup to it while it's still hot too...

She's pretty finicky but goes insane for chicken - this natural balance chicken & liver pate gets gummed right down. nomnomnom She gets a 6oz can per day and as much dry food as she cares to gum down.  She's been eating this since she was sick, and shes gained weight and her fur looks so much better.  My other cats get the dry version of this same Natures Balance - since they both have teeth.<br />Cat boxes will always stink but this stuff - compared to Friskies, etc., makes a huge difference in what comes out.

review/summary: Good cat food, but poor packing and shipping
review/text: Our cats have been eating Natural Balance for a long time. They like it and it's endorsed by our vet. I started buying it at Amazon recently to save a few cents a can and to have it delivered to my house since the cases of this can get heavy.  I buy 6 cases at a time. In both orders I've made,I've had to throw away two or three cans because they are so badly damaged that I believe the seal is broken, so I'm not sure if I'm actually saving any money.  In the last shipment, one of my cases was 1 can short and also had a damaged can or two in it so I only got about 21 instead of 24. The first time I ordered, I thought this was a fluke but it happened on this last order also, so shipping damaged goods is just part of their process.

review/summary: Two Cats give four PAWS Up
review/text: We have a 16-year old female cat, and a two-year old male that we adopted a year ago when he was a stray.  The male has "food issues" and wants to eat everything in sight.  He went from scrawny to over 12 lbs.  Our vet says that obesity in cats is related to too many carbohydrates, and she suggested giving him 80% canned and only 20% dry -- the reverse of how we used to do it.<br /><br />We wanted a good-quality canned food that both cats would eat.  Well, they both LOVE this food (chicken and liver pate).  I am measuring by tablespoon, and feeding several times a day -- no more demand feeding, we are counting cat calories!  The male seems satisfied, and the female now eats her serving at mealtime.<br /><br />I recently bought the fish flavor for variety, and they are eating that too.  The male needs to lose a pound, and I am glad that he is getting a high-quality food.  The price is a good value (if you get the flavors with free shipping), it costs less using these 6 oz. cans than those 3-1/2 oz. cans I used to buy at the grocery store.<br /><br />I wish all the flavors of Natural Balance canned cat food qualified for free shipping.

review/text: We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/text: I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

review/text: As my title says,my cats LOVED all of the gravy-they lapped it up before eating the pieces of chicken. However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

review/text: While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

review/text: My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.
