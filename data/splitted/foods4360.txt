review/summary: very tasty coffee
review/text: Historically, my wife and I have enjoyed drinking Starbucks coffee.  We both enjoy dark, full-bodied coffee.  With the prices of Starbucks climbing higher over time we decided to try the Dark Brazilian Santos coffee.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  It is definitely dark and full-bodied as we like, tastes as good as Starbucks or better, and costs far less.  We break up the 5 pound bag into smaller portions and store them in vacuum storage containers to preserve freshness.  It is a great bargain, we've already purchased more, and will definitely buy it in the future due to its great value and flavor.  Highly recommended.

review/text: A very tasty, low-acid brew that has plenty of good dark flavor without the almost burnt taste of many dark brews.  As a guy who drinks lots of coffee per day, this is easier on the gut without any loss of flavor.  Love it!

review/summary: Very Good Coffee... In a Big Ol' Bag
review/text: I took a chance and ordered this huge bag of coffee based upon the reviews of others.<br />If it were crappy, I would have had a lot of coffee to chuck. At least the garbage would have smelled nice that week...<br /><br />Well, luck smiled upon me and dropped off a 5-pound bag of very decent coffee on my doorstep.<br />(Actually it was a scruffy looking UPS delivery man, but I hear "luck" has many faces)<br />I'm very please with it. It's nit quite on par with the more expensive coffees I have had, but it makes up for it<br />by coming in a ridiculously huge bag that will take me months to go through. That being said, be sure to purchase some decent<br />storage containers to keep the beans in. You don't want to store them in the bag for a terribly long time, as they may go stale.<br /><br />~Rusty

review/text: I'm on my third 5-pound bag and the beans and price have been consistent. I use a french-press and make the coffee strong then serve it with hot soy milk. I like the taste and smell. I use the subscription option and save more. I had been buying a different brand but their price increased too much. I'll keep buying this one as long as the price stays reasonable and right now it is very reasonable. Thanks to the distributor for the good product!

review/text: I like coffee but I also suffer from acid reflux.  I can drink 3 cups of this in the morning with zero issues.  If I have a little extra time before my commute, I can handle a 4th with no reflux but the caffeine starts to cause jitters.<br /><br />One other item:  The flavor does change a bit when you use a paper filter.  If possible, make it with a permanent filter.

review/summary: Good coffee Great value
review/text: We are coffee lovers who cannot stand to drink stale coffee with bad aftertastes. We love good coffee but it can get costly when your pressing a 48oz french press everyday!So when I found coffee bean direct the price was right but was the taste? I decided to try it.The first flavor i bought was the city Papua New Guinea. It was too light for us we like our coffee on the stronger side. The best way to describe it is that it tastes like a decent standard restaurant coffee. The next one and current one we have is the Dark Brazilian. This one is much closer to what we like, it has a nice bold flavor and has a smooth finish. I would like to find one that is bold yet richer.We will continue to try Coffee Bean Directs other flavors. If your on the fence as to weather you should buy or not? Get off and buy some the price is right and the coffee is GOOD

review/text: So many positive reviews on this product made me eager to order.  I even went for Amazon's `subscribe & save' option for a discount price-which I've cancelled.  I'm not sure why I was so terribly disappointed.  It's possible I may have got an `off' batch.  The coffee I received had a flat not good taste.  It didn't even deliver an aromatic smell while brewing.  I've found grocer's cheap `house brand' coffees better.

review/summary: Weak, Arid and Acidic
review/text: Got sucked in by the reviews and promise of no shipping costs.  This stuff isn't even as good as Chock full 'o Nuts Regular out of a can.  Coarse ground and made with normal measurement (5.75 Tbsp to 48 oz. of water in my French press) produced a very weak cup that had no personality or body outside of moderate acidic tang.  Ugh.  By increasing to 6.25 Tbsp, got some body, but the flavor got very dry and arid, and any interesting notes or after taste were still woefully lacking - but I did develop a bit of headache - so I guess it wasn't a total loss.  Don't be fooled, support your favorite local or distant micro producer.

review/summary: Escabeche = vinegared sauce
review/text: Just to respond to the previous review, consumers should know that mussels in escabache means that they were cooked and then covered in a vinegared sauce to preserve them. The taste is indeed tangy and perhaps is acquired (I inhaled these when I was in Spain). Consider them tapas, and eat them on crusty bread with some wine or beer.

review/summary: Delicious treat; cans half full
review/text: Although a bit expensive, they are my preferred brand of escabeche mussels. Do not throw away any drop of that the escabeche sauce since it is soooo good on rice.<br />Appearance scores 5/5(max)<br />Odor 5/5 (max)<br />Quantity in can 2.5/5 suboptimal; lots of sauce<br />taste 5/5 (max)<br />texture 5/5 (max).<br /><br />UPDATE: after eating a dozen+ cans, I have noticed that some are really packed full of mussels while others are 50% full. Also some cans have deliciously tasting sauce and mussels while others have average sauce (= paler/seawater like) and average mussel taste. I wonder if any 'bad mussel' could explain this phenomenon which is fortunately seldom encountered but scary enough to make this product less appetizing to me suddenly. I still eat them nonetheless. I have too - I bought a few dozens!<br />UPDATE 2: the sauce which is so good is sometimes definitely diluted with salty water and this makes the product randomly but infrequently less appealing. Cans are elliptical BTW, not rectangular...(=less product).

These are probably not the same ones from the show but its better than nothing.  These are a bit too oily for my taste with a metallic tangy aftertaste.  They could be pretty good with some wine or some type of alcohol but then again everything is better with alcohol.  If you don't mind the metallic aftertaste then I would recommend this.

I'm not sure I like so many vitamins as a constant or as a substitute for good whole healthy foods. Would you like your food to smell like vitamins?

Also, it is totally addictive...the '12 servings per bag' on the label is *way* too optimistic! :p

review/text: Have tried the Chicken flavored one of this brand--YUCK!! This one isn't as good as the beef, but it's not too bad for the price. Bases are way overpriced for the most part, and since I also like to use it as  bouillon, this one is OK.

review/summary: Chicken Base (makes excellent broth)
review/text: The most superb textured and tasting Chicken Base which when mixed with water makes the greatest broth, gravies and much much more.  I have family gatherings year round, and they flock to my house just for the wonderful taste of this mouthwatering graving that is created especially when you add the drippings of chicken or turkey oils as they bake in the oven to the broth then thicken tom make a fine gravy with flour and water OR cornstarch and water.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!

review/text: This ginger has a pleasant taste, but is a bit bland.  I find it works well as a condiment for vegetables, where you wouldn't want a sharp taste anyway.  I like it with green peas.  I add a little margerine to the peas, sprinkle on about 1/8 teas. ginger, moisten the ginger with apple cider vinegar, and stir.  The ginger blends well with the peas and adds a little extra flavor.

review/summary: The coffee is great, but other buyers were right: mysterious punch hole
review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!

review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/summary: Amazing Espresso
review/text: I first discovered this coffee while in Italy and was so happy to find it here.  It does have that chocolate underlay.  I typcally make a latte with it and have found it to make a perfect cup in my moka pot.

review/summary: Nice Stuff!
review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite.

review/summary: Excellent espresso mix
review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/summary: You have to try this!
review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks. This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste. Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked. If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt&eacute;'s, the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />John S.

review/summary: The Real Italian Coffee
review/text: I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee.

review/text: I drink this coffee daily and I love it!<br />I am Italian and I know  Lavazza very well, that's the only coffee my family and I drink. If you are expecting a weak taste like the normal american coffee, do not buy this kind.<br />The flavor is strong, just like coffee should be.<br />I would raccomand to make it with of those italian coffee machines like Bialetti.
