review/summary: Great Baby Food and a Great Starter
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />1st Fruit Starter Kit<br />If you're like me trying to decide what flavor to give your baby the first time can be difficult. I had an idea because of going through this with my son, but my daughter (as it turns out) has completely different likes and dislikes. This variety comes with pears, bananas and apples. It's pretty basic and on a whole I think most babies like all of these, but you just never know. That's why I like it in this kit. You can try them out without having to hand pick and sort through a bunch at the store. It takes the guessing out of it. Yes, the price is a little high, but if you just need something to get you started it's great!

review/summary: Jar covers contain BPA ... So disappointing!
review/text: As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a "perfect lab" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).  So I may just take my "baby-food-business" elsewhere.

review/summary: Quality, convenience, and economy in a baby food
review/text: Earth's Best is one of the few brands of baby food that, having tasted it myself, I know tastes like real food - and not only like real food, but like really GOOD food. Other brands I've tested tend to be more bland, whereas Earth's Best seems to taste like actual food instead of "baby food."  My now seven-month-old daughter apparently agrees, as she has enthusiastically chowed down the contents of the entire pack (and she is a very discerning - okay, "picky" - eater). The starter kit provides an excellent sampling of the fruits that my daughter's pediatrician recommended as "starter" foods, as apples, pears, and bananas have a low probability of causing allergic reactions and do not have the adverse effects of acidic citrus fruits. My daughter has not had allergy issues with any of these, although she is prone to allergies, having even reacted adversely to oatmeal at 6 1/2 months of age.  Given the expense of Earth's Best in the store (locally for us it's $1 per jar - double the Amazon subscribe & save price!), I was thoroughly impressed to find it here for such an economical price.  In short, it's hard to go wrong if you're looking for a beginning sample as your baby ventures in the culinary world of his or her first fruits.

review/summary: Great food for little mouths
review/text: We only feed our 6 month old organic food.  We make some of our own, but this was too great a deal to pass up.  Its great to have if we will be feeding her while we are out or in the morning when I am too tired to deal with blending and steaming.  The food only has whats necessary for the baby, organic fruit, water for processing and vitamin c in the form of asorbic acid so the fruit doesn't brown.  It tastes good and I feel confident feeding it to her.

review/text: When I first started my son on solids, at about 4-6 months, I ordered these. He loved them. They are great tasting, organic, and good for him. There's no added sugar, which I love. They are in perfect little jars for little ones just atarting out. He's now one, so these are way too small, but I highly recommend them to other moms out there. :)

review/summary: Great Starter Kit!
review/text: I ordered the 1st Fruit starter kit as soon as I received the okay from the pediatrician.  The fruit contains pears apples and bananas.  My 6 month old loves the pears!!  The apples are okay for her and we haven't tried the bananas.  Her little mouth just flies open - it is hilarious!<br /><br />This is a good price for the package.  It is convenient because it comes packages on a box. Much better than putting all of the little jars in your buggy at the store - especially since I hardly have time to get to the store anyway.<br /><br />One negative is that sometimes my grocery store has buy 1 get 1 free - so the Amazon price is high compared to that.

review/text: I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself.  All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.<br /><br />I usually wrap these jars in a ziplock bag with a baby spoon and stash in the diaper bag for wholesome food on the go.  I like to feed my toddler what my husband or I eat, but it is great having a back-up if she is really not hip to the entree.<br /><br />Earths Best is the next best thing to mom's cooking ;)<br /><br />Off label use:<br />If you are out of oil when making baked goods, like pumpkin muffins, you can add a jar of complimentary flavored baby food in a pinch and they will still come out moist! Happy accidents are worth sharing!

I really wouldn't feed it to my baby, or anyone else for that matter!  The banana tastes unrecognizable, and I the pears and apples are so tart, they're disgusting.  I threw them away...I'd go with a different brand of organic baby food - Earth's Best just isn't very good.

review/summary: Good Quality Food for Baby
review/text: Just wanted to note regarding the BPA in the lid, all but very few products that are canned (metal lid or metal container) have BPA in them. I just don't scrape the food off the lid when I feed our baby. I still feel better about giving her this product over others since we may not know all the potential issues with plastic yet and organic food has been noted by some to help with immunities.<br /><br />Also, when first starting on baby food, my daughter takes three sessions to eat one of these containers. Since they need to be eatten within 3 days of opening, I think the smaller size works well for us. When we've gotten through these and have exposed her to these items, we'll buy the stage 2 foods for her which are larger and hopefully she'll have the eating thing down by then and be able to eat a larger amount.<br /><br />Overall, we are very happy with this product.

review/summary: Okay baby food
review/text: I actually bought this just for the jars to use as party favor gifts!  But I figured I would feed the food to my 10 month old daughter.  She eats just about anything, but wouldn't touch the bananas.  I don't blame her.  They smelled awful and they were pink.  But she ate the apples and pears just fine with her plain yogurt.  I wouldn't buy this food again for the food.  The pouches with mixed fruits are much better.

review/summary: Great product but constipating
review/text: I like earths best ,and so does my infant.  However, I do not find this starter pack to be useful for me because my babies tend to be constipated for a while after starting solids and it takes a few months for their system to sort it all out.  So I've used up all of the pears and one banana but am wary of giving my baby the rest of the bananas and apples.  It would have been a lot more useful to me to get just a 12 pack of pears, or pears, peaches and prunes.

review/text: I purchased these for the convenience factor. I primarily make all my own baby food but don't like to take homemade food while out and about so I purchased these for when we are running errands. My little one doesn't seem to mind them but he has only had a few of the flavors. I decided to go with Earths Best because I wanted an organic product. I know some are worried about the BPA used in the lids but unfortunately I think BPA is used on all jars and cans and I wasn't able to find an alternative product that didn't use it. I have found that my local Walmart and Target sell these for a little cheaper at only $0.54 a jar.

As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty.

review/summary: The bananas make this NOT a bargain
review/text: Be warned:  the bananas in this variety pack are DISGUSTING!  The apples and pears taste good, like the fresh fruit tastes.  The bananas however are quite nasty and do not taste anything like fresh bananas.  It might be because of the citric acid in them, but it's got a funky smell and a tangy bite to it.  Even the color is off.  I bought this variety pack thinking I was getting a deal this way, but now that I'm throwing away all four jars of the banana it's ended up being quite expensive.  I won't be buying the variety pack again.  I'll buy jars of apple and pear again, but I'll be sticking with fresh bananas from here on.

review/summary: Disgusted!
review/text: I used to buy all the earths best products for my kids. My 18 month old loved the Elmo pasta and sauce that comes in a can. However after purchasing a case of the Elmo pasta and sauce I opened the can and found bugs! There were tiny bugs that looked like baby roaches!!! I continued to open all the cans in the case to find they all contained 2-4 bugs per can!!! I called the company and was offered coupons as a compensation. She assured me that this was an isolated Incident. I told The company to keep their coupons because I will never be purchasing their products again! Makes me wonder what their plant looks like. I am throughly disgusted that I have been feeding my 6 month old the jars of baby food. Just wanted to make others aware......

review/summary: Easy To Eat Without Choking
review/text: Sometimes in the car I can't be bothered to stop at Mackdonolds for some nugs. Baby food makes snacktime a snap. I just scarf that stuff down when I'm waiting as that fat jackface crossing guard lets all of the little kids walk across the street by the preschool like they own the god damn place. So yeah, banana is really delicious, pear is good too but it's really messy and I have to wear a bib. I got a bib embroidered to look like my tuxedo so that nobody can tell I'm wearing it. One time I forgot I had it on and walked into the gas station wearing it and Bruce made fun of me for like a week after that. He called me bib-baby. He's just mean.

review/summary: Authentic Mexican Restaurant Taste
review/text: Just as with the Original Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan Hot Sauce, this salsa has a unique, addictive flavour.  We've been a salsa family for two decades but have never tasted any salsa at home which has the rounded, authentic flavour that this salsa has.  Is it the cactus?  (An ingredient that we never see here in Canada)  or the tequila?  or a combination with cilantro and spices?  I don't even want to know.  I just want to know that these products will always be available.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you should give this salsa a whirl...don't hesitate.  It's simply the best salsa we've ever tasted.  I'm sure you'll agree.

review/summary: Excellent food, big hit with the dog...
review/text: I bought these on sale and was hoping my dog would like them as much as he does the stella and chewy's freeze-dried. He absolutely does. And I love freeze-dried raw too, b/c the ingredients are all natural, less processed, teriffic ingredients and always a huge hit with the pup.<br /><br />I feed them re-hydrated, which imo is the only way to feed when as part of or a whole meal (as opposed to tiny bits at a time for treats). I can't remember if it says it on the Nutrisca packaging, but on Stella and Chewy's packaging they make a point to write: "Your pet should consume 1/4 cup of water per patty daily". So it's easier for me to rehydrate so that my dog can start to get the amount of extra water he will need (does that make sense? lol). I just put a few patties (my dog is 8lbs) in a bowl, fill with water, wait 1 or 2 mins then take them out and break them up and put them in his dish. My dog dives in then seconds later looks to me for more. They must be yum yum yum indeed.<br /><br />Anyway, of course i would not feed my dog these freeze dried dinner bites for his complete diet, they're just too expensive for that, but i do make a point to make his diet about 20+% raw, whether that is freeze-dried, air-dried (like Ziwipeak) or frozen raw. This way he gets some less processed food in his diet complete with the meat, bone and organs that is part of a dog's ancestrial diet.<br /><br />The difference btwn these freeze-dried patties and S&C's is fairly minimal. The biggest difference for me is that the Stella/Chewy Freeze Dried re-hydrate much faster, which i prefer. Biggest difference ingredient wise that i can see are the probiotics in the S&C, and a slight difference in the protein to fat ratio. So even though i slightly prefer the S&C b/c of the fast re-hydrating, i would be happy buying whichever is less expensive at the time.<br /><br />Nutrisca:<br />Chicken with Ground Bone, Chicken Liver, Apples, Chickpeas, Peas, Flaxseed, Chicory Root Extract, Cranberries, Salmon Oil (a Source of DHA), Dried Kelp, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Mixed Tocopherols (Preservative, a Source of Vitamin E), Vitamin D3 Supplement.

review/summary: Tastiest and best nutrition of any energy bar
review/text: I love these bars, I'm so glad that Amazon has started carrying them, as it's difficult to find them in sufficient quantities!  I literally eat one or two a day, and though a number of grocery and healthfood stores carry them, they often don't have the full cases I need.<br /><br />The low GI takes a little getting used to at first - you won't get an instant sugar rush like you will from other energy bars, but an hour or two later, you'll still be sated and won't be craving more carbs.<br /><br />Great science, great taste (I prefer the chocolate and chocolate mint, but my wife prefers the berry and lemon), and these make it easy to get the healthy small meals I need to maintain even blood sugar levels (no, I'm not diabetic, but I've lost significant weight and kept it off by switching to a low-GI diet and more frequent, smaller meals).

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I have searched high and low (no pun intended) for a convenient snack bar that tastes great and does not spike blood sugar.  I cannot tolerate Aspartame, Splenda or any of the other artificial sweeteners out there and trying to find products that have stevia or agave nectar are not that easy (and those I've found have honestly not been that great).<br /><br />These chocolate bars have a wonderful, chewy texture and they taste (to me)like a regular candy bar.  Obviously, you can't go crazy and eat the whole box at once (although you will be tempted), but these wonderful bars will give those who try to eat low on the glycemic index the opportunity to enjoy a real treat.<br /><br />Although the other members of my family are not bound by the same dietary restrictions, they LOVED these bars.  I can tell they are going to be the treats of choice in my house.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/text: Thank you for selling these Solo bars.  Our local supermarket used to carry these and stopped.  I have trouble with hypoglycemia, so need energy bars with low glycemic index and no chocolate (berry or lemon). Solo is one of the few or only bars that tastes great and doesn't cause sugar problems.  Thus I have become dependent on having these with me at work and on trips for the mid morning sugar low or pre workout snack in afternoon.

review/text: My family really likes these SoLo Bars.  They are not your run of the mill breakfast bars. These do not cause your blood sugar to shoot up and then drop like a rock which leads to feeling hungry again.  None of us are diabetic but my teenage son eats these while exercising and my husband, an M.D., mentioned the other day that he noticed that he felt better all morning after having one of these on the way to work instead of the oatmeal bars. Just getting a comment from my husband really made me take notice.  We also subscribe to these and often run out.

I have not had one day where I lost my stamina and could not compete at a maximum. I suggest these bars to anyone who needs energy for performance conditions. They are great period, and I love all the flavors. It is a struggle to keep my boyfriend from stealing them from me since he now chooses the solo bars over his favorite Cliff Bar. Thievery is the only disadvantage I can think of.

review/text: These bars are so delicious that I have to stop myself from eating more than one at a time.  They are loaded with fruits (purees) to help with your daily fruit and vegetable requirements.  This means they are loaded with antioxidants as well as added vitamins and minerals.  Whey protein is the first ingredient so you get 20% (11 grams) of your daily protein requirement.  And this little bar also has 3 grams of fiber or 12 % of your daily needs.  It does contain milk and soybeans and is made in a facility that makes other products using wheat, tree nuts, peanuts and eggs so if you have allergies to these items, don't buy this product.  If you or anyone in your family needs a quick meal (200 calories/bar) on the go....I recommend this really delicious bar.

My favorite is the Lemon, and then the Berry.  So many bars are chocolatey and I'm not a chocolate lover, or are made of nothing but lightweight cereal as the main ingredient, and that doesn't stay with you much longer than it takes to chew it.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: Seeing the all the positive reviews, I figured I would give these bars a try and maybe to have an alternative bar for all Atkins bars I eat.  So much for the good reviews, and supposed use by Olympic athletes.  First thing I noticed the pronounced chocholate flavor which overpowers your taste buds.  The bars also have a rather bland and sugary taste.  I have tried all the Aktins bars, and virtually all of them are superior to this bar (I have no affiliation with Atkins).  All my family members pretty much agreed with my opinions on the taste.  These bars fit into the category of the barely edible health bars (the great majority of health bars are awful). Maybe other brands of Solo are better, but I'm not going to waste my money trying them.

One jar lasts me about a month & that is with one protein shake a day.  I like to use the smoothie maker with mine & put juice in first.  I also use kefir with it.

review/summary: Misleading name to an awful product
review/text: I am a Paleo dieter by the strictest sense, meaning I avoid grains, soy, legumes, and all other non-Paleolithic carbohydrates.  I purchased this product with the assumption that it would fall under these guidelines (that and I couldn't find a decent review that discussed what was in this product).  The main source of protein is from peas, being a legume and containing anti-nutrients and lechtins.  Why of all sources of protein this company decided to choose this plant is beyond my understanding.  Protein from plants, especially legumes, are not easily digestible and can actually cause you to gain weight, let alone get in the way of detoxifying your body.  There are unnatural percentages of vitamins and stimulants such as taurine (major energy drink ingredient) that it shouldn't be taken by any person whether following a Paleo diet or not.  And the #1 complaint of this product that shouldn't even be a factor in dismissing this product: THE TASTE!  Out of all my experiences with powdered drinks, I've never had one that 1)looked like bile/urine, 2)taste like bile, 3) mixed incredibly poor until I wasted $60 on this atrocity of a "supplement".  I'm sure there are cleanses that work out there, but do your body, taste buds and wallet a favor and steer clear from this product.  It does not belong in the Paleo diet, it doesn't belong in any healthful diet, and it's barely a supplement in the general sense.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

When you spread them around crackers or bread, you feel "Garlic & Herb"  which is very delicious serving for parties or personal occasions.  These Sonoma Jacks are very rare, and can't be found in Markets or Internet.  So, ones you find them, don't hesitate to snag them or they will be gone for months.  God bless this company for bringing an excellent quality product to the Market.

review/summary: 16 cats love it...
review/text: I have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this.  I have tried Wellness, Holistic, Avoderm, Chicken Soup for the..., Merck Homestyle, BG (Before Grain), California Natural, and Evangers with mixed results.  This is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it.  I've fed them the Chicken and Liver flavor and the Seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally.  I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.  I'm a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop, less litter use, fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most.  They have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked.  I also wanted to add that this is a very STRONG smelling brand of cat food, almost overpowering when I open the cans at feeding time.

review/summary: Nice to find product thats safe
review/text: Our older cat is having some health issues, which I "suspect" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the "fish,chicken & liver" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the "seafood savory dinner". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them.

review/summary: Great quality food and my cats LOVE it.
review/text: I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain "Menadione Sodium Bisulfite" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.

review/text: My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.

And the texture is crisp, without being hard.  Only problem is that you have to order a whole case.

review/summary: This is not the tea storage box you are looking for!
review/text: If you are looking for a tea storage box, and happen to stumble upon Amazon's subscribe and save page on two leaves and a bud tea presentation box, please note that teas are included, even though Amazon specifically says "Two Leaves and a Bud Bamboo Presentation Box (Tea Not Included)". This is a problem, as if you don't like the box, you cannot return it. And, in my case, bamboo box is poorly constructed and edges are not properly put together (gaps, rough edges, low quality construction). Definitely not what I would consider a presentation box!<br /><br />And, if you are wondering about the product dimensions (as they were not listed on the page, but provided by one of the reviewers), here they are (in inches):<br />- outside dimensions: 15 3/4 x 7 x 4 1/4<br />- inside sections: ~3 1/2 x 3 1/4 and true to the picture, there are 8 sections<br /><br />I can't comment on the tea, as I haven't tasted it yet.<br /><br />PS. Yes, I did think it was strange for Amazon to offer subscribe and save on a bamboo box.... But there was nothing on the product information to indicate this was anything but an empty box! And, I have seen stranger things :)

review/summary: Bamboo Shocker!!!
review/text: I was shocked! I was looking for a basic bamboo tea box, and I ran across this box from one of my personal favorites, "Two Leaves and a Bud", so I gave it a shot. Upon delivery, I was pleasantly surprised to notice the build quality & the size of this box. It is absolutely huge. I actually use this at my office now as my "tea chest" and currently I have 6 varieties of Green and White tea and it holds over 140 packets of bag tea at this time. I see where it was "rated" for 80 bags and with the official "Two Leaves and a Bud" packs, it does tend to fill up slightly quicker, but I still can fit at least 120 without any problem or damage to the tea inside the sections.<br /><br />Since there are no other pictures with this listing, it is really hard to imagine the inside. The bamboo top is hinged and made of great quality. It is very cleanly and precisely separated into 8 individual box cubes defined by hand-placed bamboo wall dividers between each section. It is quite simply a very beautiful and amazingly priced tea box that I envision will last for many years to come.<br /><br />The only caveat which is small (in ideology but the reason for my 1 star deduction) is the bold graphical logo. It is quite large in reality and does stretch at least 8" across both the top AND the INSIDE cover of the box. I thought that the advertising could have been more understated, almost generic and perhaps used Japanese symbols for wellness, green tea or just happiness for the interior cover instead of just another loud bit of advertising. (But this is purely cosmetic in nature and may not offend anyone else out there)<br /><br />Bottom-line: Here's to a wonderful box for a great price.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: Seriously?
review/text: I should have paid attention to the negative reviews, I guess. I was looking for an inexpensive tea chest. Nothing fancy, just a basic box. After waiting from September 24 (when I placed the order) till today, October 4, the tea chest finally arrived. The logo on the outside of the box is facing the wrong direction which is really irritating -- but even better is the fact that the logo INSIDE the chest is also facing the wrong direction (ie: it's upside down). I realize you get what you pay for but for $20 I would have expected that the logos would at least be properly applied. Beyond that, it's at least fairly well made, and the hinges line up and so on. It's just the logos totally destroy the look of the chest and you can't even remove the lid and put it on properly because of the way it's made. Don't waste your money, is my vote. Oh, and incidentally, a bunch of people were saying that the tea IS included -- it was not included with mine. Despite the fact that the tea is NOT included and the logos are improperly applied, this item is "ineligible for return" so I am stuck with the upside down logos. Swell. Save your money, unless you're willing to be stuck with it. :/
