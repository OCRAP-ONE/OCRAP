review/summary: If you need to use formula this is the BEST!
review/text: When I suffered from a low milk supply with my 3rd child I tried many formulas until I found this one. My baby refused all others. This one is the closest tasting to breast milk, has the best ingredients, and spit up is no where near as foul as with other formulas.<br /><br />It can cause a bit of constipation, so I recommend talking with your ped about it. Mine recommended giving my baby 2oz of prune juice 2x a day. (And he was a Preemie) It does bubble up a LOT if you shake it up when mixing. Use a spoon instead, or add 2-3 drops of gas drops into the bottle. (Wal-Mart sells the generic form of Mylicon for around $4 and you get double the amount, instead of $12)<br /><br /> I have had another child since I first found this formula and I would use nothing else! Oh, and remember to save the UPC codes to mail in...you get 1 can free for every 12 you buy!

review/summary: The Best Organic Formula
review/text: After a 9 month long research on organic baby formulas,I ordered this one for our 9 month old son,who was exclusively breastfed since birth.I made my decision based on the fact that Baby's only formula does not contain Life's DHA,wich is produced from algae and one of the process in manufacturing it involves bleaching.the so very popular DHA and ARA,are now in almost every infant's formula,claimed to be part of important brain and eye development.Somehow the bleaching process made me insecure and that is why I chose this Formula instead of Earth's best who contain Life's DHA.As I mentioned aboveour son was exclusively breast fed for 9 months.However he liked the formula from the first bottle we gave him.It has pleasant smell and taste,it foams quite a lot,but if let to stand for about 5 min the foam disappears.<br />I contacted Nature's One,based on the reviews that I read,said that you have to order scoops,because they were not included in the box of formula.that turned out to be old information,now every box has a scoop inside.My experience with the company's customer service was very pleasant-they sent me 4 scoops,even though the boxes that I got already have scoops included.<br />Overall we do not have any complains about this formula,our baby loves it and we feel better knowing that we give him The Best Organic Formula in the US market!!!!!

review/summary: happy foster mom; healthy foster baby
review/text: Unable to breastfeed my foster baby, I wanted to give her a healthy start. I wanted to find a formula that didn't contain Corn Syrup as the first ingredient!!!! I researched, talked to friends and found this. My foster baby is tolerating it perfectly and it is actually cheaper at Sprouts than the crap she was getting at Walmart. It is even cheaper to buy by the case direct from their website and you don't pay shipping by the case. I am proud to be giving this special baby the healthiest start possible.

review/text: Just thought I would let you all know...you can get this formula WAY CHEAPER!!! I use this for my son and I absolutely love it...and he does, too. I go to a local all natural/organic grocery store and get this formula and they give you a case discount (a case is 6 cans even in the store)...so I pay $55 for 6 cans and they are selling 6 cans on here for like $84! That is just outrageous to me! So, I would check around at local all natural markets before buying this formula from amazon! Not EVERYTHING is cheaper here! :-)

review/summary: Warning - arsenic found in this type of baby formula
review/text: I was looking for a formula for my toddlers and was shocked to learn today that those made with organic brown rice syrup contain particularly high levels of arsenic, compared with products without this syrup.<br /><br />Seventeen baby formulas were tested in the Darmouth College study. According to the Today show, "Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on."<br /><br />The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit.<br /><br />The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate. I for one will be passing on this product.

review/summary: Good tasting formula
review/text: I have a two month old baby whom I exclusively breastfeed, but due to his grows I find it hard to keep up with his appetite sometimes, so I was looking to formula reviews to supplement with from time to time. Baby only organic formula has the best reviews so I bought it. Well I did not give to my baby yet but it sure tastes great when you compare it with other formulas. I had a saples of Simlac Adwance and Infamil Lipil. I tasted all of them. Similac and Infamil taste like sweetened poison! Awfull! I put into the garbage can right away. Baby Only Organic Formula tastes very similarto breast milk and it is organic and all natural.

review/summary: THE VERY BEST YOU CAN BUY!
review/text: My baby had a horrible reaction to Similac.  He could not suck and breathe at the same time.  He made terrible noises while trying to suck and you had to take the bottle out of his mouth every 15 seconds so he would not choke.<br /><br />We took him to a "specialist" at Miami Children's Hospital.  The doctor said that it was NOT THE FORMULA.  He put my baby through some test where the baby was screaming terribly.  Then he wanted us to come back so he could stick a camera down his esophagus. We never went back. We changed his formula to Baby's Only and the problem immediately went away on the first bottle!<br /><br />I firmly believe that the baby would have been quickly given a feeding tube.  That's how bad he was on the Similac! By the way, all the other infant formulas are the same as the similac. It has do do with the DHA that is derived from fungus and algae and also that they are genetically modified.<br /><br />EVERY BABY THAT IS NOT ON BREASTMILK SHOULD BE ON THIS!

review/summary: A LOT of mix, luckily it's good!
review/text: So, I bought this after running out of margarita mix.  WHILE drinking margaritas.  It's worth mentioning that I had had a couple of margaritas by the time I bought this, which would explain why I didn't remember it the next day, and was quite surprised when a box of SIX bottles of margarita mix showed up at my door.  On a side note, I think Amazon should have a breathalyzer before being able to buy anything, but anyway.<br /><br />I've been using this brand of margarita mix for years.  I normally buy it at Walmart, but it's much cheaper buying it on Amazon (plus I'm stocked for the next couple of years!!).  The box was quite heavy (as you can imagine), but it held up well during shipping.  The bottles came with the tags you stick on the top for stocking on store shelves, which I got a kick out of for some reason.<br /><br />The mix makes GREAT margaritas.  I've had many complements on my drinks, and all I've used was this mix and some tequila (if I want a sweeter drink, I just dump some Triple Sec in there too).  It's super easy to make a good margarita with this mix.  I highly recommend it, especially if you don't normally have a bunch of fruit and drink ingredients hanging around.

review/summary: Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence
review/text: The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.  They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.  It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />"Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact."<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor.

review/summary: So many uses!
review/text: I may be biased, as I have helped create some of the recipes available on thevegg.com, but I think The Vegg is a terrific product!  I have been eating a vegan diet for over 20 years, and I can't think of any other vegan egg yolk substitute.  One of the coolest ways to use The Vegg is to make a spherified Vegg yolk.  You can drop a quantity of The Vegg (once mixed with water) into a 1% (by weight) solution of calcium chloride and the liquid will form a ball with a membrane around it - which looks and tastes just like an uncooked egg yolk.  Try placing a spherified Vegg yolk in the center of a ravioli with some tofu ricotta or sweet potato filling - vegan gourmet for sure!  Just this weekend I saw calcium chloride granules on sale at Lowe's - Ball brand packages them for use with canning.  If you want more information about spherification, there is a link to a video at thevegg.com.  Also, if you haven't made french toast with The Vegg - go try it, NOW!

I've also used it to replace an equal amount of oil in pancakes -- healthier and tastier.

review/summary: The Vegg has perfected it!
review/text: Because so many people have egg allergies or choose not to eat animal products, there are several egg replacers on the market and egg-replacement suggestions out there.  The Vegg is obviously the result of experimentation with natural products and, using the techniques explained on the package for reconstitution, is superior to the other pre-packaged egg replacers.  We have used it to make a credible vegan "french toast".<br /><br />The only reason for four and not five stars is that The Vegg is pricey, and since the ingredients listed are not that expensive, is clearly based on the high demand for such a product.  Since we like the banana-based "french toast" from Isa Chandra Moskowitz's Vegan Brunch book just as well, we probably won't be buying it often.

You can make a large batch and keep it handy in the fridge. Make sure you follow the directions, there's no way you can whip this stuff by hand.

review/text: As Harvard celebrates its 375th anniversary, the Harvard Gazette is examining key moments and developments over the University's broad and compelling history.<br /><br />Baking, whether breads, cakes, or muffins, is ultimately about the bubbles.<br /><br />More than 150 years ago, a Harvard professor figured out how to put the bubbles into bread, making a lasting contribution to both the culinary arts and the pantries of modern kitchens through baking powder.<br /><br />For millennia, the bubbles that gave bread and other baked goods their light texture came from yeast, which gives off carbon dioxide when mixed with flour and water. The gas forms bubbles in the dough, which expand on baking.<br /><br />In the 1800s, the search was on for a way to make bread that didn't require the hours that yeast takes to work. Harvard chemist Eben Norton Horsford hit on the right combination.<br /><br />Horsford was the Rumford Professor of the Application of Science to the Useful Arts, and was among the first faculty members at the precursor to Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), the Lawrence Scientific School. Horsford arrived at Harvard the same year the School began, 1847, and his appointment was transferred to the School on its creation. He also served as Lawrence Scientific School's dean for several years.<br /><br />Horsford took the "useful arts" in his title seriously, and much of his research applied to practical, everyday matters. Over the years, he examined the best metal to use for Boston's water pipes. He created a compact "marching ration" for the army in the Civil War. And he developed a process for making condensed milk that was used on an expedition to explore the Arctic and was then sold to the Borden company.<br /><br />But baking powder has proven his most lasting legacy. Earlier bakers had tried different formulations to substitute for yeast, but each had drawbacks, according to a history posted on the American Chemical Society's website. Most of those formulations included sodium bicarbonate, baking soda, which creates carbon dioxide gas when combined with an acid and water. Common formulas used sour milk or cream of tartar as the acid, but varying levels of acidity in the milk and an unreliable supply of cream of tartar made neither substitute ideal.<br /><br />Horsford began working on the problem in 1854 and came up with a combination of acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate. He eventually added a bit of corn starch to keep the product dry until used.<br /><br />Horsford partnered with George Wilson to found the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, R.I., named after Count Rumford, the benefactor who endowed his chair at Harvard. Horsford marketed his baking powder formula as Rumford Baking Powder, which is still sold today.<br /><br />The advance was recognized as a milestone in America's chemical history by the American Chemical Society in 2006. The society named the Rumford Chemical Works' East Providence site a National Historic Chemical Landmark, with the citation: "As a result of Horsford's work, baking became easier, quicker, and more reliable."<br /><br />when I told the tale of just how long Harvard has been involved with advancing cooking through technology. I think it suggests a deeper truth: Harvard has always been an innovator, and often in unexpected ways, and that engineers of all persuasions are infinitely curious and want to connect what they do with the wider world."

review/summary: Better then Diet Regatta but worse then anything else
review/text: This brand has very little going for it. I'm a huge ginger beer fan, in fact I'm drinking one right now, and I have to say that this doesn't come close to the other ginger beers Ive had in the past including my personal favorite "Barritts." Very little carbonation and ginger "tang" put this on the same level as "Regatta's" diet alternative.

review/text: Was skeptical but had to try these for myself.  Like the other reviews they do smell a bit, not a turnoff smell though.  After you rinse in water then boil for a minute or so the smell is completely gone.  Then I sauteed in a pan w/tbsp olive oil added ground ginger and garlic, fresh parsly, tsp. yellow mustard, tsp. sugar free ketchup and 3 tbsp soy sauce and sauteed with fresh broccoli...was delis h.  I would recommend to people and just be creative with how you prepare them.  Next time I will make Pad Thai love that dish and these will work great.  Maybe I'll use the fettucini shaped ones.  All the styles of noodles are made the same just different shapes to choose from.

review/summary: Love!
review/text: Love these noodles!  I was skeptical after reading other reviews, but here is what I found...  First, the items shipped quickly and arrived before estimated and expected, which is a big plus.  Others have commented about a fishy smell when they first opened the bag, which they found objectionable.  I have a tiny kitchen, and though I noticed the smell, I prepared them according to instructions & I had no problem.  I rinsed them really well, then boiled for several minutes, then put in a saute pan and added spices to taste.  The noodles are tasteless and pick up the flavor of whatever prepared with, so it is a perfect low/no carb option.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Read before purchasing
review/text: Word to the wise before purchasing : your noodles didn't go bad. The slightly fishy smell is normal.<br /><br />If you're expecting to cook a fancy pasta dish with angel hair shirataki noodles and let it replace your normal pasta dishes, don't count on it. Some enjoy using these noodles for Italian dishes, but due to the texture it's not going to be the ideal dish. Would you eat ramen noodles with pasta sauce? These noodles go best as an Asian meal than an Italian one.<br /><br />I don't see why people write 1-star reviews based solely on the smell. Yes, it smells, but it's not overwhelming. I didn't smell it until I stuck my nose in the noodles. Best thing to do: get a bowl and fill it with cold water and possibly some ice cubes. I let them sit in that for about 10-15 minutes and the smell was nearly gone. If you're going to whine and fuss on an Amazon review board about a smell you clearly did not READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE.<br /><br />Lay the noodles on some paper towels to soak up access water. Shirataki noodles absorb the flavor of the dish, so allow it some time to dry a bit. These noodles are AMAZING with a stir fry. Others say sukiyaki with shirataki noodles are a hit as well.<br /><br />What I did : After completely the steps above, I cut my noodles into bite size lengths and made a slight peanut butter sauce for that Chinese take-out zing. Oils contain a lot of flavor, but only a couple drops of sesame oil really helped. I added plenty of vegetables in a pan with some chopped up chicken breast, added my sauce then dropped in the noodles and let it fry for a bit.<br /><br />...AMAZING! It was delicious and since it was mixed with plenty of other goodies I didn't notice the texture much at all. I cannot wait to buy more of these!

review/summary: Tastes just like cellophane noodles! Great for pho!
review/text: This is the new best thing ever! As an ABC (American Born Chinese) I have had many kinds of noodles over the years, made of many grains (mostly rice or wheat, but also things like quinoa or soba) and in many textures. The reviews that say the texture is horrible are probably from people accustomed only to white semolina Italian-American pasta. No, this does not taste like the spaghetti you get from cosco. It is also not the processed white flour Maruchen ramen that many Americans know as their only representation of Asian noodles. The texture is just like cellophane noodles, which are used frequently in Thai and Vietnamese food. If you are not sure if you will like the texture go to your local Vietnamese enclave and have a bowl of Pho. Those transparent noodles with a little bit of "bite" or "crunch" almost to them? That's what these are. Not slimy or slippery like semolina pasta. They don't just dissolve and break when you slurp them, you actually have to bite them off. They abosrb broth really well - try yours in a beef broth with roast slice beef and cilantro, green onions, lime and bean sprouts. Use plenty of garlic and hot chili. You won't miss a thing!<br /><br />No unnatural ingredients, high fiber and no calories! This solved two of my dietary inefficiencies with one stone - needing to add fiber supplements to my yogurt and smoothies, and the empty calories in noodle soup. Now I can have a big bowl of protein, veggies, broth and fiber with no empty processed carbs in the way! I'll be saving my carbs for important things like fruit... and chocolate :><br /><br />Post Script: For the people who insist the noodles "smell like fish," or "smell like rotting," I would like you to try a little cultural sensitivity experiment, and go to your local Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, or Chinese marketplace, and take a big deep breath. Smell that?<br /><br />It's fish. Actual, came-from-the-ocean fish. It might be fresh like sashimi or it might be dried, smoked, or pickled, depending on what flavor of Asian store you stumbled into. We eat them, you know, in forms other than breaded and deep fried. Now go smell something like kim chee, miso, or 100-year eggs. That smell is known as fermentation. Say it with me, fer-men-TA-shun. That is not the same as rotten. It is a deliberate conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol under anaerobic conditions utilized for change in flavor, texture, and quality. You may discover parallels in your Nice Normal People foods like cheese and beer.<br /><br />Before you rail on about how disgusting this product is because in your ignorance you dumped salt-free marinara on it (ew) consider trying to find one of us slanty-eyed dark-haired people and asking nicely to try our food. Then if you don't like it, please consider thinking, "Gee, I guess my palate doesn't care for Asian flavors," rather than ordering Asian noodles and crying "rip-off" because it tastes EXACTLY LIKE WHAT IT IS.

review/text: I purchased the Miracle Noodle Spinach angel hair pasta.  I looked at many of the reviews prior to making my first bag.  I did find that they have a strong fish odor upon opening.  This was expected.  I rinsed the noodles under cole water for 4-5 minutes.  The odor decreased significantly.  I boiled the noodles for about 7 minutes then rinsed under cold water.  While boiling, I added a dry garlic rub so that the noodles may take in some of the flavor.  After boiling, I rinsed the noodles under cold water for 30 seconds or so.  To finish, I added about 1-1.5 teaspoons of garlic cooking creme, red pesto with truffles, and a touch of basil garlic parmasean dipping oil.  I warmed the noodle-sauce mixture for about 5-10 minutes.  I admit, the noodle texture was interesting...I guess it was like an al dente ramen noodle.  I wasn't expecting a spaghetti noodle though.  I would definitely make again.

review/text: This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite "deal" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google "Doctor Cyberman innards" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are.

review/summary: A Good Substitute
review/text: After reading all the reviews I decided to try this product.  All in all, it is a great product.  I've only tried the Angel Hair Pasta version.  It's quick to prepare and accepts pasta sauces readily.  The only thing, is that the noodles want to stay "bundled" together (not stuck together) so it's difficult to separate to dish out onto multiple plates.

review/summary: Price is okay. S&S: Be sure to count your packages!
review/text: The price isn't the best but hey I'm lazy and these are delivered straight to my door -- can't beat the convenience. The noodles are just fine if you follow the directions: rinse and dry-fry before adding them to your dish. If you go in not expecting a "spaghetti replacement", you'll be fine. The have a chewy texture which some might find odd but I'm a fan of most types of noodles so I particularly love these added to a nice stir-fry. These have basically no flavour when rinsed and dried out a bit so absorb the flavours of whatever dish you add them to.<br /><br />One Little Bit of Advice for S&S Folks: Make sure to count your noodle packages! I inadvertently shoved the last shipment into the bottom of the fridge where it sat forgotten-about for over a month. When I finally got around to opening it up, I noticed I had been shorted one package. Grrrr!

review/summary: When is a noodle not a noodle.
review/text: Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles. Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well. Will get back to you on my final opinion.

They are meant for Asian stir fry and soup dishes.<br /><br />Also they smell terrible when you open the bag and you either have to run them under hot water or boil them first to get rid of the smell.<br /><br />Once they are washed they offer a neutral flaovr and can be added to any stir fry as a replacement for rice noodles.<br /><br />I would not purchase these again as I think the flavor is not good and you don't get enough for what you are paying for.

review/summary: A Decent Filler
review/text: These noodles serve decently as a filler. They have no taste of their own but absorb the taste of what you mix them in. The smell is mildly unpleasant but goes away with rinsing. Preparation is fairly easy and quick. I can see these being useful on a short-term low-carb diet as a filler, but certainly not long-term. You'd get about the same thing if you bought a can of bamboo shoots used to make chop suey, and it would be a lot cheaper.

review/text: I was skeptical of this product at first. I saw a chef use them on TV and was intrigued by the thought of a 'no calorie noodle.' I boiled the water and used a hand strainer to rinse them. When you cut the package open the noodles have a terrible sour smell which freaked me out at first because that smell would taste terrible. However, when you rinse the noodles well and drop them into very hot boiling water, they have no taste at all. It was pretty amazing. They have the consistancy of bean thread noodles. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Healthy, vermicelli-like noodles
review/text: After finally trying this product, I am suprised at the negative reviews.  These were very much like vermicelli, or rice noodles, that we get at one of my favorite asian restaurants.  They don't have much flavor on their own, but take on whatever sauce or flavor you add.  I was intimidated to try them after all the "OMG THEY SMELL LIKE FISH" reviews... maybe I'm just used to asain-type foods, but these only smelled only SLIGHTLY fishy-something I would expect from a product shipped in liquid.  Honestly, I've had "shrimp-chips" that smelled FAR more pungent and fishy than these noodles.  If you like asain foods, don't let the reviews scare you away.  These are a great alternative to regular pastas.

review/text: Don't smell the liquid that the noodles are packaged in, it smells like bad fish.  Just hold your breath and rinse them good.  They taste like nothing much, except kinda like pasta.  The consistency is similar to bean sprouts.  If they were cheaper, I would be using them all the time, but a 7 oz package makes 2 servings-they count the liquid as part of the 7 ounces.  So over $2 for 2 servings, when you can have pasta for $1 for 6-8 servings.  I am not rich, so this won't work for me.

To some of the other comments about the smell:....Yes, they do smell a bit fishy.  Do not stick your nose in the bag.  Since it smells a bit fishy, if you don't like that smell, don't give yourself a snoot full! Just snip, dump into a colander and rinse well, drain and repeat. I follow up by tossing them in the pan that held the veggies for a few minutes to heat them up and get rid of any residual packaging odors.<br />Try tossing them in a bit of ginger and soy sauce and then chilling to add to fresh Thai veggie wraps with basil, grated carrot, shredded cabbage, radish, mint etc and wrap in a leaf of butter lettuce and dip in some sweet chili sauce combined with some veggie stock. (gotta watch those sauces as calories can sneak right back into a low cal meal in seconds.)

Cut them up into short pieces with a knife--otherwise they're really long, and the texture is a bit much.<br />4. Add them to soup or broth and heat well. Use strong seasonings, such as chilis or hot sauce. They aren't all that good at absorbing mild flavors.<br /><br />When I go through all those steps, they're actually not bad tasting, they're quite filling, and the noodles themselves are calorie free.

review/summary: Don't expect pasta!
review/text: I am so happy to have found Miracle Noodle here, introducing me to the Shirataki noodle!<br /><br />If you are expecting it to taste or have the texture of pasta, you may be disappointed.  However, I love it!  I eat a lot Asian food so I was able to accept the initial smell and unique texture.  The "fishy" smell rises out.  It wasn't strong smelling when i opened it up, but because I read the past reviews I had to give it a good sniff to see what they were complaining about.  And yes, it was not a very appetizing smell, but it went away after rising it for about 30 seconds.  I ate my first serving of Miracle Noodle with a Japanese noodle soup base (used for tempura sauce, somen, udon, etc.) and it worked perfectly.  I was positively giddy.  Zero calories!  I actually love the texture.  It's a little rubbery but not chewy.  I don't know what it can be compared to in our common American cuisine, but it is made from a vegetable, so expect a more vegetable-like texture. Like another reviewer stated, it is similar to Asian glass noodles.<br /><br />Now for the big test: Let my husband try it.<br />New foods often ignite dialogue like,<br />"Eww, I hate X."<br />"You've never tried X."<br />"Yeah cuz I don't like it."<br />LOL. He has, however, become more adventurous with new foods and seeing me dance around singing "zero calories" tempted him enough. I gave him a bite and he just kind of responded with "meh".  I didn't expect much, so I count that as a success in my book! With the right ingredients and maybe some hot sauce, I'm sure he'd like it just fine.<br /><br />I am excited to try different methods of preparing this noodle.  It seems like the perfect filler food in place of rice or pasta.  MUCH healthier.  It really does just take on the flavor of what it's prepared with.  I was able to find individual packages a shirataki noodles (different brands) in my local Asian food market (next to produce) at a lower price, however I have not tried it yet.  It looks exactly the same and I can't imagine it'd be much different.  So if you're hesitant about buying a 6-pack, maybe you could try that first.<br /><br />I am so glad Miracle Noodle has marketed this product in this way to help get this out to more people.  I would have never thought something like this existed.  This has become one of my new staples.  Bye-bye high calorie noodles!

review/text: I see a lot of people complaining that these noodles are not like spaghetti.  Of course they aren't, and they aren't meant to be.  They are a traditional Asian food, and if you want to enjoy them I recommend using a traditional Asian recipe such as Japchae (also called Chap Chae or Korean Glass Noodles) - a Korean stir fried dish with vegetables like carrots, onions, spinach, mushrooms or almost anything in season, seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil. Some recipes include beef. I used to make this with rice noodles because I couldn't find shiritaki back then and it was very good.  With the shiritaki, it's fabulous.  I've also enjoyed shiritaki as a substitute for ramen in soup.  So ditch the marinara and get out the wok.

review/text: Appreciated all the reviews... I already knew to rinse in cold water and then boil for 5 min. before it arrived. It barely smelled when I opened it, and only when I stuck my nose to it was there a mild fishy smell. Gone by the time I rinsed the noodles. After boiling, I added to a can of Progresso Lite Vegetable soup for a minute or two. Tasted/felt very similar to ramen noodles, but from what I've read, this is a whole lot healthier. Just reordered; I hope to make this a diet staple. Also, I split this initial order with a friend because we were so concerned about the reviews. She also added it to Progresso Lite Soup and had similar opinion. This product is probably best for someone who already eats healthy. If you expect this to taste good with spaghetti sauce and replace your craving for pasta, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: I don't think these are good or bad.  They are edible, not disgusting but not tasty either.  The texture is the worst thing about them.  It is not really like pasta.  No one in a blind tast test would guess that it is noodles.  There is a smell that is associated with opening the package but this was definitely exaggerated in some reviews.<br /><br />I Ate them and felt satisfied and full (I did not vomit or gag while attempting this).  This is obviously a huge plus as they have no calories.  I used Hungry girl's recipe for alfredo with these noodles.  I also added some canned asparagus for bulk.<br /><br />If you are looking for a zero calorie substitute that tastes just like real pasta, then you are going to be dissapointed.  If you are looking for something that is edible and will fill you up, you may want to consider it.<br /><br />My conclusion:  ehhh. I'll eat it, but it's nothing to write home about.

review/summary: I keep ordering--Great substitute!
review/text: This is my third order for these noodles.  They aren't like regular noodles, but if you're a pasta fan and you are trying to cut back drastically on calories-this noodle is for you.<br /><br />Don't get apprehensive of the taste in relation to the smell of the packaging water.  Make sure you rinse them very well.  They are GREAT with spaghetti sauce and go very well with sauteed vegetables and any other seasonings you'd like to add.  These noodles absorb much flavor (if dried properly) and really fill you up<br /><br />And they are calorie-FREE.  I still don't know how that's possible, but they really help me out when I'm needing a snack but close to my calorie count for the day!

review/summary: Excellent pasta substitution!
review/text: I know that first impressions are hard to get passed, especially the smell, but if you follow the instructions you will enjoy them as a substitution for real pasta.  Just rinse them well, parch them in boiling water, and pat dry.  Then add them to whatever sauce, oil, broth, meat and veggies you want.  Miracle Noodle has a recipe book to download on their company website if you need any ideas.  We usually cook them as a spaghetti and enjoy.  I am anxious to try to the other pasta versions available.

review/summary: Buy It!
review/text: Oh Mi Gosh.  AWESOME!<br /><br />Make sure you rinse well and dry extra well in a paper towel after boiling.  I have tried it with stir fried veggies, (once with frozen) a bit of left over meat, and a favorite salad dressing, once a soy ginger, once an orange citrus,  A quick, filling, almost calorie free, and tasty meal.

review/summary: Miracle Noodles...quite impressive!
review/text: I ordered my shipment of noodles with some trepidation after reading other reviews on Amazon about them being smelly.  Once I received them, everything was just fine. The noodles did come in very small packets with liquid in them.  It took about three packets of noodles to create a pseudo spaghetti with meat sauce.  The smell after opening the noodles was unpleasant, but not bad enough for me to throw them out.  The odor from the noodles reminded me of something slightly seafood-y smelling.  Once mixed with spaghetti sauce the odor from the noodles was undetectable.  These are an excellent substitute for carb rich noodles and have a similar texture and consistency to the real thing.  I'll definitely be buying them again!

review/summary: Love These Noodles
review/text: These noodles are perfect for stir fry or spaghetti.  I am on a very low calorie diet and these noodles fit the bill without costing me excess carbs and calories.  They take on the flavor of what you are cooking i.e. pasta sauce.  You will love them.

review/summary: It DOES NOT taste bad......BUT...
review/text: Okay so my noodles came today and I was really excited to try them. I read good reviews and bad reviews..but I still wanted to try on my own. I opened the bag and just like the reviews it did have a fish smell...the smell wasn't as bad as I would've imagined..it's tolerable not as bad as a smell of after taking a dump. I washed them with cold water for about a minute..the smell was there a bit. Boiled them in hot water for around 5 minutes and the smell was kinda gone. So I put them in my already cooked meat sauce. Let it cook up for around 5 minutes. I tried just one little noodle...goodness..let's just say I didn't want to try again. The taste well it DOESN'T taste bad. The TEXTURE!!!!!! that's where the problem is....it just felt like I was eating a raw worm!..no I've never eaten a worm..but you know how soft warms are and imagine eating it and you feel that soft crunchiness...that's what I felt while eating it. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat the whole pack. Some reviewers said it was like rubber band....well...at least rubber band has a more harder texture. A worm is the closest thing of a texture I can tell you.<br />Do I recommend this: Of course not haha good luck. I bought mine at iherb (2 packs) for &lt;$4 so I feel sorry for those who bought 6 packs and had to throw them away.

review/summary: shirataki noodles
review/text: A great substitute for pasta. No calories so you can eat all you want. Since they have no flavor of their own, you can season them for Asian or Italian or any seasoning.  I toss in cooked and seasoned shellfish, or chicken, pork or ground beef.

review/summary: Love This Product
review/text: I ordered this product after researching the product, the Miracle Noodle Company and with the understanding that this is a natural plant based noodle type product.  The biggest sell for me came in two statements, natural plant fiber and low calorie, what can be better than that!<br /><br />The one thing I did find contradictory to some of the statements that I've read, the miracle noodle does not absorb the flavor of the sauces it is combined with, but served just right it is just as easy to enjoy as you would the average pasta dish.  These noodles are not your Ramen type noodle consistency yet with the right combination of seasonings this product can be much better since it has less fat, less sodium, less calories and fiber.<br /><br />My favorite dish so far is a vegetable soup made with Angel Hair Miracle Noodle, cabbage, spinach, celery, carrots, seasoned with fresh garlic, Vidalia onion and fresh thyme and of course your favorite additions.<br /><br />For a great quick meal, combine onions, fresh garlic, green peppers, the Angel Hair Miracle Noodle with a mixed vegetable, pair with a Cajun grilled chicken or a teriyaki grilled salmon, very tasty.<br /><br />If you have an open mind and a true love of good food, you will enjoy the preparing this low calorie alternative to the average noodle.

review/summary: Great low-carb option for Asian noodle dishes
review/text: Love this product! I'm committed to a low-carb lifestyle and find it easy most of the time. However, there was one carb I missed; Asian noodle dishes, like pad thai. I got the angel-hair sized noodles, and they look like rice noodles, and come packaged in a liquid filled bag. I was surprised by the weight of the shipping box. They are made from plant fiber so no calories, carbs, sugar, wheat, etc. Crazy impossible, right?<br />I used these in a chicken dish with a spicy sauce, and they were really enjoyable, not funky, and cured my Asian noodle craving. The consistency is very similar to "al dente" rice noodles in pad thai.<br />So if you are watching carbs, calorie, sugar, gluten, etc. and are looking for a pasta alternative, check them out.

review/summary: worth trying
review/text: If you live near a military commissary, you can get these for about $1.50.  If you have to buy online, asianfoods has a 16 oz bag.  I like to get those in large quantities so I can get free shipping. I also go through ebates for a percentage off and use a $10 off coupon from retailmenot.  They're still expensive, compared to cheap spaghetti noodles, but they fill you up for NO calories! They're best if, after you drain and rinse very very well, you throw them onto a hot griddle until they're pretty dry.  While they're getting all the water evaporated out,  you can be making whatever sauce you plan to put on them.  I'd have given these 5 stars if the price had been competitive.  What they're intended for definitely earns 5 very big stars though!  I'm so pleased to be able to eat noodles and not have to pay for that when I stand on the scale the next day. (And they digest better than wheat for me too.)
