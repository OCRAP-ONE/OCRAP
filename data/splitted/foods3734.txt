review/summary: Not My Favorite, but OK
review/text: Reminds me of a pina colada. It's very sweet, and refreshing. My favorite so far is the Mango Orange, so I probably won't purchase this one again. Don't let that deter you from purchasing, it's just my personal preference.

review/summary: tasty,but too expensive here...
review/text: This product tastes great,like a vacation in a bottle. As a canadian,i have to cross the border to get it,as its not for sale here yet,but i live close to buffalo anyway. Thing is, in the local tops store,these sell for about $1.29 i think (though they never have this flavour,but the other flavours are good too). A store in the galleria mall has them for about $2.29, way more than tops,but less than Amazons price here,especially adding the $12 to ship. If you are near a Tops,or the galleria mall,buy the singles and save some cash on a great tasting product.

review/text: I tried this today as I enjoy the other flavors and this is a nice light Sparkling Water/soda. I enjoy this flavor. The flavor is light, but enjoyable, reminding me of a Pina Colada. I wish it had a bit more Pinapple and Coconut flavor but is pretty good. I would definately buy this again.

review/summary: Love Sparkling ICE Brand (Stay away if you're sensitive to Splenda)
review/text: The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br /><br />The Coconut Pineapple flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) but it is delicious all the same. My only complaint about this flavor is that it is so strong and overwhelming that I can't actually drink while eating anything. If I'm looking for something to toss in my purse while I'm out running errands, this one is great. But if I'm about to sit down for a meal, I have never once grabbed this flavor because it doesn't blend well with any sort of food I can think of. The other flavors tend to be milder and so they go better with different types of meals. Other than that, though, this is a fabulous drink.

review/summary: Deliciously Simple
review/text: I really got this mainly as a mixer. I tend to lean towards the more complex, dessert-y matcha flavors like Pumpkin Pie and Cheesecake, and Earl Grey seemed like it'd be the perfect compliment to a lot of my favorites. I have so many different Earl Greys in my cupboard, it seemed blasphemous not to have an EG matcha as well even if it's just for experimenting with. But of course I have to try it by itself first! Bergamot is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey, and it's nicely present here. I'm really happy with the amount of flavor used: while I do like a strong EG, I didn't want it overpowering here at all. There's that classic citrus tang, with just a hint of floral qualities that really go well with the fresh, grassy matcha. I'm not sure if bergamot is the only flavoring used here, because as the description states there's just a tiny hint of warming smoke. It reminds me of a brisk EG with a strong black base, mixed in with my matcha! Refreshing, bright, and very different from all the other ones in my cupboard.

review/summary: Duke of Earl...
review/text: This was added to the box in an continuing effort to seduce my wife to the ways of matcha. So far, the best I've gotten out of her was "That's....interesting." Ah well, more for me. London Fogs, also known as an Earl Grey with vanilla and milk, are her favorite winter drink, so that's what I had in mind when I snagged this little beauty. That and she's a sucker for anything Earl Grey. But I'm looking forward to mixing this with, you guessed it, vanilla. An Earl Grey/vanilla was my very first tea, though I'm not much of an Earl Grey fan nowadays. But still, it sounded very tasty and I had to at least try it. I'm a bit worried, after the bitterness of the lemon matcha, but I was worried about the watermelon and it turned out amazing. And we're big fans of the Earl Grey from Red Leaf Teas around here, so we have a lot of faith in this blend. Their Earl Grey Oolong is one of the teas my wife absolutely cannot do without, and their Raspberry Earl Grey was one of the few teas I've actually seen her mourn when it was discontinued. So yes, if there was ever an Earl Grey matcha to get her into matcha, it would have to be from Red Leaf Tea.<br /><br />Success! We went to the zoo on Friday and my poor wife was only running on a couple hours sleep, so I made her a matcha London Fog and she loved it. Loved it! I stole a few sips of the Earl Grey before mixing it in with everything else and it was perfect Earl Grey, and I knew that I'd made the right choice. I mixed together equal parts Earl Grey matcha and French Vanilla matcha (both from Red Leaf Tea, of course) and whisked it together in a bowl to be sure to get all the lumps out. Personally I don't care about a clump or matcha or two, but it really turns her off of her drink. Anyway, I heated up some vanilla soy milk, frothed it up, added it to the blend and it was perfect. She loved it! And it's so much better for you than the regular London Fog, full of syrup and dairy...blegh. This is one I think I'll have to keep in stock, if only for my wife's sake, which I am more than happy to do.

review/summary: THE BEST COOKIES EVER!!!!
review/text: My sisters and I started the GFCF diet about 3 months ago for all six of our children. We each have two children. Anyway, my mother bought these for the children for a snack and I will tell you everyone in my family who has tasted these finds them absolutely addictive. My husband and my brother-in-law now both have to have a can of these every week. They won't even share with my sister and I so we, of course have to buy our own can. lol. Our children can't get enough of them. Seriously the best cookie ever. None of us even liked macaroons before Jennies. Buy them, try them and love them, just know there isn't a patch to get help when you become addicted, but there may be enough of us to start a meeting or two. lol.

review/summary: USED TO BE!! SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet) Friendly...But No More!!
review/text: Jennies Coconut Macaroons have three ingredients: Egg whites (so if you are on the SCD, eat them when you are able to eat eggs), Coconut and Honey. There are no other sweeteners, no artificial ingredients, nothing else added. They are tasty, chewy, goodness, and the ingredients can be tolerated by many people who otherwise have to avoid most of what they see at a typical grocery store. The packaging keeps them fresh. I tried the SCD diet recipe (which contains the same ingredients plus optional lemon zest) and can't get them as good as Jennies.<br /><br />For a sweet treat with wholesome goodness, Jennies coconut macaroons are the way to go!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE!!! As I have seen from another reviewer - in my most recent order, Jennie's changed from HONEY to EVAPORATED CANE JUICE WITH HONEY!! This is a HORRID DEVELOPMENT! WHY DID THEY DO THIS?? I can't eat them now! They are no longer SCD Diet friendly :(

They are tasty and they don't go stale easily. My kiddo loves these and I love that they have plenty of fiber and whole grains. Don't be put off by the idea of a "bran pretzel," this is not a weird-tasting or -textured health food store product (I think we've all had those, right?). Delicious and good for you.

review/summary: Delicious, quick and satisfying
review/text: I discovered Miso soup at a sushi place in Spokane, Wa. and loved it's unique flavor. These packaged sizes are perfect with Asian size soup bowls. It has a wonderful flavor and is a nice snack food for my daughter after school instead of milk/cookies.<br />--It only takes 3min. if you have a hot tap. Nice, large sizes of greens with a mild soy flavor. It's a unique flavor, truly tasty and much cheaper to purchase by the bulk on Amazon (love the free 2day shipping) than at Walmart.

review/text: Boil a cup of water and add a packet of soup mix.  It doesn't get much easier than that.  The tatse is very similar to the soup served in Japanese restaurants.  The only real difference is the tofu which is spongy and tastless (well tofu is always kind-of tasteless).  Yeh, the sodium content is high but it would taste right if it wasn't.  There are less expensive miso soup mixes on Amazon but I know and trust the Kikkoman brans.  The cost here is abot 35% less than at my local supermarket.

review/text: When we ran out of Frank's RedHot wing sauce my boyfriend purchased this to replace it because it was cheaper and we figured it would probably taste similar. It is disgusting. We closed the bottle back up and shook it to make sure that the flavors hadn't settled, and we even checked the expiration date to make sure that it hadn't gone bad -- that's how gross it tastes. It is not spicy, instead it tastes sweet and a little "chemically". We threw it away immediately. Don't waste your money!

review/summary: Gevalia House Blend: Excellent!
review/text: Much to my surprise, this coffee is excellent. I say it that way because years ago I had a mail order subscription for Gevalia coffee and the product was entirely unsatisfactory at that time. Something has changed. I only tried this because there was a very good incentive at my local supermarket, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The package says this blend is new, and that it is 100% Arabica. I am brewing it in an automatic drip machine that strangely enough is also from Gevalia (via our local Good Will store). I find the taste rich, dense, chocolatey and smooth.<br /><br />For some reason very good coffees are roasted and marketed in several European countries - well, at least to MY taste they are very good.<br /><br />A word of warning: There is also a House Blend decaf, and the two are hard to distinguish if one is not careful, because the word "decaf" is in a very small green box, easily missed. (Voice of experience!)

review/summary: Gevalia House Blend...
review/text: When I began to write this review, two things came to mind. 1) Sweden is not a country you normally associate with coffee, 2) Coffee is generally hard to score because taste is subjective.<br /><br />Furthermore, Sweden is not a coffee grower so Gevalia is going to be a company like Starbucks who buys, roasts, blends and packages their coffee. Old Victor Theodore Engwall might have started this company in 1853 but it has been owned by Kraft since 1971 and I just hope that Kraft is not going to do the same as GM did to Saab or Ford to Volvo.  Lastly, this is a house blend (100% Arabica), something I usually avoid because it's just someone's mixture of a few different kinds of coffee; if I'm going to drink blended coffee, I would prefer to blend my own. But I got this as a gift so I decided to write a review anyway.<br /><br />Anyhoo... this is a surprisingly good coffee. The pouch lists this medium/dark roast, 3 out of 4 beans on their scale, but it's very light to me, and I'm using a little bit more coffee than it suggests. But I like it, I also used it to make a latte and it's rich and creamy. I wouldn't say this was bitter at all.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a pretty light flavorful coffee. Good quality, not burnt, not bitter.  This is definitely a coffee I would buy and drink in rotation with my other coffees. Gevalia has a good reputation in Scandinavia and thereabouts and I'm glad that Kraft hasn't screwed it up.

I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it. I'm sure there are people who like this taste, but not me. personal preference I guess. If I could give a 0 I would.

review/summary: Not Natural at all!!
review/text: I bought three cases of this stuff. It is all going back. Unfortunately, I did not notice the tiny TRUVIA label on the picture of the can when I bought this from Amazon. When I got this stuff and saw the label, I did several hours of internet research and found the following:<br /><br /> This sweetener is NOT from stevia.  Natural stevia sweetener is a mixture of extracts of steviosides and rebaudioside-A from the leaves of several varieties of stevia plants and has been used and studied worldwide for decades and is classified "generally regarded as safe" by the FDA though some may not care for the taste.<br /><br />Truvia on the other hand is a Coca-Cola/Cargill partnership brand name for FAKE stevia sweetener; a mixture of .9% rebiana (not even an ingredient of steviana) and 99.1% erythritol sweetener derived from corn plants grown by Cargill, who have admitted that 30% of their corn is Genetically Modified. Regardless of the fact that the FDA is allowing this on the market, like many products these days this substance has not been properly tested and reviewed for negative or dangerous side effects of which many have already been reported by consumers of it. If you are smart you will not buy this, and if you already have... I suggest you GET RID OF IT in any manner besides drinking it. It may well be dangerous to your health!<br /><br />I will also be contacting Blue Sky Natural Beverage company about this unnatural ingredient in their "100% natural, no calorie, no artificial sweetener" sodas. Since my main goal in trying this soda with was to get away from genetically modified foods such as high fructose corn syrup and aspartame, I now do not trust Blue Sky enough to even try their regular sodas which they claim are made with "real" sugar, since nowadays that usually means a percentage of cane sugar mixed with sugar from genetically modified sugar beets. It is infuriating that companies like this can lie through their teeth to sell a phony product with no regard for the buyer and face no legal consequences.

review/text: I love coca cola, but started eating the low carb way earlier this year.. I haven't had a real coke in over 6 months. Out of all the things I gave up, coke has been the hardest.. I just discovered the Blue Sky pop and it is DELICIOUS.. I use stevia for all my sweetening needs, so I was so glad to find this pop sweetened with stevia/truvia... I won't eat or drink anything sweetened with equal as it gives me a huge headache as well as all the other health dangers associated with it.. So this is an excellent alternative. No aftertaste. It has given me back my love for cola...<br />I've also tried Zevia, which is also really good, but have to say, I think this one wins the taste test..<br />My husband is a diabetic who really misses pop, too.. He doesn't drink diet pop for the same reasons I don't.. He's thrilled with the taste of this Blue Sky cola. I felt the price was very good through Amazon, too. I signed up for the subscription price. It's about time pop manufacturers started using stevia! I've been waiting for a loooong time.

I have tried other stevia sweetened drinks and couldn't drink them either. I liked this one better than one of the other brands I tried though. If you like stevia drinks you may like this. It is really a great deal to get 24 cans shipped for this price though. That is why I ordered it. I bet the shipping costs alone were almost as much as I paid. I wish I liked it because I know it would be better for me. But sadly I can just not choke this down.

I like Zevia better, but this is quite drinkable, especially when it's ice-cold.

review/text: Always order Purina One for my two dogs. On subscription to get those canned food monthly as the delivery was on time and very good packing. Strongly recommendation to have someone to subscribe the amazon.com to deliver you the dog canned food every month for those who do not have a car or any mode of transportation.

review/summary: New Favorite Dark K-Cup
review/text: This coffee has a smooth, carmely, dark finish that I love! My husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me. This one is very smooth, with just a hint of sweetness. I wish that Amazon had it on its monthly purchase program, would love to save 15% on it! However, I was glad to find it someplace besides Green Mountain. As prime members, we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v. a week or longer over at GM. Sweet!

review/summary: Oooh. I like this!
review/text: This is the fifth different type of coffee I've tried with my Keurig coffee maker. Right now, it is tied with a Newman's Own k-cup as my favorite. A couple k-cup products seemed fine when I first tasted them, but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes.<br /><br />This is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee. It does not have a strong taste, but goes down very easily. There is a richness to the taste as well.<br /><br />Bottom line? I will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as I continue experimenting with different flavor k-cups.

review/summary: Amazed
review/text: I am a coffee snob. Yes, I admit it. I prefer fresh roasted Kenyan coffee, but also like Sumatran, Jamacan, Guatamalan, even Etheopian. I generally say that I don't drink Columbian. Most K-Cups are weak and less than stellar, though I have found several I enjoy. I was surprised by Caribou's Mahogany! It is excellent. Strong enough with an earthy, winey taste and smoothe finish (my description).  I eagerly tried their Daybreak, to my disappointment. Just ordinary. I don't often write reviews, but if this can get someone else to enjoy Mahogany it is well worth the time. If you have similar taste in coffee give it a try!! (and no, I don't work for them.)

review/text: This morning, for the first time in my life, I tried Mahogani Caribou Coffee only because I had run out of my usual type of coffee, which I would usually brew and drink. In short, I should not even categorize Mahogany Caribou as coffee!!!! You know why? It has far more anti-depressant and uplifting effect on me than I had previously anticipated. From now on, I will only drink Mahogany Caribou.

review/text: Very nice, smooth cup of coffee.  Caribou Coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time I visited Minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee.  I have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a Keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in K-cups.  I also enjoy the Caribou Blend but I have to say this blend has a little more "kick" to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste.

review/text: This is probably my favorite k-cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, "if you say so...". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a "note" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor.

I love dark roast but Starbucks' French roast, Sumatra, and others I can't remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold. Can't stand any of Caribou's other dark roasts, such as Obsidian which you can get at Target sometimes. All in all, I am hoping this one sticks around, Ange's personal fav.

review/summary: Smooth and tasty and an absolute dream come true for those who enjoy bold dark roasts...
review/text: Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.

review/text: Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. I've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help.

review/summary: Best K-Cup to Date
review/text: If you're a fan of full-bodied coffees, give this one a shot.<br /><br />For my taste, the vast majority of k-cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra-bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before.
