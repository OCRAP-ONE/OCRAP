review/summary: The "Green Pearl" of Tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

review/summary: Once a surprise, now a necessity
review/text: I first tasted Styrian Pumpkinseed oil a few decades ago while in the service, but on trip to Austria a few years back I had the opportunity to try it again and couldn't believe I'd forgotten what a great flavor it added to foods.  I brought a couple of bottles back to the states, after they were used up, I looked in specialty stores and markets all over the NYC area but with no success.  Finally, I ordered the oil over Amazon.  It arrived quickly and has the same great taste as the product I brought back from Austria.  My only quibble is that I can't get the organic oil that I found over there, but it's pretty much a case of beggars can't be choosers when it comes to finding this oil in the US.  A note to anyone that buys the oil, keep yours in the fridge once you open it as it will go bad if you don't.

review/text: Pumkinseed oil has a rich nutty flavor, and is very tasty.<br /><br />USES<br />> For many uses, you can use pumpkinseed oil as a (much more healthy) butter substitute.<br />> Pumkinseed oil is an excellent dipping oil.  Pour a little in a dish, sprinkle a little salt over it, and dip warm fresh bread in it---fantastic!!<br />> Pumkinseed oil is an excellent drizzling oil.  That means that you pour it over dishes just before serving, or serve it on the table in a carafe for diners to pour themselves.  If you stir-fry, use peanut oil to fry, then drizzle a little pumpkinseed oil just before serving.<br />> Pumkinseed oil is an excellent salad oil, but may be too intense used "straight", I suggest mixing it with olive oil, and a touch of honey.<br />> I often cook pole beans or green beans with roasted almonds.  A little pumpkinseed oil greatly enhances the nuttiness.<br />> Pumkinseed oil is a wonderful on vanilla ice cream---giving it a nutty flavor.  If you like almond or pecan icecream, you'll love pumkinseed oil on vanilla icecream.<br /><br />NOT A COOKING OIL!!!<br />Especially NOT for stir-frying<br />> Pumpkinseed oil has a low smoke point and burns easily<br />> Cooked pumpkinseed oil becomes bitter<br />> Cooking destroys the beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS<br />Claimed to be helpful for BHP (benign prostatic hyperplasia), irritable bowel syndrome, preventing arteriosclerosis, and lowering cholesterol levels.

review/summary: Great Pumpkinseed Oil
review/text: This is the real Austrian pumpkin seed oil from the Steiermark (Styria)region of Austria.  It is the oil used for making potato salad there.  From the bottle, it is thick almost like motor oil but with a rich taste and aroma of pumpkin seed.  Once lightened in a dressing, it renders a dark green color.  It is rich but authentic.  It is a very special item not really widely used except in Austrian cuisine.  It is one of the specialties of the Styrian region of southeastern Austria.

review/summary: They're the Best
review/text: I've tried all of the original flavors and enjoy them all.  They are wonderfully flavored, different than the norm, and pretty healthy.  I've served them and taken them as hostess gifts and have always received rave reviews regardless of the flavor.  I'm taking some to my Thanksgiving hostess tomorrow!!  When I'm lucky enough to find them in Costco (holiday time), I always end up recommending them to someone who's looking at them that's never tried them, and they've always picked up a pack.  The only criticism I have is that they do tend to stick together on occasion, but are usually easily broken apart.  It's just that it makes them seem stale or mishandled, though the flavor has always been good.  And in the summertime in Texas everything's sticky!  Can't wait to try these new flavors!!

review/text: I've been drinking this since the 70's.  The flavors are still great and Amazon has it at a good price.  The drawback?  Why isn't this part of Amazon's Subscription and Save program.  I faithfully but this about every three months and it should be part of that program.  How about it Amazon!

review/summary: great stuff
review/text: I have a sensetive enough stomach that I can't always tolerate solid food and Carnation has become an absolute godsend. Unlike some meal replacement drinks (Boost and Ensure come to mind), Carnation really lacks any kind of synthetic taste. In fact, I love the taste to death instead of previous options I've tried which were just something I had to endure to avoid passing out from not eating.<br /><br />It's got a great mix of vitamins and minerals that really do make it a meal in a glass. Wonderful product and, from a practical standpoint, it makes you more likely to actually have breakfast since it's so easy to mix up a glass and you can drink it while you're doing other parts of your morning ritual.

review/text: I'm a college student and often in the mornings I don't have time for breakfast so I just mix up a water bottle of this the night before and grab it on my way out. I find that adding the full suggested amount of power, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon is a little much, but still very tasty. It doesn't have that weird, protein powder taste and tastes a lot like nesquick powder! Overall it's great.

review/summary: My 3 Kids Love It!
review/text: Every morning my children ask for "hot chocolate". That's what we've dubbed this since they were little. I heat a glass of milk in the microwave (just so it is a warm temp) then add about 3 tablespoons of CIB.It dissolves very easily in warm milk. Then I add a straw. They love drinking it through a straw. They get a healthy start EVERY morning and they don't even realize it. My younger son also asks for it when he wakes from his nap and if my other children see I'm making one for him they want one too. When their friends stay the night, they also ask for it in the morning. It really does have a great flavor, nothing that you have to get used to. We used to buy it in the extra large canisters from Costco, but they haven't carried it in years so we would wait for it to go on sale at the store. Now we found it here on amazon for the sale price all the time and free shipping to boot. I do wish they had it on the subscribe & save plan.

review/summary: This is the best breakfast ever
review/text: I have had this stuff every morning for breakfast and sometimes for snacks for the last 8 years.  It is getting very expensive though so I am constantly having to shop around to get a good price.  At the time of this review this was the best price I could find... but the prices fluctuate.  I have seen as low as $11.90 and as high as $31, so buyer beware.<br /><br />I like the canister better than the packets because then I can make just the amount I want instead of being locked in to either a cup or two cups.  One canister lasts me for 8 - 2 cup glasses.  This is a 3 pack canister deal.<br /><br />The only think I DON'T like about it is that the lip of the canister makes it hard to get all the powder out without making a mess, and sometimes the powder comes pretty fine and sometimes it is more grainy and it makes it harder to dissolve in the milk.<br /><br />But I like the taste, I like the fact it is quick and has nutritional value.  I would recommend this to anyone.

review/text: Sometimes I can't handle solid food first thing in the morning, sometimes I'm just running late...either way, this gets something in my stomach so that I can get through the first few hours of my day.  I used to be able to find it locally in these canisters but lately I can only find individual packets - and with two of us drinking it on a near-daily basis, the extra packaging and cost (currently 28 cents/serving for the canister vs. 52 cents/serving for the packets) to buy the packets seems wasteful.  As other reviewers have said, it tastes rich and chocolate-y without being overpowering or fake.

review/summary: CIB is far better than icky Ensure (gag!) Here's some good tips on how to improve the nutrient value too
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032BG3K">Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ, In Jar, 12 oz</a> One can greatly improve upon CIB by both adding a scoop of Pro-Mod protein powder (ask your druggist to order a can) and wheat germ. The Protein powder acts as a nice minor thickening agent, but it has NO flavor. Also, to add a great deal of taste and additional nutrient value, plus fiber, try mixing the CIB powder with a fair amount of Wheat Germ: it gives CIB an excellent "toasted/nutty" taste that greatly complements the rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Using the CIB with the Pro-Mod protein powder and wheat germ is very healthy -- particularly for cancer patients and gastric bypass patients. (And its worth noting that Pro-Mod is the very best and most complete protein powder available; Kretschmer wheat germ is by far the tastiest wheat germ on the market and well worth the money.)

review/text: My kids do not like to eat breakfast often, but they do like chocolate milk, so this product solves a problem for the most part. Of course it would be better to eat a meal, but this is definitely better than nothing at all. It tastes great, is thicker than plain old chocolate milk, is not chalky, and it is filling to hold them over until lunch. It has some vitamins and minerals as well, so that is a plus. I like the taste myself as well and crave it at times. It fully dissolves in milk and leaves no residue or chunks behind.

review/text: We are not big milk drinkers in our house. I have three kids and a husband. Although we eat healthy, we are all very busy and often on the go. This drink mix is an awesome, yummy way to get nutrients. It is relatively low-cal and is a great way to guarantee my teenager eats breakfast. My toddler thinks it's a treat! My husband never ate breakfast until I started mixing this for him the night before in a travel mug. Now he shakes it and drinks it during his commute along with his coffee.<br /><br />It's obviously best to get all your nutrients from foods. However, that is not realistic for most families. This way I know my daughter and husband will get breakfast and its a "healthy chocolate milk" for my toddler and tween.<br /><br />These are three large canisters, but the shelf life is long. It is quite pricey in the grocery store, so this is definitely a good value.

I don't know why this has increased almost $2 in less than three weeks. Disappointing.

review/summary: Canisters make it easy to add extra stuff
review/text: I mix the contents of the canister with some instant coffee, fiber powder (inulin - I can't even tell it's in there) and extra dry milk (to tone down the sweetness) - all in a larger canister.  Makes a great all-in-one drink so I don't have to brew a cup of coffee as well.  Getting up at 5 in the morning makes it hard to want to take more time than mixing this with milk - can't beat it.

review/summary: Tastes Delicious!
review/text: Wow, how long have I been drinking this stuff? I think for at least 7 years now. It's the perfect meal replacement when you're in a hurry or have a tendency to forget to eat all together. This really helps me during breakfast, since I tend to forget to eat or eat very poorly when I remember. (In the mornings anyway, I'm ok with lunch and dinner.)<br /><br />This is NOT a diet drink. It's not there to help you lose weight. It's a simple meal replacement.<br /><br />It tastes delicious. I wish restaurants and fast food places used THIS for their chocolate milk mixes. It's not super sweet, but has a rich chocolate flavor to it, and there's no weird aftertaste. (I think the canister mix tastes fine, btw.)<br /><br />I drink this with Lactaid 2% milk. (I know it's better for you with Skim Milk, but I despise Skim Milk flavor--or lack thereof.) For an extra protein kick, I sometimes add a little of my husband's whey powder. :)

review/summary: Great Product Crummy Price
review/text: I started buying CIB from this merchant in March because it is sometimes hard to find in the store. My first 2 orders were $15.90 for the 3 pack, my third order in June was $17.92 was $17.92 for the 3 pack which was cheaper than my local store. So when I went to reorder today I was shocked that it has gone up to over $23 for the 3 pack making it much more expensive than buying it at my local grocery store. So while I love CIB Amazon will no longer get my business for this great product.

Little does she know, this is NUTRITIOUS Chocolate Milk, and she loves it too. I tried other nutrition drinks and she didn't like them as much because should could taste a "vitaminey" taste.<br /><br />I told her that she could have this chocolate milk anytime she wants.

review/summary: Contains cheap filler
review/text: I usually drink the carnation breakfast, but in the individual packets. I recently bought a pack of 3 of the canisters. My husband cautioned me that the ones he saw all said WHEAT in the store. Online, it was not listed in the ingredients. With his advice I double checked the ingredients. It used wheat flour. Obviously, it's a cheap way to fill the product. The smaller packets which are more expensive do not have flour. If you have Celiac disease like me, this could lead to a serious illness b/c of the bad labeling by AZ.com. Even if you do not have a wheat allergy, taking in more processed carbs is not good for your body.

review/summary: It's liquid ice.
review/text: It's amazing what the chemists come up with these days.  This stuff is amazing!  It can clean your hands with a little soap, it can turn into ice when put into the freezer, it can make soup, and did I mention that you can drink it if you're thirsty!  It comes in a clear square shaped bottle which is portable; yep, you can take it anywhere you go (except past those pesky TSA agents at the airport).  There are rumors that scientists and engineers are working on a system of pipes that will deliver this amazing stuff to your house and you could have it any time with just a twist of a knob, but that is just speculation. When this happens sometime in the future, I'm sure that they will give it to the fire department first, because, did I mention that it puts out fires!  This stuff is the miracle product of the 21st century.  If the world was perfect this stuff would fall from the sky.<br /><br />Sure, there are other brands of this stuff; but, why pay pennies per bottle when what you really want is something that tells your friends and family that you have really made it.  With Fiji you don't need to buy a Mercedes or Ed Hardy gear to rub your affluence in your friends and family's face.<br /><br />If you have the time, you can make this stuff with some oxygen and twice as much hydrogen; but, good luck finding that stuff.  But, then again why would you when Fiji has done all the hard work for you.<br /><br />Once you have tried this stuff you will wonder how you have lived without it all your life.

review/summary: CLINICALLY TESTED WATER WITH POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS- AND IT TASTES GREAT!
review/text: I knew when I first tasted fiji water years ago that it was different, better.  I loved the taste or lack of taste.  It felt smooth and moist in my mouth, even after I swallowed it.  I would drink this water forever if I could afford it.  I loved the bottle-asesthetically it is beautiful.  It reminds me of Bora Bora Tahiti, where I have been, not Fiji where I haven't been.  I have heard they are similar though from those who have been to both. (How lucky can you get!)<br /><br />The tap water where I live tastes good, but has too much lime. We bought a faucet filter for this problem. So, I only bought Fiji water when I was out and about, as a special treat.  Just couldn't justify buying it to drink all the time. I could not see buying drinking  water we got from the tap for almost free.<br /><br />Then, I read recently about clinical trials involving Fiji water and the positive affects it has on health<br />That did it for me.  I did my research. I can now justify buying this beautiful water to drink on a regular basis. My son is very happy about this too, as it is his favorite bottled water.  With Fiji water around we notice that we drink less sodas, etc. which is good.<br /><br />The silica in it is what gives it the soft, smooth feel. Turns out silica is also very  good for you. I am hoping it will help my joints and connective tissue (I have osteo arthritis), skin and overall health. There is even proof it might raise the good cholesterol in your body and so many other things.  I am gong to give it a shot at helping me.  I'll do a follow-up later. Google clinical studies on fiji water to get all the facts.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is good.  My first case was delivered with Amazon Prime shipping in two days. I ordered the 16 oz bottles. Almost ordered the 50 oz ounces but just a little too large. I do wish they had the 30+ oz bottles. I did notice the price per oz on the 16oz size is incorrect. My son likes this because UPS or Fed EX delivers it and he doesn' t have to lug it in and out of the car.<br /><br />Here is info I got on the web-site regarding what's in Fiji:<br /><br />What are the natural contents of FIJI Water?<br /><br />FIJI Water contains the following in milligrams (mg) per liter (L):<br /><br />Silica: 91 mg/L<br />Silica is an important trace mineral that may positively benefit bone formation and connective tissue, as well as other salutary benefits .<br /><br />Fluoride: 0.26 mg/L<br />An important element found in FIJI Water is natural fluoride, which helps fight tooth decay.<br /><br />Bicarbonate: 140 mg/L<br />Bicarbonate plays an important role in maintaining our bodies' pH levels.<br /><br />Total dissolved solids: 208 mg/L<br />The term "Total Dissolved Solids" refers to the amount of dissolved minerals found in water. The more dissolved solids, the more metallic the water's taste will be.<br /><br />Read more about the minerals in FIJI Water.<br /><br />What are electrolytes?<br /><br />Electrolytes are substances found in the body that help regulate important physiological functions through electrical impulses. When dissolved in water, electrolytes are formed into positively and negatively charged ions.<br /><br />What is bicarbonate?<br /><br />Bicarbonate is essential for maintaining our bodies' pH balance. Working as an important buffer in the blood, it helps prevent blood from becoming too acidic or alkaline.<br /><br />What is pH?<br /><br />Many metabolic functions have a narrow range of pH at which they function adequately. The average normal pH is 7.4.<br /><br />With a pH of 7.8, FIJI Water is an excellent choice for your daily hydration needs.

review/text: I Drink only water that has been "purified"..ie: water that does not come from tap..I relized that the water coming form my tap tasted acceptable ,,it still tasted funny.Then I found out all the "stuff" they were putting in the public water and I endevered not to drink it UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO.Now I do have my own water purification stuff but I do like to have a good supply of purified water in bottles for my family,mainly for emergency plan supplies.Anyway I have tried many different kinds and this is what I have found...Fiji water is ok..but somehow the so called artesian water tastes funny...so i am not ordering it again..It tastes kind of "slimy in a way..Silica in this Fiji water I guess is not a good thing.My opinion is that the "Smartwater" brand is just that,,good clean tasting water..Plus it is less expensive than the Fiji water.So....again this just being my opinion..go get yourself the Smartwater.I do not think you will be disappointed in your choice.I would buy it from the local Wal-Mart or some other grocery or local store if they had it but I am disabled and cannot leave the home ,seeing as i can not walk very well.

review/text: I had seen FIJI water around before and never thought much of it. I always felt that water was water and thought it was all made the same and tasted the same. I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised with how refreshing this water is. It has a very pure taste to it and will quench your thirst. It is more expensive then your average bottle of water but then again FIJI is not your average bottle of water. Give it a try and I'm sure you'll be just as surprised as I was at how different FIJI water is from other water.

review/summary: I like it. Artesian water source
review/text: We don't have the best water on tap at work (it has a taste I can detect and don't like). I have several bottles of bottled water stashed away in my office in case I forget to bring fresh tap water from home.  I do not detect any smell or unexpected taste in Fiji natural artesian water. I like it!<br /><br />I used to think that all bottled water comes from a clear mountain stream. However Consumer reports reveals that this not so.<br />Aquafina, Dasani and Nestle are made from purified tap water.  I picked Fiji because it does come from artesian water. According to Consumer reports so do Evian and Poland Spring.<br /><br />Regulation for bottled water are more lax than those for public water. The EPA requires municipalities to publish a complete annual report, bottling companies only have to reveal contaminants above a certain level.<br /><br />Refilling your own bottles at home in most cases is cheaper, greener, better option.  I try to use that option as much as I can... but when I forget, I have Fiji.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
