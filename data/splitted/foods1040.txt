review/summary: This Tea is a Must Try
review/text: The flavors of this tea are spicy, rich and complex, but nothing stands out too strong screaming "this spice is overwhelming."  When preparing ensure your water is sufficently heated and that you streep the tea for a minimum of 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Rather weak and non-descript tea
review/text: There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Fruit-Flavoured Tea
review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

review/summary: One caveat...
review/text: This tea is great! It is very sweet on its own- I like to alternate drinking it with sips of water, which makes the licorice flavor even more pronounced!<br /><br />Just use caution if you have high blood pressure or glaucoma. Licorice root can raise blood pressure. I don't have either condition, but after finding that out, decided that this was better as an occasional treat (as opposed to a daily ritual.)

Bonus; you can use the bag twice and get a good cup of tea the second time.  Also, it's nice to steep this with black tea, and get a bit of caffeine if you choose, along with the ginger / lemon flavors.

I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.

The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags.

review/summary: Best unsung home remedy
review/text: I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Sweet and Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I don't think I ever heard of "yumberry" flavor before, but it is yummy!  As I have said before, I am a big time tea drinker and Stash makes excellent teas.<br /><br />This one has a smooth, fruity, berry taste and is sweet and delicious.  It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product.

It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds.

To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

review/summary: Great Flavor Tea and Good Price
review/text: We first came across the Licorice flavored tea from Stash at a local Gourmet Market. The market has several locations locally but none close to home.<br />We loved the taste of this tea specially in the cold Michigan winters. It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good. Thank you for carrying this tea and thank you Stash!

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake. This tea is especially good with the Butter Rum Cake from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811867811">All Cakes Considered</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/summary: Creamy Strawberry
review/text: I love this tea. It has an AMAZING creamy strawberry scent and I just can't get enough of it!<br />Unfortunately like with most teas, the scent is better than taste. I like mixing it with lemon juice and honey - it gets to be simply divine!<br />I like using my big mug and have to put 2 tea bags to get the right flavor. I have a feeling I'll go through it pretty quick. I drink it every day and would recommend this tea to everyone.

review/summary: fav Lemon Ginger tea so far...
review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

review/text: We've been unable to find this tea in the local stores, so once again, Amazon to the rescue. The tea has a very pleasant aroma, doesn't need sweetners or extra stuff of any kind, and has a very "smooth" taste. There is an aftertaste that lingers for just a moment that really makes this an excellent choice for black licorice lovers.

review/text: This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/text: I ordered this oatmeal on a whim one day after running out of Quaker and being too lazy to go to the grocery store. I was pleasantly surprised; the flavor is better than Quaker and the nutritional profile is better as well, particularly the amount of protein and fiber in the oatmeal.<br /><br />The flavor is mild and not overly sweet like flavored microwavable oatmeal can sometimes be. The oats do not clump together into a mush, but stay whole after microwaving like the higher quality oatmeals do.<br /><br />Basically, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just wanted oatmeal, and was very pleasantly surprised, especially for the price and convenience. I will be ordering again as well as trying the other flavors.

review/summary: my husband's favorite oatmeal
review/text: My husband has finicky taste (and texture) buds, and this oatmeal wins hands down for him. We have tried other brands on sale, and other flavors, but nothing makes him as happy. He likes the quality of the apple-cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />For the record, sweetened instant oatmeals are usually too sweet for me, this one no exception (although the taste is yummy). Plus I'd love it if my sweetie would just *try* the "real thing" of cooked rolled oats (better nutrition). These pouches of instant oatmeal are great when we're traveling, and I'm very glad we can buy in bulk from Amazon with free shipping. The pouch volume is somewhat larger than other brands, so you get more per serving (less need to do two bags).<br /><br />The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that my husband eats it like cookie dough--adds margarine *and* sugar! :: shudder ::

review/summary: They are definitely petal-dust CAKES
review/text: I just got my shipment today and while to some degree i'm not thrilled with the six separate 3x3 sets, I have to admit they will store in my tool kit much easier being smaller packaging (and take up less very-valuable workspace while working).  I also have to wonder if reordering a specific set of 9 will be easier to replace ones i find frequently useful.  Granted both of these concerns are rather long-term issues, not so much immediate concerns.<br /><br />The reason I so-far give this item 4 stars (and I TOTALLY reserve the right to change my viewpoint) is that they are definitely CAKES of petal dust.  Previously I've worked exclusively with powders, and these cakes do require a bit more work to get the desired amount of dust onto the gumpaste flowers.  As a professional in this industry, however, I feel comfortable knowing that I spent $40+ tax/shipping/etc for 54 colors.  I was at my local hobby store (Michaels) and saw the selection of petal powders by Wilton.  Each individual tube was $4.99 and they only had 10-ish colors for roughly the same amount of petal powder.  This is far more cost effective for producing a variety of flowers for various displays.  And who says I can only make flowers with these dusts?!<br /><br />I'd also like to politely remind anyone using petal-powder style products that these are meant to give your gumpaste work depth and accents, not to entirely color a product.  Using a good reference, you should start your piece with (a leaf, for instance) a yellow or green colored piece of gumpaste and once formed, accent, darken, and shade accordingly with the powders.  Don't expect all the color work to happen with the petal dust on white gumpaste for typical work.

review/summary: Great price, great taste
review/text: Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.<br /><br />Tips to enjoy it:<br /><br />- Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.<br /><br />- Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.<br /><br />- All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones "animal rennet-free" whenever I can.<br /><br />- Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the "mac and cheesiness" of it.<br /><br />- Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess.

If you insist on something like Kraft, save your money and buy the generic kind. But if you're looking for luscious mac & cheese, Annies is ALL REAL CHEESE!!! This dish is great made as directed, but for special occasions, I boil the pasta for only 5 minutes (NOT 8 to 10!), melt half a cup (half a cube) of unsalted butter in the hot pan over low heat, beat in the cheese sauce packet, then stir in the hot pasta. YUM City!! Make TWO packets if you plan on any leftovers for lunch the next day, because this recipe is beyond belief GOOD! (Boil the pasta a LOT less if you want to reheat the dish later, it gets limp and soggy fast! My Grandmother used to say pasta should always bite back! - in other words, have some spring-back left in it.)

review/text: I purchased these originally because a friend of mine was lamenting the changes to the "other" stuff and how it didn't taste the same.  I like attempting to make mine from scratch but doggone it, sometimes I just don't feel like cooking.  I saw the reviews and thought why not?  I took a leap of faith and got the case.  It is super easy to make, the flavor is very good, and I shared it with my friend.  She liked it so much I gave her a few boxes.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is a little dry.  Not quite enough cheese sauce to make it ooey, gooey like the other stuff used to be like.  I add some cheese to ramp up the gooey factor. That being the only downside for me, I love this stuff and will buy it again.  Who doesn't like easy after a long day at work, school or whatever?

They know that I have them and they beg for them!  I think the size is good too for my dogs although I did try to break them and I was unable to do it.  They are tough bones.  I will buy again!  Oh, and I see that the product is working!  My dogs teeth look much better!

review/summary: Great Flavor, Great Tea!
review/text: I don't usually like bag tea, I drink loose teas more often. However, I love this tea flavor!  Tazo did a great job with this green ginger bag tea.  It tastes more like ginger than green tea, but I prefer that.  The tea bag can also be used for more than one cup, I just keep refilling my cup with hot water while at work!  I could not find this tea at a grocery store, so when I found it online, I bought a decent supply of it.

review/summary: Won't get it from Amazon again
review/text: Alright so I love this granola. I usually buy it from Whole foods at 6.99/lb so when I saw this at $24/4 I thought what a great deal. So I get my box and there are only 2 bags in it, each bag weighs a lb so only 2lbs.<br /><br />I'm thinking the other 2 bags are in the mail somewhere, or the seller did not send it.<br /><br />This particular bag expires 5/4/2012, which is less than a month away. After I tasted it I usually eat it by the handful, but this one I couldn't eat too much of it because it tasted stale. Let's just say I've had fresher Honey and Milk Granola.<br /><br />Buy it at whole foods, not on amazon.

review/summary: Best coffee in the world
review/text: I have been drinking Maxwell International Cofee of the Suisse Mocha variety for as long as it's been in existence.  The choclatey taste is simply soul satisfying each and every cup.  I've had ulcers and had to  cut down almost entirely on coffee and for an eight cup a day person that was almost killing to me.  I actually make my cafe mocha with half of the amount they recommend you use and it's just wonderful...which means if you want to look at it that way, that I get twice as much coffee for my money, smile...and more importantly I can have some coffee on a daily basis.  Although, I rarely keep any long, it does keep pretty well, which for some people undoubtedly would be a plus when considering purchase.  Every single person I've made a cup or two or more, laugh, for loves it.  I've tried a few of their other types of international coffees as well and they are also very good, but nothing's as good as the Suisse Mocha!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZTA3ZK">Maxwell House International Coffee Suisse Mocha Caf&eacute;, 7.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: International pleasure in coffee induglence
review/text: I'm glad that your company carries this flavor along with others from the Maxwell International Coffee-Cafe department, although I'm most anxious to get at the Viennese chocolate flavor. I hope to depend on your company for replenishments so I won't have to go to my food supermarket repeatedly - thanks for this special inclusion in your online grocery-supplementary department!!

review/summary: Great mocha at home.
review/text: Instead of paying upwards of $3 for a mocha at a coffee shop, get the Maxwell House International Coffee in mocha and make it yourself! Tastes just like the mochas you are used to. And it is just sweet enough.<br /><br />I just warm milk on the stove and pour it in a cup with the mocha powder in it. Stir, and enjoy! It doesn't taste as good with water, but if you can't have milk or are watching your calories, it still tastes great. The other flavors aren't as good, in fact, the hazelnut one isn't good at all!

review/summary: Great treats that promote healthy teeth too
review/text: I purchased these for my dog and he absolutely loves them.  They don't last very long when he gets his paws on them but I don't mind because they help keep his teeth clean and who wants a foul smelling mouth on a dog? Not me for sure.  My only complaint is exactly that, they do not last very long once he starts chewing them.  Not a big complaint at all.

review/summary: Thicker than the CET Brand
review/text: My dogs also love these chews.  I had always purchased the C.E.T. brand in the past but these were a little cheaper.  I also found these to be somewhat thicker than the C.E.T. brand so they were not consumed as quickly and were better for stronger chewers.  Each bag varies in thickness with some pieces being almost flexible to others that are stiff and rigid.  If your dog has any teeth problems like cracks I would think the thinner CET brand chews would be a better choice.  I think these chews have kept my dog's teeth in good shape over the years.  I've been using them for about 5 years.  I am lazy about brushing my dog's teeth so I typically give them these chews at least once or twice a week.  The Enzadent Chews may not be as efficient as brushing your dog's teeth every day, but I think they are a close second.  I think because of these chews I have had to have my dog's teeth cleaned only every two or three years rather than every year.  The Vets almost always comment on the health of my dog's teeth.  Highly recommended.
