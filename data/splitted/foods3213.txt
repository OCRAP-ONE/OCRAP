review/summary: Greenies Joint Care
review/text: I am so glad to have found this product.  My dog had a problem on walks when he would have to pull up his rear leg and hop.  As a puppy he was operated on with little success. The Doctor said it was common in Yorkies and there was nothing more they could do.  Now he is 4 years old and with the addition of Greenies Joint Care I rarely see him limp. He LOVES the taste, he can't wait to get his daily "bone"

review/text: What an outstanding spice blend!!!  It will allow you to create a most unusual and delicious dish -- a wonderful blend of spicy, sweet and tangy flavors accenting the chicken.  Adding dates, sesame seed, cilantro, honey and lemon to the exotic blend of spices, you will create a dish that is quite unlike anything you've ever eaten. Great for holiday parties, too, since it can be made in advance.  You and your guests will find this Moroccan chicken is absolutely delicious!!!!!!

review/text: We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!

review/text: Regular decaf contains 52mg of chlorogenic acid on average while this coffee contains 132mgs.  It's also organic.  Whole Foods sells organic decaf starting at $12.99 and going up from there, so this is a bargain with more antioxidants to boot.  The regular Rich Rewards Breakfast Blend contains 172mgs. of chlorogenic acid, but I'm not crazy about the taste.  Right now I'm hooked on Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Cocoa Nibs & Organic Coffee. It's so delicious that I can't wait to wake up in the morning for my first cup of coffee.  After 1 cup of high test, I switch over to decaf, because otherwise I get the jitters.

review/text: I first purchased a package of these dried cranberries just a few weeks ago (after having just enjoyed cranberries in the salad at a restaurant). It has rapidly become a staple in the family diet. All three of us really enjoy just munching them plain or--even more--as an element in our green salads.<br /><br />Dried cranberries in a salad add a nice tolerable sweetness and a different texture than just the green vegetables that we incorporate into the salad.<br /><br />I suspect that we will continue to use this for some time to come. And we may also experiment with other dried fruits as a component of our salads.<br /><br />Worth takjing a look at if you like fruits in your salads.

review/summary: Delicious, but......
review/text: These carb-free mini crisps are delicious and so satisfying when you need that "crunch" without carbs. I love crackers but am staying away from them and thought these would fit the bill. The trouble is you don't get that many in a very small bag for a fairly expensive price, plus the shipping makes it prohibitive for me to order again. If you don't care about price, they are worth it, especially for entertaining. But you can also search the internet for recipes for making your own a ton cheaper. That said, this is a great product and a nice company. Just wish they offered coupons or free shipping once in a while.

review/text: Thought we would try them just to see what they were.  Remember doing a grilled cheese sandwich in the oven and a dribble or two of cheese would end up on the tray beside the sandwich?  Kinda crispy/crunchy but not actually burned, it would bubble and sizzle a bit and you could just pop it in the old mouth and crunch down on it... Well that's what these are, just out of aged parmesan cheese.  Not particularly bad, but not particularly good either.  Save your money.... Go make a grilled cheese sandwich for much cheaper.

review/text: The Parmesan crisps are good.  A great alternative for something crunchy when eating low carb.  I was shocked however when I saw how small the bag was.  I don't think most consumers know how many ounces a bag of chips is, but for $6+ S&H I was expecting a normal size bag of chips and this is a mini bag of chips (single serving).  So in my opinion not really worth the expense plus shipping for an afternoon snack.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I have used agave for many things and find that it is a better alternative to sugar.  It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it.

review/summary: convenient way of taking your agave with you!
review/text: I was hesitant about this product based on some customer reviews that said there were difficulties opening the little sticks and that they (the customers, not the sticks) got agave all over their fingers... I wonder if Stash read the reviews and changed their packaging?  I have not had this problem, and I'm usually *awful* at opening packaging! With these, I simply bite off the end (gross, I know, but I am a student and I don't/can't carry a knife around with me in my bookbag all day) and squeeze it into my coffee.  It's a great way to have my agave with me because most coffee shops and cafes have not yet started stocking this alongside their poisonous sugar alternatives (you know, those pink, blue, and yellow packets).  Keeps my blood sugar from spiking, sweetens my coffee--what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Smell delightful, taste not so much
review/text: I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!

review/text: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Deceptive Term = "Sticks"
review/text: When I ordered these, based on the description, I thought the honey was somehow hardened into stick-form and thus would 'melt' into a cup of hot tea.  I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term "stick" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.  But this product is a bust and I would never purchase it again.

A bag of twists and a bag of chicken jerky went right into the trash.

review/summary: Best healthy treats
review/text: I recently purchased a small bag of these twists containing sweet potato and chicken because it appeared to be a healthy snack to "treat" my Scottie when she is a good dog.  She is such a picky eater, snacks included, so I was pleased when she reacted positively and enjoyed her  first treat.  But i was really surprised when I arrived home the next afternoon!  She had found the bag, and she was able to pull it down to her level....and she had enjoyed the entire bag!  The good news was no stomach upset.  I will keep these on hand and out of her reach from now on.<br /><br />Just call us content in South Carolina!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VWBZJO">AKC Sweet Potato Chicken Jerky Twists Dog Treats, 16 Ounce</a>

review/summary: Great Treats BUT made in CHINA
review/text: I purchased these treats several times for our Yorkie Bruno. He really seemed to like them after all they were an AKC Product, so I thought nothing of making the purchase for my precious friend, as I trusted the quality & purity and the AKC Brand. I have since reconsidered making any further purchases of this product after hearing about the deaths and illness associated with both dog food and treats made in China. I was fortunate, in my particular case my pup showed no negative effects after eating them but I am no longer willing to put my pups health at risk. Please consider carefully where your pet food and treats are made. While the FDA still has made no connection between the treats from China and the Kidney, Liver failure & deaths of pets who died or developed serious conditions after consuming these products! There have been alerts & warning issued and some Companies have removed the products from store shelves. Be cautious about feeding your beloved pets possibly deadly treats/ food made in China...Buy American, at least there is some kind of regulations in place for quality, and safety.

review/summary: BumbleBee Ruined this New England Classic
review/text: What the flipping hell did they do to my clam chowder??<br /><br />  Normally, I eat healthy foods. We are a mostly-vegetarian household, but once in a while, PMS demands that I have some clam chowder. Snow's Clam Chowder to be exact. It is one of my few comfort foods, and I spiff it up a little so it really is like a good, hearty, restaurant clam chowder. It is delicious and creamy and has clams and makes me happy.<br /><br />  I picked up a can at Market Basket the other day. I noticed that Snow's is now "Snow's by BumbleBee." Ruh-roh, Shaggy.<br /><br />  It smelled wrong when I opened the can. Not bad or spoiled, just not right. The texture was all wrong. The color was different. Since I am apparently a doofus, I made it anyway. This stuff truly sucks. It has NO flavor. It tastes pretty much like lumpy school paste. Only more bland. Not even salty crackers made a bit of difference.<br /><br />  There was no warning on the label. Usually, when a company screws around with a tried-and-true recipe and ruins the product, the add a "NEW! Improved!" warning to the packaging to alert the public of their meddling. They didn't even do that. They just ruined it without any warning, and now my chowder is disgusting.<br /><br />  I've been eating Snow's for forty years, but Look's will be getting my chowder business, now. It may well be a dollar more per can, but that's well worth it since they know enough to leave a good thing alone.

review/summary: TERRIBLE
review/text: I have three cans left of the Original Snows Clam Chowder and when I purchased the modified "Snows Clam Chowder" I knew right away something was terribly wrong so I compared the Original can with the modified version.<br />The original can says "Authentic New England Clam Chowder" and the modified can says "New England Clam Chowder".<br />Also the original can shows a sketch of a New England Trolling or Shrimp boat while the modified can shows a photograph of the soup in a bowl.<br />The original which was creamy and thick says "Snows/Doxee Inc Cape May,NJ 08204-5400" while the modified looks to be made with skim milk and very thin and little potatoes and clams says "Bumble Bee Foods, LLC San Diego,CA 92186 USA. I think the clams are from Indonesia or Thailand or Vietnam or possibly made in these countries and shipped to the USA. Also the tuna that Bumble  Bee sells in those small cans is from Asian Countries and it is a watered down version with only 40% of the can has actual tuna while 60% is water. Not to go on a tangent but went to Costco and bought their Albacore Tuna cans made Costco Wholesale Corp. in Seattle, WA with the can comprising 99% of tuna and 1% of water.<br />I think Bumble Bee Co is the company owned by Nancy Pelosi and her husband. They own 5 companies that "manufacture", and believe me this junk they are passing off as New England Clam Chowder is manufactured, seafood products.<br />In this new modified version of Snows Clam Chowder the can still says the clams are from the New England coast which I feel is a lie.<br /><br />This present modified New England Clam Chowder is junk food and a distortion of what was a very good quality soup. I will no longer purchase this and all my friends whom I told to buy this product are now being told not too.

review/summary: Snows Clam Chowder
review/text: I've been eating Snows Clam Chowder for near 30 years. Since Bumblebee took over the brand it has become terrible! Less than half the clams, and half the potatos. Not near as thick, and the taste is completely different. I contacted Bumblebee, and all I got was a canned (no pun intended) response that the only thing changed was "it no longer has MSG". Anyone that is a fan of the original knows this to be an outright lie. To add insult, they sent me 6 coupons for......cans of Snows Clam Chowder. For all you fans of the original, call them, write to them, email them, do whatever you can. For for petes sake, dont buy this till they change it back. What a horrible soup it is now!

review/summary: New recipe is horrible.  :-(
review/text: The new condensed clam chowder product is bland and watery.  It resembles nothing of the original recipe that was recently discontinued.  I wrote an email to the company about it and all they did was mailed me a letter with a couple coupons to get free cans of more chowder and another couple coupons for $0.30 off any snows product. -- Eat more?  Really?  I just told them I didn't like it.  Don't patronize me. -- And from the reviews I've read on here, it doesnt look many other consumers like it either.  It doesn't seem that this is a company who cares about their customer loyalty and longevity. At the end of the day, this company seems to be more concerned about how much they can save on ingredient costs to inflate their profit. Totally disappointing.  I boycott all Bumblebee products now.  Beware, Bumble Bee Foods, LLC owns other brands including: Brunswick�, Beach Cliff�, and in Canada under the Clover Leaf� name.  I'll buy my chowder (and tuna) elsewhere.

review/text: I was in the mood for N.E. clam chowder,since some cooler weather had just moved in... I have been buying Snows for years and have always loved its taste, texture,and size of the clams and potatoes..Yes you paid more but it was worth it. Saw the bumble bee on the label,but didn't give it a thought that it would be anything like their cans of minced tuna,though I should have...WHAT happened to the snows I know??? this is not the same..tiny hardly reconizable pieces of clams,and less potatoes. And as for seasonings forget it,just tastes like heated milk. What happened to the hearty pieces of clams,and potatoes and seasonings?????? I stopped buying the tuna,now it looks like I have to stop buying the snows,because apparently its now being mad by bummble bee. I started buying our store brand of tuna,which is most definately a chunk tuna,,,now looks like I'll be trying the clam chowder too... Good luck Bumble with keeping snows on the shelf. I'm with everyone else,,not the Snows we know!!!!!!

review/summary: Good Canned Chowder
review/text: Snow's is hard to come by in the southwest supermarkets but<br />it is worth looking for or buying on line.  Closer to<br />homemade than the other name brands.  Less of a starchy<br />potato taste and more clam taste with the most clams of<br />any canned chowder we have eaten. The potatoes are small<br />and don't outnumber the clams.<br /><br />  The only negative is that the soup is not a pearl<br />white color like many other canned types of chowder.  It is more<br />a light creamy brown.  We use skin milk to make ours to<br />cut down on the fat, but use of a light cream or whole milk<br />would make the soup even better.  We also add diced celery,<br />butter, ground pepper, and parsley for a real fish restaurant<br />soup.  We recommend Snow's to anyone that likes good chowder<br />from a can.

While I am not a fan of clam chowder, the hubby rates this one at four stars. I for one can tell you it does look jam-packed with clams. We would definitely recommend this and I'm hoping to be able to find it again on Amazon.

review/summary: Let Down!!
review/text: When I saw the picture I was excited. I was going to give this as a 30th birthday present but I decided to try if for myself. It was a huge let down.  I don't remember wink soda and it tasted like a generic mountain dew.  The candy could have been from any decade. BTW where were the gummy savers. It was mostly generic stuff. Not worth the price at all. Shipping was too much. If they would take out that nasty generic soda the shipping could be cut in half.

review/summary: major disappointment
review/text: Looking at my 80's box, I am very disappointed with it. I cannot believe that there is a 1 liter bottle of soda in this small box, it takes up a third of all the space! This is a flat out rip-off, that was space that could have had candy! Not to mention that it isn't even a brand that we'd ever heard of, so it does us zero for nostalgia. Furthermore, there are more suckers in the box than anything else! I feel like this box, which should have been very easy, was completely thrown together without much thought and is complete garbage, especially as most of the candy is still available in stores.<br /><br />I had to spend more money just to fill in that empty third of the box when  I threw the soda away!

review/summary: Nice idea, but...
review/text: The idea is a good one. Who doesn't want to reminisce about their childhood when they were free and innocent?! But the price is a bit steep and the products aren't that impressive. Many of these items can be found in certain grocery or candy stores, and for a fraction of the price. It would be much more impressive and tantalizing if there were items that you can't find regularly. I would like to see one with old favorites such as dweebs, bonkers, gatorgum or bar none (to name a few). Bring back those and you can charge me any price you want!!!

review/summary: Couple of favorites saved it
review/text: Most of the candy in this package goes into, as others have said, a generic feel. I was only 4 when the 80s started so I do remember most of these items, but I don't ever remember buying wax fangs for anything except Halloween.<br /><br />I do remember Wink, I've noticed that some reviewers have mentioned they had never heard of it. I believe it was a mid-atlantic, upper south drink, Tennessee/Kentucky maybe Ohio areas. It seems like I liked it better when I was younger, but I don't really care for soft drinks now so that could be the problem.<br /><br />The ones that saved this package for me: The Smoothie and Goetze's Cow Tail. I never saw Smoothie's sold anywhere except this one little corner drugstore back in the early 80s. I can remember going there with my grandmother and she would always buy me what is pretty much a Reese Cup with no chocolate. The Cow Tale brought back the most memories for me. There was a gas station called Hop In, where I lived. The Cow Tails were in a big see-through container and I think were 20 cents each. My friends and I, when in elementary school, would buy these every morning before school from the Hop In beside of the school. I can remember holding one in my mouth while playing Donkey Kong or Joust in the back of the store.<br /><br />For bringing back some memories, I give the product 5 stars. It was used in a recent 15 year reunion from high school. For product selection, I give it a 3. Most of these candies are still available. As a matter of fact, I just bought a large container of Fire Balls, which was my favorite candy of the 80s. I have to take a little off the score for the shipping and the inclusion of products that aren't exactly candy, like the Wax Fangs and the Wax bottles.<br /><br />Anyone reading this that wants to get a few good memories and taste does help you remember things, I would recommend it, especially for reunions, but I can't say for candy lovers to buy it.<br /><br />Now can someone tell me what those candies were called that were like Fire Balls, but they were extremely sour? My wife and I are from two very different parts of the country and she says I'm crazy, "That's explains why I married you!"<br /><br />Seriously, I'm thinking they were called Tear Jerkers or Cry Babies or something like that. One of the things I remember about those is that they turn your tongue yellow. So you could never hide them in school, in your mouth. Anybody know what those were called?

The only possitive thing to mention, is it shipped and arrived fast.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my husband's 28th birthday.  When he was a kid, his mother never let him eat candy.  Needless to say he is a complete sugar fiend, and would eat candy for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I let him!<br /><br />When he opened the box, he exclaimed, "This is a really cool gift!" and immediately tore into the box.  It generated a great conversation about what candy we remembered.<br /><br />Some of the candy appears to be knock-offs of the ones everyone remembers (where are the Pop Rocks??), and some of the candy we had never heard of.  Oh, and he opened the box upside down so he didn't see the "Don't Open Unless You're A Child of The Eighties!" until he closed it.<br /><br />All in all a very nice gift.  He's away on business now and hid the box from me so I can't eat any while he's gone!

For the price of this collection of candy I def got ripped off.  I knew what I was buying because of the candy list but wow just 1 piece of each candy! and 12 dollars for shipping!  I would not have been upset if the candy was really hard to find 80's candy but with the exception of the nintendo candy everything else you can find at a local store.

review/summary: Don't buy this item!
review/text: I really wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this,unfortunately I bought it during a lightening deal and felt rushed to purchase it. Read the review I completely agree this product or sale is crap! The cute box in the picture isn't even in the shipped product, it all is just tossed in a shipping box with some cheezy saying I can't even read because it's covered in shipping labels, and tape. I opened the box to find the majority of the weight it a 1 liter bottle of some soda I have never heard of, and I would say about 50% of the candy wasn't even legit, and most of it was generic! Seriously disappointed in this product. I could have created something unique myself with candy from the $1 store because that's what this felt like! So save yourself some time and money and don't buy this product.

review/text: I bought this on a Black Friday deal, and after all the mixed reviews was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure if these reviews are getting mixed with another product (there's another, completely different 80s candy box on Amazon) or if the manufacturer changed the product over time. There's no 1-liter of soda in my box, the candy exactly matches what's in the description, and the box/candy seems to be in great shape. I'll admit that I probably wouldn't pay full price, but it was well worth the discounted price and I think the concept is a lot of fun.

review/text: Got this for my wife after she saw it and talked about it.  The box is an impressive array of 80's candy, and very well put together.  On candy alone it's an ok value, but given you didn't have to go find it all it is a really good deal.<br /><br />However, what we found is candy is a bit of a personal thing.  Perhaps 25% of the things were items we really remembered from being a kid.  25% were things we didn't like.  50% were just ok.  This is probably more an indication that you can't relive your youth than anything else....<br /><br />Still, I would buy again.  If nothing else it is worth the conversation it creates.

review/text: I just received my re-order of this product from this vendor.  Although the price has gone up since I last ordered, so has the price for all wheat products.  The product has excellent shelf life at room temperature and cooks consistently delicious using only the "basic" preparation of 1 part bulgur, 2 parts water brought to a boil and lowered to a minimal simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Of course, additional seasoning is to your personal taste.  It is a great accompaniment to roast chicken, pot roast, chili (try it instead of rice or spaghetti), and many other dishes, and much healthier.  Try it as a substitute for cous cous in traditional North African and Middle Eastern dishes.

review/text: I was looking for a economical high quality dry dog food.  I have an aged German Shepherd who has trouble maintaining his weight as well as two other large dogs adopted from the local shelter.  Within a month of feeding this food I noticed changes in all of the dogs.  The older German Shepherd gained weight and energy. After a year on this food his coat is thick and shiny.  His weight<br />is maintained at a healthy level.  The other two dogs also have nice coats and weight.  They eat the dog food dry with a few fresh chicken scraps added occasionally.  Check the label and compare with not only the premium brands but with the common supermarket brands.<br />I found that with very little compromise this dog food compares favorably with higher-priced premium foods.  I also have seen that<br />the high end supermarket brands are creeping up to the one-dollar-a-pound price and their ingredients contain many fillers.<br />This dog food can also be fed in smaller quantities than the supermarket brand.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKUOY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult  Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCQ6DY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Chicken and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>

I tried following the directions of mixing in a little at time of the old and new food, but my 80 pound shepard mix started getting mouth fulls of the Iams/Diamond mix then dumping them on the floor so he could pick out the Diamond and leave the Iams there.

review/summary: Diamond Is Forever!
review/text: The veterinarian I worked for recommended Diamond Dog foor to all his breeders to feed to their bitches before and after birth and to their puppies,  I have used it ever since then (18 years).  I bred basset hounds for many years and I fed Diamond puppy food  exclusively and had healthy puppies with beautiful coats and no skin issues.  I have fed Diamond Maintenance to all my dogs over sox months of age, they have stayed fit and healthy with good teeth, plenty of stmina, and beautiful coats.  I now have Australian Shepherds and have switched to Diamond Naturals Dry Dog food for large breeds with glucosamine and chondroitin.  My Aussies run in Agility Trials and I want them to have a good balanced diet to keep them healthy and performing well.  It is important that their joints and bones are healthy so they can run, jump, play, and be happy for many years, even after retirement.  BTW, feeding only dry dog food, limiting table scraps, using rope tugs and chew toys helps keep dogs' teeth clean and reduces tarter build up.  My Aussies are 7 and 10 years old and have beautiful white teeth.

review/text: I have two mastiffs; an English and an Italian (aka Cane Corso). As owner of giant breeds Im always looking for the best products for my babies. With a recent lay off I needed to slash my budget without compromising the health of my girls. Naturally I was searching for a holistic food that caters specifically to the needs of giant breeds. I was ecstatic when I found this food. The ingredient levels were nearly perfect and had extra minerals good for joints too. All natural food with chicken being the 1st ingredient and at a great price especially since im buying for two. I compared it to Blue Buffalo, which is great but still a little pricey, the labels were almost identical. What a God send! Unfortunately, neither one of my girls liked the food. They disliked it so much so they did not eat for 3 days. I added a little water to release the aroma, I soaked it in chiken broth, they just didnt want it. Maybe my girls are spoiled. I would recommend starting with a small bag to see if your dog likes it. As for me, the search continues.

Prior to purchasing this product, I used to purchase Blue Buffalo food for my fur child, but after I was laid off I did some research to see if I could find a product of the same caliber for less money.<br /><br />Prior to ordering dog food on Amazon, I used to drive to the pet store every month, pay taxes and carry the bag through the store, to my car, out of my car and finally home. I use to spend over $50 at the pet store for 30lb of dog food plus my time, gas and energy.<br /><br />I now pay under $40 for 40 lbs of food, shipped to my doorstep for free rather than over $50 for 30 lbs plus the drive etc.!<br /><br />My dog and I love this food and are really pleased that we made the switch!

review/summary: A great Diamond product as expected.
review/text: My large breed Mastiff really enjoys this food, but I'm not sure it's settling well with him yet. It's only been about 2 weeks, and I didn't slowly transition the food like I usually do. I will update this review in a month or so...

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: My dog loves this stuff.  I switched from Innova large breed to get some variation (and because her name is Diamond).  She used to take a long time to eat the Innova stuff and just look at me for a bit after I put it in her bowl.  Now she eats this stuff immediately and quickly.

review/summary: good food, good price
review/text: My Great Dane is a picky eater, but she really seems to enjoy this food. Her coat is shiny, her stool is firm, and she is happy and healthy. I have tried other more expensive foods, but she has doesn't eat anything else as well as Diamond. I have researched and checked the ingredients and I am very pleased.

review/summary: Excellent Finishing Salt
review/text: I bought this because I had heard about the wonderful, mild flavor of fleur de sel, and the gourmet inside me wanted to give it a taste. This is the best salt I have ever tried. I have sprinkled it on everything from fresh peas with olive oil to homemade caramels. It's soft flavor is salty without being overbearing. And it adds a delectable crunch to whatever it compliments. This is sexy salt.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K6Z22U">Das Foods Fleur de Sel De Guerande- French Sea Salt ; 6oz</a> This is perfect to add that gourmet touch to your baked goods. I use it for homemade crackers, breads, and whatever else occurs to me as I cook and bake.  "Flower of the Sea" is the best of the sea salt, whether you say it in French or English.<br /><br />I recommend it for all chefs and chefs-to-be!
