review/summary: Pretty good stuff
review/text: One of my three cats loves this mildly smelly stuff as a treat; the others aren't as excited about it, but enjoy it well enough. But of course, cats are finicky, so explaining the different intensities of reaction isn't hard. They're cats. I don't know if I'll buy more, because it's sort of pricey as a treat for one of three cats.

review/text: I wanted 'Cat-Man-Do' Bonita flakes.  These are straight from japan so who knows what the flakes are...whale? dolphin? All writing on the package is in japanese.  The picture of the flakes (on amazon) shows a little cat similar to the one on the Cat-Man-Do package.  Since I don't like tricky little schemes like this & I don't support japanese fisheries I am returning the flakes & reordering the type we use around here.

review/text: I purchased this to incorporate into my own Ras El Hanout (along with some Lavender Powder: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015E34L2 , and a number of other ground spices).<br /><br />The floral component of the Ras El Hanout was perfectly accomplished with these two additions [a very little bit goes a LONG way!], and I had plenty left over for use in my experimental perfume-making hobby.<br /><br />The scent of the rose powder is lovely and the taste is not too bitter, with the Rosy 'nose' of the component being greater than the wholly-natural and expected bitterness of it.

It's super easy to spread & adds a nice sweetness, especially if you're adding it to shakes instead of trying to use it as jelly. I'll continue to use it as jelly in PB&Js, it's just going to take a little getting used to. But w/ my shakes, it's "da bomb"! :)

review/text: I had my doubts when I purchased this, it sounded too good to be true! Also on the shelf it was watery and not jelly-like at all. However, once I refrigerated it the jelly thickened right up! It is a lot like a "real" jelly spread but without all the sugar and unnecessary calories. This is a MUST HAVE for a dieter! Paired with a sugar free peanut butter on light bread - this is the perfect snack or small lunch. The splenda taste is apparent but not overbearing. This tastes better than most "sugar free" or "low-sugar" jellies and spreads on the market.

review/summary: too artifitial to work
review/text: Maybe the problem is my expectation -- I thought it would somehow have blueberry flavor in it, and spreadable, but it is a jar of sour flavored jelly. It runs quite quickly because you can't spread or paste it on anything, too jelly-o.  The only way to eat it I found was to mix with non fat yoghurt (original flavor). But I 'd rather take in additional 20 calories for a scoop of real jam.

review/text: I have really enjoyed walden farm's calorie free barbecue sauces and salad dressings, so I ventured forth into the realm of fruit spread -- it was a mistake. The spread hardly spreads at all, and tastes extremely artificial. If you are looking for a healthier blueberry spread, I recommend simply using frozen blueberries with truvia. This stuff is truly awful and a waste of money.

review/summary: A fabulous Smoothie!
review/text: Jet smoothies are absolutely great!  We started using this mix at my work in place of our old smoothie mix, and everyone loves them!  These smoothies are incredibly easy to make.  You just fill a glass with ice, then pour the mix to the top of the glass, then blend.<br /><br />The flavor of this smoothie is terrific!  Although it is made with green tea, you can't taste the tea over the intense fruit flavor.  One of my customers today made the comment that it tastes like you just put peaches in the blender.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I'm sitting at home, craving a smoothie, and since I won't have another one til I get to work tomorrow, I thought I'd come online and see if the mix is available for order.  I'm glad to see that I can get this for home use, because I'm addicted!

review/summary: The best true peach flavor out there
review/text: If true peach flavor is what you crave, then you have found your best mix option.  This mix is a lot better than what you get at the smoothie stands in the shopping malls.  I found out about this product after trying a pre-made smoothie sold by our local Wegman's grocery store. Just out of curiosity my wife asked if they sold the mix and they did. Twelve bucks for the 64 ouncer. If you live near a Wegman's that's the way to go.  If I would have just been window shopping on the net, I never would have just bought this sight unseen because of the green tea. However, you can't taste the green tea so don't let the tea scare you away from this one.  Unlike some other smoothie mixes that recommend yogurt, water or sugar be added, this is an all in one mix and it's super easy.  I'm betting this would make a great alcoholic drink mix and will begin experimenting with that at a later time.

review/summary: What a tasty chip!
review/text: I tried these at random, purchased from a gas station when I wanted a spicy snack. I thought 'really, what do I have to lose?' It took only a few bites before I went looking for how to acquire more. I'd had dill chips before, but this was a new twist that I really went for. In my estimation, these aren't super hot (though my wife says I can take a lot of heat), but if you prefer things to be with a 'mild kick' these might be a bit overwhelming. Then again, it does say spicy right on the bag!<br /><br />The chips are crispy and not at all brittle like a number of chips out there.. kettle chips, just as the brand says. The flavor is packed in, but it doesn't feel like the chip is utterly dowsed with the powder. I pounced the moment I saw these were available, and will be keeping my eye out for more!

review/summary: Ew.
review/text: About a month ago, I sent one of these sheets to my dorm-living daughter.  She loves Rice Krispies Treats, and I thought that these would be a good substitute for the ones I usually make.  After all, they're the best she's going to get with no kitchen facilities.<br /><br />Last weekend, my daughter came home, lugging these under her arm.  "None of the girls would eat them for the calories, and the boys wanted to eat the whole thing by themselves.  So, it's comin' home."<br /><br />I decided to open the package and have a square.  I looked for a re-closable zipper, but the package has none.  It didn't have any directions for opening, so I opened one end and tried to slide out the treat.  Yeah,right.  After much turmoil, I ended up with a giant treat stuck to cardboard on one side and with strips of colored mylar hanging from the other.  I picked off the strips of mylar with my nails, which made just opening this package a longer chore than making Rice Krispie Treats from scratch. (As much as you can say that)<br /><br />I cut the giant treat in squares, and kept thinking I was missing something.  Then I realized it!  I didn't smell the faint cooked sugar and butter smell that I get when I make the treats myself.  These smelled like corn syrup.  They cut easily enough, which is something you can't always say about the homemade kind.  But when I lifted the treat to have a taste, I realized why it was so easy to cut.  It's gummy and gooey, with lots of "stuff" between the little puffs of cereal.  It has a lot more marshmallow to cereal than the ones made by the recipe on the side of the Rice Krispies box.  I like the cereal, and the normal smell and the firmer texture of the homemade treats.<br /><br />I like the taste of the homemade treats, too -- and these didn't have it.  They tasted more like a candy bar than a bunch of marshmallows melted in a bit of butter (or margarine, which I don't use)  and mixed with a box of Rice Krispies.  There was an overwhelming rush of sugar, and the corn syrup featured prominently in the taste of the bars.  There was an aftertaste I couldn't recognize, which I will attribute to being carried back and forth to college.  Have to be fair, you know.<br /><br />I gave it two stars for convenience.  If you don't have a kitchen and you want a Rice Krispie Treat, then this is the only way you're going to get one. The packaging needs work, though.  Expecting this to taste homemade probably isn't fair, but since this costs more and bills itself as "the Original," I'm going to keep comparing the two.  And in that comparison, this loses badly.  Make the things yourself in a few minutes and wrap in buttered foil before shipping them to a friend. It might be a little messy, but it will also be worlds tastier.

review/text: I was hoping for a much stronger cinnamon flavor. But this cinnamon is more like the store bought McCormick cinnamon. Nothing realy fancy about it.  I am sticking with the Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon for my baking needs. Otherwise, this a "standard" cinnamon. Nothing special.

review/summary: Cassia great for diabetics
review/text: Cassia cinnamon is a milder cinnamon and isn't used as much for flavorful cooking as it is to help with controlling blood sugars; used in this manner, cassia cinnamon stands at the head of the line of all the cinnamons. Also, because many recipes for diabetics call for larger amounts of cinnamon, other types of cinnamon can have a real bite or bitter taste, but cassia cinnamon, with its milder taste, is perfect.

review/summary: I highly recommend trying this tea
review/text: I used to drink this tea daily, years ago, and both my local health food stores stopped stocking it.  They started carrying something a bit different, from this same company, so I just assumed they were no longer making it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and at a wonderful price as well.  I recommend this to any woman who suffers from PMS symptoms---mine are moderate to sometimes severe and I see a huge improvement when I drink it.  God provides.  It's heartening that there's a healthy alternative to prescription drugs, Midol, and birth control pills.  PMS is NOT 'all in your head' and this product is NOT 'a placebo effect'--I've seen both things recently written and it infuriates me.  You really have nothing to lose except your PMS symptoms, by trying this tea. I believe you can even order this by the box, if you don't want to buy the case.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it carries a warning for people who have liver problems---so if you do, I guess stay away from this product.  Otherwise, try it and see if it works for you.

review/summary: Love the PMS tea!
review/text: I love Traditional Medicinals PMS Tea and have used it for about 10 years now.  I used to get it at the natural foods/ healthy food sections at the grocery stores and sometimes in the tea sections at some stores, but lately it was getting more difficult to find.  It is a better deal to buy it in bulk on-line, plus having it shipped to your door is wonderful.... I don't have to hunt for it in the stores and then be dissappointed if they do not have any in stock.  I usually use the PMS tea about a week or week and a half before my period starts.  It helps me mostly with my irritability and mood swings! Whenever I am getting too stressed about the simplest things, this tea helps me to calm down.  I don't normally have cramps, so I can't say how it would help with cramping. It helps with bloating and that tired feeling that comes before the cycle begins.  Overall, it helps me get through the tough time before my period starts. Thanks for having such a wonderful product!

review/text: as soon as i start feeling bloated and depressed every month i start drinking a cup or two of this a day and start feeling better.  i normally drink very strong, usually bitter teas and the taste of this one isn't the best. but if i use one bag of this and one bag of peach (i'm sure peppermint or some other fruity type) and the taste isn't an issue. i had gone to the store to look for midol and found that it contains an antihistime.  i didn't even bother finding out why but just looked for alternatives.  i already take allergy medicine i don't need more antihistime in my body.  i don't believe this is a placebo effect but if it is it helps so either way you win.

review/summary: yay. that feels better.
review/text: I'm actually drinking this as I type. So this is my PMS-y review.<br /><br />This tea makes me... not feel homicial? Okay that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I do have a big emotional jump the week before my period. Seems to make the cramps lighter and the period shorter as well. On the box it says it helps to flush the kidney of the excess hormones or something like that- which explains a lot.<br /><br />The taste leaves something to be desired. I describe it as, "Cigarette Butt Water," sadly, I know how this tastes ;Q but hey, my palate is a bit less sophisticated than some. With a tablespoon or more of honey it tastes ok. I'm not dropping a star because of that, it's tea, I drink a lot of them, they work. Sometimes they taste good, sometimes they don't.<br /><br />I definitely recommend trying this if you feel a bit crazy or achy before and during your period.

review/summary: It helps me with bloating.
review/text: I find that this tea is a good solution for the most bothersome PMS symptom that I experience every month - bloating/water retention.<br /><br />I usually gain about 4 to 6 pounds of water weight which comes on about a week before my period.  It happens every month like clockwork.<br /><br />Drinking this tea seems to help with the water retention a lot.  I drink 2 teabags worth twice a day during the peak of my symptoms, starting whenever I start to notice myself getting bloated.  It seems to help decrease the bloating, and objectively I can weigh myself and see that when I start to drink the tea, I lose 2 - 4 pounds of the retained water weight within the next day.  I have to keep drinking it every day to maintain the effect, though.<br /><br />I don't really have noticeable mood symptoms so I can't speak to whether the tea helps with those.  I always have increased appetite around the time when I experience the bloating and the tea does not seem to change that.<br /><br />Also, this tea doesn't taste good.  It's not vile, but it's not exactly tasty either.  But hey, I'm not drinking it for the flavor. :)

review/text: After reading the last review, I needed to write another review. This is a great neutral beer yeast. I've used it several times with many different Ale's with great results. It doesn't impart many flavors on the beer. Many brewers keep a couple of these around as a backup because of this. Buy without worry and hydrate in sanitized room temp water before pitching for best results.

review/summary: Greatly Satisified with this yeast!
review/text: I have been using this yeast in all grain brewing for about a year.  I'm very pleased with it and the price here is better than I could find anywhere else.  The review by DavJohn is way off base.  That person didn't follow the instructions or use this product properly.  If you read the instructions or visit the company's website, (which I did) and follow the simple instructions, (also reflected on the back of the package) this yeast will never let you down.<br /><br />I have brewed everything from English Brown Ale to the recipes made famous for Centennial Blonde Ale on many websites.  I have never, (in over 200+ gallons) had this yeast fail and it also starts quickly.  I have finished batches, (typically 10 gallon batches is what I brew) as late as 10PM and found vigorous fermentation occurring when I checked the following morning after only a few hours.<br /><br />It doesn't take forever to start or complete.  I especially like the flavor neutrality of this yeast.  It doesn't inject any unwanted flavors during fermentation or mask the taste you're looking for in your brew.  Easy to use and work with, extremely consistant, and inexpensive.  I keep it in stock for my brewing. You can't go wrong with this yeast.  Happy Brewing!

review/summary: Great results so far
review/text: I tried this yeast for cider on the recommendation that it would produce a dry, beerlike English-style cider. I have started two batches so far. In batch 1, the yeast hydrated in water and started a good ferment in the carboy after about a day and a quarter. Activity was as expected for all 2 1/2 weeks of the first ferment. It's racked and aging now, but the taste is already very promising- quite like beer, with plenty of apple notes that the yeast does not overwhelm. I would expect that properly aged the result will indeed be pretty English.<br /><br />Batch 2 I hydrated in the actual juice (reserved from the main stock). You aren't supposed to do this but I wanted to keep my volume of liquid down and my taste undiluted. Low and behold, I got bubbles even faster, in only about 12 hours. VERY impressed.<br /><br />If you use this yeast for cider remember that apple juice/soft cider is nutritionally incomplete for beer yeasts; you should feed it with some yeast nutrient (available on Amazon as well) and some sugar (I use Woodstock organic brown).<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I have completed 2 batches of cider using Nottingham. Results were very good; all sulphery notes during ferment disappeared fairly quickly and the yeast did not impart a yeasty taste to the finished brews. One thing I have noticed is that in both cases, getting the yeast to perk back up for bottle carbonation took a pretty long time- it seems like in an alcohol-rich environment Nottingham dies or goes dormant pretty fast, which probably makes it a good candidate for cold crashing.<br /><br />I will definitely use this yeast again for the great taste and consistent results it produces.

review/text: I know this sounds crazy. I discovered this method accidentally one day when the oats n honey bar slipped from my hand and dropped into the sink. Not wanting to waste the food, I thought "eh, I'll just rinse it with water and gobble it up." Much to my surprise this rinsed half-bar tasted MUCH BETTER than the original. It serves two purposes: To "tenderize" the bar, making it become a soft tasty crunchy instead of the hard, uninviting crunchy, and also washes away a lot of the sugar making it a lot tastier and healthier (the bars are originally too sweet in my opinion). People have said "eat it with water" etc. which helps with the dryness, but it simply is not the same as rinsing or dipping in water. Ever since I started using this technique the bars have gone from merely good-tasting to heavenly.

review/summary: Oats and Honey
review/text: It didn't expire anytime soon and it tastes pretty good although a bit sweet. Only problem was apparently, the family gobbled it up too fast and I figured where the 96 bars came from. There are two small bars per package and this is somewhat misleading. I mean you can put 4 tiny bars in a package and then say you have 192 bars. Would consider buy again though.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: Granola bars used to be considered "Health Food", and didn't taste all that great. The new generation of granola bars falls into the newer category of "Better For You" snacks, may not be quite as good for you as the old ones, but they actually taste like human food, so that is a plus.<br /><br />These "Nature Valley Oats 'N Honey" are particularly addictive, just the right amount of sweetness, and enough whole grain fiber to take some of the guilt out of the equation.

review/text: I've always liked the oats n' honey bars and was in the habit of eating them at work - for 90 cents from the vending machine. Thankfully I realized that Amazon must sell them for cheaper, and I was right. (Bought it with my other account that has Prime and it came next day to NYC!)<br /><br />One packet of these bars plus a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill | Energy Vitamin Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots & Coffee (60 Capsules)</a> and some milk is my breakfast most days of the week.

review/text: This tasted just the same to me but I definitely noticed that this item is slightly thinner than the same bar that I got from a local grocery store so you get somewhat less for your money. I confirmed this by placing them side by side. However, it's still a time saver to have 96bars in one box delivered to your home instead of making several trips to the store.

review/summary: Inexpensive great dry cat food
review/text: I was never a cat lover until our oldest one followed us home when we were in NY. She was over year old but only weighted less than 3 or 4 lbs when she first met us. She has very sensentive system and has food allery to a lot of things. We tried a couple of different cat dry foods and found this is the only one that she would eat it and doesn't have food allergy. Both of our black cats have shiny coat now. My vet said that they are very healthy .<br /><br />We just hosted our neightbor's cat for almost a month when our neightbor was away. Her cat loves this cat food and her coat start shinny after eating this cat food for one month. I gave my neighbor some samples and she found that her cat really likes them.

review/summary: My puppies love it!!!
review/text: My two puppies started off on Solid Gold, but one day while I was picking them up from their doggy daycare the receptionist asked me if I would like to try a sample of Earthborn Holisitic. I figured it couldn't hurt, and seeing as it was rated higher than Solid Gold, I took home the $7 sample. My dogs, LOVED IT. The kibble is a lot smaller than the Solid Gold was and seeing as my Bichon Frise is about 10 lbs and my Maltese-Shih Tzu mix is about 7lbs, the kibble is a lot easier for their tiny mouths to work on! I have been feeding them Earthborn Holistic for about three months now and they still finish their bowls clean every day before I get home from work! Their poop is nice and solid, and they are as happy and healthy as ever.

review/summary: Puppy loved this food
review/text: My 8 week old golden retriever came from the breeders with Eukanuba Puppy Chiot but after checking the ingredients decided to switch to a higher quality food. Found Puppy Vantage to have the best combination of quality ingredients and price in addition to free Amazon shipping.  I know you are supposed to gradually introduce a new food to you dog but I mixed it for only a couple of days without any perceivable problem.  My puppy definitely appeared to like this food over her prior Eukanuba. The kibbels are much smaller and appear easier to eat.  Previously the puppy would eat, stop, then eat again.  With Earthborn Vantage, he eats non-stop!  The bag also has an easy zip closure.  Overall very satisfied with the puppy food.

review/text: This liquorice is absolutely amazing. It tastes very unlike the regular, hard stuff that Twizzlers and other brands make. The texture is completely different, with very chewy, large pieces. It has a nice sweet strawberry taste that just about anyone will like. Unfortunately it's very hard to find: you may see other Austrailian brands out there like Black Opal, which is closer to this brand than American products, but Kookaburra is definately the King of Liquorice.

It tasted like it had set around in a warehouse for a couple months. In the future I will only buy this product in a store, in person... so I know what I am getting. Normally this is exceptionally good candy ! with a soft and less chewy texture than your average liquorice.

review/text: Nice to see it on sale.  Love the coffee and it will be a staple in my coffee lineup.  Just right on the flavor scale, not to weak or strong.  Green Mountain coffees are always consistant.  Every K-cup of the same blend tastes the same.  I've had other brands that had weaker or stronger or even bitter cups come from the same blend.  I think it might be due to poor processing/packaging or maybe they're not buying from the same growers?  After a ton of 'sampler' packs I'm finally narrowing my brands down no thanks to other brands inconsistancies.  Thank you Green Mountain!
