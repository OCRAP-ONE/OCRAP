review/summary: Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix - Thumbs Up!
review/text: I have been using this product for about 5 years now.  When my then 3 year old son was diagosed with celiac disease and couldn't part with his pancakes, I began a search for suitable gluten free mixes - and this was the clear winner!  It doesn't have a "beany" taste (from garbanzo flour) that some of the other mixes have and the texture is very similar to "traditional" pancakes. The entire family thinks that the pancakes are delicious - and for more flavor, you can add milk instead of water to the mix.  I've used the mix for biscuits, last minute pizza crusts, cookies and pot pie topper.  This is a staple in our home gluten-free pantry.

review/summary: Pamela's is best
review/text: My husband is allergic to wheat so needless to say I've tried many mixes and even mix my own baking flours at home.  For a store-bought mix, no question Pamela's is the absolute best you will try.  You will pay for it, but at our house we've decided it's worth it.  The pancakes are outstanding and easy, but I also use the scones and mix Pamela's with my homemade mixes for muffins, breads, cookies, cobbler, etc.  Amazon's price was $5 cheaper a bag than what I pay at the store (even after shipping) so that helps with the budget.  Excellent quality and flavor; you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: bannana bread
review/text: This made GREAT bannana bread - added a few mini choc chips and could even get my kids to eat this bread. I did not like the bits of almond in it - but just sift them out. I think the Orgran flour works better for pancakes, etc. But this did work and was good and made decent waffles and pancakes. I just like how the Orgran cooks up better. Kids ate both fine. Both of these are better than the Namaste - which I feel is too dense and the kids hate. Both Orgran and Pamelas did not have any odd taste or textures. I am ordering both again - though will only use the Pamela's for the awesome Bannana bread - which is so far the only GF bread my kids will eat. The Orgran I could substitute cup for cup with regular flour. I could even make a puff pancake with that stuff.

review/summary: Very good chocolate chip cookies and batter
review/text: My wife discovered that she had a gluten intolerance and it was causing the majority of her body pains.  We purged our kitchen, freezer, and fridge of everything gluten, and that meant many of the sweets.  Desperate for gluten free sweets, we tried a betty crocker gluten free cake mix and it was horrible.  We then found Pamela's pancake and baking mix.  Printed on the packaging (and on her website) was a recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Since we had purchased gluten free boxed cookies in the past at stores, and found they were awful, we were really excited and hopeful for the cookie recipe.<br /><br />Needless to say, my wife and I love the chocolate chip cookies.  They are extremely soft and have stayed soft for over 10 days since the initial bake.  They tasted just as good on day 10 as day 1.  We found cooking them two minutes less than the recommendation was adequate and kept them soft.<br /><br />Since going gluten free we have missed the convenience of typical foods many people take for granted, like being able to throw some breaded chicken strips in an oven and have a tasty snack/meal in about 30 minutes.  We decided to make our own with Pamela's mix.  Following the instructions on the pack we cut fresh boneless/skinless chick breasts, put them in milk, and then covered them with the mix(and some salt/pepper/seasoning mix), then fried them in oil.  They tasted amazing and we don't miss the frozen ones at all anymore.  In fact, if we have left overs we throw them in the freezer and pop them in the toaster oven like we use to.

I substituted Pamela's mix for wheat flour in our favorite cornbread recipe and it was yummy.  We also used it as a substitute for wheat flour in gingerbread cookies and oatmeal muffins.  I will keep some of this product on hand at all times and continue to experiment with it.  Fantastic!

review/text: Enjoying homemade goodies can be quite challanging when you require a wheat & gluten free diet.  This mix makes it so-o-o much easier!  You can make cookies, coffee cake, pancakes, even biscuits.  The Recipes are on the back of the bag.  Quick & easy.  Often times with this kind on diet, you would have to buy many ingredients to mix together as a substitute for wheat flour - that is very expensive & not always tasty.  I highly recommend Pamela's baking mix !!!  I have also used many of her other mixes & they are very good too.  Added bonus is that people who don't have to eat gluten free can't tast the difference.  Pamala's mixes REALLY are that GOOD!

review/text: This stuff is amazing. Not only does it make decent pancakes, but you can use it as a wheat-flour substitute in many recipes and get better results than using most other gf flour substitutes. As long as you aren't baking dairy-free as well (this has dairy in it), use this instead of wheat flour. Good in muffin recipes, corn breads, banana breads, and makes a fine coating for fried chicken. Buy it in bulk and get free delivery, which saves a ton of money over buying the little tiny bags at the supermarket.<br /><br />Honestly the best, most useful food purchase I've made on the Internet.

Even my gluten-free hating husband loves the pancakes which turn out fluffy every time. I've made many of the recipes on the bag, most of them have been hits including the drop biscuits. This has also come to be a replacement for regular flour in regular "glutened" recipes such as banana bread, macaroni and cheese and gravy. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: great for those without celiac disease as well
review/text: i bought this mix, not due to gluten intolerance, but because i was extremely curious when i kept seeing Pamela's in the bestselling list for Amazon groceries.  I thought, what flour could be such a best seller at such a (relatively) high price?  I now understand better that this flour contains some expensive ingredients (almond flour), and items that would be somewhat inconvenient to assemble and mix at home.  anyway, i bought a 3 pack to try it out, when i recently went on a waffle-making spree. well, i have to say, just trying the recipe on the Pamela's bag had me quite impressed.  I added cornmeal, and it was even better (i like crunchy cornmeal waffles). because i don't have celiacs, i ended up with a recipe combination using wheat flour as well, and the result has been tremendous.  Pamela's is a fantastic product, and the taste is marvelous- sweet, nutty, textured.  i have not tried it for anything else but 50 or so different waffle recipe experiements, but i am so pleased with the results, that i will always order Pamela's to use as a component in my waffles.  like i said earlier, though, the Pamela's waffle recipe right on their bag is quite delicious by itself!  thank you Pamela's.  if i were gluten-intolerant, i think this product would save me.

review/text: When I first found out a few months ago that I have Celiacs, I thought I would never be making some of my favorite baked recipes again. I bought a couple of bags of gluten free flours and found them gritty and not to my liking.<br />  I then did a lot of research by reading other peoples reviews of products and found Pamela's baking and pancake mix had rave reviews. To my delight, I have made several of my own recipes with great results. I made these desserts for our 4th of July party and nobody knew they were gluten free. I had to tell my sister and my grown son (also recently diagnosed with Celiacs) that they could also indulge in these tasty treats. I'm looking forward to trying more of my longtime treasured recipes. I would also like to thank Amazon for the great price on these items. I priced one 4 lb. bag at my local health food store and was shocked to see the 26 dollar price tag.

review/text: I have been using Pamela's for over 3 years and love it! The only thing I don't like it for is pancakes, ironically. They seem to come out heavy and doughy. I love Bob's Red Mill pancake mix better. But for everything else I love Pamela's. I make lemon bars, pumpkin bread and muffins, orange chocolate-chip scones, the chocolate chip cookies on the back, sugar cookies, brownies, and lots more. I have never had a bad result, and often my family can't tell any difference between these and wheat-based baked goods. When taking baked goods made with Pamela's people often ask for recipes not even knowing they are gluten-free. One gluten-eating person even bought a bag of Pamela's from me to try my pumpkin muffins. Definitely worth the $!

I have made cake, scones, muffins, cookies, pancakes and they are all wonderful.  I have also used it in place of flour in my regular recipes and it turned out great.  I hope you continue to carry this product because I buy it on a regular basis and my friends and family are even starting to use it and they are not even on glutten free diets.

review/summary: Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix
review/text: I have been on a gluten-free diet for the past 2 months.  Most of my cooking has been from scratch so I love this mix as I use my same recipes and don't even altar them at all.  I use this mix for my favorite roll and cut biscuits.  My favorite muffin recipe is the one on the back of the sack which is Pamela's Sour Cream Coffee Cake.  I use muffin tins and don't use the glaze.  This cinnamon and raisin filling is good but I also leave this filling out sometimes and add chocolate chips or blueberries for variety.  I also found a pie crust recipe on the internet that uses almond flour and brown rice flour.  I use Pamela's for the brown rice flour and it was great for our pecan pie at Thanksgiving.  At Christmas, I will put foil over the crust as it browned too much before the pie was done.

review/summary: $4.33 per loaf
review/text: Just experimenting with gluten free to see if I notice any difference in a a couple of issues I'm dealing with.  Just bought this. Tastes pretty good, and my wife likes it too after expressing initial skepticism. This stuff comes in at $3.33 per pound. It takes 3 1/2 cups per loaf which weighs 1.30 lbs, which comes out to $4.33 per loaf + eggs + 1 hour cooking time.  So, you know that's really not so bad, but I guess one doesn't want to be throwing it to the birds.

review/summary: Please pressure Amazon for your amazing product
review/text: I have been baking with this product for two years. It is far and away the BEST product out there -- offering a wonderful texture and flavor. I have made cakes, pies, cookies, scones, pizza, cornbread, cobblers, and of course, pancakes and waffles. I particularly like this mix becuase it does not have sugar in it, and I have to use xylotol (which I have found to be the best sugar alternative). The two work beautifully together.<br /><br />Here's my issue. I have a standing order with Amazon to ship this product in bulk once every six months. I have found that I need it every four months. Amazon does not offer that option. It gives me the options of 1,2,3, or 6 months. Several times I have had to go through a tedious process of changing the timing on the ship date (which is not easy to find in the My Account section of Amazon. In fact, I have had to call you folks for their cutomer service number to help me navigate through it.<br /><br />Please ask them to expand the timing options for shipping -- to add 3, and 4 month intervals as well. Your customers other than me will appreciate it, I'm sure.<br /><br />Hats off to you folks. I sure appreciate you. Years ago, I had to mess with making my own baking mix, and it was never as good as yours.<br /><br />A loyal customer.<br /><br />Christine Boos

review/summary: Versatille
review/text: This mix is very versatille.  You can use it to make pancakes and waffles but also cookies, muffins, biscuits, cake, etc.  I have also used it to coat chicken with.  I have been very impressed with the outcome.  The taste is great! The strange after-taste that often comes with gluten-free stuff isn't really present.  I eat it with my gluten-free child.  The texture is the same.  It does have brown flecks in the mix which I thought would throw my kid off, but didn't.  They weren't as noticeable in the pancakes after cooking.  Well worth trying.<br /><br />WARNING: This product does contain a small amount of buttermilk, so it is not dairy-free like many of the other Pamela's Products.  This mix also contains almonds.

review/text: When I was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease the thought of never being able to eat pancakes again was reason enough to make me cry, so when I found this I was skeptical but curious.  EUREKA!  I think I enjoy these pancakes more than the wheat variety (or could it be CD delusion?).  They are soft and fluffy, perfect.  Next we'll start experimenting with the other recipes listed on the bag.  Now that I know I can get it online, it's even better.  Thank you Pamela for giving us CD's another chance at normalcy.

review/text: There's a lot you can do with this mix.  I usually make pancakes or waffles.  The texture is excellent; it's virtually impossible to tell they were made with a gluten-free mix.  A gluten-free diet requires many changes and compromises, but in the pancake and waffle department I don't feel as though this is a compromise at all!<br /><br />The texture is even better when using more eggs than the recipe recommends and reducing other liquids to compensate.<br /><br />No matter what results you've had with gluten-free mixes before, it's worth trying Pamela's.

review/text: Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix is a great gluten-free mix!  I've tried several other mixes from our local health food/organic stores - Whole Foods and Trader Joe's - and Pamela's is by far the best.  I've made several of the recipes listed on the bag of mix and so far the absolute best recipe is the pancakes! I throw some blueberries into the pancake batter, which helps to make the pancakes tasty, light and airy - they don't give you that "stuffed" feeling after eating them.  My husband and I believe these pancakes are better than the flour versions.  Pamela's Wheat Free Bread mix is good, too - makes a nice loaf of sandwich bread.  Thanks Pamela's!!

review/text: When I first bought this mix for my husband who has celiac disease, I only made pancakes.  Then I bought a Cuisinart waffle maker and tried the waffle recipe on the bag - spectacular!  We went camping with our adult children and grandkids who have no dietary restrictions, and I could not make the waffles fast enough.  There is also a carrot cake recipe on the bag that I use to make carrot muffins, and then freeze them.  My husband can have a carrot muffin with his coffee anytime he wants a snack.  It is wonderful to have such a good versatile product on the shelf for anyone - whether they suffer from celiac disease or not.  Buying from Amazon make the work of difference to know that you can always get that specialized product delivered to your door with free shipping.  Thanks Pamela and Thanks Amazon!!!

review/summary: Use seltzer water to mix!
review/text: I have been using this mix for 8 years for no other reason than it is superb! When you make pancakes or waffles, try gently folding in seltzer/soda/mineral water in place of plain water. It makes them fluffier. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to the mix and top the pancakes with raw blue agave nectar instead of high-glycemic syrups. For the oil (which is necessary if you don't want them to turn out like rubber and stick to the pan) try melted organic extra virgin coconut oil, melted ghee or a nut oil of your liking, like peanut, almond or macadamia nut oils. For an excellent oil with no flavor, try Republic of Tea's Stir-Fry Oil made from green tea seeds. It's excellent.<br /><br />Another plus to Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix is that there isn't any trans-fat.

review/text: I still eat gluten, though everyone in the family has some degree of gluten sensitivity.  I am working on moving us to gluten free.  The waffles and pancakes made by this mix are just as good, if not better, than most mixes made with wheat.  This past weekend I made the chocolate chip cookies that are on the back of the package.  I wasn't too hopeful.  I was wrong,  They were great.  The texture was light and not heavy like Chocolate chip cookies can sometimes be.  I would easily serve this to people who still eat wheat and not feel like I have to make excuses.  And like I said, i still eat wheat, so I know how good wheat can be.

Well, I passed on my secret.<br />Thanks Pamela for a great product.

review/summary: Makes gluten free easy
review/text: I first tried mixing and weighing a dozen different flours--life was just too complicated! Pamela's has some good basic recipes on the back--biscuits, pancakes, coffeecake  but many more recipes on the website--the cookies are great.  I can use the mix wherever flour is needed, even thickening--so easy, only one bag on the boat or  at the cabin.  I only wish they would publish a cookbook so I didn't have to keep checking the web. :)

review/summary: Best mixes out there!
review/text: Baking gluten free is not easy, especially when trying to make your own flour blends. This mix is awesome because everything is mixed and ready to go. It really can be an all-purpose baking blend. The mix comes with a bunch of recipes on the back. The pancakes are awesome, but make sure to let the batter sit for a bit before using, it seems to make them come out extra fluffy. I almost cried when I ate these, tears of joy of course. My family says they taste no different and even taste better than regular pancake mix. Pamelas Bread Mix is wonderful too. Be mindful of the climate you live in when using Pamelas mixes when using yeast. I live in warm, humid Florida at a very low elevation, so when pamelas recipe says to let the bread batter sit for an hour to rise, I usually cut that time in half so I don't over proof the batter. Now I heard if you live at high elevations it's better to double that rise time. If your new to gluten free baking remember that when you bake bread it is normal for the consistency to be more like cake batter than like the stiff dough you would get when using white flour. Also, it is wise to make these recipes in the oven, you will have more control over the outcome than if you used a bread machine. Pamelas bread mix makes great artisan style breads, they won't be as fluffy as the Wonder bread you once enjoyed, but they sure do taste amazing.

I only use this for my pancakes but I don't like adding oil to my cakes so I didn't add that, despite the recipe saying to add some. IF anything I'll melt some butter, but def. no rancid oils for me! I followed the recipe for the banana bread on the back and nobody could tell it was G-FREE! I love love love it.

review/summary: the best gluten-free baking mix I have found
review/text: My daughter has celiac (a complete inability to eat any wheat, rye, barley, and in her case oatmeal, or any of their starches or glutens). Pamela's baking and pancake mix is a real heaven-sent product. It tastes good! Unlike some other baking mixes I have tried. It is easy to alter "normal" recipes using Pamela's mix to have great tasting baked products. The bag has good recipes and Pamela's products website has additional ones. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those who don't want to take the time to mix their own grains or want to keep it on hand for when celiac family or friends come to visit and you would like to provide a delicious, easy to make treat.<br /><br />I should also add - Pamela's also offers bread, cake (chocolate and vanilla), brownie, and cookie mixes that are very good. I usually just alter the baking mix to make these baked goods, but I keep a chocolate cake mix on hand for a fast, easy cake. We used the chocolate cake mix for my daughter's wedding cake. No on knew it was gluten-free.

review/text: Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is wonderful.  Haveing been gluten free for 27 years and not being able to find products that were good tasting I gave up and went without until my daughter discovered this mix last year.  It makes the best pizza crust - so good my husband does not eat boughten pizza and prefers mine made from the Pamela's mix.  Check out their site for other great recipies.  I have tried the sugar cookies, peanutbutter cookies, chocolate chip cookies, banana nutbread, pizza and biscuits.  Now I am going to give their bread mix a try.  Hope that is as tasty! The price of the mix through Amazon.com is great too!

review/text: you'll never go back to wheat flour for pancakes and cookies after using this!  I saw another review saying the pancakes were tasteless...I don't understand, as my entire family, gluten-eaters as well, now prefer this to regular home-made pancakes.  The recipe calls for water, but I use rice milk or almond milk, or whatever milk I have available - sometimes half water and half milk, and they are superb!<br />The chocolate chip cookies recipe....oh my goodness.  These are so yummy! We made these to take a party and everyone was raving about them before they even knew they were gluten free!  They turned out perfectly - soft and chewy with a great texture.  YUM!

review/summary: Oh Good, Another Shipment Arrived Today
review/text: This is my third order from Amazon for this product. When I decided to go wheat free a few months ago I knew I had to come up with an acceptable pancake mix because I LOVE pancakes. Since I'd used Bisquick for many years my first experiment was naturally to go with their gluten-free product. It was okay but nothing to brag about. I still have a partial box left over that I use sometimes as a coating for fish or chicken.<br /><br />So I got to looking some more and kept coming across reviews for Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix. There were a lot of positive reviews so I gave it a shot and have been very satisfied. Blueberry pancakes almost every morning. No kidding! I use milk instead of water (water and pancakes just don't seem right together to me) and add lots of blueberries and a couple tablespoons of chia seed. For the oil I use coconut oil. My wife made some chocolate chip cookies with it and they were pretty excellent too. Now that the weather is getting cooler, we'll be experimenting more.<br /><br />I've recommended this mix to several family members and others and they are on board with it. Most of them are not on gluten-free diets but agree that it's a healthy alternative to wheat-based products. My wife and I and our two adult children are also not gluten intolerant.<br /><br />The only negative I have about this product is the packaging. The three bags may be shipped in frustration-free packaging but the packages themselves are not frustration-free. I usually give up trying to pinch the seals together and just fold the top over. But still, this is five-star in my book. I did find this mix at a local grocery store but by ordering it though Amazon I saved about ten dollars for three bags.

review/summary: Pamela's Ultimate  Baking and Pacake Mix
review/text: This is one of our favorite gf products! We love making waffles,pancakes and cookies with this! No one can tell it is gluten free.<br />It uses almond flour and I think that is what keeps everything so moist. Alot of gluten free products are dry and do not hold together well. Not Pamela's! It has made my life simpler and is one of the besst products out there. I would not recommend it for bread unless it was a quick bread as it just doesn't have the texture and taste of bread. It is a little sweet. Pamela's is wonderful to meet 95% of your baking needs!
