review/summary: Like it better than regular SPAM
review/text: Sure, this stuff is still about as valuable to your good health as eating lard sandwiches, but the flavor is good and "Spammy", and very noticeably less salty/fatty as regular SPAM.  Fries up nice with eggs, or great as a sandwich.  Still has a nice "hamish" taste, but the added chicken lightens things up for folks who prefer this, all the while with a less than Dead Sea kick of NaCl.  It's O-TAY by me.

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

review/summary: The worst canned salmon I've EVER had
review/text: I loved canned salmon.  I eat it almost every day.  I've tried the high priced Vital Choice, supermarket brands, and decided to give this "gourmet-ish" brand a try.  I tried 4 cans of it.  Each one was almost inedible.  The amount of salt in this salmon makes it hard to palate.  I actually didn't eat the last 2 cans I opened.  They went right in the trash after a taste.  The salmon is fishy, and the extreme salt taste made me want to throw up.  Avoid this salmon.<br />Vital Choice is outstanding 30% of the time, and the rest of the time it's not much different than my supermarket brand.<br />There are obviously variations between cans with each brand.  The best priced option is here on Amazon.  Amazon sells Rubinsteins red sockeye salmon and it is the same manufacturer as my supermarket brand, but sold cheaper here on Amazon.  I will continue to purchase the following product here on Amazon but I will NEVER buy anything from SeaBear again.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046H1OJ4">Rubinsteins Salmon Red Sockeye, 3.7500-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a>

review/summary: Western United States... BEWARE!!!!
review/text: I have fed this food to several of my dogs for years now with no problems.  About a month ago, all the dogs on this food developed chronic smelly diarrhea.  I couldn't believe it was the food since I'd fed it for years.  After $500 in vet fees I pulled the food as a last resort.  Sure enough, all dogs recovered in two days (after two weeks of problems).  I tried feeding it again to my "Mr RockGut" dog (the one who can eat anything).  The next morning he was back to runny stinky stools.<br /><br />I went to Solid Gold's website to check for any recalls and found that as of January 2010, all dry food production for the western states had been moved from their CA plant to their MO plant.  This was our first bag of food from the MO plant.  You can verify that by visiting Solid Gold's website and clicking the "News" link at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />If your pup is on this (or any other Solid Gold dry dog food) and suddenly develops stinky smelly feces, SUSPECT THE FOOD FIRST!!!  Don't waste $500 in vet fees like I did.<br /><br />Oh... by the way... an email requesting more information on our particular bag of Barking at the Moon went unanswered from Solid Gold.<br /><br />If they had warned us in advance of the changes, it would have saved us a bunch of money.<br /><br />We're off ALL Solid Gold products.

review/summary: Terrific for your dog!
review/text: After the cat food scare, our family decided to take a very close look at what we were feeding our three cats and two German Shepherd Dogs, and for a while we made all the food for all the pets. Finally we found Solid Gold Barking at the Moon dry dog food, and we now mix the appropriate amount with rice and vegetables so the dogs get enough bulk to be full, but not more calories than they need. The dogs have become so much healthier after four months of this new feeding plan!<br /><br />Here's the recipe: 16 cups water or flavored stock, boiling. Add 8 cups  brown rice, stir, turn heat to low, cover and cook 45 minutes. When rice is done and still hot, stir in five bags frozen vegetables and two cans tomatoes broken up. I use diced butternut squash, cut green beans, cut spinach, cut okra, zucchini, or whatever vegetables your dog likes except corn or lima beans. Mix two cups rice mixture with 1 & 1/2 to 2 cups Barking at the Moon kibble twice a day for a dog weighing approximately 100 pounds. This amount of rice lasts about six days for our two large dogs, and we can't believe how much healthier they are! Our older dog has regained the power to jump into the car--and up on our bed--which may or may not be a good thing!

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I didn't actually notice that this was the non-organic version until it arrived, though that doesn't bother me.  One other difference is the amount of tea per bag.  My last batch of organic from POP had  2 grams per individual bag, and this one has 1.8 grams per bag.  This won't affect anyone much.  I used to get 6 large cups out of the old 2g bags.  White tea just brews a little more than an equal amount of more processed teas.  I mostly drink 3 to 4 cups a tea these days, and the 1.8 gram bags manage that just fine.  I also sense no difference in taste between the organic and non-organic versions.  In the future, I'll buy whichever I can find cheaper.<br /><br />This is, in addition to being a bargain, a cheap quality of tea.  You get what you pay for and cheap is exactly what I'm looking for, personally.  It doesn't have as delicate a taste as some more expensive batches, and it can be a bit harsh, but I drink mine straight up without sugar or any other flavoring.  It still provides that clear headed feeling that is the trademark of a good caffeine and l-theanine balance, and it's still a great source of antioxidants.  Healthy dietary choices are normally a lot more expensive than this.

I am a former coffee drinker (bad caffeine withdrawals) so i don't mind the "dry" taste of this tea.  I like it, actually.  (I used to drink black coffee, strong!)

review/summary: Incrediblely Great food with great results.
review/text: I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.<br />  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

review/summary: Love this dog food...
review/text: My dog is prone to allergies requiring treatment with steroids and antihistamines at least twice a year.  Since beginning this food his allergies have all but gone away.  I switched him directly to this food without gradually introducing it with no problems.  The food produces well formed compact stools which is a plus if he has an accident in the house.  Not that much more expensive than other "high quality" dog foods that contain grains and meal.

review/text: The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food. I thought it would be smart to order through Amazon, since it is difficult to find in stores, but that was a mistake. It has been 14 days since I ordered, and the product has not yet arrive. Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver. The seller must have asked for special slow delivery... Never again will I buy from this seller.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning.

I love it sprinkled on apples, pears, yogurt, whatever - it adds a sensational sweetness, yet it's really only the flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, vanilla, clove, coriander subtly blended with orange peel, star anise, etc. - and the little crunchy fennelly pollen of course - positively celestial combination.

The rice tastes good too although I have to say I prefer the taste of real Basmati Rice.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: I have a dog who barks a lot and we have been training him not to bark as much by using the "Quiet" command and giving him a treat every time he is quiet (first we conditioned him before he barked by saying "quiet and giving him a treat every time we said that word - now when we say that word he immediately stops whatever he is doing and looks for a treat).<br /><br />Treats we have used in the past were good but because they were dry, they weren't as stinky and didn't get his attention during one of his barking rants. These treats are soo stinky and my dog loves them!<br /><br />I love them because they are easy to break up into 10+ pieces for training since they are soft. Also, compared to most other snacks they are healthy with duck meat being the first ingredient. Although I wouldn't consider these treats to be the healthiest you can get, they are certainly not the unhealthiest. We use the duck flavor because my dog has diarrhea when he has chicken, beef, or salmon and these work well for him.

review/summary: Delicious Bread; not perfectly suited for breadmaker
review/text: My bread maker has been sitting idle since I went gluten free 8 months ago.  I saw this box mix at the store and decided it was worth a shot.  It's easy: 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of an oil or butter, and some water.  Basically like a cake mix.  I put it all in my bread maker and let it go but unfortunately it looked like a cake mix: more of a batter than a dough.  The machine couldn't get a grip on it.  So I ended up adding about 3/4 of a cup of Gluten Free All Purpose Flour to it to get it thicker and it came out delicious.  Next time I'll let it go un-altered to give it a fair shot, but it's delicious with the minor modification so if it doesn't work in the bread machine without the extra flour it's still an excellent product with a little extra help!  My bread-loving but gluten-free self was THRILLED to have a thick slab of homemade bread slathered in butter!

review/summary: Stinky, Size Matters = Could be Just a 10 Minute Treat
review/text: OK, I read the other reviews and understood that it would smell, and I agree - they are stinky and messy - I highly suggest that this be an outside the home treat.  Originally I wrote this review after giving the male pup , a 65 lbs. 6 mos. old Dogo Argentino, one, which he devoured in 10 minutes flat.  However, I had to come back to edit this review as today I gave both he and his sister one.  This 55 pounder took 30 minutes to finally finish hers, which is fantastic.  I guess that for voracious eaters this isn't much more than a 10 minute treat, but for others it's a good deal.  I'm split down the middle because of this, which is why it's a 3 star rating.<br /><br />PS. I envision Jumbo Extra Thick being much thicker as I feel that regular size must be pencil skinny.

review/text: I love this Agave.  I use it in my green tea.  I ran out one day and used regular sugar.  It was not the same.  This sweetener has a slight caramel flavor that I've grown to love.  My husband uses it in his coffee.  The caramel flavor enhances the flavor of our tea/coffee.  The item was shipped promptly.  I will definitely order again.

review/text: This SeaBear Salmon soup is not only a staple in our home, we serve it to company often.  It comes in a sealed foil packet that requires NO refrigeration.<br />It is the best tasting seafood soup on the market.  You need to mix it with milk or half and half--we keep special milk products on hand in case of emergency to have for this soup.  We have it sent for regular delivery via Amazon to our home so we NEVER run out of this marvelous product.  Many friends are doing the same thing with this SeaBear Salmon Chowder

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I found this to be a great, quick meal. I grew up in a fishing town in Alaska and am always looking for good salmon. I love salmon and enjoy it in just about any form! The previous reviewer could have donated it to me! :) As I'm told, not everyone shares the love for salmon that I do because of its strong flavor. I say, more for me.<br /><br />Actually, my expectations for this salmon chowder were low because I'm kind of a salmon snob and didnt expect a pouch to deliver much. I was pleasantly surprised that it was full of flavor and creamy.<br /><br />If you are use to any ol' farmed Atlantic salmon, you may not share the same appreciation for pure wild Alaska salmon. Since this chowder is made with smoked salmon, the flavor is understandably more intense. If you're like me and hankerin' for a taste of home, you could do a lot worse. The pouches make it a convenient pantry staple when salmon care packages from home arent possible.

review/summary: Almost Inedible Mystery Fish Soup
review/text: This "chowder" is simply dreadful and although I made an effort to eat it, eventually gave up and threw the first batch out. I am planning on donating the rest to a food bank, and feel mildly guilty subjecting anyone else to this slop. I am shocked that this is presented as something edible -- and it is expensive enough that the expectation of a good tasting soup with a noticeable amount of smoked salmon isn't unreasonable. There is precious little salmon -- it is mostly mystery fish chunks and a few potatoes. I used regular milk, not cream, in the amount stated on the packet and it was very watery with little substance. It was decidedly fishy in an extremely unpleasant way, and my husband and I both felt nauseous after consuming the small amount we ate before tossing it.  Save your money.

review/summary: Absolutely AWFUL!
review/text: Where do I start?  This soup is HORRIFIC!  I bought 4 pouches to send to my father for Christmas, but decided I had better sample 1 pouch prior to shipping to him (since I had never tried this product before).  I love all of the ingredients it says is in this soup, so had high expectations of the flavor, consistency, etc.  However, to say I was disappointed is an under-statement!!!  The soup contained maybe 10 pieces of yucky-tasting potatoes (I hope that's what they were..hard to tell), and only a few shards of salmon, if that.  The entire mixture had a "fishy" taste to it..not fresh, and not much like "salmon".  It was watery, flavorless (except for the harsh "fishy" taste, already mentioned) and very difficult to eat.  I had to throw out the entire pot.

review/summary: Yummy, ready to eat and share
review/text: The first package of Kasilof smoked salmon I bought was several years ago and it was not good at all, the fish fell apart in chunks when the sealed foil bag was opened. I contacted the company and during our discussion, realized the foil package had been unsealed in it's cellophane wrapped cardboard box. They could have sent me back to the store, but instead replaced the product and shipped it in two days. This package contained delicious smoked salmon in a nice solid filet which was savored with great gusto. Because we had spent a week on the Kenai peninsula a few years back fishing for salmon in a fishing hole in Homer, this fish reminded us of those days. Since this first filet, we have enjoyed the salmon on many occasions, also sharing it as gifts. I personally do not care if it arrives in a box or the sturdy cardboard which I purchased this week. The fish inside is the same -- flavorful, moist, not bad nutritionally, and perfect for more than one meal if you can find the 24 ounce filet which is our favorite. Wild salmon, salt and brown sugar are the only ingredients in this product and I'm all in favor of wild fish with no colorings or preservatives added. It's great plain and simple, in hot pasta, as a fish spread or a cold salad. Must buy more when it's on sale!

review/summary: Delicious & smokey
review/text: I went to a brunch earlier this summer and someone served smoked salmon on bagels with cream cheese.  That brunch started me on my quest for a nice smoked salmon.  I found Kasilof's Smoked Salmon on Amazon and gave it a try.  Friends came for drinks and I served the salmon with crackers and cheese.  I went back 3 times to fill the salmon on the plate until it was gone.  It's one of those things that once you start, you can't stop eating it.<br /><br />Quality - The Salmon holds it shape nicely in the packaging and there is minimal water in the package.  When you open it, just stand near the sink and drain the small amount of liquid down the drain.<br /><br />Price - Smoked Salmon is going to be a pricier purchase by nature.  The quality and taste of this salmon was well worth it.  I have come back and purchased it at least 3 more times and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Great holiday gift
review/text: This product was not quite what I was expecting. It is just my own ignorance, but I assumed that smoked salmon would be lox or close to it. This salmon is more like gravlax (cured salmon with salt and sugar) but fully cooked.<br /><br />It is excellent with no qualifications. It strikes an amazing balance between having strong flavors but still tasting light and delicate. There is a little sweetness beyond the normal salmon flavor, but with added depth from the smoking. Again, very well balanced with no specific flavor knocking you over the head. The fish is of consistent quality through out the piece.<br /><br />I didn't read the included recipes but did try a few of my own. It can easily overwhelm other flavors so use a modest amount if you don't want that. It is nice as a lox alternative on a bagel with cream cheese - again use sparingly. Great in egg scramble or omelet. Experiment a little before making anything big.<br /><br />Due to the price and packaging I think this would make an ideal holiday gift.<br /><br />The box it comes in is attractive and I am sure we will find a new use for it.

review/text: I should have paid more attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews.  I can only assume the 5 star reviewers are fools who have never had proper smoked salmon or lox.  This stuff comes with a couple of ounces of liquid, tastes like and has the consistently of canned salmon with smokey flavor which is available at any large grocery store for $4.<br /><br />It is dry, stiff/flaky, not meaty-soft-smooth.  I believe the salmon costs $4, the box costs $8, and the rest is profit.  Amazon should get this garbage off their site or relabel this product as smoky-canned-salmon in a vacuum packed bag shipped in a fancy box.<br /><br />Private selection salmon at kroger costs just as much per ounce and is proper smoked salmon or lox.  This stuff is dog or cat food and fit for the garbage bin.  Save your money or flush it down the toilet.

review/summary: Nice option to have
review/text: Like others have stated, this isn't the hottest sauce you'd use.  But I think it's a good option to have in your hot sauce collection.  It's a very runny sauce that can come out quickly.  But it doesn't have a flavor like other sauces I have.  I've used it on many dishes and occasionally prefer this sauce to other options like Dave's Insanity.  Surprisingly it can pack a nice little punch so don't let the color fool you.

review/summary: Tastes like standard pasta, the kids can't tell the difference
review/text: This pasta tastes good. If you are going to eat pasta, why not get the most out of anything you eat and not just empty carbs? This is a good product.

review/summary: Avoid ReStockIt -- Sloppy Vendor
review/text: I ordered a 32 pack of Gatorade mix. The item description was clear: it indicated in two places the order would be for 32 packs, each 21 oz., and that the total package weight was 46.3 lbs. However, I received a single pack, about 2 lbs.<br /><br />When I emailed about the status of the other 31 items, I was told the item description was incorrect and was given a refund. That was an appropriate response for the seller, but I would have preferred the remaining 31 items I had purchased.<br /><br />I'll note that another buyer had a similar problem just today: they ordered 30 staplers and received only one. There appears to be a systemic problem with this seller, so I would recommend avoiding them.

review/summary: Good strips, great filets
review/text: Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two.
