review/summary: Giant Nylabones
review/text: I have 4 German Shepherds and every night they all lay down chewing their nylabones.  I've bought them for years and all my dogs over the years seem to chew on them to relax.  It keeps 4 big active dogs quiet in the house and I feel they're much safer than many chew toys.  The only disadvantage I've seen was years ago when I had a 10 year old crack 2 teeth.  After having them removed, he wouldn't settle down at night without his Nylabones, so I eventually gave them back to him after his gums heeled.  Once again, he was a happy dog!

review/text: I bought two bones for my small dogs(yorkie and bichon). I believe they enjoyed them at first, but later in the day they had stopped playing with them and at dinner time I noticed they were not eating as much as they normally would. I have to guess that these toys might be to hard for my small dogs. A few days later my brother brought over his beagle and she loved them. The chicken flavor is noticeable when you take them out of the package. I would recommend these bones for medium to large breed dog.

review/text: First of all this thing is a lot smaller than "giant" as the title suggests. Second, it is not durable. Within minutes of giving it to my dog, he chewed pieces off it. I was afraid that he was going to swallow the nylon pieces and took it away immediately. It might be a good little toy for a small dog, but definitely not for a big dog. The title is very deceiving, just like the "large everlasting chicken treat".

review/text: I was surprised by the fast delivery! It was estimated that it would take about a week but it came within three days.<br />I'm pretty satisfied with the product for now but that's because I just received it. The only problem I find is that my dog thinks its a real bone so he's trying to find a place to hide it. He doesn't get that it's a toy and he should be chewing and playing with it.<br />He has tried chewing it a bit and has only made some dents into it. Oh, by the way, my dog is an American Staff. so he has some powerful teeth. I'm hoping this will last for awhile.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />It has been about a month since I received this item and my dog has barely touched it. Whenever I show it to him he just ignores it or takes it and hides it somewhere (like under his bed). I'm not sure why since he loves bones but maybe he thinks it's not a toy and he should not chew on it? Or he might just not like it. I'm still surprised that he has barely touched it because he loves to chew!

They loved chewing on them and the bones seemed to hold up very well--until a piece broke off and lodged in the small intestine of my dachsund.  Since it's plastic, it doesn't show up in x-rays and the blockage wasn't identified until it was too late.  Always supervise your pet when they are chewing anything that can be chewed up!

review/summary: The only toy that won't be immediately destroyed
review/text: I never liked nylabones before I got them for my dogs. They always seemed dirty, hair sticks to the ends after they've been chewed and dogs will make their gums bleed chewing them. But my dogs make quick work of any chewy (they finish even very large edible chewies in less than one minute), so we got the durable nylabones and the dogs love to chew them. They are not indestructable but they last for months even with daily use. The dogs do make their gums bleed chewing them at first but I was surprised to see how clean their teeth are now. A good thing to have for a serious chewer.

review/summary: great for power chewers
review/text: This bone is the tops and best of all not expensive.  I have bought many different toys for my dog and he destroys them all within a few days.  This bone is great because it has actually lasted over two weeks and is still going strong.  The ends are getting chewed up but at a very slow pace.  My guess is this will easily last a month or two, if not longer.  My dog also absolutely loves chewing on this.  If he is inside sitting around this bone is in his mouth being chewed.  That is why I am so surprised it has lasted this long.  Usually if my dog chews something for a whole day it would be in a million pieces.  The only other toy that has been able to last this long is a king size kong, but my dog won't even look at it twice unless it is packed with treats.

review/summary: the best so far
review/text: These are my dog's "inside bones".  They last and last and last without turning into little chunks all over the rug.  The dog is an 85 pound "working dog" - which means high energy and really annoying when bored.  He's had some of these nylabones for over two years.  I only have to replace them when he sneaks one outside and buries it.<br /><br />Yes, letting the dog out has its own ritual.  "Inside bone!" -clunk- as bone drops to the floor, hopefully missing my foot.<br /><br />In comparison, the "outside" bones tend to be the leg bones of ungulates.  Those things are solid, but he eats them anyway.  I think.  He does seem to enjoy burying them, digging them up, burying them elsewhere, and trying to smuggle those filthy things into the house.  "Outside bone!" -clunk-  He also likes to carry and chew up firewood.  Nothing lasts like a nylabone.  Nothing is less messy inside the house than a nylabone.<br /><br />I buy the "giant" size because it gives me a better grip for those tugs-of-war.<br /><br />Very weird that the dog knew there were nylabones in the amazon box and that they were his.

review/summary: Received wrong product, but more importantly: Not safe for dogs!
review/text: My dogs love nylabones, and we've been buying them for years. I recently decided to stock up and ordered 4 nylabones! They arrived quickly, but one of the packages was partially open. They also had a new textured look that I wasn't sure my dogs would like. The picture indicated that the product I would be receiving would be the same untextured nylabones that my dogs love.<br /><br />However, those aren't the only reasons I'll be returning them. We just took one of our dogs to the vet this week, and had to spend almost $1,000 getting two cracked teeth removed! Our vet said that nylabones are too hard for dogs' teeth, and recommended that we use raw bones from the butcher instead. Nylabones are the only chew toys my dogs have used, so there is nothing else that could have cracked my dog's teeth. Please be cautious, and talk to your vet about whether nylabones are a safe choice for your dog.

review/summary: Nylabone success
review/text: My dog loves to chew plastic things...eyes on teddy bears and plastic lids.  Before she was a strong chewer I had given her other Nylabone products and she really liked them so I thought I'd try the durable bone.  It has a flavor to it so she will chew on it for long periods of time.  She also hasn't chewed plastic things because whenever she goes for them I throw her a durable bone and she chews that instead.  I think she likes the flavor.<br /><br />If your dog isn't an avid chewer Nylabone makes flexible and other flavored bones that come apart easier.  My dog is a year old and she just started chewing a lot.  She has enjoyed the puppy bones and flexible bones.  Now she has graduated to durable.<br /><br />Nylabone is a great product and I plan on using it for a long time.

review/summary: Perfect for my aggressive chewer
review/text: I have an American Staffordshire Terrier(aka pitbull) and she is just over one years old and not many toys are tough enough for her. This toy will slowly get chewed away but after having it a month or so there so is little damage to it that it will last a long time. I learned after having my pup that it is definitely worth the money to buy a tougher toy because in the end you save instead of replacing toy or bone after bone. My dog does not chew on this bone constantly but she gets a craving for it and it will keep her busy for a while. She tends to like things she can destruct, I think they are more fun for her but she does enjoy chewing this bone. I ended up going on nylabones website and signed up for emails and received a nice coupon in my email and I went and bought my pup another different one to go with this one. I know she will be all set for a while!

review/summary: AN ALMOST PERFECT PRODUCT.  OUR DOGS LOVE THESE THINGS
review/text: I say "almost perfect," but to be honest, I cannot find a down side to these chew toys.<br /><br />It has always been a problem keeping our dogs in chew toys.  They either completely reject them (which happens quite often) or they immediately destroy them in a destructive frenzy.  They are all rather picky dogs; spoiled dogs, and we more or less cater to them.<br /><br />These Nylabone bones were absolutely made for our crew.  All the dogs love them and they last and last and last.  With four dogs using them, they actually last well over two months.  As the bones are slowly destroyed, we do not have a problem with "toy fragments" all over the house.<br /><br />Now it in the nature of dogs, when there is more than one, to want what the other one has, even if they have an identical one of their own.  We simply dish them out four at a time and let them work their own pecking order out amongst them selves.  Hey, it works for us.  We always keep a couple of extra ones around as one of our dogs is a hider and hoarder and finds the most interesting places to stash these things.  Sometimes they disappear for days at a time...I think that pup has found a black hole somewhere in the house.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good product.  This is a good price here.  My dogs recommend them highly.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/text: We have been giving our powerful-chewing golden retriever the large original flavor Nylabone for over 10 years, and as all reviewers have noted, this is the only good chew toy for powerful chewers.  One bone lasts about 3 weeks, maybe longer as our guy has gotten older.  However, my biggest peeve is that we have increasingly had to hunt far and wide to find the original flavor large version, and now it is virtually impossible to find on the shelf anywhere.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  Please tell the manufacturer not to discontinue this version - it is irreplaceable.  Our dog didn't like any of the flavored versions, and the new "flex" version is not for powerful chewers like him.  This is the only one that works - don't take it away!!!

review/summary: Satisfies a dog's urge to chew (and saves furniture and shoes)
review/text: I have been buying Nylabones for years for our Doberman and Labradors. When a dog needs to chew, they'll find SOMETHING and I'd rather it be a Nylabone than a table leg or pair of shoes. With three dogs, we always have three available (plus three in the car for trips). I even take one when hiking in the hills with my Doberman (our Labs are now too old to hike). I especially like the Dura Chew model because it lasts. When the small end gets chewed to a point (which is a weapon in a dog's mouth), if the Nylabone is still big enough, I hacksaw and file the end and keep using it until it's too small to be safe (i.e. danger of being swallowed). If your dog's not used to chewing, train them with either a) smearing peanut butter on the bone as an inducement, b) play "keep away" and praise when the dog takes it or c) play tug of war, let the dog win with praise. I've done all three, what works depends on your dog.

review/text: I would not recommend this product for anyone who cares about  their pet. Apparently the manufacturer of this product does not take measures to insure their product is safe. I ordered the correct size of bone for my Labrador Retriever according to the manufacturers size chart. Brand new out of the package no more than 10 minutes, while my dog was chewing on the bone, a large piece about the size of a marble broke off and my dog swallowed it. I examined the bone and discovered there were numerous air bubbles in the casting making the bone weak and susceptible to breaking. I can only hope that the consumed part of this product will pass without any complications. I will not buy this product again and will be going to normal beef bones in the future.

review/summary: An All Time Classic Favorite - Great For Agressive Chewers
review/text: Nylabone has been producing some of the finest dog toys on the planet for over 50 years.<br /><br />Made in America, these a great alternative to real bone which can splinter and crack. We have two old English Bulldogs both of which can give the "Jaws of Life" a run for the money. This particular toy is a staple in our house, it's been all time favorite for years and dogs just adore this Dura Chew Bone.<br /><br />Each one lasts a good two months - we discard them when they're about 3/4 chomped. The chewed edges do catch on carpet and upholstery and can be difficult to clean. Amazon most always has the best prices - and Prime membership gets you free two day shipping so it's really a steal.<br /><br />This particular toy has been around for decades - it's time proven, safe and again, made right here in the US.Nylabones not only appease your dogs natural instinct to chew - the material does an exceptional job of keeping their in absolute pristine condition.<br />Nylabone does have a line of toys designed for oral health and they're excellent - that said this bone works equally well - our dogs never tire of them.<br /><br />And that's saying quite a lot as their average attention span with most toys is about 15 minutes. Just a wonderfully made, time proven dog toy. The perfect choice for hard core chewers

review/summary: A mainstay in my house for my buddy Odin
review/text: My dog can chew!  I'm surprised at the work he can do on this thing.  First of all it's HARD, almost impossibly so.  The one issue I have is that it becomes a landmine for your feet in the dark.  My dog likes to leave them around after he's done chewing and sweet lord it hurts when you step on them.  I now shuffle around in the dark to avoid the pain.  He enjoys chewing on them and I make sure to throw them away when they get too short.  Buy 2 or 3 and change them up so the dog does not get bored with one.

review/summary: Great product, dogs love them, BUT...
review/text: Like I said in the title, it's a great, durable product, but be aware that "Wolf" size, as it states on the package (which I didn't see until after I received the item) is for dogs up to 35 pounds.<br /><br />Not a fault of the seller, more on the manufacturer, but I bought this for my 65# pit bull mix, and ended up letting my pugs have it (It's a little big for them, but they still enjoy the heck out of it!).<br /><br />So if you have a *real* wolf-sized dog, you're best going with a larger sized chew toy.

review/summary: Dogs loved it... but made them sick! What's the point???
review/text: When it says don't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it. It also says don't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that... they mean that too. My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off. A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor, because she started having violent vomiting a day latter, then our 8 year old pit started doing the same. We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit (sick what we do for our kids) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit. Haven't had a issue since. My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.<br />Buyer beware and watch your dogs.

review/summary: Healthy for your Dog and They Last
review/text: I've been buying Nylon bones for my dogs for over 3 decades -- they are safe.  If they swallow the pieces of nylon it passes through their system - it only comes off in tiny pieces.  I've had several large breeds of gnawers - and Nylabones are the only thing on the market I've found they cannot destroy;  Good for cleaning their teeth because they have to work hard and grind.

review/summary: This does the trick!
review/text: My Labrador lives inside the house, sleeps on the couch, and is treated like a queen..and then I discovered she had tartar build up on her back teeth!  I freaked!  I have heard how it leads to dental problems that can lead to extremely bad health problems.  I started up again brushing her teeth with an enzymatic toothpaste (she did not like this when she was younger)coupled with this bone and I have to say, this bone did it.  She enjoyed chewing on it, running around the yard with it and the dark brown deposits on her back teeth are almost gone.  I was just trying to prevent it from getting worse, didn't realize they could disappear. This bone is amazing.  How amazing?  She had it outside, over the weekend and now we can't find it (we wondering if something wild walked off with it due to the flavor)so I just ordered another one!  The grooves in it get in there like little toothpicks.  This may be man's best friend!

review/summary: Dogs may prefer over classic nylabone products.
review/text: I don't know if the slight color difference indicates a different taste or texture from the Original Nylabones, or if it's  just the different shape, bumps and ridges, but I think my dogs may prefer the "Dura Chew" over the original. Sometimes I smear peanut butter into the crevices, especially for less enthusiastic chewers.<br />I don't know if Dura Chew offers flavor choices like the Original does, but in the Original, bacon seems to be the most desirable flavor.

review/summary: Hooray for Nylabones!
review/text: Although I've been buying Nylabones for my dogs for many years, I only recently realized that Amazon carried them for a better price than Petco or PetSmart so I now order all our Nylabones strictly from here. Nylabones help curb destructive chewing, ease boredom, and clean teeth.<br /><br />Like ANY toy, Nylabones carry a risk if not used properly. There is no such thing a completely, 100% safe toy.<br />With that said, I've never had a problem with Nylabones, nor do I know anyone who has. It's ALL about being responsible and knowing your dog. (When it all comes down to it, they can be quite child like. They need YOU to use YOUR head.)<br /><br />Make sure you're buying the appropriate size for your dog. (Don't buy one that's too small, simply because it's cheaper.) If you're using a bone that's too small it will greatly increase the chance of your dog biting off pieces that can be harmful.<br />If your dog is an aggressive chewer, then don't leave them alone for extended periods with any toy. Nylabones included.<br /><br />Be safe and smart!! Your dogs depend on you!

review/summary: Classic chew toy at great price
review/text: This is the same type Nylabone you'll find at the store but at a better price. Good for doggie teeth while chewing too. My Rottweiler and German Shepherd Dog usually need a new one every month or two since it does wear down (like any chew toy) but I like that it cleans teeth as it does and I've never seen either dog break off a piece anywhere near big enough to choke on, unlike a lot of rubber toys. Also doesn't create the display that rope toys do when it's time to clean up after your dog outside. One of about 2 or 3 toys I try to keep around at all times for the boys to work on so they leave our shoes and such alone :)

review/summary: Very durable even for hard chewers.
review/text: I have a 90 pound lab mix and he loves to chew.  I've had him since he was five months old and he has chewed furniture, rugs, chairs, shoes, etc. in addition to the toys we've gotten him.  None of the toys we've gotten him, including multiple Kongs, ropes, PetSmart branded tennis balls, and some supposedly indestructible toy made from an old fire hose, lasted for more than 20 minutes.  He would start breaking chunks off of Kongs or any rubber toy in about 10-15 minutes.  The first Nylabone I gave him, he began chewing immediately and enthusiastically and it lasted for hours the first night, hours the second night, and after three days, there's still plenty for my dog to chew on and play with.  This product is much more durable than I had even hoped for and should be a good match for all but the very strongest and aggressive chewers.

review/summary: Not a good replacement for rawhide bones.
review/text: I have a 60 pound black lab that is a big chewer and thought that these might be a good replacement for the rawhide bones she loves so much. She doesn't like these at all. She has barely touched it in the four weeks she has had it. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is made well and maybe some dogs do like them, just not mine. So I'm still looking for something she can enjoy but not devour in 1 or 2 hours. Also tried one of the edible Nylabones, this she liked but it was gone in less than 10 minutes.

review/text: I've had Dobermans for the last 30 years. They love a good chew. Have bought these from day 1 and will do so as long as I own a dog. Even dogs that aren't chewers (like Yorkies) love these things. So important for any dog's dental health.<br /><br />Nylabone also has incredible customer service and back up every thing they sell 100%. The only product I ever had a problem with was their dura chew ball, which split in half in 5 min., and they no longer sell. I emailed Nylabone's customer service.  They send me a brand new GIANT dura chew bone as a replacement.  Thank you Christa ! Wonderful job !!!

review/summary: Tough toy
review/text: We have a female bull terrier mix, about 45 pounds, and she really likes the Nylabone chew toys.  She gets going on them, and just keeps grinding away with her back teeth.  After one month, this toy is hardly different from when new- I expect this to be around for 6 months or more!  It is almost too long for her as she tries to prop it vertically with her front paws to chew on the top.  That also shows you how much she enjoys it, cause it doesn't slow her down!  Good product, will buy more.

review/summary: Great for strong chewers
review/text: The Durachew Souper size is perfect for my pit mix. He enjoys both the original and bacon flavors. He chews them several times every day for about 15-20 minutes at a time. And after about 4 months, they are only beginning to get worn down. They do make shavings that get stuck to carpets and things, and fuzz/hair/etc gets stuck on them like velcro, but these and Kongs are the only things that don't get destroyed immediately. My dog (who likes to rip his toys apart and eat the pieces) hasn't tried to break and eat any pieces off these. He just chews until his jaws get tired. After he's done with his current bones, I might try the Big Chews for Big Dogs size of Nylabone.<br /><br />Nylabones are worth every penny.

review/summary: A very durable bone for dogs. Love these!
review/text: I grew up with four large dogs and my parents gave them nyla bones all the time. They'd sit on the living room floor and chew for hours. I now have two dogs (a GSD and an ACD/red heeler) and this is their go-to toy for when they want to chew. As with any toy,  you should always supervise your dogs, but I've never had a problem with any pieces tearing off or breaking. We typically throw them away when they start getting smaller and ratty, just in case-but that takes a long, long time to get to that point. I've seen one single nyla bone last for more than a year. I love these things.

review/summary: Excellent Chew
review/text: My 18-month old Lab loves this Nylabone. It's the perfect size for him. It has lasted a few months and he normally spends time chewing it each night. He is a strong chewer, but not the strongest I've seen. I recently ordered another since he gnawed his first one to about half the original size. I wouldn't allow him to chew this much past the half way point as it could become a choking hazard. I gave this 4 stars since it is not really a healthy material to ingest. Small pieces are not supposed to hurt the dogs, but there is no nutritional value.<br /><br />A natural alternative to this would be Deer Antlers. They are more expensive, but will last quite a while. Our dog loves those as well, but the Nylabones provide a nice variety so he doesn't get too bored with any one chew.

review/summary: Great Product, Love the Price Compared to Local Pet Stores
review/text: I have two dogs of the same mixed breed, but they are complete opposites. One dog barely chews on anything (even chew toys/bones/rawhide) and the other one is a chewing monster. The one that I dub "chew monster" has been able to chew everything I've thrown at him even since he was a puppy. I've gone through numerous personal items because of his destructive habit and under recommendation by my vet, she mentioned trying some Nylabones.<br /><br />I started out with the puppy Nylabones and then upgraded him to the regular ones, but he went through those too fast (within hours down to spiny nubs). Despite being a 9.6 pound dog, I eventually had to upgrade him to the "Dura Chew" model which is aimed at powerful chewers. Nylabone states that these are the strongest ones they make. With the Dura Chew, I'm able to slow down the speed in which he goes through these to a week or so.<br /><br />Although my dog will still occasionally chew through my personal items I leave on the floor, I can say the Nylabones "Dura Chew" has helped curb his urge to chew on other things and he mostly chews on the Nylabones. They are a lifesaver!<br /><br />Locally (at PetSmart, PetCo, and Pet Supermarket), Nylabones are usually $2.50 each + tax. For some odd reason on Amazon, these are $1.78 each. So by buying on Amazon, I'm saving at least 75 cents each per bone that I know my dog loves.<br /><br />So it's a no brainer that if your dog likes Nylabones and needs the Dura Chew model, you should look compare prices at Amazon first.

review/summary: Great & long lasting!
review/text: This works fantastic for my husky to chew on!  It's a great alternative to raw hide and doesn't show as much wear as quickly as a raw hide does.  He isn't able to break it apart and just gnaws it down slowly over time.  Whenever he is walking around looking for something to chew on we give him this or his nylabone dinosaur (another great chew, but didn't last as long as this one).  I'd say we finally threw this out after about 2-3 months of chewing.  (We decided to throw it out when it was short enough that it looked like he could probably swallow it.)

review/summary: My dogs love these, and Amazon's price was great
review/text: My dogs have chewed on a variety of Nylabone products for years.  We have the durable bones, dinosaurs, and wishbones.  I saw this Giant size Nylabone in a local discount store for $7.99, and Amazon had it for much less so I bought two.  They arrived in just a couple of days, well ahead of the estimated delivery date.  This size is a little large for my 20-something pound dogs, but history tells me it will last a long time.

review/summary: GREAT!!!
review/text: Bought these for my teething 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier and she went to town on them. Last quite a while and pass through my dogs system pretty easily without causing any heavy diarrhea or making her sick. Def recommend this for a teething dog or just a dog who loves to chew (which is pretty much ALL dogs). My silky terrier finds these extremely uninteresting, but she's a picky brat. If your dog will chew on anything with even a slight flavor, these will work out well.

My dog (a smooth collie) is not a real heavy chewer but even at ~50lbs the wolf seems to be the size that fits her mouth well. Haven't got one in the store for a while but it seemed to be a good deal. Gives her something to do when bored besides chew holes in pillows and blankets :)

review/summary: Your dog will either love it or hate it
review/text: I've never had a dog that has been interested in one of these bones. I've had a siberian husky and a mutt in the past and neither one would chomp on one of these nylabones. I have tried the different flavors and textures, but neither one was interested. Years have past and we recently got a new siberian husky since we missed our old one. While he was teething I bought this for him hoping it may work, it didn't. I tried everything to cajole into liking this bone; however, nothing would make him like this thing. My mom told me that her golden retreiver enjoys these, so perhaps it's just a breed thing. It's worth a shot to see if your dog would like this, but be warned that I have had no success.

review/text: I have two large Rottweilers that have destroyed just about every expensive, so-called non destructive dog toy I have purchased for them.  Nothing beats the durability and long-lasting use that we have gotten from the Nylabone dog chews!  I really like the giant sized bones as it has taken my dogs much longer to go through them than other dog chews and the size is perfect for their large teeth and mouths.  Highly recommend the Nylabones to anyone with large, silly, playful dogs who need a bit more than just your regular dog toys!

review/text: My dog is a very aggressive chewer, and she really went to town on this bone! She loves it! Its the only thing I've gotten for her that she actually likes and has lasted more than a week. She still has put a significant dent in it already, after only two weeks, and you do have to watch for them shredding pieces off (small pieces are said to be all right to pass through, but anything larger than a grain of rice should not be swallowed according to the package). I dont know what I would do without this bone, this can keep her busy for a good long while when I'm working or cooking dinner or doing anything where i can't really watch her.

review/summary: Good for above average chewers
review/text: We have gotten two of these for our 7 month old black lab mix.  She goes through about one a month, which is really quite good considering she is one of the most avid and strongest chewers I've ever seen.  As long as your dog enjoys chewing on harder objects such as strong sticks and such, you will get your monies worth from one of these.  I will be purchasing more of these, as well as some of the other shapes that they have to keep things interesting.<br /><br />The only warning I have is if your dog does start to chew the bone down, the edges can be a bit sharp.  Also, this is not a good toy for fetch.

review/summary: Great grain-free dog food
review/text: I've been buying this dog food in all flavors since my vet told me to switch my dogs to a grain-free diet, which was over a year ago now, and all four of my rescue dogs love it. It may look different than other brands of dog food, but I suspect that's because there are no grains to bind it, just meat and other grain-free, all natural ingredients. I mix it with the Taste of the Wild dry food and all four dogs devour it. Unlike the reviewer who commented on the bad smell, I don't think it smells bad as far as dog food goes--the salmon smells salmony. Maybe the other reviewer had a bad can? In any event, my dogs love this food!

review/summary: Another great treat for my (less than discerning) dog
review/text: Okay, my dog is a bit of a chow-hound, she loves just about everything edible (not mushrooms however...).  BUT, there are some treats she goes particularly nuts over...and the the Blue Buffalo Bites (salmon style) are definitely one of them.  She dances, prances and pretty much carries on whenever this particular package starts opening up.  She has not yet tried sneaking onto the dining room table for these as she has done for other treats (mostly because at the moment we are in transit and don't have a dining room table) but I have no doubt she would try--of course at 55# she's not very sneaky.<br /><br />The biggest benefit, from the perspective of the person who sleeps closest to her, is that There Is No Gas generated.  Some treats/foods are very high on the malodorous-gas producing scale and happily the Blue Buffalos are not among them.  At least not the salmon ones!<br /><br />All I can say, is Greyhound Approved and Highly Recommended!<br /><br />JTG

review/text: A striking pale green, bamboo rice is not technically considered sushi rice, but is sometimes used for sushi to lend color to sushi rolls. Bamboo rice should not be cooked like regular sushi rice. To cook bamboo rice, 1.5 cups of water (0.35 L) should be added to each eight ounces (227 g) of bamboo rice. Rice should then be cooked as usual, but allowed to sit for 20 minutes after cooking.

review/text: I am a rice junkie and so glad that the getting heirloom and unique rices are becoming easy to get in the States.  I was given a bag of this rice as a gift and think it is pretty good.  The flavor is not much different than normal white rice (though I think I can tell a difference).  Also the rice does not stay as green as you would think it would.  I tried some other rice at a fancy foods show by another small company called Lotus Food.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S6XR6">Lotus Foods Organic Jade Pearl Rice, 15 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I think the Lotus Food product is perhaps better in taste and color.  If you are willing to buy a 12 pack then the Lotus price is a lot less per pound ($3.15 vs $7.00+).  Overall this product is pretty good and I would encourage anybody to use it to add a little flair to their rice dishes, however I will be buying it from Lotus.

review/text: The soda came within a reasonable time, but it's freshness seems compromised.  It's still good, but tastes a bit different then drinking it in Scotland.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I tried this when we went to Scotland and loved it.  I found some in the states at a Scottish festival and bought it on the spot!  Really different that what you get in America - like a Scottish coca-cola with a slight bubble gum flavor. Really reminds me of a great trip!

review/summary: Not the greatest drink in the world, but it's alright.
review/text: As an American, Irn Bru is not readily available to me.  I heard about it a few years ago and wanted to try some.  A good friend of mine went to Scotland and said that it was really good, so I broke down and had a 12 pack shipped to my home.  I chilled one and took a sip.  To me, it tasted like the little sugary bubble gum sodas you can get in grocery stores for about a quarter.  I am aware that it's very popular across the pond, but I personally didn't find it to be amazing.  On the other hand, many people I knew thought it was delicious and began paying me $5 a bottle for the soda and I made my money back plus another 10 dollars.  So, in a way, that was a positive.

review/summary: Buyer Beware!!!!
review/text: I have been trying for years to get my replacement part.  The part with the glass bowl in it broke... not the glass, the handle and part that makes it seal for roasting.<br /><br />About every 6 months I get tired of purchasing "not fresh" coffee, and begin my search.  They always said: "Probably available in 6 months".  Today I went to the site and it says discontinued on all of the parts.<br /><br />Don't just take my word for it, do a search for iroast 2 parts and click on a few.  discussions all over the place about this problem.  Sorry to the seller, but you don't want to pay that price only to find that they have no way of honoring the promise to repair for 1 year, when the part is not available.<br /><br />rating would be a 4 if not for the above stated problem.  It roasted better than my previous $100 Fresh Roast (now $120 at seven bridges)  Not being able to get it fixed drops it down of course.  I think I will be heading over now and order the cheaper model... lasted me a year with pretty regular roasting.  Much better deal in the long run.

review/summary: 30g of Sugar & 140 Calories per 2 oz!
review/text: I wish Amazon had a policy of also posting the Nutrition Facts label of food products.  This product has 30g of sugar in a 2 oz serving and 140 Calories.  The ingredients List is Quince & Citron Rice Black Vinegar, Fructose, Water, Oligosaccharide, Conc. Apple Juice, Polydextrose, Maltodextrin, Mixed Apple Juice.  If you're fine with that then it does add a certain zing to recipes but I was looking for something simpler.
