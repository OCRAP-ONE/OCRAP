review/text: I had been waiting for a while for a Cappuccino on the Keurig and I happened to find this one at the store. It's like drinking an angel wrapped in a unicorn. In other words, my new favorite Keurig drink! If you're not a coffee snob and you like French Vanilla and Cappuccino, try this product!

review/summary: BETTER THAN "5 HOUR ENERGY" AND GREAT FOR A HANGOVER
review/text: Yessiree- this is the same sweet coffee-esque sugar buzz that you'll find at most convenience stores and gas stations. Is it a chemical abomination? You bet! Does it taste great with a day-old buttered roll in a wax-paper sleeve? Absolutely! Here is the real thing that fogs your windows and leaves a vanilla aroma in its aftermath. It is sickeningly sweet and guaranteed to snap you out of a hangover when followed with a day-old roll or bagel with cream cheese. Nothing short of an American classic and friend of the open road.<br /><br />It's not just about the sugar. They actually put 30mg of caffeine into this concoction of--well, you really don't need to know.<br /><br />It's cheaper than the $1.75 at the gas station (around $.45 a paper cup).<br /><br />It's not actually coffee-- but it hits the spot when you're down and out and need something more for breakfast than a Baby Ruth Bar.<br /><br />Go ahead- you know that you want this, uh...whatever it is. Mmmmm! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!

review/summary: Really deserves each star!
review/text: My favorite thing about this K-cup Cappuccino is that it does NOT taste artificial!!!!  I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?

review/text: I finally found a coffee that I can say I love!  I may never go to Starbuck's again!  This coffe is just strong enough, not too bitter.  Also has a smooth and sweet taste from the french vanilla.  And, the best part is each cup is only 80 calories!  I will definitely order this brand again.  I'm usually a hot chocolate or mocha coffee drinker, but this will be my coffee of choice and I will always have on hand to brew a fresh cup.

review/summary: My new favorite for a cocoa-type drink
review/text: While Mocha Nut Fudge coffee is still my favorite, and hazelnut the coffee I most often drink,  This is the best tasting cocoa-type think I have yet had.  I find myself drinking the hazelnut, then making this in the same cup with some of the hazelnut still in there, as well as just drinking it by itself.<br />After trying several cocoas and cappuccinos, I was skipping the kcups and just using the machine to make hot water and using the far cheaper instant cocoa packets.  But after a freind had me try the caramel cappuccino, I ordered boxes of my own, and I am still happy with the taste after a month of it.

Of course their light, they are filled with instant coffee!<br />For the amount of "instant" coffee that I got for $10 I could have bought 2 jars at the same price and got 100 times the same type of coffee.<br />I expect REAL coffee when I pay around 50c a cup.

review/text: I had a cup of this at a friend's home, and he asked me if I liked it. I told him frankly that it wasn't great; it tasted too much like instant coffee. He said that it WAS instant! Conclusion: It is anathema to use a K-Cup brewer to make INSTANT anything. And at 50 cents (minimum) per cup, it's got to be the height of misplaced convenience. There are wonderful flavored coffee K-Cup varieties out there -- try them.

review/summary: Grove Square Cappuchino
review/text: I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company, Sturm Foods, Inc.,  I learned they do not refund customers based on "personal taste". I would suggest staying with a brand you know and love and avoid this "bargain" item.

review/text: Whoever designed and/or created this product has never had a real cappuccino. Even the ones from McDonald's rank as gourmet compared to this vile substance. Unless you are a fan of flavored laxatives,which is what this reminded me of, save your cash and just either buy an over priced cappuccino from a trendy cookie-cutter coffee vendor, McDonald's or a gas station because any of them have better tasting product than this. I literally took a sip and spewed it out in the sink. It was foul. Seriously, don't buy it.

Disappointed and upset are only two words that I can use to describe the experience. It was extremely sweet and already lightened (very light) and what I consider an instant coffee !! No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled "instant" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me. I told him that I probably would not buy another of their products, especially after reading other reviews......and I would forwarn people about the product!

I usually won't bother trying to get my money back on this kind of thing but I have made an exception due to the horrid product.

review/text: These are pretty good for what I wanted they taste like the stuff you get at WaWa but that was what I was aiming for. If I want a premium cappacino I have and espresso machine. It tastes the best using the 8oz. size in my opinion.

review/summary: Good cup of "fake" cappuccino, just know what you're buying
review/text: Yes, this has instant coffee in it and is ready to drink. If you have ever gotten one of those instant cappuccino drinks from a gas station you pretty much know what this is going to taste like. (you know, the one you have to hold the button and make sure you release in enough time so your drink doesn't overflow!) I enjoy it for what it is, because sometimes I just have a craving for those cheap cappuccino drinks. A few things to note:<br /><br />- Make sure you don't brew more than 8 ounces with one cup, it will be diluted. The stuff is powder mix, it doesn't brew like regular coffee grounds<br />- Please pay attention to ingredients if you are health-conscious (See below for nutrition info & ingredients)<br />- It can leave residue in your keurig/brewer so try to run a round of hot water right after brewing<br />- The box indicates that each serving contains 20-30mg caffeine<br /><br />Nutrition Info for 1 cup:<br />80 calories, 4.5 grams fat (all saturated), 170mg sodium (7%), 9g carbs (5g sugar), 0g protein<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, instant coffee, sodium caseinate, salt, cocoa, natural & artificial flavors, dipotassium phosphate, cornstarch, mono- & diglycerides, solicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color, sucralose

review/summary: Instant coffee in a k-cup
review/text: I never review products, good or bad, but this "coffee" is so bad I had to.<br /><br />This is not the typical k-cup coffee. This is an instant coffee similar to Nescafe or SB Via but tastes horrible.<br />The sugar/splenda mix makes this way too sweet. Mixing it half and half with black coffee makes it drinkable.<br /><br />This is basically just adding hot water to instant coffee. There isn't a filter or coffee grounds in the cup.

review/text: I absolutely love this cappuccino! I had my doubts, but they were proved wrong! I myself have a sweet tooth and I was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino. But thankfully, I was worng and it had the right blend of both. I had 2 cups the first day I bought it! Shared it with my family, they loved it too!

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted!
review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker, so for me the best cappuccino is one that doesn't have a strong coffee taste. . .I actually prefer the gas station variety over the 'real deal'.  If that's what you like, then this is the perfect fit!  I love it, my husband loves it as well, and he was quite skeptical!  We purchased an actual cappuccino maker several years ago and hated the strong coffee taste, so the machine went back to the store.  He refused to believe me, that this mix was what we were looking for, until I made him a cup!  He's surprised and happy to have a cheaper way to make a favorite drink at home w/out having to stop on the way to work!

review/text: Oh my goodness, this was bought for us as a housewarming present for our new Kuerig machine.. I ended up having to stab open the K-cups and put half a teaspoon into the bottom of a regular coffee for it to seem anything like a cappucino and for it to be even remotely drinkable.. I feel like energy drinks would give me less of a sugar high than one of these!!

review/summary: VERY Good!
review/text: The Grove Square Capuccino Cups are just great.  A real treat!  Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.  But this is all ready the minute it stops brewing!  To me - the entire concept of the Keurig is to have your favorite beverage ready instantly.  If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.  My only regret - I wish Grove Square would also make a Mocha K-cup.  That is another of our favorite coffee drinks.

We always like trying new brands to find what we like.<br />I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas, so I thought I'd try this gift set.<br />First of all, the crackers came to us almost a year expired and open. The meat and cheese don't have expiration dates, but the meat was a weird grey color and tasted gross, and the cheese tasted like the kind that comes out of a Cheese-Whiz can.<br />The only thing that was good was the mustard, but it wasn't amazing, or anything.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.

review/summary: The worst shopping experience I have ever had!
review/text: I bought these along with some Kit Kats for a relative living in the USA as a gift and tea bags and Kit Kats may seem like an odd gift but they were actually quite symbolic and would have meant a lot. I say would have..... I emailed the company explaining that they were a gift and requested that if possible that an invoice not be added to the package. Well weeks passed and my gift still hadn't been delivered, I emailed the company and didn't get any response. More weeks passed and by this time the "gift" was well and truly ruined. Cheers you guys!!<br /><br />Eventually the pack of tea was delivered, the box squashed but no kit kats - so not only was the gift delayed with delivery - I mean I could have bought these myself in the UK and posted them over in a few days if I'd have known, but the invoice was in the box and a note stating that a refund had been made for the cost of the Kit Kats. No email from the company to let me know of course. Out of the four emails I actually sent them, i didn't get one response. Nor had the money been credited back to my account and the invoice stated that it was refunding an amount that didn't correspond with the cost of my purchase.<br /><br />I have to say that I have never, ever been treated as badly by a company. The disappointment was even worse when I was told that actually the items i had ordered are readily available in shops in the area where my relative lives - so I sort of felt really annoyed by this stage.<br /><br />I had to contact Amazon who as always were brilliant and they refunded me my money and offered me a �5 voucher off of my next US purchase which is real customer service, I must add that i didn't use their goodwill voucher because why should Amazon be at a loss because their site was abused by such appaling trades people?? Thank you though Amazon! British Delight's you are the consumers worst nightmare and if you was in the UK you'd have had Trading Standards visiting you.<br /><br />Just amazed that you can treat people like this!

review/summary: Best Tea.  EVER.
review/text: I love Earl Grey tea, and if this company had any I would try it.  My friend is from England, and she introduced me to PG Tips.  The bags are shaped like little pyramids, and they steep very fast.  I take my tea with honey and a bit of milk, but this tea doesn't even need the milk - it is so delicious and mellow that there's no edge to take off it.<br /><br />Still, it has distinctive, definite tea flavor which is comforting and smooth.  There's no sharpness or bitterness, even if you forget and over-steep it.  You can make this tea as strong as you wish and it will still taste like delicious tea, and not like acidic, bitter tannin.  Great with honey, milk and shortbread!  It is, hands down, the best cup of tea I've ever enjoyed.

When I opened my first can the consistency was completely different, waterey more than normal, smelled different & the color is different.  I compared it to a can from another case that I had & it was completely different.  I almost wonder if it sat in a warehouse in the heat all summer, it looked like it was boiled.  It creeped me out so I switchy cats to a different food & did not feed them this.

review/text: My cats are fish cats, they do not eat any meat or poultry. For some reason it makes them gassy, nasty. Plus I feel a bit better about only having to kill one type of animal for them to survive, in this case, salmon. Having fed my cats the dry version of this food in the past I figured I would give this a shot. There was no complaints from my cats, they ate it all. I like giving all my pets foods with limited ingredients so Natural Balance always seems to work for us.

review/summary: Cat will not eat this.
review/text: My kitty loved the Natural Balance indoor cat food, so we thought we'd try this one, since it's limited ingredients which meant it had no grains. My cat has a tough time eating this. I suspect is because of the following reasons.<br /><br />1) Too much peas, not enough salmon. Even though salmon is the first listed ingredient, the food looks to be mostly ground up peas. There are not enough salmon in there to entice the cat.<br /><br />2) Way too dry. I have to mix water in with the cat food, otherwise my cat won't even touch it.<br /><br />3) Results in extremely stinky excrement. Compared to the indoor balance food, there was both an increase in volume and odour of excrement.<br /><br />As a result, I most definitely will not be buying this again. The indoor cat variety of this brand is excellent, just not this one. Avoid it!

review/summary: All 3 cats say NO!
review/text: I bought this food because of the review that said it was more meaty than the duck and green pea, which was a loser for us because it was so pasty.  I was disappointed to find that this one was the same as the duck as far as texture goes.  The one thing that made this even worse was that my cats wouldn't even eat this one.  Very unusual for them because they are typically easy to please.  I have to say that of all the flavors of Natural Balance they have, this is the only one they haven't liked.

review/summary: My cats love this stuff
review/text: My cats love this stuff.  I've bought the venison & green pea flavor and the salmon & green pea flavor, and they love both.  I haven't bought the duck version because I've read it was patte which I don't think my cats will like, while these two have more of a 'meaty' texture.  And I just haven't tried the chicken flavor because my cats' dry food is chicken flavor so I figured they'd be bored with that :).<br /><br />If your cat is picky of course they might not like this brand, that's always a risk with any food.  Sometimes cats have to be persuaded to try it out, but then once they do they like it. I'm sure you've read most of the ways to tempt cats to try a new food... but one way that I rarely saw mentioned was the way that finally worked for me with my oldest, who is very timid about anything new.  I found that if I put a tiny amount on top of one of her front paws (I smeared a dab into her fur with my finger), that more or less gave her no choice but to taste it because she wanted to lick it off to clean her paw.  Then immediately she was intrigued and started eating from the plate.  I did that with this brand and now she loves it, she stands at the fridge and cries when it's dinner time (they both do).<br /><br />Besides the fact that my cats love this brand and do well on it, I like that it's relatively cheap compared to other healthy brands. With Natural Balance I don't have to pay shipping costs like on most others, because Natural Balance is sold at Petco and also here on Amazon eligible for free shipping.

review/summary: It's pricey, but our picky cats like it.
review/text: Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled. It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.

review/summary: Cats would rather eat the cheap stuff. Oh well.
review/text: I wanted to do better for my kitties than the cheap sludge that goes into most name brand cat foods, including some that used to be considered premium foods, but are now owned by the same old mega-conglomerates that make all the other stuff out of corn and "byproducts" instead of ingredients suitable for obligate carnivores.<br /><br />I really thought better cat food would be better for the cats, but they don't care. Miss Garbage-Guts will eat anything, and lots of it, and had no problem wolfing down this stuff. Mister Gourmet wouldn't touch the Natural Balance kibble and only licked at the canned stuff, and I had to get him the cat food equivalent of Twinkies so he'd eat at all.<br /><br />Based on their evident flavor preferences for the canned food (I bought a little each of all the flavors locally to see what they liked), I "invested" in a couple of cases of the ones they seemed to like, including the salmon formula. Now that I've laid in a good supply, of course neither of them want anything to do with it after the first few bites. So, rather than throw away half eaten cans, I've been putting them outside for the strays, and even they aren't crazy about it. I don't just feed the strays, I trap, neuter and release (over a dozen so far).<br /><br />I really wouldn't mind paying top dollar for high quality ingredients if only the stuff was at least as palatable as the stuff cats ask for by name. So much for good intentions. I'll see if the rescue where I got my last cat will take the cans my two are never going to eat.

review/summary: Doesn't taste buttery at all to me.
review/text: I've recently gone back to the "old fashioned" popcorn that you cook on the stove, and the taste is SO MUCH BETTER than any of the microwave popcorns.  I love buttery-flavored popcorn and thought this butter flavored oil looked like the perfect way to get that.  Wrong.  I honestly don't taste ANY butter flavor in my popcorn when I cook it in this oil.  It tastes just like regular canola oil.<br /><br />So I'm back to using coconut oil - so far nothing comes close to beating that, by far.  If I want buttery, here's a concept - I just drizzle a little melted butter over it.

review/text: Y'know, you'd think with the words "Buttery Flavor" in the product name, the product would taste either like butter, or have the fake-butter flavor we find in many pseudo-butter products.  You'd be wrong.  What this is, is oil.  It has NO FLAVOR AT ALL. Gross!  I tried it, my wife tried it, and my daughter tried it.  All it does is make your popcorn slimy and wet.  Don't waste your money.  Most Redenbacher popcorn products are pretty good but this one is a big loser.  If you *really* don't care about fat, and you want buttery flavor for your popcorn, skip this junk and just put butter or some other butter-substitute on your popcorn.

Heat the oil(a bit extra does not hurt) pop the kernels, and remove from the stove. Then add a bit of salt and toss the popcorn (with the lid on).  Then add some more oil (remember it is popping oil and topping) and toss again to coat the popcorn.  The result is just like movie popcorn, our family will eat a double batch during one movie.  Walmart does sell this stuff for $3.00 and change.

review/summary: Anyone knows.....
review/text: Anyone knows that if you are going to bake a country ham, you need to soak it.  Soak it in something that will allow the water to cover the ham.  Soak it for 2 days, changing the water twice per day.  I soak mine in a cooler and put some ice in it to keep it fresh.  When I was a chef in a restaurant, I would soak them in the walk-in, still remembering to change the water twice per day.  If you are going to fry the ham and make a red eye gravy, I would slice the ham and only soak the slices for a couple of hours, pat dry and then fry, making sure you do not fry it too much.  If you do, you will find that it becomes extraordinarily salty.<br /><br />For the person who wrote the review in January of 2012, I would suggest two things.  Make sure you read a recipe when you start using a new product, and number two, do not become intoxicated before you type.

review/summary: Great flavour at an excellent price!
review/text: I love Indian food. I cook it a lot at home. This way, I know precisely what goes in it and I can make healthier versions of my favourites. Of course, basmati rice, much tastier then the "regular" variety, makes a great accompaniment to all the various curries and dahls. I was very pleased to find the rice available on Amazon at a great price (even more so under the Subscribe and Save program). Of course, buying in bulk, I was a little weary of its quality and freshness. I should not have been worried.<br />Each of the four plastic jars contains five cups of rice. One serving is equal to 1/4 cup of rice. Sometimes, that may seem not enough. However, this rice cooks up quite plump, making the 1/4 cup filling enough. Even though I cook the rice without any oil, it does not stick. The rice is so flavorful, I do not find it necessary to use salt. I do find I need a bit more water then suggested (three cups of water to two cups of rice works better for me).<br />I am sure I will be buying this rice again!<br />Enjoy!
