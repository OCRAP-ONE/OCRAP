review/summary: Acquired taste, but great to carry
review/text: These aren't as sweet as the description would have you believe.  The chocolate turtle flavor doesn't come through very strongly.  It mostly tastes like the soy crisps that cover the outside, and the (very chewy) caramel in the center.  They taste good, but you should know what you're getting.<br /><br />These are fairly small so they're great to carry with you as a snack.  They won't melt or deform in a bag.  Perfect travel food - nutritious, portable, and tasty.

review/summary: Not my favorite of the Kashi bars (GoLean Crunchy is the best), but not bad
review/text: The rolls consist of a very firm and chewy slightly chocolaty nougat-like center surrounded by a layer of caramel and rolled in a Rice Krispie-like coating. The taste is pretty good, and it should keep you going for a few hours.<br /><br />The caramel layer is very sticky, so try not to touch it. The least messy way to eat this is to just pull down the wrapper far enough to take a bite. Keep the rolls at room temperature (chilled you will not be able to bite into it, too warm and you have a sticky mess).<br /><br />It would be great if these were packaged as a pouch of bite-size pieces rather than a roll.

review/summary: GOLEAN roll bar, over a dollar each but very good
review/text: I love trying Kashi products because they are attentive to whole grains, low sugar, etc.  This product has 12 grams of protein and is less like candy than other nutrition bars, which I appreciate. It is, however, sweet enough that it is a pleasure to eat. I am surprised that what I am asked to review is called a Turtle Bar; I just re-read the description and what I got was definitely not the Turtle bar because the center was vanilla and not chocolate.  I don't really care because I was looking for a tasty Kashi product, hoping for something less sugary than other meal replacement bars and these goals were met. I will be trying other flavors anyway.  One caution: this bar requires a good set of teeth to eat--lots of crunch and chew (which make it more satisfying, in my opinion).  If you like Kashi products in general, you will probably like this one.

review/text: I bought this at Trader Joes and it was pretty hard.  Maybe it was just old, as others have said.  It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw.  The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped.  The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers.  The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor.  I guess I'll try for a less messy kashi bar next time.

review/text: I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them. Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks. I nearly broke my front tooth (at least it felt that way) biting into them. I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off, but it's not worth the toothache.<br /><br />Try the other flavors, they are good but think twice about this one.

review/text: I love these bars which I discovered 3 years ago when I needed to eat more foods with a better glycemic response. These are great and really keep me satisfied.  I'm on the auto delivery plan which is so much cheaper than the grocery store.  I used to try to wait until they went on sale at the grocery store, but now I just do the Amazon auto delivery and cheap price. I do wish they would make them a little healthier and stop with the palm kernel oil and a little less sugar would suit me better.

review/summary: Super filling bar
review/text: There are several things I like about this bar, but the most important thing is that it fills you up and you feel full for several hours. My favorite flavor is the caramel peanut. It has 190 calories, 6 grams of fiber, and 12 grams of protein. It's very chewy-the nougat center is the best part. It takes a while to chew, so by the time you've eaten the whole thing, you feel satisfied. It also has a low glycemic index, which means that it doesn't cause sugar spikes. Sugar spikes give you some energy, then you crash and start to feel hungry again. I eat one at work around 11:00 or 11:30, and I don't start to feel hungry until around 4:00. The price is very good too-even if I paid the full price of around $24.00, it's still only $2.00 for a meal, because this bar is usually the only lunch I eat. Amazon is good about usually having a 12 bar box available for around 16 dollars. I consider this bar a real bargain.

This is it!  As a diabetic, I have to be judicious in my use of carbs.  This is worth the 27 grams in each bar.  Try and enjoy!

review/text: I had tried this from our local grocery store and really liked the flavor, but thought they were a little hard to bite and chew!  Well, after getting my box this past Saturday and literally just finishing one (05/09/2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST) these are awesome!  Don't buy them from the grocery store because you don't know how long they have been sitting on the shelf!<br /><br />The center was a nice soft texture!  I can now let my hubby try them, he has dentures and there was no way he could have bitten down on the ones from the grocery store!<br /><br />I am on the auto delivery plan for every two months, I might have to change it to every month!  Going to look at the other flavors that are offered here on Amazon!

review/summary: Best Protein bar I've ever tasted
review/text: What I love about this bar is that it doesn't have the after taste that many other protein bars have. I have tried many believe me and most of them are not even good for you and taste artificial. I love this because it is chewy, delicious, and most of all has excellent nutritional value.<br /><br />It maybe a bit chewy for some, like it can hurt your jaw at times, but I love that fact because I love the fact that it is re-teaching me how to take time to chew and enjoy food. These days, everything has become so convenient, our teeth don't even do any work any more :)<br /><br />I also love that it has so much fiber but doesn't taste so chalky or grassy.<br /><br />I guess at the end of the day, it is all about preference. I love most Kashi products but this one, I will give five stars b/c they did an excellent job packing in nutrition in a delicious roll. Thanks Kashi!

review/text: If you have TMJ, steer far away from this. It's inedible. Never mind the taste, which is completely bland and somewhat chalky, but this is very, VERY tough to chew for someone with TMJ issues. I made the mistake of looking at the picture and spotting "nougat," which really shouldn't be *that* chewy. I mean, if I can handle a room-temperature Clif bar...<br /><br />Maybe I'll microwave the ones left in the box to make them edible.

review/summary: Great, refined sugar free snack
review/text: I discovered the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle Roll last year while hiking with my boyfriend. I've given up on anything with refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. You have no idea how difficult it is to find healthy, mass-produced snacks that don't contain either of these. But Kashi GOLEAN Turtle Rolls are made with brown rice syrup. They're great for packing into a back pack. Even when they get squished, they're still easy to eat. And they tasted good, too. These are incredibly difficult to find in my local grocery store and market so I buy a case or two from Amazon every other month and keep one at home and one at the office for days when I can't make it out to lunch. With a glass of milk, the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle rolls is great for tiding me over 'til dinner.

The product itself is very fresh and tasty; however there were two packages that had the cellophane broken and only 11 cookies in the box, not 12. I make lots of purchases through Amazon, but will most likley not make a food purchase again.

review/summary: Great but Late
review/text: I ordered these cookies to be sent to my son who is away at school. When the cookies did arrive three weeks after they were ordered my son reports they were great, he and his friends are asking for more. The cookies were very good and they are individually wrapped so he could put them in his back pack (or hide them in his dorm room) and there was no mess.  I would not order them again only because it took too long for them to arrive which is most likely Amazon's problem. The cookies were Great just too late.<br /><br />I will buy Mrs. Fields cookies again and send them to my son, just not through Amazon.

review/summary: Much ado about nothing
review/text: I like to purchase chocolates for my Mom. She is 79 years old, and does enjoy a piece of chocolate after dinner. I wanted to get something special for her, so Naturally I went to one of the more expensive items in this area. I waited for her to get the package and had her call me as she opened the box and tasted her first piece of very expensive chocolate. She was very happy to get the gift and thrilled that I had remembered her in this way. And that is about as far as the excitement went. She ate no more than one or a half of the chocolates a day. As each piece of chocolate is two servings. She kept the slip of paper from the box that told of each chocolate and what you were getting. As the days went on and she was telling me how she enjoyed the chocolates, the truth came out. These were nice chocolates. Nice, but not worth the money you spend on them. I told her that the next box of chocolates I get would be DIFFERENT. When she had finished the box I ordered her TWO boxes of the variety of Kirkland Chocolates. I actually spent less on TWO boxes than I had on this one small box of Chocolates. She was thrilled  not only with the fact of a gift again, but at the taste of the chocolates. She loved the Kirkland chocolates, and requested that I never spend the money on the Moonstruck Chocolates again. Although I didn't sample the candy, I believe that if you want more for your money, and a good piece of candy, skip the Moonstruck and go for the Kirkland box of chocolates. Variety PLUS a very happy Mom.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042TO03I">Kirkland Signature Classic American Chocolate Holiday Gift Box 16 oz.</a>

review/text: These smell great--like smoked dried salame.  Once my father accidently sliced up a few to prepare them for his lunch before he saw the words "Dog Food" on them. That would have been funny.<br /><br />Actually I have tasted these myself (as I do with everything I feed my dogs) and they are indeed quite good.  Not salty nor gritty.  It's like compressed mixed dried sausages.<br /><br />I grate these into a scoop of Natural Balance Ultra dry kibble and the dogs simply can't get enough.  They go crazy for these as treats also. A healthy alternative to expensive high-carb junkfood treats that beggin strips, snausages, greenies, milk bones, puperoni,  canine carryouts, etc...<br /><br />You know the food is good when you can use it as treats...

review/summary: Cannot grate/process like other flavors
review/text: I have been using Natural Balance food rolls for over a year as a food topper. I found that the most convenient way to distribute the topper so that it mixes evenly with the kibble (and makes the whole dish taste better) is by putting it in a food processor and grating it small bits. We call them the dogs' "sprinkles."<br /><br />I had not tried the beef flavor yet and thought the dogs would appreciate a change of pace. Unfortunately our routine is out of whack now. When put into a food processor and ground, this food roll turns into a paste and sticks to itself, basically turning into a solid again. We cannot just "sprinkle" it on top of food. Although I like the Natural Balance products, if you plan on grinding down the roll- don't get this flavor!

review/summary: Yiikes! $16.13 Why the sudden price increase?
review/text: My two lhasa apso's absolutely love this food! For the last 3 years, I've been feeding this to them exclusively, full time as their main meal. They are pretty finicky eaters but not with this food! The only thing that has worried me is the amount of water they drink after eating their 4" slice (2" each daily) I've read some comments where this has been cautioned against as a full time meal replacement but so far other than the extra water intake & subsequent occasional in house potty accidents, I've experienced no adverse reactions! It helps them stay at a healthy weight & they look forward to feeding time each night as if I am giving them prime steak! So far it has been affordable & I usually buy 6-8 rolls a month & then give them cans of Iams for the in-between times when I run out. Lately it's been averaging for the beef rolls about eleven ninety nine.<br /><br />I just went to order a new batch & was shocked to see the new price of over sixteen dollars, which is much more than even buying it at petco (in-store) I recently was at my local petsmart @ was looking for Natural Balance food rolls & they did not carry it:( but what they did carry was something very comparable a product called Pet Botanics Dog Food Rolls! I went ahead & bought four 4.5 lb rolls (2 of the lamb & brown rice & 2 of the beef) My dogs loved it just as much as this! So if anyone else is concerned as I am about the Amazon price increase I would definitely recommend Pet Botanicals Food Rolls! I just ordered my monthly 6 rolls for $9.99 EACH which are 4.5lbs or 1/2 a pound more than the Natural Balance 4lb  rolls & they were even less than the $11.99 I paid BEFORE the price increase! I have shoprunner so shipping was free & I had a $4.00 offf a $15 purchase coupon code for Petco! So I placed 3 separate orders of 2 rolls each & saved $12.00 which more than offset the tax I had to pay! Good luck!

review/text: In addition to the freeze dried dog nuggets, I supplement with cut-up portions of various flavors of the dog food rolls and the beef is Callie's favorite.  It is moist, easy to cut into 1-inch or 2-inch slices before storing in refrigerator or freezer for short or long-term.  It is a complete dog food that can be used alone, as a supplement, or as a treat.  So happy Amazon offers a great variety of pet food at reasonable prices.  It was packaged well and arrived within two days after I placed my order.

review/summary: Dog-Tested, Owner-Approved
review/text: Soon after we adopted our dog, I realized she didn't seem to enjoy treats. Or at least, the treats we bought her. She'd eat them, but she didn't LOVE them. So, I set out to find something new & came across these rolls in a nearby pet store. Sliced them up for treats, gave her one, & she was in LOVE. Awesome for training because she'll do whatever you want for one small piece. We also grate it up for her dry food, which she then gobbles down. Very happy pup, very happy owner. (The price isn't bad for us because our dog is 16 lbs. One 1lb. roll lasts almost a month for her.)

review/text: Both my dogs go crazy over this.  I originally bought it for treats but one of my dogs has decided she is not going to open her mouth for any reason whatsoever unless this is mixed in or is her treat.  I have made a monster.<br /><br />Truthfully, I am happy this inspires her to eat.  She has been a fussy eater since I have had her.  It has not been unusual for her to go a day and a half without eating.  However with this I know she will eat.  I just crumble some in her breakfast and dinner bowl and she will slurp it right up.<br /><br />For lunch she gets 1/4 cup of kibble and a half slice of this which I crumble up and put in her Bob-A-Lot toy by Starmark.  In no time it is gone.<br /><br />I love this stuff!

I have no complaints at all about the brand, but the cost of these here at Amazon is no different than what you can get at the large pet stores, and generally you can even get a discount there if you have a membership card. So while I recommend the product, I suggest you get it at a local big pet store.

review/text: This product came on my radar when my dog's clicker training puppy kindergarten teacher suggested it.  In a visit to the San Diego Wild Animal Park later that week, I learned their handlers use Natural Balance formula (and clickers!) to keep their cheetahs under control and in good shape.<br /><br />This treat is great because you can chop it into much smaller morsels than dry kibble treats.  Smaller treats let you practice more with smaller breeds before they get full/thirsty/bored.<br /><br />Since the 4 lb roll itself is an epic portion for a small breed puppy (see img), I keep the bulk of it frozen and refrigerate about a week's worth slice in a sandwich bag for easy access.

She's 11 years old so I wondered if she was developing diabetes.  She also started having accidents in the house, which she had not done since puppyhood, so maybe a bladder infection?  I took her to the vet.  He checked her urine and said there was no infection but the ph was high.  He suggested changing her diet.  As soon as I did that my dog resumed her normal water consumption and stopped peeing in the house.  This food must have a lot of salt or something.  I would not recommend it.

review/summary: Better Treat than Meal
review/text: My dog LOVES this, what we call, Snausage. I won't give it to her as a meal because its nutritional value is not high enough. I give it to her as a treat. I also crumble and sprinkle it on her more nutritional kibble when she gets fussy about eating. The added Nat. Bal. makes her scoff up her kibble. If Nat. Bal. ever raises the nutritional value of its dog food rolls, I'd use them as main meals. For now, they reamain a supplement. I recommend using this product as a supplement to your dog's diet ONLY, but not as a main source of nutrition.

review/summary: Suspicious
review/text: I was very excited to try this food.  We have an older JRT who is not a finicky eater, but isn't crazy about dry food.<br />I was hoping to find another healthy food to rotate.<br />When my order arrived, it contained 2 rolls of Natural Balance and a 5# bag of Natural Balance dry food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag of dry food, I gave her a few pieces to taste and she loved them.<br />So I mixed the dry food with the remaining other dry food in a large container.<br />Then I switched her morning food to the roll instead of her usual canned or pouch food.<br />Again, she loved it, but became very ill within a few hours.<br />She was throwing up and developed loose stools.<br />Our girl was completely listless and wouldn't eat anything but grass.<br />Today I switched her back to her previous food and she seems much better.<br />She's still not back to normal, but obviously feeling much better than yesterday.<br /><br />I know it sounds like I'm jumping to conclusions, but I searched for complaints on this brand and found many similar and worse stories at [...].<br />We're not going to use the rest of this food.  I only wish I hadn't mixed the dry food with another high priced food because now I'll have to toss all of it. I had also purchased some of their canned food.  It's all going into the trash.<br /><br />The food looks and smells great and our dog was nuts about it initially.<br />Just be careful if your pet shows any signs of illness after introducing a new food.<br />I'd rather waste a few dollars than risk the well being of our beloved pet.<br /><br />Too many companies who make food and treats for our beloved pets have been compromising quality to increase profit.<br />Our pet is going to be fine.  She hadn't eaten much of whatever made her so ill and I'm not going to risk repeating it.<br />In the future, I will research complaints before trying a new brand or just start making our own.

review/summary: Very interesting blend
review/text: I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it.

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks variety
review/text: First of all, in response to the query of why you would order this online posed by the reviewer below...not everyone lives near a Starbucks. Hard to believe I know, considering they seem to be on every street corner, but believe it or not there are still large sections of the US w/out Starbucks. So for those of us who want good coffee, Thank God for the internet & amazon. Verona is my favorite SB blend. It doesn't taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me. It has a boldness without being too dark & overwhelming, and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee. It makes a delicious cup of coffee.

review/text: As a perusal of comment about Verona Dark will show, the fans of regular Verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued. It's your company and you can run it any way you please. Conclusion: Unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular Verona, the decision to do so is (for me terribly) ill-advised.<br /><br />There. How's that for potentially positive and useful feedback?<br /><br />PS: I cannot choose the product you want me to specify, because you mention only DARK Verona.

review/summary: Well, if this doesn't wake you up, NOTHING will.
review/text: The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is "Extra Bold."  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week.

review/summary: Excellent rice for the price
review/text: This is an excellent wild rice.  Wild rice can be hard to find in the grocery stores, especially in the South.  I happen to love it, and most of all, I love the price here rather than buying a tiny stale box in a grocery store.  It's reasonably fresh, the grains are reasonably whole, and I'm reasonably pleased too!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about some broken grains.  I feel that is probably inevitable after shipping, and since I live a long ways from the wild rice fields, I'm going to have to accept the broken grains as part of the deal.  There aren't many, it's very much whole grain and "fancy" grade.  I'd serve this to guests or my family without worries.<br /><br />We don't generally mix wild rice while cooking, preferring to mix other rices in after cooking them separately so that I don't have to worry about different ratios of cooking time, water, etc.  Typically, I use wild rice in a wild rice pilaf or stuffing for poultry.  I definitely recommend this brand.

review/text: Fruit by the Foot is delicious! It's FAT FREE, so you can indulge your snacking needs for just 80 CALORIES PER ROLL! They are Gluten free, as well. This Variety Pack has 3 flavors: Strawberry, Color by the Foot and Berry Tie Dye. Color by the Foot is a mish mash of flavors and colors--from green to yellow to orange to red and each color change represents a flavor change! Fun and Tasty! Some of the flavors/colors you cannot get elsewhere in the Fruit by the Foot products. Berry Tie Dye is red, blue and purple, has the flavors of blueberry, raspberry and blue raspberry as well as strawberry. Variety pack lets you satisfy many different tastes in one box!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFF8">Fruit by the Foot Variety Pack (Strawberry, Color by the Foot, Tie Dye), 6-Count Rolls (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Each roll contains 3 FEET of fruit and come packaged 6 rolls to the box, 12 boxes per case and each roll is INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED for freshness and protection. The fruit 'leather' is backed on a waxed paper-type product, printed with facts, puzzles or silly stuff. The 3 FOOT paper and fruit product is then rolled up into a roll and sealed into individual packets, which are easy to open. The fruit by the foot NEVER sticks to the paper, even in hot weather! It is eaten by peeling the fruit off the paper. The Fruit is often cut into shapes, like dentil moulding, rick-rack or waves. FBF is great for lunch boxes/bags; to toss in your purse, tote or briefcase for a pick me up;for picnics; for a treat jar and for Halloween giving. This is a good solution for families, pre-schools/child cares, teachers, churches, or any other group that needs a lot of snacks and wants to give variety and something realistically healthy that kids will ENJOY eating. I'm not even a kid and I enjoy them. My students get them as rewards and my dog LOVES them!<br /><br />I began purchasing these in a local grocery store. When that became too expensive, I bought them at the big box store. Browsing the 'Subscribe and Save' items on Amazon one day, I came across this case price--nearly HALF of what each box cost me at the BIG BOX store. You get a total of 72 Rolls in this particular package! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFF8">Fruit by the Foot Variety Pack (Strawberry, Color by the Foot, Tie Dye), 6-Count Rolls (Pack of 12)</a> Plus, I had the added convenience of having them AUTOMATICALLY SHIPPED on my chosen time schedule!

AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS BY NOW?<br />--Potassium Citrate,  SOUNDS LIKE POTASSIUM AND CITRUS FRUIT -- BUT IT'S NOT<br />--Color (Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1)  COLOR, COLOR, AND MORE COLOR -- ISN'T FRUIT PRETTY COLORFUL ALL BY ITSELF?<br /><br />So fruit -- which is already colorful and already sweet, is puree'd with enough sugar to kill ants, then dosed up with preservatives so it has a half-life of 200 years -- AND they throw in partially hydrogenated fats (which are so bad for your that they have been banned in several states and countries around the world -- and will be banned by the rest before it's over) -- and what have you got?  Something nobody in their right mind would eat and call "fruit".<br /><br />This is not fruit -- it's candy.  And as candy -- it's not even good candy.  Why not go for a piece of real fruit followed by a bit of REAL 60-75% chocolate made with REAL sugar.  Chocolate has the highest concentration of anti-oxidents on the planet -- so many that it has a naturally ultra-long shelf life with no zero- none- nada- not-a-bit of preservative or partially hydrogenated anything.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I've just about reached the end of my patience with these monolithic companies that market empty calories laced with poison under innocent sounding names and cute, brightly colored boxes with cartoon animals on them.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by anything that says "Zero Grams of Trans Fat" --if it has partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list -- then they're splitting hairs with the labeling laws.  Partially hydrogenated oil IS Trans Fat.<br /><br />If they make the portion size small enough that 1 portion has less than .5 grams of partially hydrogenated fat (even if the portion size is only 4 grams of the food)  -- then they are within the law to lie to you and advertise their product as having 0-grams of trans fat!  Can you believe it?  Whatever happened to the spirit of the law?<br /><br />Money happened.<br /><br />If a portion size is 4-grams, and each 4-grams of a 180-gram box contains .4-grams of partially hydrogenated fat -- that means the box could contain as much as 18-grams of TRANS FAT.  It's a con.  It's a lie.  It's trying to pass a lie that falls within the letter of the law off as the truth.  I've actually read boxes where the serving size was 2 crackers -- little tiny crackers -- that together weighed less than 9 grams.  That's less than 1/3 of an ounce.  Who is that supposed to be a serving for?  Barbie?<br /><br />And if you buy these things and feed them to your children -- then you're buying the lie because it's easy, pretty, well marketed, sweet (no kidding) and without a shadow of thought or conscience.

review/summary: now i can buy cd's and gelato at the same store.  SCORE.
review/text: seriously.  this is amazing.  who knew you could order frozen food products on amazon?  if you haven't tried it yet, you have got to get on the gelato classico train . . . it is sooooo good.  i haven't tried a flavor i don't like yet and it's healthier than ice cream so, wheee!  delicious and i'd definitely recommend it (obviously) to anyone.  if you're an ice cream eater, try this and you'll never go back.  i don't even look at ice cream the same way anymore . . . try the dark chocolate with fresh strawberries: instant legend status.

review/text: I thought this might be good, but the taste was just repulsive. It was hard to finish a single serving.

review/summary: Typical of its kind, really not bad
review/text: I've had this soup, not bought here, bought it in a grocery store. I wanted to say it's a good enough quick snack, I actually liked the shrimp/lime taste. It's kind of tangy, an interesting taste compared to some of the dried noodle quick soups. I'd have it again.

review/summary: MY favorite of all the noodle soups....
review/text: This has become my favorite of the various soup flavors available. When I first saw the name I passed on it wondering what the manufacturer was thinking. I had tried the plain shrimp and was not impressed at all, but I did order a case after a few weeks and found the flavor was much better with the lime flavor added.

review/summary: Funny, doesn't taste like the ones I buy in Hawaii...
review/text: Couldn't taste the lime in it like the ones I have tried from our local store. Weird. Maybe it was close to its shelf life date? Unsure. But I think I will be purchasing this item at my local store - more flavor.

review/summary: Wrong Item Pictured
review/text: The product pictured above (at this time) is Lime Chili Shrimp flavor but the product sent is actually as the listing states: Lime Shrimp. It's bland and needs hot sauce and/or more citrus flavor. It's just ramen and you can't expect much more than for it to not instantly kill you, but for the same 29 cents a cup, there's better flavors.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: GREAT DEAL
review/text: I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.

review/summary: Hard
review/text: Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard.
