review/summary: When's the Cutoff?
review/text: At what point during the day can I no longer consume Breakfast Blend?<br /><br />I turn to you, fellow K-Cup aficionados.  I regularly enjoy a cup in the AM, typically between 8am-10am.  But yesterday I tried a cup around 3pm and it tasted like I was licking a clown's elbow.<br /><br />I'm assuming y'all will recommend noon as a safe cutoff, but I'd really like to incorporate BB into my post lunch rotation.  How late can I enjoy a cup without it feeling like I'm drinking a bucket of sand?<br /><br />Thanks.

review/summary: Happy, healthy, well fed dogs
review/text: I switched to Fromm Gold earlier this year from Innova Small Bites.  I have two dogs - a 2 1/2 year old Chinese Crested Powder Puff and a 2 year old Yorkie/Bichon Frise mix.  While they did very well on the Innova, as it also didn't contain corn or wheat, I wasn't thrilled that it was bought out by Proctor & Gamble last year and fear it will go the way of other small brands that used to be higher quality, like Iams.  Fromm Gold was an easy switch over, with no tummy issues for either dog.  They eat less, which is something I try to watch carefully since they're both toy breeds and can tend to become overweight quickly. And because they eat less and this food doesn't have all the fillers, they poop less.  I add just a little bit of warm water to the kibble and they LOVE their Fromm Gold "crunchies and gravy"!  Their coats, skin, eyes, and teeth are healthy and they have plenty of energy.

review/text: Our Silver Dapple Miniature Dachshund Sophie loves this food and we do too! After trying many foods with no luck we came across Fromm and knew it was Sophie's new food from day one. This food had done great at keeping her weight in check and her coat soft and shiny. She has to eat less and poops very little due to there not being any fillers in Fromm foods. We tell every person we meet about this food, all of our friends have changed their dog to Fromm and love it for their pups too. Thank you Fromm for making such a great food for our Miss Sophie!

review/summary: Who needs barbecue potato chips?
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZSYCK">Tyrrell's Hand Fried Potato Chips, Sweet Chilli & Pepper, 5.29-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> is my favorite of the four varieties I've had.  That's not to say I won't grab a bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZU3C4">Tyrrell's Hand Fried Potato Chips, Lightly Sea Salted, 5.29-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> just as fast, or the Mature Cheddar variety and even the Sea Salt and Cider Vinegar.  Really, they are all good!  Thinly sliced of potatoes that are grown within 25 miles of where they are turned into potato chips, each bag is imprinted with the potato variety and location where grown, so those who are interested in those details can be happy.  Since they are shipped to the states from England, I am not really impressed by the manufacturers proximity to the farms.  What does impress me is the flavor of each distinctive variety, the really light salt on the slightly salted variety, the spiciness to the sweet chilli flavor, and I love the pictures on the bags.  They hold up well after the bag is opened and don't deteriorate as quickly as other potato chips.  I've combined the slightly salted with the other flavors to cut down on the sodium and alleviate some of the snacking guilt.  My main criticism is that some of the chips have been blemished and others have been a very oily, but for the most part, these are top notch potato chips if you don't eat too many at once when the oil becomes overwhelming.

review/summary: Superior quality Kalamatas
review/text: We have a local Lebanese diner where we regularly get their marinated Kalamatas.  The quality highly varies -- sometimes great, sometimes mushy with an off taste.  So I'm on a mission to replicate the great ones, and have found my source for the olives.  Second order from Martinis, and so far every olive has been perfect.  Good sized olives with a consistently very firm, meaty texture, not a mushy one in the bunch.  Olives come in a tasty but very salty brine and wine vinegar mixture.  Right out of the keg you can't eat too many because of the salt, but the flavor is very good.  For regular eating we do the following.  We take a portion of the olives, drain and rinse them, and transfer them to another container and fill with cold water.  We let it sit for several hours and change out the water. We repeat this a couple more times with a final wash that is left overnight to 2-days with something added to season and spice them up.  Use dried red pepper, fresh jalapenos or whatever.  Then they are well drained and put in a separate container with more fresh sliced peppers and covered with olive oil.  Here they stay as they are consumed overthe next week or two.  Thanks for the recipe Albert!

review/summary: Had to throw them out.
review/text: Very disappointed.  The package arrived well insulated and no apparent leakage.  But, there was brown crust around the lip seal.  Maybe it had leaked at one point?  When we opened and sampled them, they had a distinct vinegar or old wine taste.  I'm guessing (only speculation) that the container may have been stored in a hot place at some point in it's life?  They said they were packaged a little over two years ago.  That tells me they were stored somewhere for that long.  The expiration date was July of this year (about 7 months away).  Also, the label says "large" whole olives.  These were small to medium in size.  Maybe we just got a bad jar? Never contacted the vendor.  Just threw them in the trash.

review/summary: Mars Bars Ride Again
review/text: Years ago, there was the Mars Bar.  The Mars Bar was a chocolate bar with nougat, caramel and almonds. Deee-licious--or so I remember it as being, because Mars discontinued the Mars Bar some years back.  (This Mars Bar is not to be confused with the Mars Bar still made and sold in Britain and can be ordered online as well, which is much more like a version of the Milky Way Bar than the old defunct Mars Bar I'm speaking of.)<br /><br />But now there are Snickers-Almond Bars.  The Snickers-Almond Bar is the closest thing extant to the old Mars Bar.  It's slightly different and not quite as good, in my opinion, as the original Mars Bar (hence the four, not five, stars), but it's a passable substitute.  If you were a Mars Bar kid, as I was back in the day, you'll like these Snickers-Almond Bars for the nostalgia factor alone.  The fact that they're not quite the same thing is okay, too, because nostalgia is always a little different than the original reality had been anyway.<br /><br />P.S. I also loved the dark chocolate Mars Forever Yours Bars as a kid; and they too are now a thing of the past.  But Mars now makes Milky Way Midnight Bars, which are a close proximity of Forever Yours.  Like the Snickers-Almond Bar, the Milky Way Midnight isn't as good as its predecessor, but it'll do.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/text: When I found out about Ginger flavored Altoids, I was intrigued. I already liked Altoids, but in Ginger? I was skeptical till I had one, then WOW! They are almost as potent as taking a big bite directly off of a Ginger root (not reccommended for the faint of taste buds). These things are great, but not for everyone. I have shared them with almost everyone I know, and the reaction ranges from pleased to nauseated. YOU REALLY NEED TO LOVE GINGER TO ENJOY THESE!

If you want the taste of ginger, try Newman's Own.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I am a big fan of Altoids and have been for years.  When I was a child, my English mother gave me candied ginger and, even then, I fell in love with the sharp taste of the rhizome. I like it in all of it's many forms and the stronger the better. When I discovered that Altoids made a Ginger Mint, I was entranced and immediately ordered a box. After a short, but anxious, wait for delivery, they arrived and I was in heaven. They were all a ginger fan could hope for. Sharp, pungent and spicy in a beautiful gold box. If you prefer ginger beer to ginger ale, then this will be your candy mint of choice. If you prefer the robust taste of Vernor's to the subtlety of Canada Dry, try these mints. You will not be disappointed, I think.

review/summary: Ginger Altoids can take the edge off headaches
review/text: Many of the reviews for ginger Altoids have cited their usefulness for alleviating indigestion. I would like to suggest that they can also help take the edge off headaches. I have suffered from migraines all my life. A few years ago, wishing to kick the aspirin habit, I looked for alternative cures. One thing I discovered was ginger. At first sign of a headache, I eat some candied ginger or Altoids, or drink a ginger ale (Reed's is best!) Depending on the severity of the headache, I notice improvement within 10 minutes. Migraines are more difficult. For those, it might take several hours, and then the headache tapers off gradually. It used to take 2-3 days before my migraines were gone.<br />The ginger Altoids work as well as candied ginger, and they taste a lot better, in my opinion.

review/summary: Love these Ginger Mints
review/text: I just love these Altoids Ginger Mints. You can't find these mints in any stores, so I am glad Amazon.com carries them. I easily get motion sickness and these mints really help. The ginger is just strong enough. I only wish Altoids would come out with a sugar free version.

review/summary: A Little too Sweet
review/text: We have been big fans of these Altoids for a long time. They are a great breath freshener and cough suppressant. It makes a suitable replacement for preserved ginger candy. However, the old Altoids made in England were much better than the new ones made in the US. The English version was not as sweet and tasted more like real ginger. We still have some of the old version and the differences are very evident. Still, the new ones are the best mass produced mints out there in the market - and the only place we could find to buy them is through Amazon. They are not on retail racks.

review/summary: That's a lot of Altoids...
review/text: I really only wanted to purchase a few tins. Unfortunately, at the time I ordered these, it only came in 12 packs. That's a lot of Altoids. But hey, at least I won't have to buy more for quite some time. I wanted to try these because I have issues with nausea and car sickness. Nothing works better for that kind of queasiness than ginger. The Altoids ginger tabs aren't as effective as just straight up ginger tabs, but they have a pleasant spiciness and they get the job done well enough.

review/text: Someone gave me a tin of Ginger Altoids several years ago. I've never been able to find them in any store. Suddenly I got the idea to check on Amazon.com, and, by golly, there they were. I'm happy to say that the Ginger Altoids are as delicious as I remember them. Now I have enough to keep a tin in my car, my husband's car and in my home. I even have enough to give a couple of tins away to friends who like the Ginger flavor.

review/summary: Godsend for the carsick
review/text: Ginger Altoids, like all the other Altoids, pack a tremendous amount of flavor into a tiny tablet. I got them for carsickness, and they have been extremely helpful, on three counts:<br /><br />1) They have enough concentrated ginger to quell the nausea without eating a whole box of them.<br />2) They don't have a lot of sugar.<br />3) They are not so sweet or so tasty that I am tempted to eat them all up when I don't need them for nausea (for others this may not be a plus, for me it is perfect!)<br /><br />They also have the bonus of making my breath smell nice. I wish they were easier to find in stores!

review/text: These altoids are difficult to find in stores.  I discovered them from a store in WA but after moving to AZ I couldn't seem to find them anymore & will readily admit, I MISSED them.<br /><br />They do have a bit of a 'bite' if you chew them but otherwise are pleasantly tingling as they dissolve.<br /><br />Of course you do need to be a 'ginger' fan to appreciate them as much as I do.<br /><br />Highly recommended for ginger lovers.

review/text: I purchase them locally by the carton at World Market stores.  This chain is located in most states, although I don't think they are in the northeastern U. S.  If I could not find them locally I would buy from Amazon because I am absolutely hooked on them.  They are without a doubt the best Altoid mint, but as may people have pointed out, they are strong so you really need to love ginger.

review/summary: We Love Altoids!!!
review/text: We love these ginger Altoids!  While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our tea and sometimes, coffee.  One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting!  Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee.  And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.  Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative.  Almost no calories, but big on flavor!  We've used these for decades!
