review/summary: The Perfect Post Workout Recovery Drink.
review/text: Stationed in Afghanistan, I bought this as a recovery drink to have after workouts when I got tired of other recovery drinks. Just to mix it up a little. The shipping is fast, often getting to me in a matter of days. Being 8oz makes for a perfect portion. 24g carbs, 9g protein, make for a perfect ration after a good lift or run. The taste is amazing. I've ordered several times and will continue to do so.

review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate milk.  I personally feel that Schepp's available in Dallas is the best tasting out there.  I have been on a several year quest to find something that is healthier, low fat, and available to buy in multiple cartons.  I came across Organic Valley first at Whole Foods and was amazed at its great taste.  In my opinion, this is as good as it gets.  The eight ounce cartons offer a nice filling snack and will energize you for several hours.  I ended up ordering these to be shipped monthly from Amazon and have been so happy with them.  If you're looking for individual chocolate milk cartons, that do not have to be refrigerated and taste great, look no further.

review/summary: Great chocolate flavor in convenient packaging
review/text: I'm a frequent purchaser of milk in asceptic packages.  I find the packaging to be incredibly convenient for our family of two, to avoid waste due to spoilage.  We drink chocolate milk as a post-run recovery drink, and the single serve packages work really well for us.  Previously, I'd purchased Horizon's brand of chocolate milk in aseptic cartons and was reasonably satisfied with it.  However, Amazon stopped carrying it, which forced me to try a different brand.  The difference with Organic Valley's milk is like night and day.  The chocolate flavoring is incredible compared to Horizon's.  It is dark and rich with a light sweetness.  It's not as sweet as melted ice cream, for example, but it's on par with hot cocoa mix, I think.<br /><br />Furthermore, I did some research this time that I hadn't done before.  Organic Valley is a co-op of farmers.  To join the co-op, farmers have to meet OV's practices, which include several anti-cruelty measures as well as ensuring that the cows have pasture access (granted, the farms in wintry regions may only have pastures open for 4-6 months of the year) and plenty of room for each cow to move.  Yes, I know that things can be faked and loopholes can be found...but given what's available and out there in this product space, Organic Valley seems like a better choice than some other brands for consumers concerned with animal welfare.

review/summary: Thoroughly Disgusted
review/text: I googled Organic Valley to find out how to let them know the lot number of some spoiled aseptic chocolate milk.  I was planning to return the milk to the local grocery where I bought it, but since I've always thought Organic Valley was an ethical cooperative, I figured they would want to know about the spoiled milk.<br /><br />To my horror, I happened upon a recent article (April 2011) describing how Organic Valley is allowing giant factory farms that abuse their animals to sell milk and eggs via the Organic Valley label. I am so disgusted. Here I've been paying a premium for organic milk, eggs, and cheese (carefully avoiding Horizon since they are notorious for factory farms), and now I find out that Organic Valley has been lying to us about all the "family farms" in their cooperative.<br /><br />The board of directors of Organic Valley should be ashamed of themselves.  Honestly, the only thing that has kept me from going vegan was thinking it's OK to buy organic. Guess what--it's not OK to buy organic dairy products. Animals are still being abused.Organic Valley is evil.

review/summary: The worst chocolate milk we ever tasted
review/text: We buy a lot of chocolate milk for our daughters and prefer organic, but switch between different brands to save money. I got a case of Organic Valley Lowfat Chocolate Milk with a 15% "Subscribe and Save" discount, which made the price reasonable. These cartons looked convenient to include in the girls' school lunches.<br /><br />So I did. Today.<br />Both our girls came home with one request: NEVER EVER pack this HORRIBLE milk again!<br /><br />I asked what was wrong, and the younger one (5 years old) said "it was just not yummy", while the nine year old proclaimed it "the worst chocolate milk she had ever tasted".<br /><br />So I tried one myself and, sadly, have to agree: it looks and tastes like dirty water, NOT milk and definitely NOT chocolate! In fact it was so bad, that I had to rinse my mouth thoroughly after taking one sip :(<br /><br />I'm not asking Amazon for a refund, since the product was delivered as advertized and the expiration date is 6 months from now. But I know for sure that I will never ever buy this again and will strongly recommend against it if you like the taste of REAL milk and REAL chocolate.

I use it on everything, and if it is on the counter top, a little is ground into my palm.  Hats off to Trader JOe for this fantastic blend of seasoning spices.

Even  when I perc stronger by using less water. it is smooth and non acidic.<br /> Also makes a great cop with a single serve Keurig.<br /><br />The Peruvian has a slight  grassy after taste not objectionable just different.  I' like a  true medium roast which really works with the KONA. I'll try the Jamaivan blend next and report  on it.  So far KONA leads in my taste test,  I like coffee that isn't bitter. so both are good choices.<br /><br />If on the road try the restaurant that has a little girl on the logo. It is also smooth even if it is darker than what I roast at home.

review/summary: Exceptionally mild to wonderful
review/text: So you grind your own coffee at home? The next step to a perfect cup of coffee is to grind your freshly roasted beans, then brew. It takes me about 20-30 minutes to roast these in a skillet on a stovetop over medium heat (.25/lb. at a time). I prefer dark roast coffee and surprisingly these beans are not bitter at all! It's a bit strange drinking coffee without any bitterness. BHK states that it's because the coffee is hand-picked only when ripe.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned over the volume of beans in this one pound bag as it seemed much smaller than a pound bag of roasted beans, until I photographed the green and roasted beans side by side. (Please view my posted customer image) The beans plump (and pop!) during the roasting process.<br /><br />UPDATE: Yesterday I received my second pound and so I tried roasting the beans longer and darker. The beans range from brown to  dark brown, with a hint of an oil sheen. I just brewed some and WOW! More flavor components have emerged, without bitterness, and I just had one of the best cups of coffee I can remember. For my next batch, I'll try a French roast.<br /><br />Enjoy!

This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/summary: No taste or flavor
review/text: I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.

review/text: I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this...

review/summary: tea OK, postage way too high
review/text: The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?

review/summary: tasty Maybe beneficial
review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

review/summary: A must have if you have painful heavy periods
review/text: I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck
