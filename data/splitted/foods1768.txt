review/summary: Great & healthy bamboo, decent holding piece
review/text: I just got my bamboo today.  It arrived so so quickly (that's why the shipping costs are so much- they ship it USPS, but it's SUPER quick; they're located in CA, and I got it in three days.  I'm in IL)  The bamboo arrived healthy, and looked just as tall as the picture shows, and very green.  Looks wonderful.  I also purchased some Super Green from KL Design & Import; and got that the same day too (highly recommend that to go with Bamboo)<br /><br />Anyway, my only disappointment was that the photo shows a lovely holding piece; looks almost like a dark wood or ceramic piece.  The one that it comes with is much lighter colored (look at the user pics) and has a random leaf printing on it.  It's not nearly as nice looking, so that is a bummer.  I wish it was darker.  That's my only complaint.  Will update if I have anything to add later on.  Still a great bamboo piece, and I recommend seller.  It will live in my office cubicle to brighten things up. :)<br /><br />EDIT: April 10th, 2012<br /><br />Just giving an update on this.  The bamboo is still healthy, and growing great.  My one disappointment was that the spiral piece that came with it has not grown at all since I got it.  It's still the same size, and with the same leaves.  It's still green and alive, but has not shot up and grown new leaves like the other two straight stalks.  I may actually break off the spiral part and let it grow more naturally.

review/text: I bought this to have on hand and give to my daughter, on the birth of her son. It arrived in a few days and in perfect condition. I was able to give this to them last week and they loved it. They loved that there were 3 stalks with the circular vase symbolizing their new encircled family.<br />Easily cared for, the vase which looks like wood and glass is actually plastic, which my daughter found to be a plus in the babys room. It is a beautiful piece and the plants are healthy and need minimal care- another plus for a new family. The lucky bamboo was and continues to be a hit- thank you.

review/text: The bamboo arrived in great shape and the vases were well-packed!  I ordered two of them from this company, and am happy with both.  They have a lot of shoots coming off of them already!  Not sure what the gray goopy stuff around the roots was when I unpacked it.  Assume it was plant food or something to keep the roots from drying out.  Anyway, these look great and I'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Much Smaller than Expected - Not as Good as Pictures
review/text: I received this item today and I'm happy with it, but I'm not thrilled. It is much smaller than I had anticipated and I guess that is my fault for not reading the dimensions, so be sure to do that before you order. Also, the vase looks almost black in the pictures, but it is more brown in reality. The vase appears to be much better quality in the pictures as well, but it is not that great in person. It will still work for my office and these lucky bamboo are really the only plants that can survive without windows.

review/text: I love bamboo plants. I liked that this was low priced and well made. There is a leaf accent on one side of the vase, which is nice. The plant arrived healthy and has been going good for last two months. Its a little difficult to water if you dont have a mini watering can. It adds a nice touch to my house so I love it.<br /><br />Update: Its almost 7 months now and the plant is doing absoultely wonderful with almost nil light. I got some plant food from http://www.amazon.com/Green-Plant-Food-Case-Bottles/dp/B004490QYI/<br /> which is amazing, and I put a drop in like 2 weeks, and water only when the water level comes down, and it does the bamboo really good, lovely green leaves and all.

Overall I give this a five star review because it actually looks like the picture and was packaged well and I paid next to nothing for it. Great buy!

Many different flavors in the tea, some sweet and some with more of a bite to them, but the really amazing thing is the way they all work so well together and you can taste so many of them distinctly!  HIGHLY recommended.

review/summary: A surprising merlot value that tastes best chilled
review/text: Many reds show their depth closer to room temperature. For those vinophiles who appreciate a red that holds up to a decent chill, Gnarly Head's 2010 Merlot is an excellent value.<br /><br />Gnarly Head is a wine brand I usually ignore, but for a pizza dinner I wanted a cheap red, and this was under $8. With no time to chill, the first glass was underwhelming. A bit too much acidity came through on the finish, and the wine had diesel notes--a common characteristic in some ambitious reds, but not one I like in a merlot.<br /><br />In a startling turnaround, the next day's drinking with a decent chill proved this to be an outstanding red for the money. Lush, with loads of varied dark fruit, and a velvet finish with excellent balance, it shone when served cooler, something many reds do poorly. Highly recommended at 55 degrees F, and a good choice for white wine drinkers who normally shun reds.

review/summary: Not just a tasty drink... it's magic!
review/text: OK, not really magic, but it sure does make you feel better when you have a cold. It also does wonders at soothing a sore tummy.<br /><br />Honestly, the first time I tried this drink, I thought it smelled kind of funny. But once I took a couple of sips, the warmth of the ginger, and the sweet taste of honey, all combined and cleared my sinuses, soothed my sore throat, and made me feel really relaxed. Now, it just smells like ginger and honey to me, and I know it will make me feel better.<br /><br />I also drink it when I have an upset stomach. The ginger makes you feel like all your stomach muscles relax and it warms you up from the inside. It settles queasiness too.<br /><br />But don't just think of this as a medicinal drink. It's tasty, and is a great addition to my collection of tea. Even when I'm not feeling a cold or a stomach ache, it's a great way to warm up and relax!

review/text: I got this when I was looking for a good ginger tea.  Admittedly, I'm sure it was my error in not reading closely enough, but do note that this is not a tea nor does it come in tea bags. It's more like a granulated powder.  That said, it dissolves easily in hot water and it quite tasty.  Initially the taste was a little too sharp for me, but I have discovered that with some french vanilla creamer it actually makes an excellent chai type drink.

review/summary: excellent medicinal tea
review/text: Nothing helps a cold more than ginger tea.  Ginger tea is good plain, or you can add some lemon juice or orange juice.  I used to go to the trouble of making my own (boiling ginger root in a glass pot [never metal, which interacts badly with ginger] for half an hour).  Well not any more. This tea has a nice strong ginger flavor and is moderately sweet.  I would actually prefer it a little less sweet [I even take coffee without sugar], but most people will probably like it just as it is. Ginger is good for colds, stomach upsets, and inflamation of any sort, including arthritic joints. A cachet of this tea would spice up a stew or curry as well if you don't have real ginger root around the next time you make one.  I have tried a number of other commercial ginger teas, but they are not gingery enough.  A great find.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These ginger drink teas are hard to find in the store and I was thrilled to find them (where else??) on Amazon.  They are a wonderful, warm treat on a cold day and are a great aid to digestion.  I find them a little too sweet but the strong ginger zing is definitely there, distinct and very enjoyable.  They are delicious and worth a try if you have not had them before.

review/text: Most herbal teas are great airfreshners but don't really taste of anything much.  Well this is the real thing, it's manufactured in Singapore and it is a lovely hot ginger drink with honey that will suit anyone who enjoys the tast of real ginger and finds tea boring.<br /><br />I couldn't get through the day without several cups of this.

review/summary: delicious ginger drink
review/text: I had a wonderfully strong ginger tea at a Thai restaurant lately, and wanted to find a similar product.  This is it - much stronger than traditional ginger tea, this drink has a no-nonsense ginger bite.  It has a bit too much sweetening for my tastes, so I cut that by adding more water than recommended. The ginger taste is still strong.  I have found this tea in Asian supermarkets as well as on Amazon.

review/summary: Good ginger tea with a little kick
review/text: I tried three different brands of ginger tea and I think this one is the best. This is not in a sachet. Ginger is dried into granules (way better) and mixed with a sweetener like cane sugar or honey. This brand brews dark which is the way I like it. The other brands were light in color but they tasted okay. This one is closer to the brand I used to buy in China, but the Chinese brand was much stronger. I like to drink this during the flu and cold seasons and when I've had a heavy meal and need to settle my stomach before bedtime. This is the kind of tea you will either love or hate. I love it! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the cane sugar which I do not use. I prefer liquid sugar or sugar in the raw. Otherwise, this is a great drink.

I found these and they worked great.

Overall, I still think it was a cost savings and having only 2 bottles rather than a bunch of little ones is great for the pantry.

review/text: I'm addicted to sprinkles. They tend to be very expensive at the grocery stores, so I decided to try this kind. I received the product in timely manner and well packed. However they don't taste like the kind your would get from a Yogurt place or grocery store. The sprinkles do taste fresh, but they are too sweet and it overpowers the ice cream/yogurt taste. If you don't really care much about how sweet they are, then go for this kind. On the other hand, the chocolate sprinkles from this company do taste much better than this rainbow kind.

review/summary: Gets old Fast
review/text: I bought two flavors of these snack bars and ended up giving them both dirty looks. Of the two, the Cookies and Cream was the better flavor (Chocolate Toffee Nut) was the other flavor. Unfortunately I bought the multi-pack of these and it has gone to waste. I think my husband and I each ate one or two.<br /><br />They suffer from the same texture issues as most nutrition bars. What really makes them worthless is that they are snack sized, meaning tiny. We follow the Belly Fat Cure plan and you have to sacrifice one serving (of 6 for the day) of carbs for these snack bars. Darn it, I don't waste a serving of carbs on something that doesn't taste good!<br /><br />In addition, being small, they don't really hold me over for any real activity. Yes there are 5g of Protein per bar, but there's no satisfied feeling afterward, if I can even make it past the texture to try and eat the whole thing.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Chocolate-Dipped Nuts meal replacement bar (also by thinkThin) is very enjoyable, tastes and feels like actual food and is still only one carb serving under the Belly Fat Cure, so I would recommend that instead.

review/text: I have been getting these delivered for the past 6-8 months but have had to return 50-60% of the deliveries.  They get dropped off on my porch in the morning and sit in the sun.  Once they melt they don't taste so great.  Place your order in the winter when it is not sunny out.  Be sure to think about this before you order.  I just cancelled my subscription because it is such a waste.  Amazon has been great about replacing them, but there doesn't seem to be a solution for me.<br />The bars are great though and I would recommend buying them (in the winter of course).

Out of the hundreds of sample bars I brought home he picked this one and tried it without me even knowing. Maybe the cheetah on the front?  Anyway, He loved it and it has become his favorite nutrition bar!  (His old favorite nutrition bar was Balance Bar's Cookie Dough.)<br /><br />He still loves these bars best even though he tried the two other flavors. I just put them on subscription so I'll have plenty in the house for him and the hockey team.

review/summary: Tastes like homemade oatmeal!
review/text: I chose to purchase Plum Organics Oatmeal baby cereal as a part of my daughter's first foods. I really liked that this brand is independently certified as organic and along with the standard added viatmins that all infant cereals have, it also has both PREBIOTICS AND PROBOIOTICS, which are proven to assist in better digestion and overall GI health. I mixed her serving with breastmilk and the consistancy is soft and fluffy. It doesn't have a weird grey color that other brands have, nor does it have a weird aftertaste either (I always taste whatever I feed my dauther first). This infant oatmeal cereal tastes and smells like real oatmeal, minus the added sugars. While it costs more than the standard brands, I feel it's well worth the money for the high quality and taste your child will get.<br /><br />My daughter took to this oatmeal right away and it really made feeding her a breeze. She is now 7 months old and she still eats this for breakfast regularly, along with some fresh fruits. While I mainly feed her homemade food, I have no qualms about feeding her this brand of oatmeal and neither should you. She has never had an allergic reaction nor has she had any digestive problems afterwards, which I feel is due to the added PRE/PROBIOTICS. So, if you are looking for a healthy, organic oatmeal cereal option for your baby, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the Plum Organics brand. It's a great way to start your child on the right path to eating healthy and tasty first foods!<br /><br />*Amazon has the BEST prices for bulk purchasing this item!*

It makes a fiber snack actually enjoyable.  German food regulations also severely limit the use of pesticides which is NOT the case for U.S. regulations.  Don't worry about it going stale and soggy as the mylar packaging keeps it fresh until it is gone. The package shelf life is longer than it will be in your home!  Enjoy.

review/text: I also was buying this at HEB, but they reworked the cereal aisle and the #2 vanished. They still carry other numbers, but this is the one we like. I don't avoid wheat, but I like the grains this one features instead. Don't hesitate to buy the case. As all Seitenbachers, it's in sealed foil bags. If you like it well enough to order the case, you won't have to worry about shelf life. They don't skimp on the dried berries, either. Shake it up, though. The raspberries, being large and light, tend to float to the top of the package. Otherwise, the predominate notes are dried apples and oats.

review/summary: The best way to start your day
review/text: I've had more traditional Muesli and been disappointed, but here you get something a little more appealing to the masses (or those with a bit of a sweet tooth).  You get great taste, variety of textures, and you have the feeling that you did something good for yourself.  The only complaint I'd make is that despite being good for you, the sugar in the fruits add up quickly so make sure you have correct serving sizes.  For some the amount of fruit in it may come as a detractor, but as noted for me this is perfect. As for the 6 pack size these come in, it seems like a huge amount, but if you enjoy them at all they'll go rather quickly.  The good part too with this is that you can have them in the morning, evening, and well they're even great to add to yogurt so there you go, a great tasting Muesli that'll brighten your day.

review/summary: These are good!
review/text: Looked all over the web for these, and even went to two local stores before I remembered Amazon.  Sure enough, there they were.  I wanted these for my gum machine at home, and the gumballs you can buy for that purpose are really gross.  These have the good flavors I like, Cinnamon, spearmint, banana, and two others that I can't identify, but are good.  Thanks Amazon.com!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Cup Heretic
review/text: Lurking in the shadows of the Hershey's kingdom... fomenting a dark, sweet & salty revolution and spreading their rich vision of deliciousness across the land - these are off the heezy fo' sheezy.  Even though I bought a whole box I still feel possessive of them and tend to lash out viciously at anybody who even looks in their direction.  Some may feel that darker chocolate does not work as well as milk chocolate for a peanut butter cup.  They would be wrong.  Some may argue melting points, ratios, sugar/fat content and the like, but they can kindly shut it - for this is the ultimate in mass produced chocolate/peanut butter cups.<br /><br />You're not allowed to order any... AT ALL because I can't spare a single cup.  Not one.  They're all mine.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  Thank you!  Go back to your ongoing, intermittent perusal of the internet.  Yes, Virginia you can't have one.  It's not you, it's the peanut butter cup.  The dark chocolate's in the mail and I promise not to melt in your mouth.  I think I'll have another one.

review/text: If you like dark chocolate, these Reeses Peanut Butter Dark Cups are very good!  Since they are almost impossible to find in stores, it's great that Amazon offers them at a reasonable price.  However, BEWARE the weather conditions at the time you place your order.  The first package I received was completely melted in shipping (a disaster).  Amazon should put a warning or else restrict shipping times/locations based on seasonal temperatures.

review/summary: Now THIS is how I remember Reese's peanut butter cups!!
review/text: When I was a kid, I'd enjoy Reese's peanut butter cups as a tasty treat. The flavors were very memorable.<br /><br />I'd stopped eating them for several years. When I tried the "standard" RPBC's after a long absence I was shocked at how awful they tasted (was it "mockolate" - fake chocolate?). They didn't taste much like how I remembered at all. So I stopped eating them again.<br /><br />Then, I saw this version - made with dark chocolate. And guess what? They are the RPBC's I remembered!! The flavor was THERE. With the dark chocolate, you can really taste the separate chocolate and peanut butter flavor. With the "standard" / milk version, you can't discern the chocolate flavor at all. Those taste more like you're eating something resembling peanut butter and an oil mix. Awful.<br /><br />But these are great! I hope they are permanently available. If so, I will indulge in RPBC's once again!

review/summary: Fabulous Dark Reeses Cups!
review/text: I've only been able to find dark chocolate Reeses cups in single serve packs at stores.  Apparently they are not sold in larger packs.  So, buying the single serve packs in bulk was the next best thing.  The price was very reasonable (came out to about 59 cents per pack) and they arrived within two days of placing my order. Shipping was only 1.99--a great deal. I love the regular Reeses cups but the dark chocolate ones are so much better! If you enjoy dark chocolate, try these out.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Chocolate / Peanut Butter Heaven
review/text: You can't get these babies many places anymore, but at least Amazon.com (and its external partners) still offer them.<br /><br />I always loved Reese's PB cups, but they were just a TAD too sweet.  When I found they also made the Dark Chocolate version, I jumped up and clicked my heels in delight.  Wal-Mart carried them for a while, but then stopped, and I gnashed my teeth at not having bought a freight-train's worth of them when I had the chance.<br /><br />Then I remembered Amazon.com -- and lo and behold, they had the things for sale.<br /><br />It's this kind of comprehensive product coverage that makes me salute the company.<br /><br />Now I'm sitting, grinning, with a whole box of the luscious desserts in front of me.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon, and Reeses!

review/summary: absolutely perfect!
review/text: I ordered a box of these on a whim when they were a Goldbox special a few days ago. The UPS guy delivered them an hour ago and I just got done eating 2 perfect pieces of perfection! The dark chocolate is excellent- a perfect complement to the peanut butter filling. Not too sweet, but not bitter or waxy like so many mass market dark chocolates can be. These are delicious and a must have if you favor the dark side like I do! Milk chocolate tends to be too sickly sweet for me although I enjoyed having a standard PBC on occasion. Now I fear I am spoiled forever and will no longer settle for the milk chocolate pbc. The biggest problem I face now is how to be an adult and not eat multiple packs at one sitting. I only pray Amazon keeps carrying these!

I will only eat it if its on some buffet and it looks fresh, a coworker of mine that will remain nameless always calls it "Admiral Chos" and we laugh at her everytime. ANYWAY, I was making stir fry over rice and needed a new taste and decided to try this bottle of Iron Chef, I mean how could Morimoto steer me wrong? It was actually a good blend of spicy and sweet, it blended well with the chicken and cabbage and onions. I did not make the traditional fried Tso's because lets face it, fried things are bad for you. I cant wait to try the other "flavors" of Iron Chef sauces!!

review/text: This is by far the best dog food I have ever used. My dachshund has one of those "rare" coat colors, the product of a gene mutation, which results in short, very fine hair, no undercoat, and occasional bouts of hair loss (when not on the proper diet, apparently.) I had tried a number of foods, both economical and higher end, and not one really seemed to work well, as he also has a weakened immune system and digestive issues. I found this product in my local health food store and decided to try it. It didn't take long before his coat was shiny and practically lush! Its the only food I have tried that has done that. Its easily digestible (they also make one with fewer ingredients that i have since discovered that is great for dogs with allergies) and doesn't leave him lethargic the way some brands did. Its worth every penny.
