review/summary: This Hot Chocolate's the Real Deal
review/text: Whenever a sugar-free item is reviewed, there's typically one or more persons who complain that the item tastes "fake", "metallic" or something else unpleasant. However, perhaps to the consternation of sugar-eating folks,  people who confine themselves to sugar-free foods typically reject the taste of real, sugary items. Just ask anyone who lives on Diet Cokes, if they wish they could replace their soda with a real one. To most of us, the real stuff doesn't taste nearly as good and IT tastes funny. Really! With that said, I don't know if you can ever recommend a sugar-free item to EVERYone, but, of ANY sugar-free product I've ever had -- and there've been hundreds -- I can't imagine a more universally-appealing, sugar-free item. This stuff is just fabulous. It's richly decadent and, because of the chunks, fun to eat/drink. There's simply no comparison between this, on the one hand, and the Swiss Miss and Carnation drinks, on the other. Keep in mind it's clearly dark rather than milk chocolate. The manufacturer recommends making it with milk, but for sugar-free enthusiasts, the high-sugar load of milk itself would seem to negate the premise. I can tell you that I started making it with fat-free half & half (which has a lower sugar content) and, with each new tasting, replaced a portion of the half & half with tap water. Now, I just use a splash of fat-free half & half and the rest water...and it's still terrific. And, btw, I've found it delectable even mixing in less of the product than recommended. Expermient. Now, if we could only get a less-expensive version.

review/text: I have to admit, this is probably one of the best sugar free hot chocolate's I've ever tried.  That said, it's an adequate replacement for the real thing at best.  I usually drink a BIG mug with 2 packets, so I'll probably use one packet and some of this.  However for over $10 a can I'm NOT impressed!!!  Totally not worth it!!!!!

review/summary: Great product!  Ignore the bad reviews...
review/text: I have no idea how anyone could give this product 1 Star.  They either work for a competitor or don't want a dark chocolate product, because this is the best dark hot chocolate product I have ever tasted, sugar free or not.  The chunks of chocolate are great and it tastes better than every powdered hot cocoa I've used before, including Godiva.<br /><br />For those trying to maintain a low glycemic/sugar diet, try with Hood's Calorie Countdown dairy product instead of some combination of water and half & half or milk.  Never drank this milk substitute without the chocolate, so can't recommend that.

review/text: After checking out the reviews, I decided to try King's Cupboard sugar-free hot chocolate. Although it was only available in a 3 pack of 8 ounce cans (and was over $35) the reviews made it look like a good deal.<br /><br />Hardly.<br /><br />Following the directions, and using filtered water, made for a completely undrinkable cup of hot chocolate. I tried milk, cream, a mix of water and cream, and even added sugar to see if it helped. The mix remained metallic tasting, and completely undrinkable.

review/text: I've purchase this product twice. I use it to make rice. The quality is consistent and that it is organic, makes it even more appealing. The only problem I've had is with the packaging; about one third of the time when I pull the aluminum tab to open the container, the tab breaks off without opening it. It's a minor inconvenience though because one can simply cut it open with a pairing knife.

review/summary: Green Color Mist for a Green Alien Party
review/text: I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.<br /><br />I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys!

review/text: I looked everwhere to change my daughter's birthday cake frosting black when the frosting was white.  This product sprays on and says it will give it a black color.  I followed the instructions perfectly and it gave it a grayish color only if you sprayed a bunch on.  The smell was awful and it looked awful.  Realizing it wasn't going to work I stopped and tried to scrape it off.  The entire cake absorbed the flavor - it was horrible and the cake ended up in the garbage.

review/summary: Surprisingly good, white chocolate taste, not too sweet
review/text: I've never had PB & Co before, as the price for this PB is not affordable for any flavor they make.  I finally decided the White chocolate version would be worth trying and having as a luxury item because it can be used in so many ways other than the typical PB.<br /><br />For those who love White Chocolate but are frustrated by the endless claims of white chocolate that turn out to be dreadful vanilla flavored or other odd, super sweet flavors, this has a truly white chocolate flavor.  It has the lightweight, creamy white chocolate flavor rather than the super sweet, heavy, not creamy flavor that some companies call WC but either isn't WC or it's a poor quality.<br /><br />Great on any breakfast bread, PBJ sandwhiches, PB pie was amazing, and dunking bunny shaped marshmallows in warm WCPB on easter was delicious and not too sweet - but so good you didn't need a whole lot.  Having 3 or 4 little bunny m-mallows in this, slightly warmed was enough to get a sweet fix without it being a huge dessert portion.

review/text: Ordered this & the dark chocolate PB @ the same time, to compare & contrast. I love straight peanut butter as a snack, when i need the extra calories. These are pb-based, but unique, i wouldn't classify them as real peanut butter. The White Chocolate has a much thicker consistency than the dark chocolate, similar to drier/thicker peanut butters. And the flavor is Amazing! I'm normally a huge dark chocolate fan and think white is chocolate okay... but this snack is unique and delicious on its own! =)

review/text: It was interesting and I used up the whole jar. I only used it to make a couple sandwiches. It's sweet on its own. So, it does not really go that well with jelly. I had one sandwich with butter instead and I liked that better. The rest I finished by getting a spoonful now and then as a quick snack.<br /><br />To me, it tastes like it is made with a lot of oil. Peanut butter is normally oily, but had a softer and oilier feel to it.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy it but I probably won't buy this flavor again. I might try their other types of peanut butter.

review/text: I cannot emphasize this enough: Ginger 'Gizer is a spicy drink. Any sweetness in it is overcome by its bite. If you like spicy drinks, this drink is for you.  It really does wake up a person. It tingled my tongue and my throat.  There is a thick quality to this drink.  Even though I shook the bottle up before opening, there was still some sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  An authentic ginger drink.  Pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: RIPOFF
review/text: Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item.<br />Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up with uneven done-ness. If you want best quality, your best bet would be to look for stem-free (caps only) variety even though they tend to cost more. From one gourmet chef to another, hope it helps.

review/summary: 11-month olds love it!
review/text: I love the idea of this because it's chock full of veggies, but when I saw it, I thought that there was no way our 11-month-old twins would like it because it's quite chunky. BUT, it is their absolute favorite! A great way to introduce texture to older babies, and it smells great, too. My only complaint is the packaging - it's a real mess to squeeze it out the top of the package. But this is a real favorite in our house.

My baby doesn't like ANY of them except for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BUSCQ">Peach Pumpkin Pie with Graham</a> one. I have tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BOZNE">Curried Red Lentils and Glazed Carrots with Jasmine Rice</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BSZTY">Minestrone with Beans and Greens</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BQXDE">Black Beans and Sweet Corn with Greens and Wild Rice</a>. She tolerates the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044BOZMU">Multi-Grain Cereal with Fruits and Berries</a> but she doesn't love it. I got the multi-packs for all of these flavors and I wish I hadn't. I have tried giving it a couple week break in between and introducing them again but she still doesn't like them. We did the curried jasmine rice tonight and she only ate about 5 bites. She is 11 months old. I really wanted these to work out. The portion is generous, and the pouch is resealable, unlike other brands. There is nothing wrong with the quality, my baby just isn't into these at all.

review/summary: Fantastic option for the vegetarian baby (and carnivores, too!)
review/text: It's very difficult to find advanced baby food with protein and fat that is vegetarian.  Most vegetarian baby foods are simply pureed fruits and veggies whose textures are way too boring and whose nutritional content is way too low for a 10 month old and beyond.  While we try to make most of our baby's foods from scratch, as a working mom, this is not always practical.  Welcome the Sprout stage 3 foods.  These are AWESOME.  They smell and look and taste like real food that anyone would eat only a bit more mashed up than adult food though not pureed and smooth.  Our baby loves this minestrone with beans and greens.  Other favorites in our house are the butternut squash with mac and cheese (my husband wants to eat that one!) and the black beans and corn.  A bit more expensive than most baby food, but definitely worth it.  They're much better than the other, more commonly found, organic brand--Earth's Best.

Not sure but this one was not a hit! She disliked the lasagne too. We are sticking with the Holiday turkey, mac and cheese, and peach pumpkin pie. We have yet to try the chicken and vegetable, or the other turkey option but I would recommend this brand, just not the spicier meals.

review/summary: Cats wait at the door when a bag comes home.....
review/text: I've been feed grain-free for many years, back when Innova Evo seemed to be the only company available at the local pet food store (not big stores like Petsmart). I switched off Evo a few years ago when grain prices increased and never decreased... taking my normal $40/large bag to $44 to $46 and now $50. The knowledgeable owner recommended Taste of the Wild as comparable and much less expensive at $30/large bag. This is much more cost effective for us since we have four cats to feed.<br /><br />I periodically re-research the state of cat foods to check whether Taste of the Wild is still comparable to the best available brands and it's held steady among the more expensive brands for several years (Innova Evo, Orijen, Wellness Core, etc.) Recently, I did more research and found that wet food/raw frozen food/raw homemade food is the best option for healthy kitties, NOT any kind of dry processed food (although grain free is still better than other substandard brands). However, dry food is still the most convenient for early morning automatic feedings, short trips away from home, and having a backup supply.<br /><br />This food, both this and the other available flavor, has been fine for the cats. They think it's tasty, don't barf it up (only one cat has issues and it's from scarfing his food in two minutes flat, not the food itself), and it keeps their coats healthy. Their weight seems stable (although the two fat cats stay fat from stealing food and human leftovers), energy levels fine (for an animal that sleeps 16hrs/day), and they're not eating scary junk (which is what I now think of the Iams/Eukanuba they ate before I went grain-free). Handling the food isn't bad, it smells like cat food, but not overwhelmingly gross (some dry kibble can be strongly odorous). The price point is the best plus for me for a dry food.<br /><br />Regarding other posts about unhappy cats... GRADUALLY introduce a new food. If your animal notices that there's something different or just refuses to eat, you're probably doing it too fast.<br /><br />Also, I'm not that concerned about the ethoxyquin issue that someone else pointed out (that particular poster is also talking about dog food forums too). Many manufacturers claim that it gets eliminated from the high heat (heavy processing that makes dry food so much unhealthier for cats in general) and others claim that all non-human consumption "ocean fish" get treated with ethoxyquin under US law which dissipates over time, yadda yadda, etc. Basically, there's a lot of talk about it and not a whole lot of evidence that it has any provable effects on animals. Just about everything processed nowadays seems to cause cancer or other horrible things. The non-ethoxyquin foods still mislead consumers (farm fish instead of ocean fish, etc.) or just use human-grade fish, which makes it MUCH more expensive. If you're that concerned about getting the best food quality and absolute healthiest diet for your beloved pet, IMO, you shouldn't be using dry cat food at all.

review/summary: I buy only Taste of the Wild for my cats
review/text: I don't know whether she has a hereditary predisposition to a delicate digestive constitution or whether it was my daughters' Polly Pocket doll clothes, which she has twice ingested and for which she was twice treated by a veterinarian, but my eight-year old house cat vomits when she eats any cat food that contains cereal fillers. What a pain in the rear end! Front end, actually. As my cat's gastrointestinal challenges worsened, it took me a while to identify the source of the problem and then a while longer, through trial-and-error, to find a food she could eat and keep down. Finally, I found it: Taste of the Wild Dry Cat Food.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the key is the omission of cereal/corn fillers in the recipe, but I believe there probably is another reason, too. (I'd tell if I knew.) I'd tried other foods with no fillers before, but still had the same problem, although not quite as pronounced. Maybe it's the venison and/or the salmon, which could be more easily digested by cats than other proteins. I don't know. Whatever the reason, I buy only Taste of the Wild for my cat. We adopted another cat from the local shelter near the end of last year, a one-year old, and switched him from Iams (which the shelter uses) to Taste of the Wild. All good; almost six months later, he's flourishing.<br /><br />No, I'm not an employee, vendor, distributor, or any other person or entity related directly or indirectly to the manufacturer. The stuff is just really good.

Thats some strong food. He's only been on it for a week so we'll see how it progresses. Maybe his digestive system has to get used to it.

review/summary: Sensitive stomachs, picky eaters, and NO vomiting
review/text: After rescuing a kitten a few months ago, I now have 3 cats. Something is wrong with him, but the vets can't figure out what...all tests are negative yet he's losing hair and vomiting. My oldest cat had digestive problems from the start ... I had to force feed her digestive enzymes for almost 2 years just so she could get any nutrients since her body wasn't creating the necessary enzymes... she was 5 years old, very long and only 3.5 pounds! She kept eating and eating, but it just went straight through her in a not so pleasant way. She has been on non-prescription food and medication free for 3 years, but now she has been vomiting occasionally for months and has started getting scabby patches from allergies that just keep coming back.<br /><br />So between the two of them, I ended up with partially digested piles of science diet in all sorts of places in my house. Thank the heavens for hardwood floors. Wet food? Ha, not a chance it will stay down... and they even turn up their noses at treats these days.<br /><br />So they've only been on this food for a week (about 50/50 this food and old food)... all vomiting has stopped by all 3 cats, hair is regrowing, scabs are healing and everyone is eating. When switching food I expected there to be some extra vomiting... especially by my older female, but nope - not a single incident all week... all 3 adore it, they already have more energy, and seem to be doing well.<br /><br />I'm THRILLED that there is a grain free dry food formula... I looked into more appropriate diets (aka - not 60% carbs) several years ago, but I didn't have the time, patience, or schedule necessary to feed all wet food. So this is great.<br /><br />I will update after they've been on the food longer. Also - can't beat having food delivered to my door (up 3 flights of stairs) without paying shipping.

review/summary: Great price and my cat LOVES the flavor!
review/text: After my vet educated me on how bad the cat foods you buy at most pet stores and grocery stores are (because they're mostly full of grain = fillers), I decided that my cat deserved something better and healthier.  Plus, she needed to get rid of that extra 2-lb bulge around her tummy, :).<br /><br />I was looking into several different brands that my vet recommended, including Taste of the Wild, Orijen, and Before Grain.  Before taking the leap and buying one of them, I contacted each brand to see if they would provide me with some samples so I can see if my cat would like it (considering how pricey these brands are in comparison to what I was used to, I didn't want to commit to one brand blindly).  Taste of the Wild was the only company of the three that delivered and oh, did they deliver!  They gave me about 5 6oz trial bags of different flavors they had, which in my opinion, was an amazing amount for just samples.  My cat LOOOOVED the roasted venison and smoked salmon flavor.  She ate it like she would eat the treats I occassionally feed her.  This was definitely a great sign - it's healthy (42% protein) and she loves it!  Win win!  I couldn't be happier!

review/summary: Excellent and Healthy Diet for my Kitties
review/text: This is an amazing and affordable food. I work at a relatively small locally-owned pet food store, and I get nothing but praise for Taste of The Wild products--both the cat and dog food.<br /><br />I wanted to switch my cat over to a grain-free diet and it seemed she was just stuck on the artificial flavors of Purina...ew. Cats can be very stubborn when introducing a new food. I tried a couple different brands and they didn't take. When I switched to TOTW, she loved it right away. In a month, I was blown away. Her coat shines beautifully and glossy, and everyone comments on it when they see her. It's easy to forget what a good-quality food it is (high in protein) and feed too much. She's been gaining some weight. So, follow the feeding guidelines!<br /><br />I also buy the canned food. It is a little spendy, but I feed it to them once a week because it's very important! Think of it as "mouse-in-a-can." Cats originate from the desert cat, and they got their water from their kill. So, cats get most their water intake from what they eat--they do like flowing water, though. So, all in all, I give them one can a week to make sure they don't get dehydrated.<br /><br />I think there is only ONE downside to this food. A higher content of fish in a cat's diet will make their urine and feces a little more... potent. I found a really good product to help the litter box odor, though. Earth Friendly Products offers a "Kitty Litter Treatment" and it works great.<br /><br />I see so many animals that are on Taste of The Wild food and they look happy, shiny and healthy! I think it's a really wonderful and trusted brand and you should try it! (:

review/summary: "Brings Out The Wild" alright.
review/text: My cats are just over two years old. They will eat any cat food put in front of them, so that was not an issue. However, the stench was a real issue. Of all the dry foods I have ever fed my kids (or their predecessors) this was by far the worst on the other end. The smell was unbearable, had to switch after a one bag experiment. Smell went back to normal within a week or so of getting them off this stuff.

review/summary: good, balanced and reasonable
review/text: We tried several of the higher end foods including avoderm; science diet; neutro ; holistic; halo spot's; Proplan and finally discovered Taste of the Wild dry food which our cats took an instant liking to. One of our cats prefers wet food but we like to give them a daily diet of wet food and dry food and he wouldn't quite like any of the others or would vomit up some of the brands. But with Taste of the wild both our cats readily eat and digest it. Although they have more flavors for their dog food line ; between the two flavors for cats they like the roated venison and smoked salmon one better. I did buy a crate of the canned wet food from Taste of the Wild but the morsels are really big and look very processed ; our cats ended up licking up the gelatinous stuff and left the solid pieces behind. So we have for the past half a year stuck with the dry cat food from Tast of the Wild and Weruva for the wet food.

review/summary: Good Food, but check around for prices
review/text: The food is good, not full of fillers. My cat gobbles it up every time. The ingredient list shows a good list of things NOT full of crap:<br /><br />Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon, natural flavor, ocean fish meal, DL-methionine, potassium chloride, taurine, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, dried fermentation products of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), vitamin A supplement, biotin, potassium iodide, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />That pretty much sold me. Look around for prices though! They seem to vary a lot from online to store. Even on amazon, (as of 3.15.2011) it's cheaper to buy (3) 5 lb. bags for ~$10 ea. than buy one $15 lb. bag for close to $40.

review/summary: Great food at a good price
review/text: With five cats, buying premium cat food can get expen$ive, but we don't feel comfortable feeding our beloved friends anything less.  At least TOTW is the best priced of the premium, grain-free foods. Of course, a good price would mean nothing if the cats don't like it...yeah right, they literally face plant in the bowls when we put it out for them.<br /><br />Some people complain that the second ingredient listed is peas and not another meat ingredient.  Am I concerned?  Not really; the ordering of ingredients tells me little about how much chicken meal is present, only that there is more chicken than peas.  Lets look at two completely fake (and utterly unrealistic) scenarios to demonstrate this point:<br /><br />Cat Food #1 has 40% chicken meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br />Cat Food #2 has 20% chicken meal, 20% turkey meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br /><br />Although peas are the second ingredient listed for Cat Food #1, it has the same meat content as Cat Food #2, which lists meat as the first two ingredients.  Does TOTW have more or less meat that the other premium brands? I don't know, and I probably never will.<br /><br />Of course, all cats are different, and there can be problems any time you change diets.  Make a gradual change and watch closely for warning signs such as vomiting and changes in stool.

review/summary: New energy for 13 year old cat
review/text: Bootz started out life on grocery store cat foods - name brands. She developed kidney stones and had to experience some painful and costly treatment. Then she was on Purina Urinary tract health dry food, along with two other younger cats. One cat developed a tumor in her stomach. Poor baby, it took over and she had to be put out of her pain. Another younger cat developed kidney stones while on the urinary tract health dry food! He suffered horrible procedures to try and correct it, with the end result being having to end his pain. It was heartbreaking. Soooo good old Bootz got put on Science Diet SO and she ate it for over a year. Her skin was oily with some flaking but otherwise she seemed okay.<br />Now enter Taste of the Wild! Boots sniffed the new food option and walked away. Gradually she ate more and more of it and less and less of the Science Diet. It only took her a few days to transition completely to the Taste of The Wild. Now 5 weeks later, it seems we have a new cat! She is talkative and playful and her skin and coat are as beautiful as a one year old cat. I can tell that she feels better!<br />Why are so many of the pet food companies putting junk into our beloved pets? No one wants their fur babies to be sick!<br />I highly recommend purchasing this food. Put it next to their current food and give the pet the option. I am soooooo happy that I did. My 13 year old cat is acting more like a young cat. She is so appreciative of her improved health. Maybe it isn't your pet that is unhealthy - maybe it is their food that is unhealthy....

review/summary: IMPORTANT INFO: DIAMOND PET FOOD RECALL
review/text: IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING "TASTE OF THE WILD" CAT FOOD, IT MAY BE PART OF THE CURRENT RECALL BY DIAMOND PET FOOD FOR SALMONELLA POISONING IN PETS AND PEOPLE HANDLING THE FOOD.<br /><br />"Taste of the Wild" cat food is made by Diamond Pet Food, a manufacturer who is associated with previous recalls. Their current pet food recall now also includes "Taste of the Wild" CAT FOOD with production numbers in addition than those currently shown on their website. I called them today after reading the news stories about the large dog food recall and learning that "Taste of the Wild" is one of their brands. I was horrified when the customer service rep told me my cat food bag was indeed part of the recall.  This is the link to their recall website (although the recall information currently on there today is incomplete): [...]  Also, the Diamond Pet Food recall telephone number is (866)918-8756.<br /><br />FYI, my cat has had bloody diarrhea/stools for a couple of weeks now and is currently taking a 2nd round of medicine prescribed by my vet because the 1st round was ineffective. A couple of nights ago, the sound of my cat vomiting woke me up.  He threw up approximately 8-10 times over approximately 2 hours - very unusual for him. I now suspect that both of these issues may have been caused by the "Taste of the Wild" cat food. Thank goodness the recall occurred before he got any worse as pet deaths are being reported.<br /><br />If I had only realized "Taste of the Wild" was made by Diamond Pet Food, I would have never bought the stuff. Ironically, I switched to this food two months ago because I wanted a healthier food for my cats.  My cats like it, but it is not worth the risk.

review/text: I have two cats, one is overweight and the other one is definitely a senior cat.  She was not doing well couldn't keep any food down and I switched to this mainly because I thought I was losing my one one cat due to old age and my other one needs to go on a diet.  So now my overweight cat is eating less (yay) and my other cat is eating again and began to walk around again she's still wobbly but she's still hanging on!)<br /><br />as for price if you have a smart phone and use the amazon app you can price the cat food and that's exactly what I did I was able to also read the reviews which proved beneficial as well.  I was able to double check prices which it was cheaper at rural king and read the reviews.  so once again a win win situation.  Just so glad that both my cats are doing well and as for the poop smell my cat's poop smelled anyways so that didn't change for me but i will update once they've been on this longer.

review/summary: Cats love it, least expensive grain-free dry food
review/text: My cats love the Taste of the Wild dry food. They aren't thrilled with the canned version, but they'll go nuts over the dry. If I don't carefully put the bag out of reach, they will try to chew through it to get at the food. It is usually a good deal cheaper than comparable formulas. I did a price comparison of dry foods a while ago, and this one was the least expensive grain-free dry food I could find.<br /><br />My cats do well on it, but it is just a part of their diet and not their exclusive food. I feed them wet food twice daily, and then leave portions of the dry food out while I'm at work or sleeping so they have something to snack on. The small round kibble size also fits perfectly into the treat balls I have and they love to roll those around in the basement at night. I usually mix it with a high fiber calorie-reduced food because it is very rich and my oldest needs some more fiber in his diet to prevent constipation issues. I've learned the hard way that feeding him only grain-free food will cause him to gain weight and become constipated. This brand works better than others though and they all do very well on the mix. I would not recommend feeding exclusively dry food though, but if you do feed some then this one seems like a good choice to try.<br /><br />One thing to note is that even though it claims to be Roasted Venison & Smoked Salmon, it actually is chicken-based and contains fish meal and some plant proteins. This might be important for cats with certain protein allergies. The top six ingredients are: Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), pea protein, and potato protein. So it really is a "chicken, peas and potatoes" formula.

review/summary: Very Impressed!
review/text: I could not believe how fast this product got to me!  They are certainly on top of things over there.  I opened the box and set the bag in the forier.  My cat started acting strange wanting to go outside all of the sudden, then wanting back in, then inspecting the baby stroller (also in the forier).  I didn't put it together until he honed in on the bag and started going crazy.  I was trying to get him to finish his last two bowls of his old food before I opened the new stuff, but from the time he smelled this new food he went on a hunger strike from his old food.  My cat is typically VERY laid back so this was all hilarious to me. After a few hours of him scratching at the bag and refusing his other food, I finally just mixed the last two bowls in and gave him the new Taste of the Wild food.  He inhaled it!  He LOVES this stuff.  I have only had it for a week or so, so I haven't had it long enough to see if it improves his skin and coat, but even if it doesn't, I prefer it to his old food that certainly didnt.  So far, no complaints at all!!!

review/text: When my kitten started on regular food, I bought all the expensive stuff.  The cat was vomiting, and her coat was full of loose hair and dander no matter how much I brushed her.  I gave her tubes of oils and gels without any relief.  I started to do some research on causes of these conditions, and it turns out that simply put.... Cat's need protein and almost all these big name pet foods, and specialty pet foods were mostly corn and fillers.  A little "Mom and Pop" pet store first showed me this product, and within 3 days you could see remarkable improvement in her coat.  She stopped throwing up almost within 24 hours, and now she is the fluffiest softest little thing in the world.  She has so much energy, and just loves the taste.  She camps out by the bowl when feeding time approaches.  I think these other pet food companies should start doing the right thing.  I was actually very surprised how reasonable the cost was considering the ingredients.  Please,....if you love your pet, you need to do the right thing and give them a quality food like this one.

review/summary: Good cat food for a decent price
review/text: While trying to help my previous kids through their medical issues, my son brought home various samples of grain-free cat chows from the pet store he managed (not one of the bigger chains - more of a local pet store).  It was a close toss-up between NOW and Taste of the Wild.  Although NOW was lower in protein, both were well-received.  Being that Taste of the Wild was a little less expensive and more readily available, this was chosen.  Since then several kitties were adopted from a shelter (two 4-month old kittens and two 4-year old sisters) and I took on my son's cat as well.  One older cat (11 year) remains from the original brood and she has also transitioned easily to this food.<br /><br />The shelter kitties came with Hill's kitten and adult food... after a few days I added this chow to the Hill's, no problems.  I even left one bowl with just Taste of the Wild and found the kittens even liked it (had to periodically hide the kitten chow as the big boy was chowing it and doesn't need to eat this stuff!)  I mixed the last of the adult Hill's with more of the ToW and once that is gone, were going cold turkey (or is that venison/salmon?).  I plan to give the second bag of Hill's chow back to the shelter for their use.  The AAFCO statement on the ToW indicates it is approved for all life-stages, so everyone will be eating just this brand of chow soon!  Shipping time was great, arrived before the estimated delivery date.<br /><br />Anyone concerned about the ethoxyquin comments, see [...]<br />Yes, we should be aware of bad things in all foods, beverages, etc, but if we worry about every little thing in our food and theirs, we'd stop eating.  Just breathing air is bad for us all, yet we continue to do it... There are many things MANY people eat that are "safe" yet extremely bad for you health-wise.  Also, just because someone tells you it's not in their food, unless you are a scientist who can analyze the food, remember you can't believe everything you're told/sold - if you do, I have a bridge in Manhattan for sale... ;-) Just my take on this.

review/summary: More "filling" for your cat, so a bag lasts a long time!
review/text: A friend told me about Taste of the Wild dry food that he fed to his dog.  I started researching cat food online and grain-free made sense to me since a cat's natural diet would mostly be rodents and birds.  I was hesitant to try Taste of the Wild because it is more expensive than the grain-based food I had been buying at the grocery store; however, I have found that this food lasts a very long time. The same way that a "meat and potatoes" dinner is filling for humans, it is filling to your cat.  Four of these 15lb bags last about one year for two average sized cats (8 lb spayed female and 9.5 lb neutered male) letting them eat as much as they please.  I use a gravity feeder very similar to this one:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7DFIM">Petmate Le Bistro Pet Feeder, 2-Pound Capacity, Bleached Linen</a>.

His fur is SO soft, and he doesn't shed that much, which is great because he has long hair.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend!

review/summary: making my master chubby I mean fluffy...lol
review/text: have been feeding my cat this for over a month now and he never vomited at all. He loves this food and would always start meowing whenever he hears me opening the bag. The cat never had any eating problems, poops are normal, and the coat is shinny and fluffy. I would say this is a really good cat food, pretty decent on the price too for a large bag; will probably last my cat around 3 month based on the amount he has eaten so far.

review/summary: Cat almost died
review/text: Switched to this food and several of my cats had the runs.. after a month on this food, my 12 year old cat ended up at the vet's and they couldn't find anything wrong in the  metabolic tests or any other tests but he clearly had lost much weight and was shutting down physically. almost 300 dollars later and having him almost die, i switched back to katz'n flocken. he's now on the mend and his poop is showing form again.<br /><br />I think there's something potentially dangerous with this food.

review/summary: One of the Best Bars in Raw Foods
review/text: Raw Revolution makes high quality products already, but these "organic greens" bars are fantastic and a cut above the rest.  All three flavors are spectacular but I chose the apple-cinnamon because I want to get my 3-year old nephews into raw foods and figured they'd like this flavor best.  chlorella, spirulina, barley grass and more...and best of all, no nuts!

review/summary: guilt free energy food!
review/text: I travel alot & sometimes before the gym need something to give me a boost!  coconut is the best oil & these are sugar free ofcourse!!  also very good for the golf bag when flagging on that 14th hole!  I think you have to use them as a meal as the calorie content is high!  but they are delicious & satisfy that sweet & chewy craving!  try them!

review/summary: Tastes delicious without relying on chocolate for flavor!
review/text: I love chocolate as much as anyone, but sometimes I get tired of raw bars that taste like raw candy bars. Too many raw bars have chocolate\cacao in them. If you go raw 100% for an extended period of time, you may find that you can no longer tolerate the adrenal gushers produced by the cacao. I also like a variety of flavors to choose from to prevent raw food boredom and I love this apple cinnamon bar (as well as the tropical banana). I like a raw bar that tastes like the real food that it is. I don't want everything I eat to taste like a raw kid's candy bar. So in that regard I'd call this an "adult" raw bar that is delicious!

review/summary: good taste
review/text: The bars had a good flavor but I didn't like the texture. I would have liked more crunch. The other thing that is a problem for me is they contain wheat grass and I am sensitive to wheat so I have had to pass them on to other friends.  My husband likes them and appreciates being able to get the good greens in a pleasant way.

review/summary: great GF healthy snack
review/text: These bars aren't as heavy as the chocolate Raw Revolution bars, but are definitely tasty, and not too sweet.  They aren't as filling as the chocolate bars.  I think it's because these bars have half the protein that you'll find in the chocolate bars. That said, it's a great gluten free snack to keep in the desk at work.

review/summary: Product is stale (very hard and dry)
review/text: Suspect product has been re-packaged - instead of 12 6oz boxes, I received 12 7.8oz boxes - which would be fine except all of this candy appears to be old (because it's very hard and dry).  Also, all of the batch identification information has been rubbed off all of the individual boxes, so there is no way to confirm the date it was made with the manufacturer.

review/summary: jujyfruits pack of 12
review/text: i opened the packages in put the candy in plastic bottles. anyway, i still have some left over because the kids like a variety of candy. chocolate being the favorite, and next the fruit snacks. but i keep the rest by my bed and at night if i have dry throat or even a sore throat, i take a few of these. the taste was good just like the old days. price was good as well because it was all delivered.
