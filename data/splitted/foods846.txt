review/text: Since I have started drinking Black Tiger each morning, everything else just disappoints me.  Black Tiger is bold, which I like, but it also has the flavor that lasts all the way to the end of the cup.  It is really one of those blends that stand the test of time for me.

review/text: You may be wondering what is disappointing about a four star coffee.... This is a better than average brew, reasonably strong while not bitter (so no robusto beans), but the flavour, if "intense," it is not particularly rich. If you love Timothy's Rainforest Espresso & Parisian Nights, this coffee is not in the same league. It is similar to Green Mountain's bold roasts.

Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one.

review/text: I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy, what mistake-- it was VERY bitter and I was stuck with two boxes of it!  If you like your coffee with a bite then go for it.  This is bitter even at the mug setting. If you like your coffee smooth avoid this like the plague! After two months of trying to use this up, I'm finally finished with it. I was the only one in my family that would go near it-- it was like swallowing a bitter pill every day.  Never again! I thought I should warn those out there from being swayed by bitter-coffee lovers.<br />David

I've since ordered him the Timothy's Columbian and he likes it even better - a bit smoother and more mellow taste, but not weak.  My preferences lean toward flavored blends.

review/text: I drink my coffee black and prefer the bolder, stronger k-cups.  I don't like the french roasts or the other dark roasts, but I do like my coffee strong.  After having tried many different extra bolds, Coffee People's Black Tiger and Gloria Jean's Black Gold have become my favorites.  I alternate between the two of them and sprinkle in Green Mountain's Sumatran Reserve now and then which is also very good.

Tastes differ so if you like a strong, dark coffee, try it - it may be just the one for you.

review/summary: Yeah !!
review/text: *THIS* is the stuff right here!<br /><br />I had been going through a ton of K-CUP varieties trying to find a really good, strong coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee-snob and most of the K-CUPs I tried just left me saying "Meh... It's 'ok'. Not terrible, not great just 'ok'."<br /><br />Even the K-CUPs marked 'extra-bold' left me wondering who decided this coffee was even deserving of the name "slightly bold", let alone "extra bold". I usually found myself using 2 K-CUPS, and running the small cup size twice just to get 1 decent cup of coffee - and even then the flavor just wasn't quite "there" (to me, they always taste "old", as if someone ground halfway-decent beans but then left it out open and exposed to the air overnight to spoil.)<br /><br />.. and then I picked up some Black Tiger.. Yeah!!! This is the *only* K-CUP I've found so far where I can choose the 12 oz brewing size and still get decent cup of coffee that doesn't taste like someone rinsed out my cup and served me hot water instead of coffee.<br /><br />Now even as such, this coffee is *still* not nearly as good as the cup of coffee that I can get with my good old french press using coffee that was roasted 2 days ago and ground 2 minutes ago. Sorry, ain't no way a K-CUP is going to get you that level of coffee. Ever.<br /><br />However, this variety is still darn good for a K-CUP and definitely deserving of my morning cup of coffee! (coming from me, that's saying *alot*!)

I've just found that it's not to my personal taste; I don't like dark roasts as much as mediums, such as another flavor by Coffee People called Donut Shop. This is because the dark roast flavor overpowers the cream I use, while the Donut Shop is a good balance that I will gladly have every day.<br /><br />Don't let that discourage you: if you like dark roasts, this one may yet become one of your favorites.

review/text: This is probably the best coffee made for the Keurig single serve brewer. Bold statement, I know, but this is one bold coffee that stands apart from the mediocre "Green Mountain" blends that Keurig offers. This is a strong, in your face, wake you up, no holds barred coffee that I wish they made available in whole bean bags (or even pre-ground, it's that good) just so I could take it with me for when I didn't have my Keurig. The only downside is that it can get a little expensive, especially with how addictive it is to drink.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this coffee for anybody that like to flower up their morning brew with sugar, cream, sweeteners, or heaven forbid those awful flavored creamers.<br /><br />If you like good coffee, drink this and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Written while sipping a cup of Black Tiger coffee.

review/text: This coffee is a great, strong blend that simply tastes great. Amazon has this at just the right price (~60�/k-cup). I can honestly say that I will never buy a k-cup again that is not made by Coffee People. Absolutely thrilled with my purchase. For an idea of how this tastes, it's in between Dunkin and StarBucks, leaning much more toward StarBucks.

review/summary: Must have Black Tiger!
review/text: A lot of K-cups say they are strong. I've tried many - Emeril, REVV, GM French Roast, etc. Many have a weird side taste or are bitter.<br /><br />Not Black Tiger! It is strong and smooth and my go-to when I need the caffeine kick-in-the-pants. I hope they never stop making this product.

review/summary: Harsh
review/text: This coffee is burnt tasting.  Like burnt toast.  The burnt taste overpowers the other flavors that may be there.  Not much coffee flavor detectable, reminds me of and old fashioned large percolator, after several hours, only more burnt tasting.  I have not had this problem with any other K-cups.  This one, Black Tiger, stands out as the worst tasting.  Adding milk added will not mask the overwhelming sour, bitter and chalky flavors.  I have tried it several times over the past 2 years, so I think I have sampled a few representative "batches."  My wife, who prefers the darkest roasted coffees, consistently complains about the taste, and drinks it only as a last resort.  She drinks a lot of coffee, and I see her point.<br /><br />Try any other brand, Donut Shop, Dark Magic, French Roast, any other brand is much more drinkable.  Maybe some folks appreciate the burnt taste.  If you like the taste of burnt toast, then you might like "Black Tiger."

I tried a few of their Bold Coffees, but when I found the XBOLD - Black Tiger, I stopped looking further. And I was much better off buying through Amazon as the price was better than retail or via Keurig.

review/text: I bought this coffee for my son who loves his coffee stronger than I do and he loves it.  He said the flavor was very good and I will be buying more.  After he uses one of these bold black tiger k-cups he leaves it for me and I use it a second time and it is very good for me and not as strong which I like so this has worked out for both of us.  Would definitly buy more and recommend if you like your coffee more on the strong side but not bitter.

review/text: Those of us who must limit sodium intake tend to be desperate for palatable low-sodium seasonings and grateful when we find them. BaconSalt has leapt way beyond merely "palatable," however, and brought new seasoning products to market that can make salt-hungry, bacon-deprived deprived folk like us absolutely giggle with delight. When we first learned about BaconSalt, we bought one of each flavor (the basics on Amazon, some special ones on the company website), plus extras for gifts. We sent a half-price gift package to loved ones at an APO address (as of this writing, the company actually gives military buyers/recipients a 50% discount -- imagine that!). We have no interest in the company, BTW ... we're just happy consumers grateful to find that we needn't abandon the savory flavors of bacon in the pursuit of good health.

review/text: I heard about this salt on a forum a while back. Many people said it was the real thing. So I ordered it from Amazon. It was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy. I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta. The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing. I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer. That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt and MSG...  I found the peppered bacon salt no better than the natural flavor.  Just add some pepper to your food..  it is better than this

review/summary: My favorite cider
review/text: I've been buying this cider for awhile now and I have to say, it's really good.  I went out looking for a better cider, so I ordered the Mott's Cider variety pack here on Amazon.  After having the Mott's, I have to say, it wasn't a hard decision to come back to Alpine.<br /><br />If you're interested, Alpine makes this cider in a non-sugar formula, but I haven't tried it since I'd rather have a natural sweetener.  These packets are 80 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you're interested in the Mott's, I wrote a review so you can check that out, but basically all I said was this.  Alpine is stronger per packet and has better flavor.  Mott's has an interesting variety of flavors, but truly, all I want is a good cider, so the Alpine is a much better fit for me.  Oh yeah, Mott's also uses corn syrup solids in their cider.<br /><br />If you want to flavor your cider, you can look in the coffee isle at your grocery store for the syrups used to flavor coffee.  You can pick up a bottle of caramel flavoring for a couple dollars and it mixes really well in the cider.  The ones I've seen are cane sugar based so they'll also sweeten up your drink a bit more too.

review/summary: Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice
review/text: Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend.  Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't.  It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background.  During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds.  On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go.  Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage.  It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.

review/summary: Great value if you like to mix up your tea choice
review/text: I probably drink too much tea, but that makes me well suited to review this collection.  I sampled each of the teas over the past two days, and I don't hesitate to recommend the collection to anyone who likes Lipton tea.  I have Chinese and Japanese teas as well, both bags and looseleaf, and Lipton is definitely a whole different type of tea; for that reason, I recommend flavored Lipton tea over my usually preferred flavorless tea.  The variety in this package is wonderful!  Ratings of each type:<br /><br />Pure Green: 3 out of 5.  A decent green tea, certainly drinkable, but nobody will confuse it with the good stuff.  A little too strongly flavored and bitter for my liking.<br /><br />Orange Passion Fruit and Jasmine: 4 out of 5.  I was worried this tea would be too sweet and the flavors would just blend together, but that isn't so.  The tea is sweet, but less so than adding honey to a cup of tea.  The orange flavor comes through with the first sip while the passionfruit and jasmine, are predictably evident in the aftertaste.  Overall, a good afternoon tea when you can savor the flavor.<br /><br />Lemon Ginseng: 5 out of 5.  This tea is terrific!  The lemon tastes real (which it should, given that lemon grass is one of the ingredients) and the ginseng also has the telltale taste and tickle at the back of your throat.  This tea is my favorite in the box.<br /><br />Honey: 4 of 5.  While honey isn't listed as an ingredient, the taste of the tea comes from the chicory, licorice, and orange, which gives a very complex and "deep" tasting tea.  It's one of my favorite teas to drink in the morning when I'm slurping it down and want to be conscious of the flavor in every sip.<br /><br />Mint: 5 out of 5.  My second favorite tea in the collection, the mint includes both spearmint and peppermint as well as lemon grass, it's very pleasant to smell and I think I'll be saving most of these bags for when I feel sick.  Overall a surprisingly good mint green tea (no offense Lipton).<br /><br />Mixed Berry: 2 out of 5.  This tea is what I was afraid the Orange Passionfruit tea would be...that is to say, too sweet.  In good news, it has a ton of antioxidants.  The smell is almost cloying in sweetness, the taste is not as bad, but definitely my least favorite tea.  However, that's a matter of taste; if you like sweet/berry green tea, then this might be right up your alley.<br /><br />You may wonder why I'm giving a 5 star review when I didn't like all the flavors, but that's because the variety and value are definitely worth 5 stars.  Be aware if quantity is your main concern, this variety pack comes in boxes of 18, three of each flavor, rather than the usual box of 20.  I think it is still a great value, and I subscribed to this without hesitation.

review/summary: Great flavors, though somewhat weak
review/text: Great teas with great flavors. I thought the bags were a little weak flavor wise, even after leaving the bag in the hot water for an additional 5 minutes, so I just started using less water. They were all great flavors except for the honey one. I'm sure this is a preference thing, but I ended up tossing or giving away the extra honey ones, because the flavor was very off. It didn't taste like honey at all, and I wasn't sure what it tasted like. Overall, great variety pack, completely recommend it if you're someone who's starting out with teas and would like to explore some flavors (like I did!).

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: I was a bit skeptical given Lipton's reputation for bastardizing and oversweetening some of its products, but its flavored "green tea" variety pack was a welcome surprise, especially given the 30% off incentive. Surprisingly, my least favorite blend was Orange Passion Fruit and Jasmine, but most flavors were solid. The fact that each box has a mix of flavors was superior to them being separate, IMO. I don't get quite the metabolic or healthful benefits I do from straight green tea, but this was a very nice change in the interim.

review/text: I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031612737X">The Blood Sugar Solution: The UltraHealthy Program for Losing Weight, Preventing Disease, and Feeling Great Now!</a>. In this book there is a recipe for Honey Almond Butter Spread that has raw almond butter as an ingredient. You mix the almond butter with honey and cardamom and use it as a dip for apples. It is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. So that is the reason I bought this almond butter and I love that it is all natural and creamy. I was worried that an almond butter would be rancid but this tasted really fresh and it has no preservative or any added anything. It is made out of raw almonds, that is it. Enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

If you're looking for a nut butter with unroasted nuts (better for you) and great taste, this is definitely one I'd recommend.<br /><br />Besides eating it by the spoonful, I suggest spreading it on apples, making a almond butter and banana sandwich (use sprouted grain bead) or mixing a spoonful into your hot oatmeal.  These are all great options for a NUTritious, high protein meal or snack that will keep you satisfied for hours.

review/summary: Vegetable oil?
review/text: I'm surprised at the good reviews... maybe there are quality control problems.... I purchased some this week and I find it bear very little resemblance to Almond butter. When I opened the jar I smelled oil, vegetable oil, not almonds or any kind of nut. There was a very large amount of oil on the top (more than I have ever seen on Almond butter), stirring it was a lot more work than mixing Laura Scudder's Natural, I had to parcel it out into smaller containers and mix in stages. Once mixed it does not taste like Almond butter, it is still predominately oily. The ingredients do not acknowledge other added oils, but I would be willing to bet on it...<br />I'd advise, try other brands, Trader Joe's for one, tastes and spreads like Almond butter.<br /><br />it only got one star because I can't give less...

But I actually save $8.00 buying it on Amazon (as opposed to my local market.)  I use it successfully in many recipes, too; as well as dipping my spoon and eating raw from the jar...YUM.  It's creamy and you don't even have to stir (or minimal stirring at most.)  Just pure deliciousness.

I highly recommend giving this a try if your looking for all natural organic almond butter! It is expensive but well worth it!

review/summary: Best of hundreds!
review/text: The Trinidad Hot Habanero Sauce is literally the best of hundreds that I have tried (including local products in the Caribbean; just wish I could find "Bob's" again). Actually, the best was "Vib's Caribbean Heat" that was sold in the St. Louis area years ago but who's owner and recipe has apparently been lost forever. If you prefer the habanero or scotch bonnet pepper, in a vinegar base, then this is the best that is out there. A little shop in St. Charles, Missouri (Figueros)has hundreds of different sauces and thousands of bottles and I have tried many over the years. Trinidad's has the perfect combination of flavor and heat (I'm not a fan of heat-for-heat's-sake, but I don't like a wimpy hot sauce either). Many "flavorful" caribbean hot sauces are too strong on the papaya or mango; this is not. The only comparable sauces are Melinda's Scotch Bonnet or Melinda's XXXtra Reserve and Dave's Scotch Bonnet Pepper Sauce (all also very good). I wish Amazon had the gallon available; but regardless, try this and you will not be disappointed.

They are great treats, I just wish they make them a lot harder for my puppy to get it off. Perhaps make them out of a much tougher material?

review/summary: GNAWHIDE FOR BRISTLE BONE
review/text: My only complaint is that the refills are too expensive.  My puppy loves this rawhide and putting it in the bristle bone prevents her from snarfing it down too fast.  The two small discs don't seem to upset her stomach and I am not worried about big chunks of rawhide being ingested, as can happen with rawhide bones.  Once a day I can depend on having about 10-15 minuets of free time when I give my puppy this rawhide toy.  I would love to be able to give it to her more often but the cost, and the fact that I don't want her to ingest too much rawhide, prohibits me from doing so.  Tragically, she is learning to extract the rawhide much more quickly, but it still keeps her satisfied longer than most toys.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0RRTQ">Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Refill Ring Dog Treats for Bristle and/or Bouncy Bones, Rawhide, Medium</a>
