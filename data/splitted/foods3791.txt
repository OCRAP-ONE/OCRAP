review/text: Two weeks after placing my order for a box of Ugly Mug Saving Grace I hadn't received my order or notification of shipping. I contacted the company and it turns out my order was missed due to an Amazon glitch (seller has had issues receiving notification of Amazon orders). The company president contacted me with an apology and immediately shipped my box along with a free one for my trouble. Haven't tried the Saving Grace but the Butter Moon is very good -- smooth and caramel-y. The compostable/bio-degradable nature of the pods is a nice bonus.

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: At slightly over ten dollars, I was very impressed by the quality of this tea.<br />It's kind of hard to describe the exact taste. It sits somewhere between a green and a black tea (but not like oolong). It is crisp and clean just like green tea, but warmer. It is layered, well composed, like black tea, but lighter.<br /><br />When I took the pyramid out and first made it, I noticed the absence of any remarkable smell, which is usually an indicator of a good tea. I was a little alarmed. But once I took the first sip, I was captivated by the liveliness of this tea. This is for sure a very elegant tea.<br /><br />I would suggest try it first without milk or sugar.

review/summary: Wow, amazing!
review/text: Wow, this is amazing tea!!!<br />Ok, frankly speaking, I gave this a try just because this had a very good price during friday sale. I like every tea but I am not a big tea drinker. I'd rather a heavy coffee drinker... But wait, this is so much good!! I have drunk many black teas but they did not change me to a tea drinker. I usually got tea gifts and I don't buy it for me. But it's different this time. I can see the difference!<br />If you're a tea lover, you probably will see the difference easily. The taste of this tea is so much amazing! This tea has a very slight color, with a very mild taste. The flowery flavor(this is not flavored tea! The flavor is natural!)is very fresh and delightful. There's no tough tannin aftertaste that always makes me hesitate to drink black tea. I feel as if I am drinking high quality chinese green tea. This is so fresh taste!<br />I couldve never tried this tea if there had been no friday sale. Thank you to amazon. I love this tea. I will try Dilmah's other single estate tea series, too.

review/summary: California Yummies
review/text: Texas drought has made our local fresh fruit scarce this season so I've resorted to more canned fruits. These were on sale for fifteen-ish. Nice and just right, neither mushy or too firm, too sweet or too bland, you know how some canned fruits can be. Not as good as fresh but pretty good California fruit. The Libby's serving size is also just enough to leave you satisfied with one serving. Easily portable for on the go lunches and snacks and worth it to me.<br /><br />I have some interesting experiences with some imported peaches that were grainy and gritty like pears - yuckiest peaches EVER. I thought I had opened the wrong can of fruit; being so discernible as peaches by texture OR taste. They were from the right can though.

review/text: Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

review/text: I have tried several fat-free salad dressings that come in individual packets, and I find Ken's FF Honey Dijon Mustard to be my favorite as it is very tasty, with just enough of a zip to it to give it good flavor. It pours easily from the packet and is not too thin or too thick. It only has 40 calories per packet and contains ingredients I can pronounce and recognize. I use it on all my salads and/or baked potatoes at home or when eating out, and I love the convenience of being able to throw a packet of it into my purse to carry with me. The packets do not need refrigerated, which makes it easy to take with me everywhere - no fuss about having to pack it in an insulated or frozen ice bag.

review/summary: Dairy-Free Delicious!
review/text: If you are on a dairy-free diet, this quick pesto sauce is for you!  Just add the olive oil & water.  My gluten-free, dairy-free son loves this sauce on rice penne pasta.  It has a bit of a strong taste, so you can adjust the amount you use -- I personally use 1 envelope per box/bag of pasta (ignoring the instructions to use only 6 oz. of pasta).  In my local store, 1 envelope can be $2-3, and not always available, so this is a much better deal (12 packets for $15.51 plus super saver shipping) for a product we use weekly.  If you like the Knorr brand (contains dairy), you will probably like this.  However, if you are picky about your pesto (use only jarred/fresh, make-your-own) this may disappoint, you should buy just 1 packet to try from your local store before you purchase a bulk item, but it pleases my family.<br /><br />** If you have corn allergy/intolerance, this product is not for you.  One of the ingredients is derived from corn.

review/text: This is a very tasty pesto sauce that is very simple to make. We usually follow the simple directions and perhaps add some grated nuts of our choice for texture. Then toss in the pasta. It's handy to have it around the kitchen in dry form. My wife loves the fact that it's organic. I love the fact that it is not overly garlicky. Sometimes when we are out of olive oil, it still tastes great with regular vegetable oil, as well. Definitely a family pleaser in our household.

review/summary: Delicious, and MSG free!
review/text: I bought this pesto mix after another Amazon reviewer suggested it to me.  He commented on a review I posted complaining about another pesto sauce that was full of artificial ingredients and MSG.  I took a chance on buying this 12-pack, and I'm really happy I did.<br /><br />The ingredients are:  Organic Basil, Organic Potato Starch (thickener), Organic Maltodextrin (a thickener), Sea Salt, Organic Garlic, Citric Acid, Organic Black Pepper, Silicon Dioxide (makes product free flowing).<br /><br />I fixed some the day I got my order, and everyone raved about the fresh basil flavor of it.  It's not overly salty like so many products, and you can see actual pieces of basil in it. It has a slightly mint undertone, but it compliments the basil.  It is definitely something I'll buy again.<br /><br />I got my order shipped free with Supersaver Shipping (on orders over $25), and I plan to use Subscribe and Save to save an additional 15% next time.

review/summary: Healthy but boring after one bowl.
review/text: I prefer healthy granola/cereal for my breakfast, which is why I went with a bag of Bear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch.  While it tastes alright, it gets bland and boring really fast.  Luckily there's a decent amount of vanilla flavor, but it needs something else.<br /><br />The granola is mainly just whole oats, which is difficult to chew and takes awhile.  The mouth-feel isn't nearly as appealing as other granola on the market.  It doesn't really get soggy in milk, either.<br /><br />The almonds in this granola are whole, but few and far between.  While normally I like whole almonds in granola, this granola type would be much better with lots of almond slivers instead.  I think that would greatly enhance this granola.<br /><br />The flavor is mainly oats and vanilla, and both are mild.  That's why I got tired of it quickly.  I ended up mixing it into other granola to use it up.<br /><br />This is a healthy granola, with a very low sugar content, which is nice.  However, it doesn't taste good enough for me to keep buying more of.  I like other Bear Naked granola, but this one is low on my list.

This definitely tastes different, but it's great in its own way, and I think much more economical, especially when I'm making a lot of iced tea in the summer.  I think the makers assume that you'll have a nice permanent container to put this in; I would never just leave it in the original box once it's open.  Even in a cheap plastic container, it held its flavor very nicely.

I combine a tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar, a tablespoon of lemon juice, several squirts of Hibiscus Tea extract, and a few drops of liquid stevia.  This seems to act as an appetite suppressant between meals and wards off hunger.  And I can feel good about having a flavored drink while avoiding sodas or other artificially flavored drinks.<br /><br />I can also think of ways to put it into smoothies or protein powder drinks.

review/summary: Misleading Product
review/text: I ordered this basket for my brother-in-law who was recovering from a recent heart attack.  I did a lot of research on "heart healthy" baskets and chose this one b/c it sounded like what I was looking for. When it was received, they found that most of the products were loaded with sodium.  There was a bottle of V8 juice that had 700 mg of sodium.  The doctors recommend no more than 1500 mg of sodium per day - so this one bottle of juice is 1/2 your days allowance! I received a notice from Amazon to rate the product.  I rated it poor, then got a request to please contact the seller before completing the rating, to see if they could resolve the issue.  So...I emailed the seller and said that I was disappointed in the basket, and that it was certainly NOT heart healthy and asked if they have anything else that actually was.  I asked if they could send something else and that they should not be advertising as "heart healthy" when it is not.  They returned my email saying that they didn't accept returned product. (I never said I wanted to return the basket).  They also said that the description of the basket never said that it was low in sodium and that they have to put products in that have sodium b/c the low fat ones don't have as much flavor.  Oh brother!!!! Heart Healthy products are supposed to be low in sodium!  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that!  Geeze.  They said there was nothing they would do for me and were sorry for the misunderstanding.  This is a poorly run company. Terrible customer service. Misleading product and I would never order from them again.

review/summary: Love the taste AND the concept!
review/text: I discovered this coffee while on vacation; it is served at Two Cats Restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine.  I really enjoyed the flavor and smoothness of that first cup with my breakfast. The second cup seemed even more flavorful, robust without an acidic aftertaste.  When I got home, I ordered some online.  I have it daily now: fresh ground, hot, and black.  Finally, a dark roasted coffee with a smooth flavor that satisfies. And I like the fact that it is a product that is not only organic but also gurantees the growers a fair price. Over the years I've paid quite a bit more for premium coffee beans.  I consider this coffee to be moderately priced, which makes it a tremendous value.

I'd found a small organic mercantile near my house and purchased it there for a long time. Then I moved away and the only place I could find it was that store, but now it's an hour to drive there. I searched the closer stores and could not find it. Finally it occurred to me that Amazon has EVERYTHING and of course there it was. So much nice to order this and have it show up at my door. It's cheaper here too. Thanks Amazon !

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: Last year, I purchased a Keurig machine.  K-cups are extremely convenient and cleanup is so easy.  So many varieties of coffee to choose from and they are generally pretty good.  I've tried a number of K-cups since last year and reviewed a few here.  Fast forward to almost a year later.  My Keurig machine started to act up and I called customer service.  It started short cupping me and would automatically shut off.  It's hit or miss for when I brew a cup of coffee now.  Customer service had me try a number of things and finally decided to replace my Keurig machine.  I am waiting for the new one to arrive.  (I'm getting to the Starbucks review...wait for it.)  I decided to go buy a back of beans, as I had always done previous to purchasing a Keurig.  Also, I purchased a $14 Mr Coffee 5-cup drip coffeemaker.<br /><br />I ground up the beans, put it into my newly cleaned new coffeemaker, and made some Starbucks.  It smelled fantastic.  I remembered that smell.  Nothing like fresh brewed coffee smell.  I started to drink a cup.  It was good solid cup of Starbucks coffee(which is a bit strong anyway I think).  It got me thinking.  I decided to do a taste test of K-cup vs Starbucks.  I popped in the best K-cup I had around, a Timothy's Columbian.  I compared the two.  The Starbucks had depth to it.  Multidimensional compared to the K-cup, which I had thought was a great K-cup until now.  The K-cup had only one dimension of taste to it(some nuttiness) and did not fill out with the floral notes like the fresh ground.  The body of the Starbucks coffee was much fuller, too.  I was really amazed at the difference between the two.  I noticed that the Timothy's was smooth, only hit the front part of the tongue with taste, and did not linger long with a finish.  The Starbucks seemed to hit the entire tongue with taste and the finish lasted quite a bit longer.  In other words, with the Starbucks you know you have had a cup of coffee and it satisfied well.<br /><br />Where does this leave me?  I am seriously considering going back to whole beans and grinding them up daily now.  I love the convenience and clean-up of the Keurig but I have been missing out on taste.  There are many excellent beans to try. Here is a list of pros and cons of each...<br /><br />Whole Bean:<br />PRO<br />- Great taste, multidimensional.<br />- Significantly lower cost compared to K-cup(cheapest I can get is 35 cents per cup.  fresh ground is nearly 13 cents)<br />- Huge variety<br />- Can get 100% Kona or Blue Mountain<br />- Low cost coffeemaker can be used.<br />- Coffeemaker has few parts to go wrong and is easy to clean<br />- Small footprint on counter top for a coffeemaker.<br />- Many styles and colors to choose from.<br />- Fresh taste.<br /><br />CON<br />- Takes more time.  (time to clean the coffeemaker, time to grind the beans, time to brew the coffee)<br />- Not a lot of great 4-5 cup coffeemakers out there.<br />- Not as easy to grind up beans for one cup of coffee. I found it takes a lot of tapping out of my small grinder for 2 tbls.<br /><br />K-Cup:<br />PRO<br />-  Fast coffeemaker.<br />-  Extremely convenient when wanting to make just one cup of coffee.<br />-  Huge variety of K-cups available.<br />-  Extremely easy cleanup with just a damp paper towel.<br />-  Coffee isn't stale tasting like already ground coffee you purchase in the store.  Once you open a can of regular ground<br />  coffee, the first brew or two is fine but after that it turns stale very rapidly.  The freshness is due to the nitrogen<br />  gas in each K-cup.  Each one will stay fairly fresh.<br />-  Relatively quiet compared to the Mr Coffee 5-cup coffeemaker I purchased.  It still has some noise but not much.<br />-  K-cup coffee isn't bad at all.<br />-  My K-cup is available.  You can add your own fresh ground beans and make a cup in the Keurig.  That decreases some of<br />  the convenience but many love it.  (101 reviewers out of 500 or so give this a 1 star rating...mostly saying it delivers<br />  a weak cup of coffee.)<br /><br />CON<br />-  Expensive coffeemaker.<br />-  Track record of issues with short cupping and automatic shutoffs.<br />-  Inability to fully empty the coffeemaker.  It concerns me that water is in it all the time and could lead to mold.<br />-  Environmental issues with K-cups.  There's a lot of plastic waste with a K-cup.<br />-  Not as fresh tasting as the fresh ground beans.<br />-  Lacks that smell of fresh brewed coffee in the air.<br />-  One dimensional flavor compared to whole bean fresh brewed.<br />-  Takes up a lot of counter space.  It's a huge honkin' machine.<br />-  Only comes in black unless you get the mini(which the no reservoir and has issues with temperature).<br />-  Bold varieties often push coffee grounds back up into the 3 holes from the pump. Hit or miss with this one.<br />  Bold varieties have about 30% more coffee in each K-Cup and are sometimes really packed.<br />-  Only a few mediocre Kona blends are available in a K-cup.  They don't have 100% Kona or Blue Mountain.  Tully's<br />  isn't too bad.<br /><br />Maybe I have a place for both coffeemakers.  Maybe I will take the Keurig to work and savor fresh beans at home.

The worst off all for me is that is not red, it was a really sad pink! For that quality of color I should have mixed it myself in a white one.

It usually means a trip to the bulk bins at the local health food stores and then I'm not always satisfied with the price or the quality.  It's most likely overpriced and the seed is old, stale or rancid.<br /><br />I have discovered that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3Q4">Frontier Organic Caraway Seed, Whole, 1.96-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a> is not only a great organic caraway seed but a great value here at Amazon as well.  The 1.96-ounce jars are just about the perfect size for me.  I can use up a jar quickly and don't have to worry about the product's freshness.  The flavor is vibrant and I delight in it.<br /><br />If you enjoy fresh organic caraway seed as much as I do, you will enjoy this one.

review/text: I have never had such delicious bean soup. I wish I had known about Bob's Red Mill's bean soup seasoning years ago, I would have had many more delicious bean meals.<br /><br />The mixture is complex, balanced, and delightful but be aware that the red pepper grows very spicy as the soup ages. I use half-packets now instead of whole packets, but those who love spice will probably want the entire packet.<br /><br />I can imagine other uses for this spice: Texas-style chili (no beans, no tomatoes, only meat and the spice); cornbread; meatloaf; spicy potato soup; spicy corn spoonbread, fried spicy potato patties, breading for fish and chicken, in beef and pork mardinade, in biscuits and other small breads, and for the adventurous, even in chocolate cake!

review/text: This seasoning packet is great for people that dont do a lot of cooking as it makes Red Bob's Bean Soup extremely easy to make. I ordered this more out of curiosity as I already have some great recipes that go perfectly with Red Bob's 13 bean mix. With that being said, I am glad I did order it as it really is great and will be perfect for those days where I am feeling a bit lazy. There is nothing really fancy in here, just some basic ingredients thrown together is perfect quantity. You basically have Chili Powder, Black Pepper, Salt, Garlic, Onions, Basil, Celery Seed, Cumin Seed, Oregano and Savory. It really does make a mean bowl of 13 bean soup and again the seasoning mix makes the 13 bean mix accessible to everyone, even people that dont cook regularly.<br /><br />I have to comment on the price as its really out of whack, something that I am not used to seeing on Amazon. Basically the current price on Amazons site is basically double what one would normally pay for these packets. My advice to people would be to go to Red Bob's website and order it there. I actually just ordered a 12 pack from there last week and again it was basically 50% cheaper than the current price on Amazon. This is one case where Amazon is overcharging in a big way but I wont factor that into my review score. My review score reflects the product itself, not Amazon's pricing.<br /><br />Bottom line - Even if you have a good recipe for Red Bob's 13 bean mix, you should order a seasoning packet and give it a try. It basically gives you the ability to have the 13 bean mix, even on your lazy days. For those that haven't tried Red Bob's 13 bean mix or the seasoning packet, your missing out on one of the tastiest and healthiest packaged soups on the market.

Don't let the "light" fool you; it may be a lighter roast but still full flavored.<br /><br />Amazon sells this for less than my local market, and getting three cans delivered on a regular schedule keeps me from having one of those "Uh-oh, we're out of coffee" moments at home.

review/summary: An Early Review: Biting In A Good Way
review/text: I haven't had the chance to test this salt on a variety of foods:  this review is based on nibbling on little crystals right out of the bag.  I have just bought seven different salts and this salt (at first taste) seems to be the saltiest to me:  it bites my tongue as I bite into it:  I consider this a good thing.  I don't know if this is a mineral thing, a texture thing or even a 'my mind is playing tricks on me' thing.  4.25 Stars.<br /><br />I will update later with a more complete review (if I don't get lazy!).

review/text: I've tried the spaghetti & meatballs (which is really darned good), the hawaiin nuggets (which I'd rather not have to try again), and the vegetarian steak...  The Vegetarian steak is definitely edible, to the point where I'd be ok with eating it again.<br /><br />The "steak" bits are quite tasty, have a good texture, and quite plentiful.  The biggest issue with the veggie steak is the texture of the vegetables: on the box, it shows all sorts of nice yummy crisp looking veggies...  whereas it turns out its really just a gelatneous goo.  It's pretty yucky looking, but it tastes decent.<br /><br />Definitely good for camping, or if you need to eat kosher on a business trip.

review/summary: An unappealing hot sauce
review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I find to be unappealing.  Awhile back, I had tried this hot sauce, but I could not remember what I had thought about it.  So recently, I decided to get another bottle of it in order to give it another try.  When I tried it, my impression was that it was strong and sharp, yet it did not have a pleasant taste.  Also, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider this to be a problem--it is not overpoweringly hot.  I am glad that I gave this hot sauce another shot, but it just is not my thing.

We ordered six bottles of it, because the dressing was no longer available at the store.  They sent us a new product which is basically their Sesame Dressing.  It tastes nothing like the Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing. It appears they are marketing their Sesame Dressing as their Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing.  I know its confusing, but the bottom line is this: if you want Cha Cha Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing DONT BUY THIS...its sesame oil with sesame seeds mixed in. Period.

review/summary: Not usual Harney quality, weak taste
review/text: I was surprised that the product came in a recycled (or apparently) cardboard box of low quality. The individual packets of tea were also in flimsy wrapping (compared to the usual sturdy, flavor-holding metallic-lined material). I have been drinking Earl Grey for a while and have also tried several varieties of decaffinated black tea (in other flavors) from other makers. I know that I have had flavorful decaffinated black tea before. That being said, the bergamot in this decaffinated Earl Grey is exceptionally weak. I would not buy this product again and I would even hesitate to purchase Harney & Son's tea anywhere other than from the cafes attached to Barnes and Noble (where it is sold in quality tins).

review/text: This particular malt powder is wonderful.  If you like malted milk drinks, or just like the flavor of malt, this is for you.  Malt is mainly a blend of more complex sugars and doesn't generally cause blood-sugar spikes for diabetics.  While it tastes quite sweet, 1.5 tablespoons of this powder has only 15 calories and 3 gm of sugars.  This particular powder is super-fine and dissolves easily in even cold liquids.  Highly recommended.

This malted milk dissolves easily in a little cold milk with a bit of whisking.  I have enjoyed it in milk, malts and I'll admit, eating it dry right from the spoon, it tastes just the same as those yummy tablets!  I chose this malted milk on Amazon because it is considerably less expensive than Horlick's and I won't look any further!

review/summary: Like Louisiana Better
review/text: I had been buying The Louisiana Fish Fry Cobbler Mix and thought it was heavently. THEN, I saw The Calhoun Bend Mill Peach Cobbler Mix ADVERTIZED as the mix that Georgia uses for its Peach Festival. Since Georgia is the Peach capital of the US (and perhaps the world), I figured this Calhoun Bend Mix was worth a try.<br />And it was. It is just as simple to make as the other mix...just add butter and water. But, to my taste it is not quite as sweet as the Louisiana Mix and I like my Cobbler to be very sweet; hence, I prefer the Louisiana Mix.<br />But between the two, I think, it will just come down to a matter of taste...do you like it extra sweet? Or do you like it "Very Sweet?" For the Extra Sweet, go Louisiana. For the Very Sweet, go Calhoun. Both are a snap to make and get you compliments every time. So, it is just your choice!

review/summary: Hard to find cobbler mix is my family's favorite!
review/text: I have been buying this mix locally for about 10 years, but they were always sporadically available. About 2 years ago the last store in town that was most reliable stopped carrying it altogether.  On occasion I've found the mixes in a country store here and there and I would buy all their stock. Lately I haven't reliably found it in any stores anywhere.<br /><br />Finally gave up on the stores in the area having this mix and checked online.  The company's website wants some ungodly amount with a ridiculous shipping price. Luckily it was available on Amazon for around $2 per bag of mix, which is about what we were paying in the stores locally.<br /><br />The family has made a variety of home-made cobblers and clafoutis, but we always preferred this one. We use canned fruit or fresh. If you follow the directions on the package you get a perfectly molten and crispy blend of fruit and cobbler. For fresh fruit you get great results by making a simple syrup to soak the produce in(and if you prepare it according to cooking orthodoxy it makes it that much better).<br /><br />The 12 pack is great, but we must have gotten the last one since they are currently not available. Will definitely be ordering more if they are restocked at a comparable price.

review/summary: Delicious citrus-tangy, and packs just a little heat.
review/text: Herdez's Salsa Verde tastes wonderful -- a perfect balance of fresh tangy-citrusy flavor with just a bit of fire from Serrano peppers. 'Medium' hot is a good description -- it warms up slowly, and gets just to the point of being noticeable but not uncomfortable. People who are heat-freaks will consider this salsa mild!!!<br /><br />Many salsa verdes sold in my local (New York, NY) markets are Amero-Mexican, with 'extra' ingredients that I do not want in my food. I decided to try Amazon's Herdez when I saw that the ingredients matched recipes in my Mexican cookbooks: tomatillos, onions, Serrano peppers, iodized salt and cilantro. Exactly what I wanted. There are seeds in it -- as there would be if you roasted and ground your own tomatillos and peppers. Herdez's salsa is imported from Mexico--it's the real thing. The cans are flip top -- one 7 oz. can is perfect to accompany two meals as a main dish sauce.<br /><br />My favorite use is southern fried chicken thighs (dusted with flour before frying in olive oil), rice and pozole (hominy). Not classically Mexican, but delicious. My other salsa verde favorite is chicken tamales. I add the salsa in the last few minutes to just heat it up, or heat it separately and pour over the food. I intend to cook something in the sauce to see if/how it changes with long cooking -- but I haven't done that yet. Enjoy!!

A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping.

Nothing serious, but it does suggest that no one actually picked out the selection; they just scooped them out of a bin without regard for the selection.

review/summary: Limited variety
review/text: I was looking forward to trying the different varieties and ordered the 22 pack. Unfortunately it only contained 6 different types of teas.  I was disappointed in the purchase.

review/summary: Lame
review/text: I understand that the description says "Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice" so I can't be too mad, but its a bit ridiculous when you buy a 22-pack tea "sampler" and you only get 7 differnt types of tea. I received 5 Green Tea, 5 Sleepytime Herbal Tea, 4 English Breakfast Black Tea...you get the picture. Definitely go with a different sampler.

review/summary: TERRIBLE
review/text: I was very unhappy with the selection. All 22 k cups were Celestial Seasonings. 7 of them were mandarin orange. 5 were sleepytime. 4 were lemon zinger. 1 india spice. 4 breakfast blend. 1 green tea. So really, I only got 6 flavors. The cups were covered in in what looks like burned tea leaves or dirt. If you want variety, go with a different sampler pack.

review/summary: Good, but not the best
review/text: This salsa is pretty good.  I like the variety, but I want to have somthing that makes it seem like I'm at a great restaurant at home.<br /><br />The best I've tried is Border Town Salsa. [&#8230;]<br /><br />That is real salsa that tastes like it comes from your favorite restaurant.<br /><br />Try some of that if you want something to impress your friends and family.

review/summary: Lives up to the name
review/text: I bought this for my dad for Christmas since he loves spicy foods and rarely finds anything that he actually considers spicy enough. He loves them, and they are definitely spicy enough, but not too much for him. I personally cannot handle spicy stuff too well, and one little drop of this sauce had me searching for some water, haha. Definitely recommend for someone who enjoys heat in their food.

review/summary: Can I Get This in Gallon Jugs?
review/text: Put this product on subscribe and save.  If I'm willing to pay $45 a month for coffee, I am certainly willing to pay the same for this vinegar.<br /><br />This vinegar is incredible - I could drink the entire bottle while I'm sitting here.  It is thick and rich and sweet and tangy.  I can see how people would pour it on ice cream, make martinis with it, and dip strawberries into it.<br /><br />Knowing how good it is makes me want to try the 15 and 30 year old versions.  Life is too short to not experience the best.

review/summary: Not an English Breakfast but still good
review/text: Although it isn't like any typical English breakfast tea from England it is still good. I was expecting a black tea but this is more like a light oolong and a little smokey.  It certainly isnt green as the description claims ( noticed that after I purchased). Also I weighed the packets and they are only 2.5 grams instead of the 3 grams as advertised. Also the tea is pure dust.
